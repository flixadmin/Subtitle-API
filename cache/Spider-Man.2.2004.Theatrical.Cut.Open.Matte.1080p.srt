1
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,349
<i>She looks at me every day.</i>

2
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,310
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

3
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:08,522
<i>Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.</i>

4
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,483
<i>But she can never know.</i>

5
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,070
<i>I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.</i>

6
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,572
<i>A life she can never be a part of.</i>

7
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,032
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,785
<i>I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.</i>

9
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,954
<i>And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.</i>

10
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,706
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,084
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,213
Parker, you're late, man.
Always late, huh?

13
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,299
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,760
Disturbance. Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,721
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,308
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,520
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,606
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas,

19
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,442
but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,029
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,950
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,160
This is your last chance.

23
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:08,082
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,669
Go!

25
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,484
Hey, what, are you stupid?

26
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,381
Woo-hoo! Whoo!

27
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,634
Whoa! He stole
that guy's pizzas!

28
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,936
I'm gonna get it!

29
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,535
Hmm.

30
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,871
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

31
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,414
- Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.
- Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

32
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,291
See you.

33
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,710
Way to go, Spidey!

34
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,515
Pizza time.

35
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,854
You're late.

36
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,107
I'm not paying for those.

37
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,087
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

38
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,883
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

39
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,052
It's serious to me too,
Mr. Aziz.

40
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,638
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

41
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,474
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

42
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,901
<i>You're fired.</i>

43
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,321
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

44
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,947
Dogs catching
Frisbees?

45
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,408
Pigeons in the park?
A couple of geezers playing chess?

46
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,826
- Boss.
- Not now.

47
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,704
I was thinking maybe the <i>Bugle</i> could show
another side of New York for a change.

48
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,832
We got six minutes to deadline,
Jonah. We need page one.

49
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,377
Parker, I don't pay you to be a sensitive
artiste. I pay you because- Still not now!

50
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,172
I pay you because, for some reason, that
psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.

51
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,195
Spider-Man won't let me
take any more pictures.

52
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:46,842
You've turned the
whole city against him.

53
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,510
A fact I'm very proud of.

54
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,431
Now, get your pretty little portfolio off
my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

55
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,600
Boss, your wife's on the line,
she says she lost her checkbook.

56
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,976
Thanks for the good news.

57
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,837
Mr. Jameson, please,
isn't there any of these

58
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,480
shots you can use? I
really need the money.

59
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,482
Awww. Miss Brant.

60
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,983
- Yes?
- Get me a violin.

61
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,526
Five minutes to deadline,
Jonah.

62
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,363
All right, run a picture of a rancid
chicken. Here's the headline:

63
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,406
"Food Poisoning Scare
Sweeps City."

64
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,950
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous, yeah.

65
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,994
All right, Mr. Jameson.

66
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,873
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

67
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,666
"Masked Menace
Terrorizes Town."

68
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,293
I told you, he's not a menace.

69
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,212
- And I told you
- I'll take care of it.

70
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,963
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

71
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,632
That's outrageous.

72
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,759
Done. Give this to the girl.

73
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,219
Thank you. Bye-bye.

74
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,096
Hi.

75
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,764
Hey, Pete.

76
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,600
Oh.

77
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,978
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

78
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,898
- Oh, right.
- Sorry.

79
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,359
Hey.

80
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,403
Chin up, okay?

81
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,000
Watch it, jerk!

82
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,594
Oh, hey. Wow.

83
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,555
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

84
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,306
Where were you headed,
Parker?

85
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,766
To your class.

86
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,768
My class is over.

87
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,146
See me standing here?

88
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,108
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

89
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,609
Then be here.

90
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,446
Look at you, Peter.

91
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:35,325
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

92
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,412
You always appear
exhausted.

93
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,915
Your paper on fusion
is still overdue.

94
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,210
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

95
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,547
Planning is not a major
at this university.

96
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,886
Octavius is a friend of mine.

97
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,221
Better do your research, Parker.

98
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,725
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

99
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,290
Surprise!

100
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,375
Well, say
something.

101
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,835
Uh, what's the occasion?

102
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,546
- Really, Peter. It's your birthday!
- "What's the occasion"?

103
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,757
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

104
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,553
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

105
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,680
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

106
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,516
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

107
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,934
Long time, no see.

108
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,979
So, uh, how's the play?
I read a great review.

109
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,856
It's going fine.
It's going good.

110
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,274
She's brilliant in it.

111
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,109
Harry sent me roses.

112
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,862
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

113
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,199
I've been busy.

114
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,911
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

115
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,038
The less you see of that man,
the better.

116
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,708
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

117
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,210
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

118
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,420
So how are things going at Oscorp?

119
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,465
Oh, they're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

120
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,759
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

121
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,138
Oh, how lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

122
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,640
Thank you.

123
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,727
We're actually funding one of
your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

124
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,397
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

125
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:29,815
You'd introduce me?

126
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:33,193
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map

127
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,445
in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

128
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,489
M.J., could you give
me a hand?

129
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,451
She's waiting for you, pal.

130
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,412
What do you mean?

131
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,039
Oh, the way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

132
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,916
However you want to
look at it.

133
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,460
I don't have time for girls
right now.

134
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,962
Why, are you dead?

135
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,630
I've been kind of busy.

136
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,507
Taking pictures of your friend?

137
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,510
Could we get off
that subject?

138
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,014
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

139
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,807
Then be honest with me.

140
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,560
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

141
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,793
May.

142
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,713
Oh, what, Ben? Hmm?

143
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,798
Wait. Oh--

144
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,467
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

145
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:44,097
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

146
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,226
Everybody's gone,
aren't they?

147
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,312
Did they have a good time?

148
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,105
I'm sure they did.

149
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,778
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

150
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:03,533
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

151
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,452
I'm worried about you.

152
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,791
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

153
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,502
Oh, my. You did?

154
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,337
Oh, Well.

155
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,963
So?

156
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,174
I'm a little behind.

157
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,885
Everybody is.

158
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,555
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

159
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,476
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

160
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,730
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

161
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,732
You need it more than I do.

162
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,443
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

163
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,654
You can take this money
from me.

164
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,532
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

165
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,201
And don't you dare
leave it here.

166
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,619
Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,666
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

168
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,048
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

169
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,594
I think to myself at times,

170
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:10,058
were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

171
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,145
Oh, I don't know
what I'd do.

172
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,278
Now,

173
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,907
you better take
the rest of your cake home.

174
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,174
Hey.

175
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,509
Hey. You're still here.

176
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,262
I saw your billboard
on Bleecker.

177
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,724
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

178
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,978
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

179
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,025
I liked seeing you
tonight, Peter.

180
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,029
Oh, boy, yeah.

181
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,616
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

182
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,789
Nothing.

183
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,961
Do you want to say
something?

184
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,594
I...

185
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,810
was...

186
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,064
wondering if you're still
in the Village.

187
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,242
You're such a mystery.

188
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,295
Peter.

189
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,215
What?

190
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,930
Happy birthday.

191
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,774
I'm seeing
somebody now.

192
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,777
You mean, like a boyfriend?

193
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,613
Well, like I like him.

194
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,159
- Wow.
- What?

195
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,537
Nothing.

196
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,666
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

197
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,044
May be more than that.

198
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,714
More?

199
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,883
I don't know.

200
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,428
I'm gonna come see your play
tomorrow night.

201
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,434
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

202
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,103
Don't disappoint me.

203
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,231
I won't.

204
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,914
Rent.

205
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,420
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

206
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,589
- Can I spend it?
- Uh...

207
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,758
I have a paycheck due
this week and--

208
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,261
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as I--

209
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,932
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

210
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,723
I'm really sorry,
Mr. Ditkovitch. You know,

211
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:42,062
all I got is this 2O for
the rest of the week.

212
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,272
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

213
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:49,277
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

214
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,822
Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.

215
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,866
Hi, Pete. OW! Oh!

216
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,288
Hello?

217
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,339
Rent?

218
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,847
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

219
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:02,892
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

220
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,853
It's not about the prizes,
Harry.

221
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,813
Ah, but you need money.
You need Oscorp.

222
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,273
Who do we have here?

223
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,191
This is my good friend
I called you about.

224
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,068
The guy who got me through
high school science.

225
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,820
- Peter Parker, sir.
- Parker.

226
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,905
- I'm writing a paper on you for--
- Yes, yes.

227
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,572
I know what you're
doing here, but I really

228
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,200
don't have time to talk
to students right now.

229
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,287
But Oscorp pays the bills,
so...

230
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,539
That's right. That's why
I have to take off. Board meeting.

231
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:28,043
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

232
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:32,839
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

233
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,093
Interesting fellow,
your friend.

234
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,345
- Well, I won't take much of your time.
- Parker.

235
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,892
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

236
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,770
He also tells me you're lazy.

237
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,022
I'm trying to do better.

238
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,776
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

239
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,279
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

240
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,573
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

241
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,241
You want to try it back there?

242
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,619
So is that it?

243
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:07,207
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

244
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,502
I understand you use
harmonics of atomic frequencies.

245
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,045
Sympathetic frequencies.

246
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,255
Harmonic reinforcement?

247
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,299
Go on.

248
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,428
An exponential increase
in energy output.

249
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,263
A huge amount
of energy.

250
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,601
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

251
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,728
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

252
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,483
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

253
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,985
This is my life's work.

254
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,489
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

255
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,950
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

256
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:45,453
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

257
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,455
You can sleep soundly
tonight.

258
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,374
Otto's done his homework.

259
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,627
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

260
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,296
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

261
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,674
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

262
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,468
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

263
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,762
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the <i>5th?</i>

264
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,224
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

265
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,893
Ah, Rosie, I love this boy.

266
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,522
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

267
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,483
Uh, Well...

268
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,986
I don't really know.

269
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,239
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

270
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,450
Well, leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

271
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,494
Love should never be
a secret.

272
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,956
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside,

273
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,333
gonna make you sick.

274
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,752
I finally got lucky in love.

275
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,254
We both did.

276
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,133
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

277
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,012
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

278
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,432
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

279
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,768
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

280
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,438
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

281
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,566
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

282
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,610
- Oh, come on. Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

283
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,779
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

284
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:06,284
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

285
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,952
Poetry.

286
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,622
Never fails.

287
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,129
<i>A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie</i>

288
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,673
<i>Brightest green
Were all her garments</i>

289
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,218
<i>And her hair was like the sunshine</i>

290
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,136
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

291
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,113
Rent!

292
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,741
Where is my money?!

293
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,686
- You seem jittery tonight.
- Oh.

294
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,646
You never know who's coming.

295
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:16,956
Ladies, five minutes.
Five minutes.

296
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,475
How'd you do that?

297
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,102
Uh...

298
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,772
Work out, plenty of rest.

299
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,857
You know, eat your
green vegetables.

300
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,320
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

301
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,491
Come on. Go.

302
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,828
Keep it steady.

303
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,852
It's a web.

304
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,605
Go, Spidey, go!

305
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,403
Whoo!

306
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,948
We got trouble!

307
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,552
Get me down!

308
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,097
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

309
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,559
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

310
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,853
Then you think we should
forgive them?

311
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,399
Yes.

312
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,401
I mean, no.

313
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:16,951
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

314
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,953
Whatever.

315
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,166
Shoelace.

316
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,297
You might want to...

317
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:38,848
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I, uh, come to see the show.

318
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,810
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

319
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,355
It helps maintain the illusion.

320
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,152
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

321
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,820
But not to come late.

322
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,783
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the--

323
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,410
Shh.

324
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,624
Hmm.

325
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,550
<i>A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man</i>

326
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,720
<i>A-does whatever a spider can</i>

327
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,890
<i>A-spins a web, any size</i>

328
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,434
<i>Catches thieves a-just like flies</i>

329
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,854
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

330
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,248
Hey. You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

331
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,791
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Yeah?

332
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,876
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

333
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,753
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

334
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,841
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

335
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,469
What are you doing here?

336
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:14,819
You hungry?

337
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,320
Starved.

338
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,789
What was that?

339
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,004
Okay.

340
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,063
Huh.

341
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,128
Cool Spidey outfit.

342
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,674
Thanks.

343
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,510
Where'd you get it?

344
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,137
I made it.

345
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,391
Hmm.

346
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,685
Looks uncomfortable.

347
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,188
Yeah, it gets
kind of itchy.

348
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,486
And it rides up in the
crotch a little bit too.

349
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,789
<i>- Hi. It's me.
- Sing your song at the beep.</i>

350
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,709
Hi, M.J.

351
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,169
This is Peter.

352
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,756
<i>I was on my way
to your show</i> and...

353
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,302
<i>Well, I was on my bike...</i>

354
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,928
<i>Uh...</i>

355
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,056
<i>Are you there?</i>

356
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,562
I really was planning on it all clay.

357
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,398
And...

358
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,110
I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

359
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,112
Bingo.

360
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,782
<i>It's amazing, isn't it?</i>

361
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:51,577
<i>How complicated a simple thing</i>

362
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:56,874
<i>like being someplace at 8:00
can become.</i>

363
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,752
<i>Huh.</i>

364
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,632
<i>Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.</i>

365
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,427
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

366
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,137
<i>Your time has expired.</i>

367
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:14,517
<i>Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.</i>

368
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:26,320
I wanna tell you the truth.

369
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,907
Here it is.

370
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,576
I'm Spider-Man.

371
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,120
Weird, huh?

372
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,291
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

373
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:45,089
If my enemies found out
about you,

374
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,178
if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

375
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,020
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

376
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,825
Ladies and gentlemen,

377
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,829
my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

378
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,664
But first, before we start,

379
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:23,210
has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

380
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,212
Because we found
the rubber band.

381
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,218
It's a terrible joke.

382
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,137
But thank you
for coming.

383
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,722
Today,

384
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:39,393
you will witness the birth of a
new fusion-based energy source.

385
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:44,899
Safe, renewable energy and
cheap electricity for everyone.

386
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,528
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

387
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,122
These four actuators were
developed and programmed

388
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,751
for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

389
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,462
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

390
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:55,928
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

391
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,390
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum,

392
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:03,644
allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction

393
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,563
in an environment
no human hand could enter.

394
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,274
Doctor, if the artificial
intelligence in the arms

395
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,151
is as advanced
as you suggest,

396
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,445
uh, couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

397
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,863
How right you are.

398
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,199
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip

399
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,660
to protect
my higher brain function.

400
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:24,289
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

401
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,917
And now on to the main event.

402
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,003
Give me the blue light,
Rosie.

403
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,443
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

404
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,738
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

405
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:00,576
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

406
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,661
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

407
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,010
Ladies and gentlemen,

408
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,389
fasten your seat belts.

409
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,744
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

410
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,877
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

411
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,295
Thank you.

412
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:56,131
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

413
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,890
The power of the sun

414
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:07,643
in the palm of my hand.

415
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,834
Keep calm!
It's only a spike!

416
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,836
It'll soon stabilize!

417
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,634
- Pete...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

418
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,302
please clear the room.

419
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:49,518
We have a containment
breach!

420
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,314
Otto, please get back!

421
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:58,152
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

422
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:01,155
It will stabilize!
It's under control!

423
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,157
I'm in charge here!

424
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,160
It's my money! I'm in con--

425
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,832
This doesn't change
anything.

426
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,504
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

427
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,173
No!

428
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,776
Rosie!

429
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:11,558
Watch it.

430
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:12,976
That was too close.

431
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:17,189
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

432
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,987
I'm ruined.

433
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:28,158
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

434
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:29,993
He saved your life, sir.

435
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,829
He humiliated me by touching me.

436
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,582
Mr. Osborn, the press will be here
soon. I suggest we move on.

437
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,668
What was he doing here anyway?

438
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,520
As you can see, molten metal
penetrated the spinal cavity

439
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,814
and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points,

440
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,566
including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

441
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,902
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

442
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,281
So I suggest we cut off these
mechanical arms, slice up the harness

443
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,574
and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy

444
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,995
with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

445
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,579
We're ready, doctor.

446
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,710
Anybody here take
shop class?

447
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,796
Help me! Help me!

448
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,371
No!

449
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,675
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

450
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:16,011
Panic in the streets,
if we're lucky.

451
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:18,972
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

452
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:22,142
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

453
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:27,314
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

454
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:29,065
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

455
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,235
- What are we gonna call this guy?
- Uh-- Uh--

456
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,613
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

457
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,323
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

458
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,617
- "Doctor Strange."
- That's pretty good.

459
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:43,288
But it's taken. Wait, wait!
I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

460
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,082
- Um, but-- I like it.
- Of course you do.

461
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:50,003
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

462
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,255
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

463
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,007
Get out.

464
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,967
Chief, I found Parker.

465
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,637
Where you been? Looking for you all
morning. Why don't you pay your phone bill.

466
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,805
Mad scientist goes berserk,
and we don't have pictures!

467
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,058
I heard Spider-Man was there.

468
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,019
Where were you? Photographing squirrels?
You're fired.

469
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,604
Chief, the planetarium party.

470
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,439
Oh, right. You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

471
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,191
What do you know
about high society?

472
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:13,568
- Oh. Uh, well, I--
- Ah, don't answer that.

473
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:17,405
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

474
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,325
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

475
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,244
Could you pay me
in advance?

476
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,713
You serious? Pay you
for what? Standing there?

477
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,550
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

478
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,400
My Rosie's dead.

479
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,320
My dream is dead.

480
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,284
And these...

481
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,789
monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river,

482
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,043
along with me.

483
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,596
Something...

484
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,099
in my head.

485
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,812
Something talking.

486
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,318
The inhibitor chip!

487
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:41,281
Gone.

488
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,370
Rebuild.

489
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,459
No.

490
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:55,086
Peter was right.

491
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,007
I miscalculated.

492
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,641
I couldn't have miscalculated.

493
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,685
It was working, wasn't it?

494
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:16,983
Yes.

495
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:21,071
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

496
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,490
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

497
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:26,201
But we need money.

498
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,329
Steal it?

499
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,331
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

500
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,251
That's right.

501
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,382
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

502
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,679
We'll do it here.

503
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:49,683
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

504
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,519
Nothing will stand in our way.

505
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:54,020
Nothing!

506
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:02,028
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

507
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,030
My uncle Ben's
life insurance.

508
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:06,449
Yes, but I'm afraid

509
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:09,703
it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

510
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,540
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

511
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:14,999
You are?

512
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,668
Ow!

513
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:18,294
Oh, ow!

514
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:23,383
We-- We appreciate
that you've just opened up

515
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,136
a new supersaver account
with us today.

516
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,554
But the fact is,

517
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:32,058
you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

518
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:34,269
Well...

519
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,897
At least we get
the toaster.

520
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:42,068
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of, uh, 300 or more.

521
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,239
Oh, yes, I see.

522
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:49,367
Okay.

523
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,539
Don't worry,
we'll figure it out.

524
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:13,183
Peter?

525
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,061
Don't leave me.

526
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:20,315
Oh, that boy of yours
is a real hero.

527
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,066
Hold it!

528
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,487
Put your arms up! All of them!

529
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,094
Here's your change!

530
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,606
Oh, no. Come on!

531
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,400
Ha!

532
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,741
Ow!

533
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,163
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

534
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,957
Not anymore.

535
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,488
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

536
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,244
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

537
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,916
Wait a second.

538
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,936
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

539
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:23,938
Easy, now.

540
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,358
Butterfingers.

541
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:40,872
Look out!

542
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,043
Help me!

543
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:49,714
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

544
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,888
Hang on!

545
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:16,074
Help!

546
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,595
Thank you.

547
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,141
Aunt May.

548
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,311
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

549
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,523
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

550
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:55,613
Come on.

551
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,703
Shame on you.

552
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,388
<i>Woo-how.!</i>

553
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,778
There you go.

554
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:40,074
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

555
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,534
We sure showed him.

556
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:43,453
What do you mean, "we"?

557
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,246
Oh.

558
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,959
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- No, take me.

559
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:20,073
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

560
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:22,950
Penny! Over here!

561
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:29,874
Leave it.

562
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,422
Hey. Might wanna
take it easy, buddy.

563
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:37,924
Why? It's a party.

564
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:41,219
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot

565
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,639
who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

566
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:46,599
Not to mention your friend the bug.

567
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,392
Not tonight, Harry.

568
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,021
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

569
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:53,981
Parker!

570
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:55,858
Parker!

571
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,153
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

572
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,697
Come on, what do you think, I'm paying
you to sit around, sip champagne?

573
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,741
Here, get a shot of my wife
with the minister here.

574
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,451
Beautiful tie.

575
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,870
Ooh! No, get a shot of us
with the DA.

576
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,789
Beautiful dress.

577
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,625
Ooh! Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

578
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,878
Wife.

579
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,174
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

580
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:23,386
The committee for
the Science Library of New York

581
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:25,805
is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

582
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:29,100
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

583
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,980
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious

584
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:36,023
Captain John Jameson.

585
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,236
Hi.

586
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:27,909
- Oh. You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

587
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,203
But there was
a disturbance.

588
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,746
I don't know you.

589
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:37,668
And I can't keep thinking
about you. It's too painful.

590
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,254
I've been reading
poetry lately.

591
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:41,797
Whatever that means.

592
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,801
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

593
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:49,055
<i>Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--</i>

594
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,098
Don't start.

595
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,227
Can I get you a drink?

596
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,270
I'm with John.
He'll get me my drink.

597
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:58,564
John.

598
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:02,610
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

599
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:05,780
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

600
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:08,282
My sick mother got out of bed
to see it.

601
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,825
Even my father.

602
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:13,788
He came backstage
to borrow cash.

603
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:19,794
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me,

604
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:22,129
can't make an 8:00 curtain.

605
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,383
After all these years,

606
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:29,303
he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

607
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,623
You know, it
pisses me off, your loyalty

608
00:56:56,635 --> 00:56:58,291
to Spider-Man and
not to your best friend.

609
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,921
I find him with my
father's body, and you

610
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:01,585
defend him because
he's your bread and butter.

611
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,754
- Hey, take it easy.
- Hey, don't push me.

612
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,798
Don't act like you're
my friend.

613
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:08,509
You stole M.J. from me.

614
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,845
You stole my father's love.

615
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:16,517
Then you let him die because you didn't
turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

616
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:19,979
Huh? Isn't that right?

617
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,939
Huh, brother?

618
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,661
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know

619
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,416
that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

620
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:52,803
What a surprise.

621
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,890
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

622
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,252
Oh, no. No!

623
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,474
Why is this happening to me?

624
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,850
Aaaah.

625
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,771
You seem very okay to me.

626
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,857
My diagnosis?

627
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,817
It's up here.

628
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:18,532
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

629
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,453
There is one dream where,

630
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,371
in my dream,

631
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:26,874
I'm Spider-Man.

632
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,712
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

633
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:33,964
Oh.

634
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,051
So you're Spider-Man.

635
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:38,469
In my dream.

636
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:43,015
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

637
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:44,975
Huh.

638
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,894
Somebody else's dream.

639
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,568
What about this friend?

640
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:58,072
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

641
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,535
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

642
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,914
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

643
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,874
Nothing as bad
as uncertainty.

644
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:11,252
Listen,

645
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:16,382
maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

646
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,551
That's why you keep falling.

647
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,930
You always have
a choice, Peter.

648
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,892
I have a choice.

649
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:38,988
<i>All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter,</i>

650
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,532
<i>make me sad.</i>

651
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,952
Can't you understand?

652
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:47,997
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

653
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:51,875
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty,

654
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:55,129
fairness, justice...

655
01:01:55,879 --> 01:02:00,634
Out of those times, I counted on you
to have the courage

656
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,722
to take those dreams
out into the world.

657
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:08,392
I can't live your dreams anymore.

658
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,395
I want a life of my own.

659
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,689
You've been given
a gift, Peter.

660
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:18,235
With great power
comes great responsibility.

661
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:24,491
Take my hand, son.

662
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,423
No, Uncle Ben.

663
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,761
I'm just Peter Parker.

664
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,264
I'm Spider-Man

665
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,683
no more.

666
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,227
No more.

667
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:01,945
No more.

668
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:30,617
Hey!

669
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,245
- You punk!
- Sorry.

670
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,789
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

671
01:04:43,255 --> 01:04:44,590
Hurry up!

672
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:57,853
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

673
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,855
Someone, please?

674
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,234
.23 electron volts.

675
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,367
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

676
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,839
Why, I'm not really wicked at all, Cousin
Cecily. You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

677
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:29,051
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all

678
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:30,969
in a very inexcusable manner.

679
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,472
I hope you have not been
leading a double life,

680
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:36,683
pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

681
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,602
That would be hypocrisy.

682
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:40,896
Oh. Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

683
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:44,608
Hi.

684
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,363
"I am glad."

685
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,199
"I am glad."

686
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:54,284
"I am glad."

687
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,247
Are you glad
to hear it?

688
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,793
I am glad

689
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,419
to hear it.

690
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,338
In fact, now you mention
the subject,

691
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:10,092
I have been very bad
in my own small way.

692
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:15,013
Oh. You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

693
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,224
You could've told me
you were coming.

694
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:19,726
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

695
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,107
You look different.

696
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:30,779
I shined my shoes, pressed
my pants, did my homework.

697
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,865
I do my homework now.

698
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,785
You wanna get some
chow mein?

699
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:38,370
Peter,

700
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,372
I'm getting married.

701
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:48,213
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

702
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,173
And who's the groom?

703
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,217
You hadn't decided yet.

704
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,763
You think just because
you saw my play,

705
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,308
you can talk me out
of getting married?

706
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,769
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

707
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:06,440
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

708
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,483
You're too late.

709
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:10,944
Will you think about it?

710
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,446
Think about what?

711
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,615
Picking up
where we left off.

712
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,074
Where was that?

713
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,869
We never got on. You can't get off
if you don't get on, Peter.

714
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,370
I don't think it's that simple.

715
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,789
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

716
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,625
You don't understand.

717
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,544
I'm not an empty seat
anymore.

718
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:29,504
I'm different.

719
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,132
Punch me, I bleed.

720
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,891
I have to go.

721
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,192
I'm getting married
in a church.

722
01:07:57,908 --> 01:07:59,451
You are different.

723
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:17,469
Dear, we agreed to put on
a wedding, not go into bankruptcy.

724
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,847
Caviar? What, are we
inviting the tsar?

725
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,059
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail Weenies.

726
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:27,396
Boss, I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

727
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,427
Don't tell me you have the
head of an extraterrestrial in

728
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,316
there, because if you do,
you're the third guy this week.

729
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,654
Where the hell
did you get that?

730
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:37,364
In the garbage.

731
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:38,949
In the garbage?

732
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,703
He must've
given up.

733
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:47,749
Thrown in the towel. Abandoned
his sad little masquerade.

734
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:51,837
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

735
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:56,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, uh, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

736
01:08:56,967 --> 01:09:00,053
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

737
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:03,849
All right, 100. Miss Brant, give this man
his money and throw in a bar of soap.

738
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:05,976
Your wife is still
on that line.

739
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:09,146
Flowers? How much?

740
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,983
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

741
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,401
Get plastic.

742
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:17,154
Gotta go, big story.

743
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:31,501
<i>Spider-Man
Spider-Man</i>

744
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,671
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

745
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:38,258
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

746
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,018
Come on, man. Get the money.

747
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,521
Come on, come on.

748
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,400
Help!

749
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:00,572
Come on!

750
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:09,289
It wasn't fair
to have gone like that.

751
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,625
He was a peaceful man.

752
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,921
And it was all my doing.

753
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:52,165
Aunt May. You don't have to
punish yourself.

754
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,376
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

755
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,963
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway,

756
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,298
and he wanted to
drive you.

757
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:03,176
If only I had stopped him.

758
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:06,805
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

759
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:24,072
I'm responsible.

760
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:29,327
For what?

761
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,455
For what happened
to Uncle Ben.

762
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,916
But you were at the library.

763
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,043
You were doing
your homework.

764
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,338
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

765
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:42,799
What do you mean?

766
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,218
I went someplace else.

767
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,388
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money

768
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:52,309
to buy a car, because I wanted

769
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:55,478
to impress Mary Jane.

770
01:11:57,606 --> 01:11:59,649
It happened so fast.

771
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:04,654
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

772
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,574
The thief

773
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:10,577
was running towards me.

774
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,956
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted

775
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,250
revenge.

776
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,754
I let him go.

777
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:25,592
I let him get away.

778
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:33,266
He wanted a car.

779
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,685
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

780
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:40,190
Uncle Ben said no,

781
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,860
and then he shot him.

782
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:51,117
Uncle Ben was killed
that night

783
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:55,830
for being the only one
who did the right thing.

784
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,293
And I, uh...

785
01:13:03,755 --> 01:13:05,799
I held his hand

786
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:07,968
when he died.

787
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,520
I've tried to tell you
so many times.

788
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:17,329
Just one more little chore.

789
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,338
Where are you?

790
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:32,385
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

791
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:35,263
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

792
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,057
Good night, Bernard.

793
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,694
Hello, Harry.

794
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,072
Otto. What do you want?

795
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:36,241
That precious tritium.

796
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:38,785
But I need more of it this time.

797
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:44,541
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

798
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,422
Hey! Hey!

799
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:53,633
Stop! Stop! All right!

800
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:57,804
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

801
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,984
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

802
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:15,697
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

803
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,157
How do I find him?

804
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,076
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

805
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:22,579
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the <i>Bugle.</i>

806
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,247
Make him tell you
where he is.

807
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,337
Have it ready.

808
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,676
Don't hurt Peter!

809
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:52,358
Somebody, help!

810
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:54,861
Fire!

811
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:06,039
Alisa. Alisa, the Chens can't find
their daughter. Have you seen her?

812
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:10,043
Somebody call the
fire department! Help!

813
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:13,129
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

814
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,882
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

815
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,800
Hey, where you going?!

816
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,406
I'm coming!

817
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:44,410
Aah! Oh!

818
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:07,934
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

819
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,395
Come on. Come on.

820
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,624
Mama.

821
01:19:24,636 --> 01:19:26,179
You got some guts, kid.

822
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:30,975
Some poor soul got trapped on
the fourth floor. Never made it out.

823
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,685
Oh, man.

824
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:39,192
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

825
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,112
Let's pick it up! Let's get all
this equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

826
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:51,829
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

827
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,290
What I need?

828
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:59,045
What am I supposed to do?

829
01:20:03,675 --> 01:20:05,551
Oh, uh...

830
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,261
I shouldn't have without

831
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,180
knocking.

832
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,353
Come in.

833
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:20,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

834
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:23,778
Um...

835
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,198
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

836
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,451
Okay.

837
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:33,788
And a glass of milk?

838
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,459
That would be nice.

839
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,547
Okay.

840
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,569
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

841
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,157
Oh, um...

842
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:10,908
You got a message.

843
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,536
It's your aunt.

844
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:15,455
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

845
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:32,889
What's going on?

846
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:36,851
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

847
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:40,688
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

848
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:42,315
Why didn't you
tell me?

849
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:45,818
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

850
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:49,363
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand,

851
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,032
and I'm giving him $5.

852
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,326
- That's Henry Jackson?
- Yes.

853
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:55,578
Yes. It's funny what
happens in two years.

854
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:59,332
Nine years old,
has great ambitions.

855
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:04,170
Um... Listen, about my last visit...

856
01:22:04,462 --> 01:22:06,798
Pish-posh, we needn't
talk about it.

857
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:11,511
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

858
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:17,517
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

859
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:20,895
And I'm proud of you.

860
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,357
And I thank you, and I...

861
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,985
I love you, Peter.

862
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:31,739
So very, very much.

863
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:54,220
Hey. Where are all
my comic books?

864
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:57,306
Oh, those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

865
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:01,936
I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.

866
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,563
Thank you,
Henry.

867
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,273
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

868
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:06,816
You're getting tall.

869
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:11,070
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

870
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:14,365
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

871
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:16,576
I used to.

872
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:17,994
Where is he?

873
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:22,456
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

874
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:27,169
He, uh...

875
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:30,506
- quit.
- Why?

876
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:33,259
Wanted to try other things.

877
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:35,011
He'll be back, right?

878
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,597
I don't know.

879
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:42,059
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

880
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:44,228
Spider-Man.

881
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,355
- Why?
- Well, he knows a hero

882
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,274
when he sees one.

883
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:52,194
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that,

884
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,405
saving old girls like me.

885
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:56,866
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

886
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,412
Courageous, self-sacrificing people

887
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:03,915
setting examples for all of us.

888
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,709
Everybody loves a hero.

889
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:10,504
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

890
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:14,842
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours

891
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,844
just to get a glimpse
of the one

892
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:20,348
who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

893
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:24,936
I believe there's a hero
in all of us

894
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,521
that keeps us honest,

895
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:29,774
gives us strength,

896
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:32,068
makes us noble

897
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,697
and finally allows us to die
with pride.

898
01:24:37,865 --> 01:24:41,994
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady

899
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:44,956
and give up the thing
we want the most.

900
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,626
Even our dreams.

901
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:53,255
Spider-Man did that for Henry,

902
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,841
and he wonders where he's gone.

903
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,844
He needs him.

904
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:08,020
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

905
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,690
But don't strain yourself.

906
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,483
Okay.

907
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,421
Strong focus on what I want.

908
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:02,408
Woo-hoo!

909
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:05,036
I'm back!

910
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:06,579
I'm back!

911
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,598
My back.

912
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:27,892
My back.

913
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:56,378
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

914
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:58,172
Peter Parker?

915
01:26:58,923 --> 01:27:01,592
Oh. Positive.

916
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:03,052
Thought he was your pal.

917
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,638
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

918
01:27:05,805 --> 01:27:09,225
Uh, he's just a great big jerk.

919
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:11,352
The world's full of great big jerks.

920
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,647
You're adorable.

921
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:16,649
It's just the uniform.

922
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:22,029
Lean your head back for me.

923
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:24,782
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

924
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:28,494
- Just put my head back?
- Mm-hmm.

925
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:30,830
Okay.

926
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,392
Wow.

927
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,936
I'm back on the moon.

928
01:27:58,566 --> 01:28:00,067
You up there with me?

929
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,048
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

930
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,717
Very.

931
01:28:24,884 --> 01:28:26,427
Thanks for coming.

932
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,721
Everything okay?

933
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:31,432
Uh, you might say so.

934
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:36,562
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

935
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,567
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

936
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:45,946
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

937
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:51,243
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night,

938
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:54,914
that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

939
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,833
I was afraid to trust you.

940
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:02,546
But I've been thinking
about it--

941
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:06,383
Listen, there's more
for me to say.

942
01:29:10,054 --> 01:29:14,266
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought--

943
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:17,061
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

944
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:19,563
I'm saying...

945
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,066
I...

946
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:28,739
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane,

947
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,741
but I can't.

948
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:37,414
My mind was playing tricks too.

949
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,713
Do you love me, or not?

950
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:53,389
I...

951
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:57,977
don't.

952
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,692
You don't.

953
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:15,494
Kiss me.

954
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:19,164
Kiss you?

955
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,166
I need to know
something.

956
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,379
Just one kiss.

957
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:14,678
What's happening?

958
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:26,565
Peter Parker,

959
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,068
and the girlfriend.

960
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:31,362
What do you want?

961
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:36,408
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

962
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:39,203
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

963
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,538
Well, I don't know
where he is.

964
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,583
Find him.

965
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:49,713
Or I'll peel the flesh
off her bones.

966
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,924
If you lay one finger on her...

967
01:31:52,091 --> 01:31:53,425
You'll do what?

968
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:10,878
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

969
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:12,671
Sorry, Jonah.

970
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,215
It's all my fault.

971
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:19,344
I drove Spider-Man away.

972
01:33:19,595 --> 01:33:22,306
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

973
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:25,601
Yes.

974
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:30,397
Spider-Man was a hero.

975
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:33,400
I just couldn't see it.

976
01:33:35,194 --> 01:33:36,612
He was a--

977
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:39,448
A thief! A criminal!

978
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:43,452
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

979
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:46,538
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

980
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:48,790
I want him strung up by his web!

981
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:52,961
I want Spider-Man!

982
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:22,783
Where is she?

983
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:25,577
Oh, she'll be just fine.
Let's talk.

984
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:18,046
What the hell?

985
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:06,553
Aah!

986
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,090
You have a train to catch.

987
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:29,428
Help!

988
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:33,932
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

989
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:55,287
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

990
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:56,955
Tell everyone
to hang on!

991
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:58,874
Brace yourselves!

992
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:22,564
Any more bright ideas?

993
01:38:22,773 --> 01:38:25,108
I got a few, yeah!

994
01:38:46,463 --> 01:38:48,256
Whoa, watch out!

995
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,163
We're slowing down.

996
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:26,521
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

997
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,024
Slower. Gently.

998
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:35,614
Is he alive?

999
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,619
He's

1000
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,370
just a kid.

1001
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:45,373
No older than my son.

1002
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:06,519
It's all right.

1003
01:41:10,941 --> 01:41:12,776
We found something.

1004
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,204
We won't tell nobody.

1005
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:40,387
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

1006
01:42:00,365 --> 01:42:02,200
He's mine!

1007
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:05,745
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

1008
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:07,414
And me.

1009
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:09,374
Me too.

1010
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:15,880
Very well.

1011
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:46,870
Where do you want him?

1012
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:56,171
And the tritium?

1013
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,145
Yes.

1014
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:45,261
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

1015
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:50,517
First we'll see
who's behind the mask.

1016
01:43:50,683 --> 01:43:53,144
I can look into your eyes
as you die.

1017
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:57,440
Pete.

1018
01:43:57,816 --> 01:43:59,484
No.

1019
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:01,486
It can't be.

1020
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:09,410
Harry.

1021
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:14,332
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

1022
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:19,671
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

1023
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:21,756
Tritium?

1024
01:44:23,675 --> 01:44:25,677
He's making
the machine again.

1025
01:44:26,511 --> 01:44:30,765
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

1026
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:33,685
- Now, where is he?
- Peter,

1027
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:36,688
you killed my father.

1028
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:45,989
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

1029
01:44:46,698 --> 01:44:49,325
Harry, please,
I've got to stop him.

1030
01:45:00,086 --> 01:45:01,796
Hey!

1031
01:45:02,881 --> 01:45:04,549
Hey!

1032
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,719
I'm talking to you!

1033
01:45:08,052 --> 01:45:11,556
You got what you needed for your
little science project, now let me go.

1034
01:45:11,723 --> 01:45:13,725
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1035
01:45:13,892 --> 01:45:17,103
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1036
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:18,730
He's not dead.

1037
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,608
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1038
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:40,710
Surprise.

1039
01:45:45,131 --> 01:45:46,758
As soon as you get free--

1040
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:52,805
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1041
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:56,226
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1042
01:45:56,392 --> 01:45:58,686
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1043
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:01,689
Well, I'm not.

1044
01:46:34,222 --> 01:46:35,473
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1045
01:46:51,406 --> 01:46:52,782
Run!

1046
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:19,517
Let's see you scurry
out of this.

1047
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:45,626
Now what?

1048
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,867
Dr. Octavius.

1049
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:22,330
We have to
shut it down.

1050
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:24,707
Please tell me how.

1051
01:48:24,874 --> 01:48:26,292
Peter Parker?

1052
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:31,923
"Brilliant but lazy."

1053
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:33,633
Look at what's
happening.

1054
01:48:34,634 --> 01:48:36,511
We must destroy it.

1055
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,768
I can't destroy it.

1056
01:48:49,023 --> 01:48:50,358
I won't.

1057
01:48:55,947 --> 01:48:58,116
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1058
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:03,704
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1059
01:49:05,415 --> 01:49:06,791
A privilege.

1060
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:10,545
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1061
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:13,464
Don't listen to them.

1062
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:20,888
It was my dream.

1063
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:25,560
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady

1064
01:49:25,726 --> 01:49:28,271
and give up the thing
we want the most.

1065
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:30,731
Even our dreams.

1066
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:38,573
You're right.

1067
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,290
He's right.

1068
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:51,002
Listen.

1069
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:55,465
Listen to me now.

1070
01:49:58,342 --> 01:50:00,678
Listen to me now.

1071
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:07,351
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1072
01:50:08,478 --> 01:50:10,146
It can't be stopped.

1073
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,566
It's self-sustaining now.

1074
01:50:13,816 --> 01:50:15,860
- Think!
- Unless...

1075
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:19,197
The river.

1076
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:22,158
Drown it.

1077
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:25,453
I'll do it.

1078
01:51:10,831 --> 01:51:13,501
No!

1079
01:51:25,513 --> 01:51:27,098
Hi.

1080
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:29,433
Hi.

1081
01:51:30,226 --> 01:51:31,686
This is really heavy.

1082
01:51:56,252 --> 01:51:58,212
M.J.

1083
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:00,840
In case we die...

1084
01:52:01,007 --> 01:52:02,592
You do love me.

1085
01:52:03,175 --> 01:52:04,427
I do.

1086
01:52:05,386 --> 01:52:07,471
Even though you said you didn't.

1087
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:12,852
I will not die a monster.

1088
01:53:18,084 --> 01:53:20,169
I think I always knew,

1089
01:53:21,212 --> 01:53:22,880
all this time,

1090
01:53:24,048 --> 01:53:25,841
who you really were.

1091
01:53:26,425 --> 01:53:29,011
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1092
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:33,057
Spider-Man will always
have enemies.

1093
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:37,728
I can't let you
take that risk.

1094
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,776
I will...

1095
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:47,738
always be Spider-Man.

1096
01:53:50,491 --> 01:53:52,868
You and I can never be.

1097
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:43,252
Mary Jane!

1098
01:55:46,357 --> 01:55:47,983
Hello?

1099
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:05,376
Who's that?

1100
01:56:05,543 --> 01:56:07,461
Son.

1101
01:56:08,546 --> 01:56:09,880
I'm here.

1102
01:56:11,215 --> 01:56:12,883
Dad?

1103
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:16,136
- I thought you were--
- No.

1104
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:18,722
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1105
01:56:18,889 --> 01:56:20,140
Now it's your turn.

1106
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:24,395
You swore to make
Spider-Man pay.

1107
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:26,397
Now make him pay.

1108
01:56:26,897 --> 01:56:28,566
But Pete's my best friend.

1109
01:56:28,774 --> 01:56:30,276
And I'm your father.

1110
01:56:31,277 --> 01:56:32,736
You're weak.

1111
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:38,075
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1112
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:41,954
Now you know the truth
about Peter.

1113
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:44,415
Be strong, Harry.

1114
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:46,834
Avenge me.

1115
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:51,714
- Avenge me!
- No!

1116
01:59:16,358 --> 01:59:17,735
Call Deborah.

1117
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:19,737
The--? The caterer?

1118
01:59:20,738 --> 01:59:22,865
Tell her not to open
the caviar.

1119
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,408
Had to do what I had to do.

1120
02:00:08,077 --> 02:00:09,411
Mary Jane.

1121
02:00:10,579 --> 02:00:11,830
Peter.

1122
02:00:13,082 --> 02:00:15,501
I can't survive without you.

1123
02:00:25,511 --> 02:00:27,346
You shouldn't be here.

1124
02:00:28,472 --> 02:00:31,517
I know you think
we can't be together.

1125
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:36,313
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1126
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,399
I know there'll be risks.

1127
02:00:40,234 --> 02:00:42,820
But I want to face them
with you.

1128
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:47,324
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive,

1129
02:00:47,491 --> 02:00:49,284
half of ourselves.

1130
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:53,330
I love you.

1131
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:58,585
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1132
02:01:00,337 --> 02:01:03,423
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1133
02:01:10,472 --> 02:01:14,017
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1134
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:21,775
Well, say something.

1135
02:01:24,278 --> 02:01:26,780
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1136
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:44,715
Go get them, tiger.

1137
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:08,947
Whoo!

1138
02:02:09,364 --> 02:02:11,241
Woo-hoo!
