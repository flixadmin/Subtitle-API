1
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,463
<i>They say that jazz life takes its toll.</i>
<i>But this isn't what they had in mind.</i>

2
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:10,034
<i>The dark side of jazz, America's</i>
<i>greatest indigenous art form...</i>

3
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,637
<i>... has always been its capacity</i>
<i>for self-destruction.</i>

4
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:17,470
<i>Drugs, alcohol and the road are the perils</i>
<i>of the life lived after midnight.</i>

5
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,841
<i>But not 20,000 volts</i>
<i>of state-supplied electricity.</i>

6
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,177
<i>After a year's worth of appeals,</i>
<i>the governor remains adamant...</i>

7
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,343
<i>... refusing to grant clemency</i>
<i>to jazz colossus Wayne Cotrell.</i>

8
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,489
<i>Condemned to death</i>
<i>at midnight tonight...</i>

9
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,218
<i>... for the passion slaying</i>
<i>of his wife, songstress Linda Lake.</i>

10
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,859
<i>One of the finest modern jazz stylists in</i>
<i>decades, Linda's first and only recording...</i>

11
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,661
...Smoke Dreams<i>, went triple platinum</i>
<i>after her death a year ago.</i>

12
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,101
<i>The prosecution convinced a jury</i>
<i>of his peers that Linda's success...</i>

13
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,832
<i>... drove Wayne into a jealous rage.</i>

14
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,967
<i>So with the streets of Central City,</i>
<i>an armed camp of hoodlums...</i>

15
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,775
<i>... the state enacts the death penalty</i>
<i>for the first time in 15 years...</i>

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,748
<i>... for Wayne Cotrell</i>
<i>at midnight tonight.</i>

17
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,318
Damn!

18
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,453
<i>It makes you think, huh?</i>

19
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,092
- I needed that analysis yesterday.
- Get off my back.

20
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,094
- We've got a heavy caseload.
- Like the Cotrell case?

21
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,424
That what you've spent...?

22
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,897
- Somebody's gotta look into it.
- And somebody did.

23
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,298
He was indicted, tried, convicted.

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,463
All on circumstantial evidence. You guys
never even found the babe he was with.

25
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,905
You think we didn't try?

26
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,943
- Wayne is innocent.
- You face the facts, Mendez.

27
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,445
Cotrell strangled her.

28
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,074
And then he tried to make it
look like an automobile accident.

29
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,187
Wayne is like a brother to me, okay?

30
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,791
He had his problems, but he
couldn't kill anyone, let alone Linda.

31
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,155
You don't think I know how you feel?
But you didn't see her.

32
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,922
You didn't see what was left of her
after that explosion.

33
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,098
Linda's murderer is walking free,
when Wayne dies in less than an hour.

34
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,628
This department did a first-rate job.

35
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,331
We opened the case, and the jury shut it.
Now you get back to work.

36
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,170
And I don't wanna hear
anything more about it.

37
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,159
Julio, I'm a little worried about you.

38
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:21,031
Now, I've never seen you like this. It's like
you've been ready to erupt all week.

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,968
My oldest friend dies in less than an hour,
and I can't do squat to stop it.

40
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,606
I know.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,110
- But you won't get anywhere with Garfield.
- Oh, the hell with Garfield.

42
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,805
I gotta get some air.

43
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,246
I'll cover you here.

44
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,623
Crime lab. Allen.

45
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,129
- I gotta talk to Julio Mendez.
- <i>He's not available right now.</i>

46
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,598
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- No, man. Julio's the only cop I trust.

47
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,303
Tell him Dave Buell called.

48
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,971
<i>Decibel Dave Buell?</i>

49
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,574
Yeah, do I know you, man?

50
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,544
Do I know you? I've been a big fan
of yours since the <i>Black Heat</i> sides.

51
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,708
I love the new chart on "Sing the Blues"
you premiered at Take Five last week.

52
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,950
Well, the song's been recorded.

53
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,489
But now it's got a vocal track.
That's why I'm calling.

54
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,093
Listen, man, tell Julio
I've got a tape for him.

55
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,889
Proof Wayne didn't kill anybody.

56
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,897
Why did you...?

57
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,001
The man dies in less than an hour.
Why did you wait until now?

58
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:35,232
Because I just now stole it.
And if it's missed, man, I'm gone.

59
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,742
You just tell Julio to meet me at
the Take Five within the next 15 minutes.

60
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,713
No, man. No! Back off!

61
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,743
No!

62
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,154
Buell? Buell!

63
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,599
Hey, who was that?

64
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,349
There he is over there!

65
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,286
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, stop!

66
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,963
<i>Hello?</i>

67
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,566
<i>Hello?</i>

68
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,468
- Julio?
- Barry?

69
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,535
I thought you were here.

70
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,402
Wait, why is the phone off the hook?

71
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,469
It wasn't working...

72
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,807
...so I went to another line
to check it out.

73
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,576
- Hello? Can you hear me okay?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:03,187
Great. Listen, we had a message from
Dave Buell, all right? About the Cotrell case.

75
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:07,452
- <i>What did he say?</i>
- Something about new evidence.

76
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,921
What new evidence?

77
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,526
How fast can you get down
to the Take Five?

78
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,689
I'm out of here, man.

79
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,988
This is Joe Kline, voice of the city...

80
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:49,066
...with Wayne Cotrell's brother,
Elliott, asking:

81
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,827
Why are you here tonight?

82
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,962
I'm keeping the club open tonight
in the memory of Linda...

83
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,233
...and to bear witness
of Wayne's innocence.

84
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,311
So you're still convinced
your brother was railroaded?

85
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,506
Nothing in life is certain, Mr. Kline.

86
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,948
But there's one thing
I have no doubt about:

87
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,145
My brother never killed anybody.

88
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,623
Do you plan to be at your brother's side
tonight, Mr. Cotrell?

89
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,225
I'll be there.

90
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,057
Mom...

91
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,387
Mom would want me to be there.

92
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,326
Thank you. I know how difficult
this can be. I really appreciate it.

93
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,630
Wrap up here. We gotta get back
to the studio for a late report.

94
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,831
How you doing?

95
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:37,548
- What are you doing? Get off me, man.
- It's a private affair. Invitations only.

96
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,551
Excuse me just a second, please.
Thank you.

97
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,787
Mendez.

98
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,518
I didn't recognize you
with the spaghetti on your head.

99
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,254
- Get off of me, man.
- Whisper.

100
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,866
This is Julio Mendez,
one of Central City's finest.

101
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,559
Hey, come on. Cool it. Cool it.
He's with me.

102
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,599
I apologize.

103
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,402
Things have been very, very tense
around here lately.

104
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,877
- Never mind Whisper. He's harmless.
- Whisper was never harmless.

105
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,948
Thanks for coming.

106
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,410
Oh, Elliott, this is my friend
Barry Allen.

107
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,751
Barry. Barry, I've seen you.
You've been a regular here for years.

108
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,292
- Since Linda's debut.
- Linda was very special for all of us.

109
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,029
Hey, any truth to the rumors?

110
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,892
The unreleased tracks?

111
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,665
All I have in the vaults are a bunch
of old jazz standards. Real chestnuts.

112
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,102
- Well, you could make a fortune.
- I'm not in it for the money.

113
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:40,104
Right now it would be real painful
to go through all those tapes...

114
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,510
...to hear her voice. It's very much alive.

115
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:48,211
But when the time comes that I can,
I will release the tracks for all her fans.

116
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,214
Wayne saved my butt too often.
If there's anything I can do...

117
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,424
Any miracles handy?

118
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,427
You know, I'm surprised
Dave Buell isn't here.

119
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,196
Dave?

120
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,131
Dave's still in Chicago.
He couldn't make it tonight.

121
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,767
Decibel in Dutch with the cops?

122
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,373
- No.
- Nothing like that.

123
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,010
We gotta blow.
We gotta try and find a miracle.

124
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,870
Okay. Fall by a little later
for the wake.

125
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:33,988
He'll have those tapes on disks
before Wayne's corpse is even cold.

126
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,364
Elliott's all business, man.
This place is his entire life.

127
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,936
He even has an apartment upstairs.

128
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,598
He lied about Buell.
I found his horn case on the bandstand.

129
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:48,213
We can find him later. But he said this
would prove Wayne's innocence.

130
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,976
What the hell good is that, man?
It looks like it got run over by a truck.

131
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,014
Where's Dave?

132
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,087
Beats the hell out of me.
But we got 40 minutes, all right?

133
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,090
Call me at Star Labs after you've pulled
everything you can on the case, all right?

134
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,319
All right, whatever you say, man.

135
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,372
You paged me in the middle of <i>Swan Lake.</i>
I got dirty looks climbing over knees.

136
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,313
I'm sorry, okay? But it's a matter
of life and death, literally.

137
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,282
We may just save Wayne Cotrell
from the chair.

138
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,321
- But that's tonight.
- Yeah. At midnight.

139
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,822
It's 20 past 11 already.

140
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,188
It's 17 past,
and I need your help desperately.

141
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,422
- I'll do anything I can.
- This is all we have to work from.

142
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,897
Can you rebuild it?

143
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:46,002
I'll try the digitizer. It's a long shot.
Especially with the time we have.

144
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,199
Long shots are all we've got. Just do
it fast, all right? I'm off to see Cotrell.

145
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,782
I can't understand why you keep
refusing absolution, Wayne.

146
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,409
Nothing personal, Padre.
I got nothing to confess.

147
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:07,252
I didn't kill Linda. That's the truth,
so help me God.

148
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,190
- I'll pray for you anyway, brother.
- Thanks.

149
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,354
But you better pray in double time.

150
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,821
Nice.

151
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,100
I know you.

152
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,293
You're the guy they call the Flash.

153
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,870
What are you doing here?
What do you want with me?

154
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,564
Some people I know
think you're innocent.

155
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,439
- I'm here to help you.
- Well, thanks, but it's a little late for that.

156
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,741
I don't think so.
But I need to hear your side.

157
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,110
Oh, man.
I've been over this, like, forever.

158
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,153
Nobody believes me.

159
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,449
Man, I love...

160
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,223
Loved Linda. She was the best thing
ever happened to me...

161
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,627
...on or off the stage.
Man, that night...

162
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,797
<i>... we fought like cats and dogs.</i>
<i>But that was just us.</i>

163
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,564
<i>There's no way I could have killed her.</i>

164
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,141
<i>I worshiped Linda.</i>

165
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,336
<i>I mean, I was angry that night,</i>
<i>man, not homicidal.</i>

166
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,007
Later on, I left the club
with this girl named Suzi Storm.

167
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,648
<i>I know it was a stupid thing to do,</i>
<i>but I was feeling bad.</i>

168
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,951
Feeling sorry for myself.

169
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,927
We went back to her place,
but all we did was talk.

170
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,623
We talked about how much
I loved Linda.

171
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,563
And the next day...

172
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,259
...Linda's dead...

173
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,999
...and Suzi, my alibi,
is nowhere to be found.

174
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,505
But Linda was leaving you.

175
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,509
She'd booked a one-way flight to L.A.

176
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,649
She wasn't leaving me, man.

177
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,781
You see, Linda cut her first record
for my brother.

178
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,424
But she didn't wanna do
her second album with Elliott.

179
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,152
She wanted to get out
from under his shadow, you dig?

180
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,658
So there was this bigtime producer
out on the West Coast...

181
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,795
...said she could do what she wanted.

182
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,403
The songs, hire the session musicians,
everything.

183
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,903
But she was coming back.
She was coming back to me.

184
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,974
The prosecution insists she
walked out on you...

185
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:45,680
...because you were seeing Suzi Storm.
- I couldn't help seeing Suzi Storm.

186
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,617
She followed me everywhere.
She was after me for sure.

187
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:54,851
She even had these earrings
custom-made. Little gold saxes.

188
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:59,930
- But we weren't having an affair.
- Why didn't she come forward to testify?

189
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,136
She was a band chick, man.
In and out of town all the time.

190
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,965
No permanent address.

191
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,939
Suzi Storm was probably
one of a half a dozen names she had.

192
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,577
Who knows what happened to her.

193
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,374
If I have anything to say about it...

194
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,379
...this won't be your last meal.

195
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,211
No big deal.

196
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,120
I don't much want to live
without Linda anyway.

197
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,538
The tape wasn't on Buell's body
or at his crib either.

198
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,043
Now we got Mendez
nosing around on us.

199
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:52,616
- Lf that tape gets out, we got nailed tight.
- Relax, Elliott.

200
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,754
That tape's not getting out
till we say so.

201
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,253
That's not enough.

202
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,621
I want a guarantee.

203
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,388
A personal guarantee.

204
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,330
Make that call on Mendez.

205
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,932
Yeah.

206
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,437
He and I got a lot
of catching up to do.

207
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,468
- Yeah?
- Mendez!

208
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,542
- Who?
- Forensics, let me in!

209
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,987
Did Julio call in?

210
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,195
Not yet. But listen.

211
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,667
I transferred the magnetic pattern
to the tape fragment on the digitizer.

212
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,167
I let the computer run millions
of possibilities...

213
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,862
...organizing according to algorithms.

214
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,139
That's Linda.

215
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,978
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, no question.

216
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,180
But that's not from her album.

217
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,251
What is this?

218
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,625
Coming through.

219
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,596
Wait. That's Dave Buell.
Where'd you find him?

220
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,401
Vacant alley near Feather and Grants.
He was strangled.

221
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,438
Like Linda. Wait up, guys,
I want to go with you.

222
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,854
Wait.

223
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,121
That's Dave Buell's new chart
from the Take Five gig he did last month.

224
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,263
If the arrangement is new,
how can it be Linda?

225
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,066
I guess it can't.

226
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,571
Last time she did the Five,
I caught her act.

227
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,471
Last night...

228
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,305
...last show.

229
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,712
Three days later,
I was handling forensics in her murder.

230
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,219
It's Julio.

231
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,226
Dave Buell's dead. I saw his body
at the morgue.

232
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,961
I can't believe it. Dave had evidence
Wayne didn't kill Linda. Now he's dead.

233
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,401
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta get it out of my mind...

234
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,371
...if we're gonna save Wayne, right?
Any luck on that tape?

235
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,705
It sounds like Linda's voice,
but the music is new. Can't figure it out.

236
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,383
Probably some kind of phony.
It's a bootleg. So what?

237
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,878
No need to speculate.
Linda's <i>Smoke Dream</i> disk.

238
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,922
Voiceprints are as individual
as fingerprints.

239
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,762
Now the new tape.

240
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,913
The sine waves are identical.

241
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,676
How could Linda be singing an arrangement
that's only a month old?

242
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,286
There's more on the tape.

243
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,514
<i>I'd like to help you to remember</i>
<i>by having you sing a little.</i>

244
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,091
- Hey, that's... That's Elliott Cotrell.
- Are you sure?

245
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,524
Yeah, I'm sure that's him.

246
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,400
Suppose that wasn't Linda
in the car wreck.

247
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,901
All we had to identify her
with were dental x-rays.

248
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,768
- Which could have been switched.
- Exactly.

249
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,399
Now, Wayne told me
that Suzi had earrings...

250
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:58,038
...custom-made to look like saxophones.
- We just assumed they were Linda's.

251
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,774
But what does this all mean?

252
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,351
It means that Suzi Storm
was murdered and put in the car.

253
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,389
It means that Linda Lake is not dead...

254
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,651
...and somebody framed Wayne.
- Elliott.

255
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,057
I knew those were crocodile tears.
It's Elliott.

256
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,630
Good Lord. Wayne Cotrell is gonna die
for a murder that never happened.

257
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,733
- I'm headed to Take Five to talk with Elliott.
- I'm with you.

258
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,635
Julio, listen, you call the governor,
all right? Wayne dies in 30 minutes.

259
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,676
Tina, you call the governor, all right?
This is my deal. I'm coming with you.

260
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,512
Come on!

261
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,784
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Statehouse, please.

262
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,786
- <i>Clearance?</i>
- Security 150.

263
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,857
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- I need the governor.

264
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,926
- <i>He's asleep.</i>
- No, this is an emergency.

265
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,926
<i>I'll see what I can do</i>.

266
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,112
Why don't you take it
to the Statehouse...

267
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,078
...and I'll go to the Take Five.
- I want a piece of Elliott.

268
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,151
- And his bodyguard.
- This isn't about revenge, Julio.

269
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,920
Maybe not for you.

270
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,080
- Dr. Christina McGee, Star Labs.
- <i>I can help you.</i>

271
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,658
- I have to talk to the governor.
- <i>The governor's out.</i>

272
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,260
A man's life is at stake here.

273
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,420
- <i>Well, whose life is that?</i>
- Wayne Cotrell.

274
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,294
- <i>The governor is out.</i>
- I don't give a damn if he's out.

275
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,957
<i>Don't use foul language with me.</i>

276
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,469
Give me your name, you idiot,
or give me that number now.

277
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,039
Hello? Hello?

278
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,673
Damn it all. Not now.

279
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,912
Use both hands, all right?

280
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:49,519
You know, I never knew how much
Wayne meant to you till this week.

281
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,555
I tried to put it behind me after the
appeals failed, but it hurt too much.

282
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,230
Wayne and I go back, man.

283
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,803
He was like a brother to me.

284
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,002
You had Jay. I had Wayne.

285
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,509
See, I grew up real middle class, but
my dad, he had this ghetto head, man.

286
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,876
Refused to leave the neighborhood,
even when he could afford it.

287
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,381
He said he owed something
to where he came from.

288
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,053
<i>Wayne was the only guy</i>
<i>who didn't bust on me...</i>

289
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,452
<i>... for having a couple extra bucks.</i>

290
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,355
<i>Not like the local homeboy</i>
<i>gangsters, the Railers.</i>

291
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:29,299
Their warlord told me I was in, like it
or not. I told him to forget it, man.

292
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,134
<i>He threatened my family.</i>
<i>I just freaked out.</i>

293
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,172
<i>I attacked a whole bunch</i>
<i>of Railers by myself, man.</i>

294
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,399
Until Wayne saw what was happening
and helped me out.

295
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,975
<i>Got the hell kicked out of us, man.</i>

296
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,583
<i>But the Railers never</i>
<i>bothered us again, man.</i>

297
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,947
- The warlord, what happened to him?
- Believe it or not, he became a singer.

298
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,385
- What?
- Yeah.

299
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:57,494
He was owned by a couple of mob guys.
He rolled over on them to the feds...

300
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,823
...and they just cut his throat
from ear to ear.

301
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,559
Severed his vocal cords.

302
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,860
Never sang again.

303
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,902
You don't want to know what he did
to the guys who sliced his throat.

304
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,906
<i>They call him Whisper now.</i>

305
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,053
Fair warning. I'm armed.

306
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,348
Give me the tape.

307
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,962
I think you need fresh batteries.

308
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:38,486
- Hey, bro, don't forget, I get your sax.
- Oh, yeah? Well, says who, little man?

309
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,099
Says you. You said I was
your most promising student.

310
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,566
Yeah? Well, with the time
you got left...

311
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:48,706
...you shouldn't be making
no promises you can't keep.

312
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,967
Man, you know you can't
take it with you.

313
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,681
Man, with all the great cats there already,
I'm gonna put together a band.

314
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,434
- Julio.
- What?

315
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,237
- That's Elliott's apartment, right?
- Yeah.

316
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,805
- What's it doing boarded up?
- I don't know. Beats me.

317
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,601
Maybe he had something to hide.

318
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,244
See if Elliott's in the club.
I'll check the living quarters.

319
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,312
- All right.
- Julio, be careful, all right?

320
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,609
If they killed Suzi and framed Wayne,
they'll be unhappy we know it.

321
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,445
Okay. All right.

322
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:00,232
All right, that was wonderful.
Wonderful.

323
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,973
Tomorrow we'll fill in the earlier track.

324
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:08,078
When will I be better?
I still can't remember a thing.

325
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,681
Linda, you had an accident.

326
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,444
It was a terrible shock to your mind.
Do you understand?

327
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:21,348
Sometimes when I sing, I can
almost remember lights, people...

328
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:25,559
- But then it just fades.
- You see?

329
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,528
Singing is just what
the doctor ordered.

330
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,691
Singing's gonna help
get back your memory.

331
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,737
Yes. I love the songs.

332
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:38,000
But how could I forget
everything about my life?

333
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,975
I have something to do.

334
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,980
But I'll be right back in a while
to tuck you in...

335
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,449
...and give you your medicine.

336
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:15,770
Elliott, Mendez and the other cop
had this.

337
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,144
It's a reconstruction
of Dave Buell's tape.

338
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,286
She might hear. Let's talk
about this outside. Come on.

339
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,562
Damn it!

340
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:40,431
Fifteen minutes away
from being home free.

341
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:44,302
We don't know what else Mendez
and his partner have on us.

342
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,205
As far as I'm concerned,
those guys are dead.

343
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:53,010
My pleasure. Elliott, we're
gonna have to lose Linda too.

344
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,052
No. She is a gold mine.
I'm not throwing that away.

345
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,555
Hey, we've taken this
as far as we can.

346
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,826
The heat is up, my man.

347
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:07,226
And if you fry,
I'm on the burner beside you.

348
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,027
I don't know.

349
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,766
<i>Linda's voice built this club.</i>

350
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,340
<i>Yeah, and the minute the record came out,</i>
<i>she was gonna leave you...</i>

351
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,273
<i>... and sign with a big label.</i>

352
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,547
<i>You made that tramp.</i>

353
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,741
<i>She was more mine</i>
<i>than she ever was Wayne's.</i>

354
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,217
<i>Yeah, that night she tried to split...</i>

355
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,414
<i>... you would've beat the life</i>
<i>out of her if I hadn't stopped you.</i>

356
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,355
<i>Now, don't you play sentimental on me.</i>

357
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,231
I lived up to my end.

358
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,334
I did Suzi. Put her in Linda's car.

359
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,905
And you set Wayne to take the fall.

360
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,166
Now it's time to do Linda for good.

361
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,243
We gotta do her for real.

362
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,082
Elliott, we got enough new song tapes.

363
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,384
We're gonna be in business
for a long, long time.

364
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,703
Do it away from here.

365
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,505
Make sure that the body's
unrecognizable. I...

366
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,438
I don't want any reopened investigations.

367
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:36,848
- I gotta go play the grieving brother.
- Elliott.

368
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,182
Give Wayne my regards.

369
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,978
- Linda, I'm your friend.
- Who are you?

370
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,982
- You've got to come with me.
- Get back.

371
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,781
- Back. I won't go with you. I won't!
- Wayne, your husband, will die...

372
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,481
...if you don't come with me.
- Wayne?

373
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,560
- I can't. Stay away!
- Please.

374
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,539
Why did you do that?
You killed that man.

375
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,682
I was only protecting you, honey.

376
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,550
It's time for your medicine, Linda.

377
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:50,251
- Elliott was gonna give it to me.
- Elliott's not here. Come on.

378
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,000
There.

379
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,401
Who am I?

380
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,304
Who are you?

381
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,207
I don't even know who I am.

382
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,551
Come on, let's take a ride.

383
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,084
Showtime, huh, Father?

384
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,632
Bless me, Father.

385
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,800
Bless me.

386
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,773
Linda!

387
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,317
You're under arrest, Whisper.

388
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,951
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts my throat.

389
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,651
Look, I know all about
what you did to Suzi and Dave.

390
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,819
And I know how you and Elliott
set Wayne up.

391
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,760
You should have stayed at home.

392
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,956
Nobody's here to help you this time.

393
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,397
Not Wayne, not anybody.

394
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,870
You never should have messed
with me, Mendez.

395
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:25,447
Not then, not now.

396
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,585
Look, you killed Suzi Storm
and you framed Wayne.

397
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,688
Mendez, I'm gonna enjoy
tearing you apart.

398
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,552
You're not gonna get away with it!

399
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,373
You see who's there, right?

400
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,610
Hey.

401
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,048
- Is that Linda?
- No, that can't be.

402
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,049
- Look.
- Who is that?

403
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,585
I don't know, man.

404
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:17,984
Old scores come to tonight.

405
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,891
I'm gonna teach you
about the quick and the dead.

406
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,538
- Julio, you okay?
- Yeah. Did you take him out?

407
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,514
Me? No, man. You were all over it.

408
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,210
- I was?
- Yeah.

409
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,184
- That's Linda.
- They're gonna kill her.

410
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,291
We gotta get her to the prison.
We've got five minutes.

411
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,504
I'm Wayne's brother.

412
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,083
Warden, may I speak to my brother,
please?

413
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,868
I'm glad you could make it.

414
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:42,877
You quit that, little brother.
Listen, before they strap me in...

415
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,778
...I want to apologize.

416
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,714
Apologize? For what?

417
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,287
I didn't always treat you right, Elliott.

418
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:56,654
Left you to do the chores,
taking care of Mama.

419
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,459
You got stuck being the responsible one.

420
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:04,089
Always playing the straight man to me.

421
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,963
Of course, you also got stuck
with all the brains in the family.

422
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,807
Yeah, but you always had the genius.

423
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,912
No, but I was always
putting you down.

424
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,640
Bird-dogging all your chicks.

425
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,977
I'm really sorry, Elliott.

426
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,650
No kidding.

427
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,924
Forgive me, okay?

428
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:37,095
- I know you didn't do it.
- Oh, God, that means a lot.

429
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,974
Whenever you gentlemen are ready.

430
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,374
Excuse me! Stand back!
Get away from the stage!

431
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,516
- We have to get to the prison.
- Prison? Why?

432
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,878
To save your husband.

433
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,020
- I'll take her.
- You won't make it in time.

434
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:33,588
- Then call Garfield, man.
- Listen, listen! I can make it.

435
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,282
- Because I'm...
- Damn it, Barry, just get to a phone!

436
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,792
You're not going anywhere.

437
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,557
What happened?

438
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:16,223
Please, it's one to midnight.
You have to get her to the prison.

439
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,300
I can try.

440
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:25,032
- I'm a friend. Really.
- I know that now.

441
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,749
- Don't shoot!
- Where did he come from?

442
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,010
I think you'll agree...

443
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,815
...there's been some mistake.
- Stay calm, everyone.

444
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,390
- Wayne?
- I don't know, I don't know.

445
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,288
Wayne?

446
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:22,257
Linda? Linda? Linda!

447
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,335
- Time to face the music, Elliott.
- No, I am not going down for this.

448
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,869
I'm walking out of here!

449
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,497
No.

450
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,507
I think you're gonna be around
for a long while.

451
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,498
- Beautiful, baby.
- Wonderful.

452
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,209
All right, yeah!

00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:51,688
Jazz has never been my cup of soup,
but I gotta tell you, this was very cool.

454
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,760
- Not bad, Wayne. Not bad.
- Not bad?

455
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,089
Considering your junior
high school teacher...

456
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,461
...wouldn't trust you with a woodblock.
- Look at this guy.

457
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,659
This place is absolutely packed.

458
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,168
If this keeps up,
I won't be able to get in.

459
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,741
Yes, you will, Barry. There'll always
be a table for you and Julio.

460
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,067
Thanks, Linda.

461
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,943
But you may notice a few changes
next time you're here, though.

462
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,278
Yeah. After what I went through,
all these clocks around here...

463
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,977
...just gotta go. Except that one.

464
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,582
Of course, that one I can live with.

465
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:35,231
- What's this?
- A new item to the menu.

466
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,466
In honor of our mysterious friend.

467
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:42,133
- Buffalo wings?
- No, no. Flash wings.

468
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,399
Oh, I get it. Kind of like:

00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,570
