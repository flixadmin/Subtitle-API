1
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,852
...salute you.

2
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,864
Be gentle, Hanno.

3
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,284
We invoke you
by your great names

4
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,119
to come to our aid.

5
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,871
Defeat the Romans.

6
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,539
Destroy their ships,

7
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,249
their engines of war,

8
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,209
and their soldiers.

9
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,338
We will prevail.

10
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,136
Ozalsces.

11
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,265
Arishat.

12
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,947
Hanno.

13
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,287
You did not make
an offering today.

14
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,790
I prefer to sacrifice a Roman.

15
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,015
Where you are,

16
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,142
I am, too.

17
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,689
And where you are,

18
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,734
I am, too, forever.

19
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,319
My wife.

20
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,607
The wind is too strong.
Furl sail and strike water.

21
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,026
Furl sail,
strike water!

22
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,112
Furl sail
and strike water!

23
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,539
Strike water!

24
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,777
They have no lands
but the ones they've stolen.

25
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,572
Wherever they go,
they leave destruction

26
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,365
and call it peace.

27
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,037
This is the last free city
in Africa Nova.

28
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,249
Today, we go into battle.

29
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,130
Pray that your god is with you.
If he is not, he is no god.

30
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,469
We've nothing to fear.

31
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,513
Where death is, we are not.

32
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,932
Where we are,

33
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
death is not.

34
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,939
Stay together and listen
for my commands.

35
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,403
Your eyes up
and your head out.

36
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,857
Fire!

37
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,032
Ready your weapons!

38
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,325
Again!

39
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,250
We're ablaze on the right!

40
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,336
Keep formation!

41
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,675
Pull!

42
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,600
Archers ready.

43
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,310
Release!

44
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,526
Nock!

45
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,945
Draw!

46
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,322
Loose!

47
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,538
Archers!

48
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,298
Fire!

49
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,812
-Raise the tower!
-Raise the tower!

50
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,164
-Back astern!
-Back astern!

51
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,173
Keep cranking.

52
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,851
Drop drawbridge!

53
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,520
The drawbridge is stuck!

54
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,614
Sir!

55
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,284
Loose!

56
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,631
Back.

57
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,779
Archers!

58
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,988
There!

59
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,448
Kill her!

60
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,617
Arishat!

61
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,647
Arishat.

62
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:32,121
Arishat!

63
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,213
I'll wait for you.

64
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,008
Check all the bodies!

65
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,010
Leave nothing!

66
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,579
I claim this city...

67
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,292
for the glory of Rome.

68
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,879
Vae victis.

69
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,383
Woe to the conquered.

70
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,487
Next!

71
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,365
Move it!

72
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,301
-Down the stairs!
-Downstairs!

73
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,434
Hey.

74
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,687
What damage have they
done you, eh?

75
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,535
Lift it up. Easy, easy.

76
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,912
Hold that.

77
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,211
Arishat?

78
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,924
I am sorry, my son.

79
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,096
I have not long.

80
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,433
This galley

81
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,894
is sailing us to something
I cannot endure.

82
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,105
I am ready... to be taken
to another place.

83
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,316
Stay here a while longer.

84
00:19:55,652 --> 00:20:00,324
I remember well when you
first were brought to us.

85
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,493
A lonely boy from the desert.
Guileless.

86
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,870
Afraid.

87
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,124
You embraced everything
we taught you.

88
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:15,505
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

89
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,968
When I die,

90
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,971
my ancestors will meet me
in the next world.

91
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,308
Who will meet you?

92
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,644
Hanno,

93
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,604
I am done.

94
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,066
Do not let them change
what you are.

95
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,807
Have you seen this boy?

96
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,439
Eama! Eama!

97
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,239
You must
go alone now, Hanno.

98
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,828
Never let them find you.

99
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,418
Go. Go.

100
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,659
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

101
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,077
Emperor Geta.

102
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,039
Emperor Caracalla.

103
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,167
General Acacius.

104
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,254
I have taken Numidia
in your names

105
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,172
that your dominion
may eclipse that

106
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,466
of every emperor
that came before you.

107
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,094
Crown him with laurels,
brother.

108
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,189
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

109
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,697
In honor
of your conquest,

110
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,783
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

111
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,495
I require no games
in my honor.

112
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,166
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

113
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,959
is honor enough for me.

114
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,837
You are too modest,
Acacius.

115
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,132
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

116
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,095
The glory is yours,
not mine.

117
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,307
I only ask for
some respite from war

118
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,892
to spend time
with my wife.

119
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,394
Your wife, yes.

120
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,188
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

121
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,816
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

122
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,694
There are victories
yet still to come.

123
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,864
Persia.

124
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,116
India.

125
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,996
Both... must be conquered.

126
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,417
Rome has so many subjects.

127
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,461
She must feed them.

128
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,964
They can eat war.

129
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,970
Your triumphs
will be celebrated

130
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,224
as a tribute
to the greatness

131
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,309
of the Roman people.

132
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,749
Go to hell!

133
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,272
Macrinus of Thysdrus,

134
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,566
master of gladiators!

135
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,965
Stay close.

136
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:52,193
Aediles
and the town councilors,

137
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,488
distinguished guests,

138
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,450
citizens of Antium,

139
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,539
behold the fate

140
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,501
of the conquered enemies
of Rome:

141
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:14,633
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

142
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,261
Jugurtha!

143
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,843
This one is interesting.

144
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,079
I'll buy him.

145
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,353
Halt! Who goes there?

146
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,148
General.

147
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,227
My lady.

148
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,737
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

149
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,990
Thank the Army.
They protected me.

150
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,910
Mm.

151
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,621
Let me feed you.

152
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,358
Go.

153
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,443
To the wall.

154
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,540
The arena
is a sacred temple.

155
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,250
For the bravest of you,

156
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,211
the road to glory
runs through the arena.

157
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,338
The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

158
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,382
and gladiators into free men.

159
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,224
You have worms.

160
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,481
I know this one.
He eats monkeys.

161
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,040
Go. Sit. Eat.

162
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,726
You.

163
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,522
Hanno, get up.

164
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,573
What is your native language?
I speak them all.

165
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,372
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

166
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,667
Mm, all right.

167
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,546
Violence...
is the universal language.

168
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,298
Viggo,
put him through his paces.

169
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,344
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

170
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,332
Enough!

171
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,046
Very good.

172
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,924
Very good.

173
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,344
Hose him down.

174
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,557
Bring him to me.

175
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,857
Ah!

176
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,529
A strong jaw.

177
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,698
Good arms.

178
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,535
Better smell.

179
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,206
You will do well.

180
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,792
It is an art,

181
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
choosing gladiators.

182
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,422
Some choose entertainers.

183
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,591
Some choose brute force.

184
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,218
I choose rage.

185
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,141
Crowd loves blood.

186
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,017
And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

187
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,603
And you, my friend, rage

188
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,565
pours out of you like...

189
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,568
like milk...

190
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,487
from a whore's tit.

191
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,198
You will be
quite the fighter.

192
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,825
Not for you.

193
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,994
You're right,
you do not fight for me.

194
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,454
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

195
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,706
The choice is yours.

196
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,750
But whose head
could I give you

197
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,462
that would satisfy this fury?

198
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,464
The entire Roman Army's.

199
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,094
Too much.

200
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,804
Mm.

201
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,973
The general will do.

202
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,057
General?

203
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,436
-General Acacius?
-Mm.

204
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,232
Use your rage
in my service,

205
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:37,236
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

206
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,532
Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

207
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,369
and you will die.

208
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,124
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

209
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,001
rather than
fight their wars.

210
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,128
I've made my choice.

211
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,049
I can live with it.

212
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,097
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

213
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,019
Leta?

214
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,689
You may go to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

215
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,406
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

216
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,283
on that beach at Numidia...

217
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,454
Lucilla.

218
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,044
No more.

219
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,465
I will not waste

220
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,177
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

221
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,933
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

222
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,937
When will your troops
arrive?

223
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,023
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

224
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,152
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

225
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,197
All of them.

226
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,828
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

227
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:13,708
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

228
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:20,840
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

229
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,698
Enjoy yourself,
everyone,

230
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,742
to excess!

231
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,786
Thank you. Thank you.

232
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,091
Oh!

233
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,845
Please, drink.

234
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,848
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

235
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,769
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

236
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,022
-I'm just here for the games.
-Ah, well,

237
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,732
you won't be disappointed.

238
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,027
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

239
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,363
Men like me, Thraex?
Men like us.

240
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,991
I know nothing happens in Rome
unless you've tasted it first.

241
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,093
What is my purpose here?

242
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,677
You'll find out soon enough.

243
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,393
What's this we hear
about you being interested

244
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,230
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

245
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,816
Me? No, I'm, uh...

246
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,402
I don't even know how
to use an abacus.

247
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,278
But I do understand that

248
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,781
it's customary
for your guests

249
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,492
to make wagers
at these affairs?

250
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,869
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

251
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,914
A thousand gold denarii?

252
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,374
Two.

253
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,544
Two?

254
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,756
Denarii.

255
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,400
Stand back! Stand back!

256
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,445
My emperors.

257
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,615
Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
and senators.

258
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,076
For your entertainment,

259
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,037
the art of combat!

260
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,875
May I present

261
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,043
the barbarian versus,

262
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:07,298
from my own stable,
the mighty Vichek!

263
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,183
-This is your gladiator?
-It is.

264
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,147
Three rounds,
hand to hand.

265
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,857
Swords!

266
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,277
We want swords.
A fight to the death.

267
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,531
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

268
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,783
Fight now!

269
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,373
Brother,

270
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,210
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

271
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,152
Remarkable!

272
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,198
Remarkable!

273
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,410
Thraex, he looked expensive.

274
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,955
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

275
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,291
Remarkable.

276
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,380
From where do you hail?

277
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,387
Speak.

278
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,183
I said speak.

279
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,977
He is from the colonies,
Your Majesty.

280
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,479
His native tongue
is all he understands.

281
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,989
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

282
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:43,579
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

283
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,667
But...

284
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,796
to come back from hell

285
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,715
and view the cheerful skies,

286
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:59,428
in this the task
and mighty labor lies."

287
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,311
Virgil, Your Majesty.

288
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,355
Poetry!

289
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,402
-Very clever, Macrinus.
-Thank you.

290
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,989
I've grown so bored,
but you surprise me.

291
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,117
To amuse you is my only wish.

292
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,078
We are amused,
we are amused.

293
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,414
We are amused.

294
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,960
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

295
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,296
perform in the arena.

296
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,383
As do I, Your Majesties.

297
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,218
Thank you.

298
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,719
Viggo?

299
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,514
Come with me.

300
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,118
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

301
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,914
The lines you recited.

302
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,583
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

303
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,670
-A good verse travels far.
-Mm.

304
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,714
Who taught you poetry?

305
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,966
A captured Roman officer.

306
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,344
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

307
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,346
to pass the time.

308
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,473
And what became
of this prisoner?

309
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,100
Oh, we ate him.

310
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,436
As barbarians do.

311
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,896
As barbarians do.

312
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,982
And where were you born?

313
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,359
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

314
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,695
to die for you in the arena?

315
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,579
Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

316
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,375
A gladiator

317
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,044
can buy his own freedom.

318
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,922
His liberty.

319
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,508
The Roman dream.

320
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,635
No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

321
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,221
but of a slave
to call his own.

322
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,557
Cicero.

323
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,144
Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

324
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,398
What did you have to do
for Roman money?

325
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,193
You promised me a head.

326
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,154
Earn your keep and you
can have anyone's head.

327
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,138
Father,

328
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,766
protect us and guide us.

329
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,031
Senators.

330
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,866
My lady.

331
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,417
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

332
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,295
Better times will come.

333
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,882
And why are we here?

334
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,926
To take back the city.

335
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,348
And restore Rome
to where she should be.

336
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,643
An exciting venture.

337
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,355
-When?
-On the final day of the games.

338
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,025
My army waits for my command
at Ostia.

339
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,903
Five thousand soldiers
loyal to me...

340
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,699
will enter Rome
and then the Colosseum,

341
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,701
where they will
arrest the emperors

342
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,494
for their crimes
against the Senate

343
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,913
and their people.

344
00:47:55,789 --> 00:48:00,794
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

345
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,630
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

346
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,385
Marcus Aurelius talked of
restoring power to the Senate,

347
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,806
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

348
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,810
The people
have not seen hope

349
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,270
for many years.

350
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:22,024
But with time...
and guidance...

351
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,070
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

352
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,281
He had my loyalty.

353
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,993
And so do you.

354
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,747
Senator Thraex?

355
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,877
Politics follows power,
my lady.

356
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,048
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

357
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,092
and the Senate
will support you.

358
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,386
Thank you.

359
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,904
Food! Food!

360
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,869
When I was told of this place,

361
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,205
they never mentioned
the stink.

362
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,291
That would be Hanno.

363
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,464
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

364
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,806
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

365
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,727
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

366
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,562
Left in the hills to die.

367
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,693
That wolf found them and she
suckled them on her milk.

368
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,238
Raised by an animal.
It's in their blood.

369
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,241
How do you know this place?

370
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,411
I know the chaos
they brought.

371
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,373
This city infects
everything it touches.

372
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,542
I never dreamt
it would be so big.

373
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,377
Don't fall for it.

374
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,546
This city is diseased.

375
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,008
Food! Food!

376
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,200
You! Barbarian scum!

377
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,125
Help me.
Please, help me!

378
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,163
-Ah!
-Thraex.

379
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,959
About our wager.

380
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,795
Ah. The barbarian.

381
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,213
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

382
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,173
I was merely
going to suggest

383
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,217
that perhaps your luck
might change.

384
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,761
Shall we say
double or quits?

385
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,391
-Ah.
-Ah.

386
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,155
Get back!

387
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,963
Fresh meat.

388
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,885
Line up! Line up!

389
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,085
Play! Play!

390
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,603
Emperor Caracalla.

391
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,147
Emperor Geta.

392
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,858
Citizens of Rome!

393
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,863
These sacred games

394
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:23,200
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

395
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,369
over the barbarians of Numidia.

396
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,290
Go! Go!

397
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,588
And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

398
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,882
General Justus Acacius!

399
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,635
Long live Acacius!

400
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,178
And with him

401
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:47,974
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

402
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,355
-Lucilla!
-Mother of Rome!

403
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,649
Acacius.

404
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,359
General.

405
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,286
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

406
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,500
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

407
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,418
Speak to them.

408
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,004
Speak to us!

409
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,974
I am not an orator

410
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,684
or a politician.

411
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,603
I am a soldier.

412
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:41,278
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

413
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,822
And even once in this arena.

414
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,075
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

415
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,371
ask for that same bravery.

416
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,792
Because Rome needs it now.

417
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,674
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

418
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,052
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

419
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,109
From the South Gate,

420
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:26,323
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

421
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,795
From the stables

422
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,466
of Emperors Caracalla
and Geta themselves,

423
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,135
the undefeated champion:

424
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,889
Glyceo the Destroyer!

425
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,438
Hold.

426
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,213
Hold.

427
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,132
Hail Caesars!

428
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:31,096
Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

429
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,944
Hold together and when it
charges, break for the wall.

430
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:46,986
Why should I?

431
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,117
Hold!

432
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,327
Hold!

433
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,370
Break!

434
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,747
Cowards!

435
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,888
To the wall!

436
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,818
Come on!

437
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,132
Brother, it's that poet,
is it not?

438
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,843
I can't remember.

439
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,720
That night was a blur.

440
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,683
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

441
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,852
Smooth the desc--"
I forget.

442
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,771
"Smooth the descent..."

443
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,649
"Smooth is the descent,

444
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,901
easy is the way."

445
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,618
Shield!

446
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,325
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

447
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,369
Blood.

448
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,540
Lucilla,

449
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,459
shall we show mercy?

450
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,252
Mercy.

451
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,519
No mercy!

452
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,480
Your life has been
spared by the gods--

453
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:54,692
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

454
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:14,128
Kill! Kill! Kill!

455
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,465
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:33,940
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

457
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,721
The road to freedom doesn't
run through the arena.

458
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,056
It leads to this.

459
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,479
Go to your cells.

460
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,903
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

461
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,172
Come on, let's go.

462
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,646
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

463
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,232
Smooth is the descent...

464
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,318
...easy is the way."

465
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,741
There, there, there, there.

466
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,159
And I've got you.

467
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,953
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

468
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,558
Scatto and Argento.

469
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,657
Lucius is safe?

470
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,551
Lucius!

471
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,065
Lucius,

472
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:24,193
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

473
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,196
There are men
who want to kill you

474
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,823
so they can take power.

475
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,661
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

476
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:37,373
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

477
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,917
I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

478
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,003
And for the sake of Rome.

479
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,589
Remember who you are.

480
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,632
And that I love you.

481
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,718
I love you.

482
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,678
Come.

483
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,308
Give me your leg.

484
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,811
Go. Go!

485
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,069
So...

486
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,824
What's your name?

487
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,204
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

488
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,876
Because... more men die
of infected wounds

489
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,587
than out there, in the arena.

490
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,758
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and

491
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,552
it is going to hurt.

492
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,803
Mm.

493
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,015
This is Devil's Breath
and opium.

494
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,184
It's for the pain.

495
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,853
You should breathe in.

496
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,277
I've been here
so long now,

497
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,821
I don't even notice anymore.

498
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,741
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

499
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:57,453
-Where'd you learn your trade?
-Why do you ask?

500
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,288
You've got a heavy hand.

501
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,083
I used to be
a gladiator myself.

502
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,542
Ah.

503
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,753
And would you have bested me?

504
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,421
In your prime, of course.

505
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,217
In your current state,
I could best you now.

506
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,222
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

507
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,516
So now I spend my days

508
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,185
saving lives
instead of taking them.

509
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,272
And why such a change
so late in life?

510
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,275
What we do in life

511
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,820
echoes in eternity.

512
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,117
I feel like
I know those words.

513
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,744
I can't take credit.

514
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,414
It's written on
one of the tombs.

515
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,166
Over the bones of a gladiator.

516
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,584
My champion!

517
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,878
I smell Devil's Breath!

518
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,759
My... champion.

519
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,470
Did you hear that crowd?

520
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,684
-Did you hear that crowd?
-Mm-hm.

521
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,730
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

522
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,775
-Did you now?
-Yes. The Greeks call it...

523
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,028
thymos.

524
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,529
Smoke.

525
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,614
Rage.

526
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,659
That rage is your gift.

527
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,079
Like the great Achilles.

528
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,498
Never let it go.

529
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,460
It will carry you
to greatness,

530
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,420
my champion.

531
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,858
Thank you

532
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,902
for inviting me.

533
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,071
This is truly an honor.

534
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,994
I hear you are
the talk of the court.

535
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,414
Yes.

536
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,750
We've met before.

537
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,503
-Have we?
-Long ago.

538
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,464
Where?

539
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,466
I was in the service
of your father's army

540
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,676
on his African campaign.

541
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,930
You served
with my father?

542
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,768
Mm.

543
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,479
I had the privilege

544
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,023
of reading
his "Meditations."

545
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,441
Mm.

546
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,363
"The best revenge

547
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:41,742
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

548
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,497
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

549
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:51,710
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

550
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,881
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

551
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,050
I do it for the love
of the sport.

552
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,220
And where did you find
these gladiators?

553
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,974
They're usually
prisoners of war.

554
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,311
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

555
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,231
A man can choose to fight...

556
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,693
and stay alive.

557
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,988
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

558
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,033
Who is this?

559
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,578
That is my father
as a youth.

560
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,957
She had a child?

561
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,792
Mm.

562
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,295
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

563
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,172
-the boy disappeared.
-Mm.

564
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,340
-But who would care?
-Lucilla would care.

565
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,177
-More wine!
-More wine!

566
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,015
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

567
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,976
And his father?

568
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:53,814
Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

569
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,691
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

570
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:56,859
She was 14.

571
01:09:56,942 --> 01:10:00,321
-Mm.
-Females were not his taste.

572
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,780
-Nor mine, some days.
-Nor yours!

573
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:07,661
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see, she took lovers.

574
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:11,999
And by rumor, the real father...
was Commodus.

575
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,336
-Brotherly love, you see?
-Yeah.

576
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,171
If he died,

577
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,549
-there has to be remains.
-Mm.

578
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,969
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

579
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,138
Um, well,
let's work it out.

580
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,642
-He was about 12 when he died?
-Yes.

581
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:34,104
So that would make him...

582
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,599
My lady.

583
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,101
Gracchus.

584
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,104
-Please come.
-Thank you.

585
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,291
Gladiator...

586
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,793
do you know me?

587
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,553
Do you have a family?

588
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,309
A wife. Arishat.

589
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,186
Arishat.

590
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,606
She was killed
under your husband's command.

591
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,403
Rome drowns
in its own blood.

592
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,905
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

593
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,076
There is much
you do not understand.

594
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:18,917
Lucius.

595
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,086
I do not know
who you think I am.

596
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,299
My name is Hanno,

597
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,926
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

598
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,560
I'm so sorry.

599
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:38,771
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

600
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,773
not to grieve him.

601
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,608
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

602
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,777
That boy is dead.

603
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,281
You may think
I have little worth.

604
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,951
You may think
I betrayed you.

605
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,705
But I need you to know...

606
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,001
if you will not have
your mother's love,

607
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,046
then take
your father's strength.

608
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,632
You need it.

609
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:13,138
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

610
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:15,933
And I see him in you.

611
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,476
Get out.

612
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,064
My lady, we must go at once!

613
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:27,861
Lucius, you were loved

614
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,115
by myself
and by your father.

615
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,784
Your name
was on his lips--

616
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,744
Get out!

617
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,689
Lucius is alive.

618
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,776
Are you certain?

619
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,236
Yes.

620
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,530
I know my son.

621
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,452
I spoke to him
tonight.

622
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,916
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

623
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,836
but he lives.

624
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,590
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

625
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:31,258
Most fighters won't survive.

626
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,801
Acacius,

627
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:35,679
you must help him.

628
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,390
-Help him?
-Yes.

629
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,395
I failed him then.

630
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,481
I know I did.

631
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,401
I cannot fail him now.

632
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,405
The army is in Ostia.

633
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,283
If we wait a few days...

634
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,494
He could be dead
by then.

635
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,788
Acacius,

636
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:05,584
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

637
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,171
but I will not
give my son's.

638
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,638
And one.

639
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,182
And two.

640
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,976
And one.

641
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,021
Together.
Timing, timing, timing!

642
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,359
And one. And two.

643
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,903
And one.

644
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,988
Pause, pause!

645
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,034
We won't get far
like this.

646
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,121
Just him. You go.

647
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,915
Go!

648
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:48,585
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

649
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,713
Ready?

650
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,131
One!

651
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:54,883
And two!

652
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,135
Timing, timing!

653
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,221
Come on, more!

654
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,061
More!

655
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,079
Leave him.

656
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,476
It's just
vinegar, my friend.

657
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,981
There will be
no more opium for you.

658
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:55,902
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

659
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:59,448
I don't know why you are so
greedy for it in this one.

660
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,537
Are you a free man, Ravi?

661
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,539
"Free."

662
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,585
I am. Mm.

663
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,211
I laid down my sword

664
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,297
and I swore never
to pick it up again.

665
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,965
And yet
you choose this hell?

666
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,675
Mm-hm.

667
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,177
What was your home before?

668
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,763
Varanasi.

669
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,140
And why don't you go back?

670
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,683
I wish I could.

671
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,560
But...

672
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,148
-I met a woman.
-Ah.

673
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,360
-It's always a woman.
-Always.

674
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:40,405
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

675
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,324
So now...

676
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,369
our sons,
they speak only Latin.

677
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,871
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

678
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,167
We are Romans now.

679
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:56,004
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

680
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,509
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

681
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,765
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

682
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:10,852
or it would vanish.

683
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,146
So,

684
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,898
what was this dream?

685
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:19,611
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

686
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,447
A Rome of the Senate.

687
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,617
A Rome of hope.

688
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,999
Your grandfather,
he sounds like a dangerous man.

689
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,376
Hm.

690
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,256
The odds are against you.

691
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,635
The odds
are always against me.

692
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:45,721
Don't worry, old man.

693
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,639
Eh?

694
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,353
-You should get some rest. Hm?
-Mm.

695
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:56,898
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

696
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,958
This is about survival.

697
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:17,335
Survive!

698
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:21,214
In the name of Poseidon,

699
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:25,469
we celebrate the glory
of naval war.

700
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,304
They have archers.

701
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:29,848
Be ready.
Listen for my commands.

702
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,684
Stay together
and pull as one, yes?

703
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:33,643
Yes!

704
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,146
-Yes?
-Yes!

705
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,655
Today we relive

706
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:49,284
the Battle of Salamis!

707
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:55,207
The Trojans
versus the Persians!

708
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,338
-Oars out!
-Oars!

709
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:04,132
And... pull!

710
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,779
Archers!

711
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:26,863
Archers!

712
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,033
Pull!

713
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,585
Pull!

714
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,422
Pull!

715
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:00,063
Pull! To my time!

716
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,107
And... now!

717
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,028
Left side! Ready, and

718
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,072
ship oars now!

719
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,324
Oars in! Oars in!

720
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:13,702
Get down!

721
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,763
And pull! And pull!

722
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:38,727
Don't stop!

723
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,230
Pull!

724
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,318
And right!

725
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,325
Ready to ram!

726
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:58,079
And brace! Brace!

727
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,579
Everyone regroup!

728
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:17,867
Praetorians!

729
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,621
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

730
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:22,664
Move, move.

731
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,757
In the name of the emperors...

732
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:37,512
the victor is Hanno!

733
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,109
Who did this?

734
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,072
Who did this?!

735
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:58,867
-It was me!
-I did it!

736
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,910
-I did it! I did it! I did it!
-It was me!

737
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:07,584
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

738
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:09,794
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

739
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,379
you learned to recite poetry?

740
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:12,630
Be glad it wasn't me,

741
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,090
or that arrow
would have found you.

742
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,441
Be seated.

743
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,361
I have news for you.

744
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,326
He's here, sir.

745
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:46,456
Oh, still here.

746
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:49,959
Macrinus.

747
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,253
Welcome.

748
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,049
Yes, I'm listening.

749
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:58,718
You know
this is my house now.

750
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:01,137
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

751
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,597
You know that.

752
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,308
I have other things. Uh...

753
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,185
Cattle. Art!

754
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,895
Truth, then.

755
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,563
What do you... want?

756
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,316
Truth.
That's what I want.

757
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:17,946
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

758
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:21,116
You have
the senators' trust.

759
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,077
You have
Lucilla's trust.

760
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,955
More importantly,
you have my trust.

761
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:32,877
You wish my... loyalty?

762
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,712
I own...

763
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,924
your house.

764
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,718
I want your loyalty.

765
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,890
I...

766
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,810
-Tell me.
-I have heard...

767
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:51,646
of a plot...

768
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:55,150
-to dethrone the emperors.
-Yes.

769
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,694
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

770
01:25:57,777 --> 01:26:00,947
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

771
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,448
-Tonight.
-Mm.

772
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,743
-I don't know why.
-I know why. I know who.

773
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:09,205
Pack.

774
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,377
Quickly.

775
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:43,364
Open up!

776
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,470
Open for
the emperors' guard!

777
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:36,501
My Lady, come with us.

778
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:24,007
Thanks to the civic virtue

779
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,801
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

780
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,804
your insurrection

781
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,473
has been revealed.

782
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,685
The honor,

783
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:40,648
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

784
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,112
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

785
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:48,239
Please, Emperor Geta.

786
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,783
Torture me if you want,

787
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:52,994
but do not lecture me.

788
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:56,622
Your name
will be forgotten!

789
01:28:57,623 --> 01:29:00,752
Lost... to history.

790
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,047
You are damned,
General.

791
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,801
-You laugh.
-You damn me?

792
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,554
I don't care.

793
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:15,183
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

794
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,976
Why wait?

795
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:20,271
-I will gut him right now!
-No, no, no!

796
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,649
Let them be. Come! Come!

797
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,568
His death must be public.

798
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:27,153
Public?

799
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:30,114
Hang his entrails
from the city gates!

800
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,866
And crucify her!

801
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:33,993
Crucify her!

802
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:35,995
Take them away!

803
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,540
Shh! Shh! Shh!

804
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:53,846
Thank you, Macrinus.

805
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,521
Come on.

806
01:30:04,857 --> 01:30:06,734
In these last days,

807
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:10,071
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

808
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:12,365
but as a true friend.

809
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:14,117
Thank you.

810
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,869
Thank you so much.
But as a friend,

811
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,705
I must counsel caution.

812
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:22,875
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

813
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:27,130
Crucifixion
is for thieves.

814
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:28,423
Christians.

815
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:32,468
-It's too common.
-He is a traitor. He must die.

816
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:33,928
I agree.

817
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:39,851
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

818
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,859
Let the gods decide.

819
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:54,699
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

820
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,119
This time,
for the first time,

821
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,787
I was crossing it.

822
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:02,165
Hm.

823
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,750
Well, you know,
where I come from,

824
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:07,837
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

825
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,923
Represents... salvation.

826
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:14,093
Where I come from,
it means you're already dead.

827
01:31:22,351 --> 01:31:24,979
But as I saw it,
I was not afraid.

828
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,274
For...

829
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:31,319
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

830
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,697
There.

831
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,501
Who is this man?

832
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,295
Scratched out?

833
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,256
Maximus.

834
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,011
I saw him fight once.

835
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,555
-He was magnificent.
-Mm.

836
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,600
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

837
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:06,979
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

838
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,357
Spoke of him.

839
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,776
What he did.

840
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,861
I met him once.

841
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:17,198
He was kind.

842
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:21,369
He bowed to no one.

843
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,415
Come with me.

844
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:29,627
-Hmm?
-Come. With me.

845
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:52,817
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

846
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:57,405
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

847
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,882
This is Argento.

848
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,593
This is Scatto.

849
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,635
Cheers.

850
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:02,720
And stop.

851
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:08,351
For his treason
against the lives

852
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:12,521
of the emperors
and the Roman state,

853
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,067
General Justus Acacius,

854
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,363
an enemy of the people!

855
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,948
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

856
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,493
-We love you, Acacius!
-You are a hero!

857
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:29,789
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

858
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,906
-Vae victis.
-General.

859
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:27,972
Acacius!

860
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:33,310
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

861
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:43,404
From the
vanquished city of Numidia,

862
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:49,744
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

863
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:52,455
Go now. Vae victis.

864
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:59,545
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

865
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:01,964
Hanno!

866
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:04,842
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

867
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,635
-I will give it to you!
-It's too late.

868
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,014
The Roman traitor or

869
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:12,475
the barbarian hero.

870
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:14,935
Let the gods decide.

871
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,812
Lucius... wait.

872
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,440
Wait! Wait!

873
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:32,244
I am a vessel.

874
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,831
Fill me with vengeance

875
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:39,043
and vanquish the betrayer.

876
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:59,146
-We love you, Acacius!
-Move it!

877
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,819
Pick it up!

878
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:07,279
Bravo, Hanno!

879
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:08,823
We love you, Acacius!

880
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:09,907
What are you waiting for?

881
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,033
You will die!

882
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:43,399
I know who you are.

883
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,236
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

884
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:02,543
Acacius
has raised his hand!

885
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,796
He has surrendered.

886
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:15,431
Let the gods decide.

887
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,868
The gods have rendered
their judgment.

888
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,497
Do what you must.

889
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:44,001
But on my death,
you have to know...

890
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,796
I love your mother,
Lucilla.

891
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,633
And your father...

892
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:54,428
Maximus.

893
01:38:55,638 --> 01:38:57,806
I would have died
for him.

894
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,767
Kill him!

895
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,645
Let him live!
Please!

896
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,815
Live! Live! Live! Live!

897
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:15,491
Kill him!

898
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,327
Kill him!

899
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,662
Archers!

900
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,580
-No!
-Kill him!

901
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:24,208
Acacius! Acacius!

902
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,001
Kill him!

903
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:27,503
Kill him!

904
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:29,046
Kill him! Kill him!

905
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:32,633
Acacius!

906
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:43,769
No!

907
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,813
No!

908
01:39:45,896 --> 01:39:47,606
Acacius!

909
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,069
Damn you!

910
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,948
Death will be
too good for you!

911
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,665
Is this how Rome
treats its heroes?

912
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:10,170
Tell me!

913
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:16,760
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

914
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:21,890
The gods have spoken!

915
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,575
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

916
01:40:54,923 --> 01:40:58,052
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

917
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,605
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

918
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:21,700
Stay back! Stay back!

919
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:14,336
Arishat!

920
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,438
We had a bargain.

921
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:40,279
I gave him to you.
You let him live.

922
01:42:40,362 --> 01:42:42,030
And you got
what you wanted.

923
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,741
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

924
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:47,786
You bought a gladiator,
not a slave.

925
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,290
My will is my own.

926
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,835
Ah...

927
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:57,588
How blue is your blood?

928
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,257
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

929
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,676
beats in that chest.

930
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:11,143
The greatest temple
Rome ever built.

931
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:12,769
The Colosseum.

932
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:15,189
Because this is
what they believe in.

933
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:16,899
Power.

934
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:19,693
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

935
01:43:19,776 --> 01:43:21,612
-There has to be something else.
-There is nothing else.

936
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,615
-There has to be another Rome.
-There is no other Rome.

937
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,618
-The "dream"?
-Mm.

938
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,620
The dream of Rome?

939
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,330
It's an old man's fantasy.

940
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,499
Who are you?

941
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:40,589
What was your name before you
traded it for a Roman one?

942
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:43,091
You'll never know.

943
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,512
I have a destiny.

944
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:53,352
The gods delivered you to me.

945
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:57,981
You will be my instrument.

946
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:01,485
I will never be your instrument,
in this life or the next.

947
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,955
That will not be my destiny.

948
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:16,541
But I will see your end.

949
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:39,439
What else could I do?

950
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,316
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

951
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:44,069
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

952
01:44:44,152 --> 01:44:46,196
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

953
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,031
-Like they have every other.
-You brought this on us.

954
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,659
Filthy ape!

955
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,957
Perhaps you should, uh,

956
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,503
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

957
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:13,348
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

958
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:16,685
The disease
that infects his loins

959
01:45:16,768 --> 01:45:18,729
has spread to his brain.

960
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:21,940
-Every day he gets worse.
-I will reason with him.

961
01:45:38,206 --> 01:45:41,335
I see you.

962
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,545
I see you.

963
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:47,049
Caracalla, Caracalla!

964
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,759
Come on, stand up.

965
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,927
Get up, get up.
Not you.

966
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:52,888
All right,
there you go.

967
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:56,850
Now, listen to me.

968
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:58,518
What's the matter?

969
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:01,271
Nothing's ever mine.

970
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:03,690
Everything is ours,
always.

971
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:07,069
Even in the womb...
he tried...

972
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:11,156
to cut my umbilicus

973
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:13,075
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

974
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,452
-You remember that, do you?
-Certainly.

975
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,871
-Come, sit.
-One cannot forget.

976
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:20,207
My conscience compels me.

977
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:21,750
What?

978
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:23,043
Sit.

979
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:24,586
Your brother

980
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:26,963
means to blame you

981
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,300
in front of
the entire Senate...

982
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:31,760
But I did not do it!

983
01:46:31,843 --> 01:46:33,428
...for what's happening
in the streets.

984
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:35,889
-The chaos!
-He's lying!

985
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:37,808
No testimony
can be more damning

986
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:41,353
than one brother
against another.

987
01:46:41,436 --> 01:46:44,106
That's a lie!
He always lies!

988
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:46,650
He can be very persuasive.

989
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:49,444
So?
What will they do to me?

990
01:46:49,528 --> 01:46:52,322
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

991
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:54,533
What will they do to Dondus?

992
01:46:57,577 --> 01:47:00,414
What will they do

993
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:01,873
to Dondus?

994
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,627
It's your decision.

995
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:44,332
Brother.

996
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:49,671
Put down the blade.

997
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:50,881
You lie.

998
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:52,757
-Give it to me.
-You always lie!

999
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:53,800
Give it--

1000
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,973
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1001
01:48:00,056 --> 01:48:02,476
-Lie!
-Listen to me. Break the spell.

1002
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:04,561
-Lie!
-Break the spell!

1003
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,898
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

1004
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,609
Come back. Help me.

1005
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,633
Lucius.

1006
01:48:56,279 --> 01:48:58,907
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

1007
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:02,911
And yet here we are.

1008
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:06,248
Everything has
brought us full circle.

1009
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:09,417
You sent me away
and yet fate

1010
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:12,087
brought me back to the
very ground where he died.

1011
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:16,091
This ring...

1012
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:19,678
belonged to my father.

1013
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,726
He gave it to your
father, Maximus,

1014
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,770
as a token of trust.

1015
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,149
I gave it to Acacius
for his valor.

1016
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:39,864
This ring belonged to my wife.

1017
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:44,327
I shall wear it next to yours.

1018
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:01,052
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1019
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:05,056
I could not see the man.

1020
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:09,227
He was a soldier of Rome.

1021
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:12,564
There was a plan.

1022
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:15,150
He was readying troops
at Ostia

1023
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:18,278
under the command
of Darius Sextus.

1024
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:21,489
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

1025
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:27,912
Acacius. Maximus.
Marcus Aurelius.

1026
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:31,416
They lived and died
for Rome.

1027
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:33,585
We all do.

1028
01:50:35,545 --> 01:50:38,006
Is it true
they intend to kill you?

1029
01:50:40,884 --> 01:50:42,927
One man or another has had
a sword against my neck

1030
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:45,430
since the day
my father died.

1031
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:50,644
But now
that I've found you,

1032
01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:53,271
it doesn't matter.

1033
01:50:54,564 --> 01:50:56,316
I am not afraid.

1034
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:59,569
I've become well versed in
losing the things that I love.

1035
01:51:02,322 --> 01:51:03,573
But now that I've found you,

1036
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:05,450
I have no desire
to lose you again.

1037
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:10,830
-You stand like him.
-Mm.

1038
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:12,957
Alert.

1039
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,959
Proud.

1040
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:19,756
I do not have his strength.

1041
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,801
I wish that were true.

1042
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:27,263
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

1043
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:37,232
Go now.

1044
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:46,700
Strength and honor.

1045
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,870
Strength and honor.

1046
01:52:03,425 --> 01:52:05,552
As Emperor,

1047
01:52:05,635 --> 01:52:07,345
I have convened

1048
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:11,474
the Senate to appoint
my First Consul

1049
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:14,894
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

1050
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:18,314
and civic functions
of the Empire.

1051
01:52:22,068 --> 01:52:23,528
I name...

1052
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:27,031
Citizen Dondus!

1053
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,749
Hail Dondus!

1054
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:40,670
Hail Dondus!

1055
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:45,300
-Hail Dondus.
-Hail Dondus!

1056
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:47,969
Hail Dondus!

1057
01:52:52,098 --> 01:52:54,058
As Second Consul...

1058
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:57,479
I name...

1059
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:01,149
Citizen...

1060
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:04,861
Macrinus!

1061
01:53:07,155 --> 01:53:08,865
Hail Macrinus!

1062
01:53:08,948 --> 01:53:10,450
Hail Macrinus!

1063
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:12,535
Hail Macrinus!

1064
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:16,873
There will be a triumphal
parade to celebrate.

1065
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:18,583
There will be games

1066
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,252
and mass executions.

1067
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:27,175
Long live the Empire!

1068
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:30,428
Long live the Empire!

1069
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:32,263
Long live the Empire!

1070
01:53:38,561 --> 01:53:39,854
Sit down.

1071
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:45,944
I happen to have...

1072
01:53:49,405 --> 01:53:53,201
with good fortune
and not a little skill...

1073
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,081
the remaining emperor's ear.

1074
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:07,549
I can speak logic to it...

1075
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:14,806
and tame the madness
in the street. But...

1076
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:19,394
to restore order...

1077
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:23,314
I must have power...

1078
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,070
and command

1079
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,739
over the Praetorian Army.

1080
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:39,372
Ballot...

1081
01:54:41,457 --> 01:54:42,917
or hand?

1082
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:47,589
-Aye!
-Aye!

1083
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,510
Your humble servant.

1084
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,182
Put your hands down.

1085
01:55:00,768 --> 01:55:02,353
You can sit down.

1086
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:17,535
Rome must fall.

1087
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:22,290
I need only
give it a push.

1088
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:27,545
And after Rome falls...

1089
01:55:28,379 --> 01:55:30,882
...what then?

1090
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:35,053
You are
your father's child.

1091
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,433
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

1092
01:55:40,516 --> 01:55:42,560
It was a fiction.

1093
01:55:42,644 --> 01:55:44,938
"The best revenge is

1094
01:55:45,021 --> 01:55:48,900
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1095
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:53,988
I have made myself
unlike your father.

1096
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:57,617
He spoke of dreams,
I speak of truth.

1097
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:00,244
And the only truth
in my Rome

1098
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:03,831
is the law
of the strongest.

1099
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:07,502
I was owned

1100
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:10,505
by an emperor.

1101
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:15,593
Now I control an empire.

1102
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:19,931
Where else but in Rome
can a man do that?

1103
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:29,732
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

1104
01:56:34,445 --> 01:56:35,863
If there is anything

1105
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:37,949
you need...

1106
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:41,369
in these last hours,

1107
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:44,038
we will provide.

1108
01:56:49,627 --> 01:56:52,463
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

1109
01:56:54,257 --> 01:56:57,260
Tomorrow
there will be games.

1110
01:56:57,343 --> 01:56:59,053
And at them...

1111
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,639
I will prevail.

1112
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:16,779
Ravi!

1113
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:25,538
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

1114
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:27,373
What is in Ostia?

1115
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,000
There is an army.

1116
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:32,837
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

1117
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:35,173
in the service
of something greater.

1118
01:57:37,967 --> 01:57:39,469
Ride to Ostia.

1119
01:57:40,636 --> 01:57:42,764
Take this ring
to General Darius Sextus.

1120
01:57:42,847 --> 01:57:44,348
Are you listening?

1121
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:47,560
Darius Sextus.

1122
01:57:47,643 --> 01:57:49,771
He will know it
as Acacius's ring.

1123
01:57:52,607 --> 01:57:54,859
And, uh,

1124
01:57:55,651 --> 01:57:57,111
who shall I say has

1125
01:57:57,695 --> 01:57:59,489
sent me with this ring?

1126
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:05,203
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1127
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:07,955
The Prince of Rome.

1128
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:10,583
Tell him
I am summoning the army

1129
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:13,044
to the defense
of a new Republic.

1130
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:22,845
-Should I trust you?
-Yes.

1131
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:25,098
-Should I?
-Yes.

1132
01:58:31,896 --> 01:58:34,690
Ravi! I need your keys.

1133
01:58:40,696 --> 01:58:42,490
Thank you.

1134
01:59:20,236 --> 01:59:22,780
Stop! Come back!

1135
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:54,687
Who gave you this?

1136
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,815
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1137
01:59:58,941 --> 02:00:00,276
The Prince of Rome.

1138
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:56,499
Must we kill Lucilla?

1139
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,879
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1140
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:04,799
Ever.

1141
02:01:15,559 --> 02:01:18,187
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1142
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,856
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1143
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,441
I shall deliver them
Caracalla's head

1144
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:23,943
and the people
shall acclaim me.

1145
02:01:24,026 --> 02:01:27,738
That, my friend,
is politics.

1146
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:32,410
-Shall we?
-Yes.

1147
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,760
Today will be
your last fight, champion.

1148
02:01:50,761 --> 02:01:52,513
And our master
has bestowed on you...

1149
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:57,268
the wooden sword of freedom.

1150
02:02:01,147 --> 02:02:03,190
But you have to
earn it first.

1151
02:02:03,274 --> 02:02:05,735
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

1152
02:02:28,549 --> 02:02:31,510
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

1153
02:02:58,662 --> 02:03:00,289
Wait for me.

1154
02:03:19,016 --> 02:03:20,768
In honor

1155
02:03:20,851 --> 02:03:25,189
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

1156
02:03:25,272 --> 02:03:31,237
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1157
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:35,866
and as punishment for her
conspiracy against the empire,

1158
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:40,454
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1159
02:03:40,538 --> 02:03:42,790
and for fomenting
military mutiny

1160
02:03:42,873 --> 02:03:44,375
along with her husband,

1161
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:48,129
the queen will face
divine justice

1162
02:03:48,212 --> 02:03:52,425
at the hands
of the Praetorian Guard.

1163
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:18,409
I am not a general.

1164
02:04:19,994 --> 02:04:23,622
But we are all soldiers.

1165
02:04:25,499 --> 02:04:27,293
And up until now,

1166
02:04:27,376 --> 02:04:31,672
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1167
02:04:31,755 --> 02:04:33,716
What will you
have us do?

1168
02:04:34,925 --> 02:04:36,177
Well, you can return
to your cells

1169
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,304
if you do not wish
to fight this battle.

1170
02:04:38,387 --> 02:04:40,806
Or...

1171
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:43,893
you can join me.

1172
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,480
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1173
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:49,148
Aye!

1174
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:53,527
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1175
02:04:55,112 --> 02:04:56,739
In this Rome

1176
02:04:57,531 --> 02:04:59,700
I no longer believe
that exists.

1177
02:04:59,783 --> 02:05:01,785
We must find it!

1178
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:05,831
And know this:

1179
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:10,920
Where death is, we are not.

1180
02:05:12,796 --> 02:05:14,840
Where we are,

1181
02:05:15,466 --> 02:05:17,301
death is not!

1182
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:21,597
By my sword.

1183
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:25,142
Strength and honor.

1184
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:27,186
Strength and honor!

1185
02:05:27,269 --> 02:05:28,938
Strength and honor!

1186
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:30,981
Strength and honor!

1187
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:57,716
Let it not be said

1188
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:00,928
that the emperor
is not merciful.

1189
02:06:01,011 --> 02:06:06,517
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1190
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:10,396
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

1191
02:06:20,364 --> 02:06:24,368
The champion, Hanno!

1192
02:06:28,205 --> 02:06:31,834
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1193
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:39,193
Yes!

1194
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,240
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

1195
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:49,161
This is war! Real war!

1196
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:57,503
The army of Acacius is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1197
02:08:00,047 --> 02:08:01,507
We can still
outflank them.

1198
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:04,051
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

1199
02:08:05,302 --> 02:08:06,804
How many are we?

1200
02:08:06,887 --> 02:08:08,263
Six thousand.
Perhaps more.

1201
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:10,015
Ride to the gate
and hold them.

1202
02:09:01,775 --> 02:09:02,943
Filthy scum!

1203
02:09:16,707 --> 02:09:18,333
Lucius!

1204
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:21,170
Give me the bow.

1205
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:47,404
Go, my son. Lucius--

1206
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:48,614
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1207
02:09:48,697 --> 02:09:50,157
Horse!

1208
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:25,002
Will nothing
kill this barbarian?

1209
02:11:25,085 --> 02:11:27,629
My name is
Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1210
02:11:27,713 --> 02:11:30,090
A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1211
02:11:30,173 --> 02:11:32,926
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1212
02:11:33,010 --> 02:11:34,845
Are you such a man
as this?

1213
02:11:34,928 --> 02:11:36,388
I don't fight for power.

1214
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:39,224
I fight to free Rome
from men like you

1215
02:11:39,308 --> 02:11:40,809
and to return it to them.

1216
02:11:40,893 --> 02:11:43,729
The gods themselves
want Rome reborn.

1217
02:11:43,812 --> 02:11:46,773
They sent me...
to fulfill that task.

1218
02:11:46,857 --> 02:11:50,444
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1219
02:11:50,527 --> 02:11:51,653
Huh?

1220
02:11:52,696 --> 02:11:54,990
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1221
02:12:30,984 --> 02:12:33,320
Hah!

1222
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:04,685
Strength and honor,

1223
02:13:05,185 --> 02:13:06,812
my son.

1224
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:41,907
You look to me to speak.

1225
02:14:43,992 --> 02:14:45,702
I know not what
to say other than

1226
02:14:45,786 --> 02:14:47,913
we have all known
too much death.

1227
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:52,667
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1228
02:14:56,505 --> 02:14:59,049
My grandfather,
Marcus Aurelius,

1229
02:14:59,132 --> 02:15:02,094
talked of a dream
that would be Rome.

1230
02:15:03,011 --> 02:15:05,013
A dream that my father,

1231
02:15:06,139 --> 02:15:08,975
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1232
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:10,685
died for.

1233
02:15:11,812 --> 02:15:13,522
An ideal.

1234
02:15:16,149 --> 02:15:20,529
A city for the many and a
refuge for those in need.

1235
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:23,198
A home worth fighting for.

1236
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:28,620
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1237
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,541
That dream is lost.

1238
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:40,132
But dare we...

1239
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,302
rebuild that dream
together?

1240
02:15:56,106 --> 02:15:57,983
What say you?

1241
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:06,199
Aye!

1242
02:16:07,242 --> 02:16:08,660
Aye!

1243
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:10,537
Aye!

1244
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:15,083
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1245
02:17:19,689 --> 02:17:20,982
Mother.

1246
02:18:13,451 --> 02:18:15,745
Speak to me, Father.
