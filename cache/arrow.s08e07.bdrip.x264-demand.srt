1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,230
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,714
- need your help, Roy.
-You really think

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,632
an energy weapon's
gonna stop this Monitor guy?

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,679
We got the plutonium
with an assist from Roy.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,989
You're working with the Monitor.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,549
Mar Novu is trying to save
worlds, not destroy them.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,835
1 didn't want to believe it.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,835
The only way to win is
to accept the inevitable.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,035
Where the hell are we?

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,829
We're on Lian Yu.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,037
The name of the island
they found me on is Lian Yu.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,434
It's Mandarin for "purgatory."

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,638
Now I understand why.

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,711
The memories, the pain,
I've never escaped them.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,469
They're always with me,

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,718
a reminder of what
I had to endure

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,077
with only one
thought, one goal--

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,155
survive.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,399
To save the multiverse, I
must become something else.

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,639
To do that, I have to return
to where my journey began...

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,439
purgatory.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,831
So this is the famous Lian Yu.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,350
I did not want a return
ticket to this place.

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,759
The three of you were supposed
to be safe and sound in Star City.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,310
How'd you get here?

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,879
A bunch of guys in tac gear came

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,075
and stormed the bunker.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,469
AR.G.U.S. agents.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,717
Sounds just as
fun as tranq darts.

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,632
I'm sorry about that.
I needed you here,

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,234
and I didn't have
time to convince you.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,430
What the hell's going on, Lyla?

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,999
Mar Novu needs
us to build a weapon,

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,514
and it has to be
done on this island.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,034
I'm not doing
anything for that guy.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,359
No, we have to.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,198
Since when do we take
orders from the enemy?

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,476
We were wrong about Novu, John.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,710
He's not our enemy.

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,870
Since when?

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,593
He dropped me in
an alternate reality

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,675
in order to teach
me the lesson that

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,995
to fix the multiverse

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,069
we need to work with him.

45
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,790
This is crazy.

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,189
I know it's hard
to hear, Johnny,

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,475
but it's the truth.

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,030
John...

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,350
Um...

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,550
how do we build the weapon?

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,353
The materials we
need are already here

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,709
in the crates outside.

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
Dr. Wong has been experimenting

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,391
with the dwarf star particles
since leaving Hong Kong.

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,198
He's designed
schematics for the build.

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,357
Schematics? Why
does that make me think

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,591
that this Dr. Wong guy
won't actually build this thing?

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,875
We're counting on you for that.

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,792
-Say again? ~The
device is powered

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,950
by plutonium.

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,958
Dinah, Roy, and Rene
are on their way here

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,309
with samples from Star City.

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,515
So my mission was part of this?

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,398
All of our missions
are a part of this.

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,439
With all due respect,

66
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,039
what am I doing back on Lian Yu?

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,555
In the past few days,
the island has seen

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,875
arash of energy spikes.

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,190
Is that your reason
for it being green?

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,158
Because the last
time that I was here,

71
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,754
Adrian Chase blew it up.

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,917
Yes. Harnessing
that energy is the key,

73
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,559
and we need to do
it right away because

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,996
we have no idea how long
the energy spikes will last.

75
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,596
Okay. Wait. So we build this
magic weapon for the space god

76
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,512
and we stop Crisis?

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,875
There is no stopping Crisis.

78
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,514
Well, then what's
the weapon for?

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,829
I don't know,

80
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,269
but Novu said this
is how we survive it,

81
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,430
and I believe him.

82
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,637
If we can't stop Crisis...

83
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,150
Sorry.

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,399
What is he talking about?

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,394
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,839
Would the group mind if I
had a moment with my kids?

87
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,115
Of course.

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,713
There's no easy way to say this.

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,632
Mar Novu has seen my fate.

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,398
1 don't survive Crisis.

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,519
‘What do you mean?
- mean that he told me

92
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,990
what would happen to me
the day that he walked in

93
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,355
and asked for my help.

94
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,511
And when exactly were
you planning on telling us?

95
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,160
I've been fighting my fate
because of the two of you,

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,835
and I can't fight
it, I can't change it.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,070
So you're just giving up?

98
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,154
I am attempting to
save the multiverse,

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,031
and I'm trying to keep
the two of you safe.

100
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
We gotta build the weapon,

101
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,999
and finish this mission,

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,194
and that's the way
that it has to be.

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,956
Well, then I guess
we better get to it.

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,752
Lyla, what happened to no
more secrets between us?

105
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,319
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

106
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,198
So you thought tranqing
me and bringing me here

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,431
of all places was somehow
a better explanation?

108
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,677
Mar Novu made it
clear that silence was

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,274
a requirement of the mission.

110
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,915
We couldn't risk interfering

111
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,275
with the journeys
of the other players.

112
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,637
As in Oliver's journey
ending in a death sentence?

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,073
What did Novu
ask you to do, Lyla?

114
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,719
He didn't give me details.

115
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,951
He just told me that
when the time comes

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,670
I would know what to do.

117
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,309
You're just fine with that? Why?

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,354
Faith.

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,153
You remember that IED that
took out my unit in Afghanistan?

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,913
I remember that. Of course I do.

121
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,039
You were the only survivor.

122
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,636
Took you years to stop having
nightmares about that blast.

123
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,433
Mar Novu when
he first came to me,

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,352
he told me he
rescued me that day

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,273
because I have
a greater purpose.

126
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,911
-And you believed him?
-A grown man in costume

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,434
prophesizing the apocalypse?

128
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,675
I thought it was a joke,

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,192
but then he came to me again,

130
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,111
and he showed
me...us, our future

131
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,678
just wiped away, gone
as if it never existed.

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,475
So you made a deal with him?

133
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,313
We would work
together to find heroes

134
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,039
strong enough
to face this Crisis.

135
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,799
He told me it was the only
way 1 could protect our family.

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,079
Lyla, you may have accepted that
this was the only way to move forward,

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,590
but I have not.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,035
won't.

139
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,476
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
the Black Canary knows how to fly.

140
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,354
Flying's easy.
Landing's the hard part.

141
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,070
Kidding.

142
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,430
There it is...

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,629
purgatory.

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,030
Looks a little less bombed
out than I remember.

145
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,635
Wow. After everything
I've heard about this place,

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,160
1 didn't imagine it to be so...

147
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,310
Terrifying?

148
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,795
Beautiful.

149
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,394
Makes sense you'd think so

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,911
since apparently
you're moving here.

151
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,070
Maybe not.

152
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,991
This time around,
you are part of a team.

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,275
Island team, do you copy?

154
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,949
We are five miles south
and inbound for landing. Over.

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,474
We copy. Island
team will meet you

156
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,233
at the airstrip to unload. Over.

157
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,357
No wind to speak
of. Looks like we're in

158
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,079
for a relatively smooth landing.

159
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,157
Hang on. Hang on.
What the hell is that?

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,835
Something's wrong.

161
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,474
Hey. Is everything
all right up there?

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,990
We're picking up--
something's incoming.

163
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,355
Did she say, "incoming"?

164
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,276
Dinah, are you there?
Can you read me?

165
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,475
Can you read me?

166
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,789
Oh, my God.

167
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,835
Brace for emergency landing.

168
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,990
Hold on!

169
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,999
They're not gonna make it.

170
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,159
“We need to find the crash
site. I'm working as fast as I can.

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,033
I can't get in contact
with Roy, Rene, or Dinah.

172
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,560
Something keeps
blocking my signal.

173
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,836
Not something, someone.
Whoever shot down that plane.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,274
You should have told
us we weren't alone.

175
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,510
I thought we were.

176
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,593
I had AR.G.U.S.
sweep the entire island.

177
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,512
Okay. I just got
the coordinates,

178
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,440
but the plutonium
landed in a different spot.

179
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,994
There's a tracker in the case,

180
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,753
but it's nowhere near
Rene, Dinah, or Roy.

181
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,950
The people are the priority.

182
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,589
Well, obviously, but we still need
the plutonium to build the weapon.

183
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,237
All right. John, let's split up.

184
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,470
I'll run point on the rescue.

185
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,795
Connor, you're with me.

186
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,234
I'm coming, too.

187
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,913
I called them
here. This is on me.

188
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,878
Whatever the three of
you do, just be careful.

189
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,792
We don't know who these
people are or what they want.

190
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,995
Copy that.

191
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,071
And I guess that means,
what, the three of us,

192
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,436
we are on nuclear weapon duty?

193
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,670
I'm staying here.

194
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,674
Are you okay with that?

195
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,519
Someone needs
to protect William.

196
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,670
Gee. Thanks.

197
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,995
It's fair.

198
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,710
Thank you.

199
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,552
William synced this map
to the plutonium's location.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,229
Gonna get us close to the case,

201
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,913
but the coordinates
won't be exact,

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,151
so we're gonna have
to sweep the area.

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,596
Well, the sooner
we find it, the better

204
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,229
because I am not
a fan of this island.

205
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,438
Yeah? Well, it has
that effect on people.

206
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,991
You know, I, uh--
I never expected

207
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,312
to be on a mission with
you like this, you know.

208
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,114
I'm glad you're here.

209
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,198
No offense, but shouldn't
this Kodak moment

210
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,237
be with you and someone else?

211
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,438
What? You and Mia.

212
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,716
Oh. Trying to give
her a little space.

213
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,593
Sure you're not trying to
avoid a difficult conversation?

214
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,273
I'm pretty sure she doesn't
want to talk to me, Laurel.

215
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,954
Oliver, don't be an idiot, okay?

216
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,190
All that girl wants to do
is live up to her father.

217
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,955
Fine. All this father wants
is to complete this mission

218
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,317
so that my kids actually
have a world to live in.

219
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,831
“We are almost there.
Come on. «Oliver.

220
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,070
Piece of advice.

221
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,118
Don't leave this island
with more regrets

222
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,435
than you already
have buried here.

223
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,271
Oh. Building this weapon with
2019 tech may actually kill me.

224
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,749
I miss the future.

225
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,595
What's this?

226
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,276
Those are very volatile
dwarf star particles

227
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,752
that could level an
entire city or island.

228
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,357
All right. What can
I do to help, huh?

229
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,909
Well, do you know how to
calculate the volume of a sphere?

230
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,157
43 pi times radius cubed.

231
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,318
I was raised by
Felicity, too, remember?

232
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,353
Right. Well, do you know what
the Pauli exclusion principle

233
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,510
of quantum physics is?

234
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,079
Didn't pay that much attention.

235
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,277
Well, then that pretty much
takes you out of the running

236
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,431
of helping me in
any meaningful way.

237
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,353
Damn. I'm gonna
need a wire stripper.

238
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,511
These are the most
complicated coding

239
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,273
and design sequences
I have ever seen,

240
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,317
and I'm including
2040 when I say, "ever."

241
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,992
It's not like you to
hide out in the bunker

242
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,833
and miss out on all the action.

243
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,879
Still mad at Dad?

244
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,755
It's his life.

245
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,989
He can do whatever
he wants with it, right?

246
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,750
Always has.

247
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,759
You're being a bit
harsh, don't you think?

248
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,753
And you are being a
bit chill, don't you think?

249
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,434
I was right all along.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,755
Yeah. He has always
been a hero first

251
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,274
and a dad second.

252
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,879
We never should
have trusted him.

253
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,195
Mia.
-I'm getting your wire stripper.

254
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,836
I'm sorry our first
meeting had to be this.

255
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,233
I envisioned getting to know
my future son over a meal,

256
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,199
not en route to a plane crash.

257
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,077
This--this feels about
right for our family.

258
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,279
Most of our milestones
got interrupted

259
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,397
by some sort of international
emergency or another.

260
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,199
Yeah. I guess your dad
and I weren't really there

261
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,789
for you and JJ.

262
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,314
You were there when it counted.

263
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,550
Besides, I was beyond
proud to be the son

264
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,996
of the two superspies that
co-founded Knightwatch.

265
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,554
You never mentioned that.

266
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,436
I think maybe I
wasn't supposed to.

267
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,558
Time travel rules and all.

268
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,711
Have to assume that the
timelines are different now

269
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,235
unless you remember
your mother being in league

270
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,993
with a evil deity.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,399
Mar Novu is not evil.

272
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,956
Our friends' plane got
shot out of the sky, Lyla.

273
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,191
How do you know that
wasn't part of his cosmic plan?

274
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,430
And don't say faith.

275
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,239
Because I'm fresh out.

276
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,355
Okay, okay.

277
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,709
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

278
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,514
You guys okay?

279
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,670
I think so.

280
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,910
We have no idea where Roy is.

281
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,593
Okay. You are
definitely not okay.

282
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,200
We cannot let this get infected.

283
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,799
You guys keep searching.
I'll take Rene back

284
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,189
- and get him fixed up.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

285
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,959
“We need to find
Roy. ‘Where? Where?

286
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,315
This way.

287
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,433
Laurel, I found it!

288
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,470
Laurel!

289
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
- Let her go.
- I'm afraid he can't do that.

290
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,150
Hello, Oliver.

291
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,159
Fyers.

292
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,233
- You're dead.
- What?

293
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,671
Seems I've been given
a new lease on life,

294
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,430
though this time I'l be
sure to finish the job.

295
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,349
Drop your weapon.

296
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,351
Drop...your weapon!

297
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,429
Friends of yours?

298
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,557
Edward Fyers and
Billy Wintergreen.

299
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,711
They were on the island
when I first got here,

300
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,789
and they're both dead.

301
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,236
So now we're fighting ghosts?
How is that even possible?

302
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,516
-Get this to William.
“Where are you going?

303
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,670
I have to go after Fyers.

304
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,114
Or you come with me,

305
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,395
and we finish this weapon

306
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,597
and get the hell off
this nightmare island.

307
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,875
Fyers is my mess.

308
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,878
He's a mercenary
that I fought and I killed.

309
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,150
He clearly wants revenge,

310
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,755
and ma--makes
him my responsibility.

311
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,039
All right. I'll be back
as soon as I can.

312
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,034
Yao Fei?

313
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,114
-Are you real?
-As real as the men you hunt.

314
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,595
Why'd you try to shoot me?

315
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,955
Like the first time.

316
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,669
To keep you from danger.

317
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,030
No one can keep me from
danger, okay, not even you.

318
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,429
Because you are fated to die?

319
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,754
There are forces at play

320
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,433
that want you to not succeed.

321
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,875
Fyers and his men
know about the weapon,

322
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,269
and they want to
use it for themselves.

323
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,439
All right. Well, who
else has, um, returned?

324
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,716
Only those who were with
you from the beginning,

325
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,749
but you must not let the evil
that tempted you at the start

326
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,831
distract you at the end.

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,753
He's coming after more than my
mission, Yao Fei, you understand?

328
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,955
I'm not gonna let that happen.

329
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,551
Last time you tried to
do alone did not end well.

330
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,439
I'm not that person anymore.

331
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,199
1 will hope.

332
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,597
Roy! John] Roy!

333
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,273
Roy!

334
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,270
There!

335
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,155
Roy!

336
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,914
I can't-- I can't move!

337
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,119
Roy, we're gonna
get you out of here.

338
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,270
His arm is pinned.

339
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,551
-Can you feel anything? No, no.

340
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,430
We got a problem. Fuel.

341
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,354
Okay. “We got to
get him out of here

342
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,749
before this whole thing blows.

343
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,275
Let's get this off of him, okay?

344
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,192
Yeah, -One, two, three, lift!

345
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,835
How bad is it?

346
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,915
Tell me!

347
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,514
Your arm is crushed.

348
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,156
If you can't feel it, then
that means pretty badly.

349
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,397
If we can't move
what is pinning you,

350
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,796
then we need to start thinking
about other contingencies.

351
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,950
What are we talking about here?

352
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,675
We don't have much time.

353
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,758
The best way to get Roy out

354
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,150
might be amputation.

355
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,913
- What?
- Can you do that?

356
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,150
Ihave a med kit in
my pack back there.

357
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,310
It'll have what I need.

358
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,318
If we can just move
this off of him, okay,

359
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,713
we have a chance
at saving his arm.

360
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,075
I mean, the odds
aren't very good.

361
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,429
We owe it to him to keep trying!

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,149
So let's move
this thing, all right?

363
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,350
Let's go!

364
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,069
-Dinah, -I'm gonna check it out.

365
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,834
Yeah. All right. Look.
Let's try to find a lever

366
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,432
to help get this
off of him, okay?

367
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,234
Roy, just hang tight.
We'll be right back.

368
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,115
Oh, good. You're not dead.

369
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,239
Or maybe I spoke too soon.

370
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,758
Rene is injured but okay.

371
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,040
Roy's in a bad spot.

372
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,270
Well, we're all gonna
be there with him

373
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,515
if--if we don't keep moving.

374
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,870
Sounds like you found the
guys who shot down our plane.

375
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,553
Oliver's old island enemies.

376
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,313
They've been dead
for the last 12 years.

377
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,676
Of course they have.

378
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,635
Where is Oliver?

379
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,389
He went after them,

380
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,632
made me the
radioactive material mule.

381
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,870
Let's go.

382
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,794
1,2, 3!

383
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,510
It's got to be caught
on something,

384
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,075
-a root system or something.
-All right. Then we dig him out.

385
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,355
- We dig him out.
- We have to hurry.

386
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,079
Guys, we're about
to have company

387
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,799
-and not the good kind.
We can hold them off!

388
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,553
The fuel's about to spark,
John. We don't have time.

389
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,835
We can trench it, Dinah!

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,037
-Dad, we are out of options!
-We are not out of options!

391
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,918
-l don't accept that!
“We don't have a choice!

392
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,400
We always have a choice, Connor.

393
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,789
Then I'll make it.

394
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,872
Doiit. Just cut me free.

395
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,990
No. No, Roy.

396
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,113
John, it's better my
arm than our lives.

397
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,117
Get the kit. Get the kit.

398
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,069
Laurel and I will distract them.

399
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,800
Here. You apply the tourniquet.

400
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,950
I'll get ready.

401
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,749
Just hold on,
okay? Just hold on.

402
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,270
Okay.

403
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,317
<This will be over fast.
-Am I gonna feel it?

404
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,390
Probably.

405
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,074
I'm with you, Roy.
I'm with you, okay?

406
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,710
You ready?

407
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,750
Do it!

408
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,355
Hyah!

409
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,434
Fyers' camp is just up ahead.

410
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,749
We should not be back here.

411
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,394
You don't have to help, Yao Fei.

412
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,834
I help for Shado.

413
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,279
I'm sorry I couldn't save her.

414
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,275
You know the bond now
between a father and child.

415
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,636
I do. It's exactly why I
have to put Fyers down.

416
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,279
Should be right up here.

417
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,110
They're gone.

418
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,270
Okay. That doesn't
make any sense.

419
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,515
He should be here.

420
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,995
Fyers knew you'd come here.

421
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,754
Well, now he's free and clear to
attack my friends and my family.

422
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,240
We need to get out of here.

423
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,630
How?

424
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,350
Use your how?

425
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,230
It's pinned.

426
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,631
All right, Well, we will
have to cut our way out.

427
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,839
The net is made
of braided steel.

428
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,952
-That blade
won't cut. It'll cut.

429
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,269
- Ohh!
- Gotchu, gotchu, easy. Shh.

430
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,710
What the hell happened?

431
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,473
His arm got pinned
underneath the landing gear.

432
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,630
We had to amputate.

433
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,995
I'm sure you did what
you needed to do.

434
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,033
- Roy?
- William.

435
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,237
Not sure it's really a good
time for a meet and greet.

436
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,390
Is Oliver back yet?

437
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,955
We thought he was with you.

438
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,713
No. He went after the
bad guys on his own.

439
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,957
“Why would you let him do that?
-Seriously?

440
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,389
Okay. We have to go after him.

441
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,870
No. No. William has
to finish the weapon.

442
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,195
I don't care about your weapon!

443
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,556
Oliver knows this island better
than anyone, Mia. He'll be fine.

444
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,597
Plus it's smarter for
us to stick together.

445
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,637
No. We are not
leaving him out there.

446
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,554
Fine. I'll go on my own!

447
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,673
-This is a bad idea.
Then don't come with me.

448
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,797
You heard Laurel. We
should stick together.

449
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,712
t's smarter tactically.
-Are you really gonna lecture me

450
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,995
on tactics right now?

451
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,197
Well...no, but...

452
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,790
Dig is right.

453
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,110
I mean, Dad and this
island, they go way back,

454
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,754
and he knows every
inch of this place.

455
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,638
You going out there
could make things worse.

456
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,870
I'll take my chances.

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,990
Get out of my way.

458
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,670
William.

459
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,513
Look. It is okay for you
to be afraid of losing him

460
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,991
especially after the
way that you left things.

461
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,639
You don't know what
you're talking about.

462
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,552
This is exactly what
happened with Felicity.

463
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,231
You were angry with her, but
you still wanted to save her.

464
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,914
I'm not just gonna sit
here and do nothing, okay?

465
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,749
1 will not leave him
alone out there. I--

466
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,993
1 will not...let him die.

467
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,199
I let myself believe for just...

468
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,716
just a minute that I could
actually have my dad.

469
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,074
Look. When I was a kid, I spent
a lot of time pushing him away

470
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,672
because I never thought
that I could lose him,

471
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,870
and then he disappeared.

472
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,639
Yeah. Now we
might lose him again.

473
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,873
How are you so calm about this?

474
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,230
I'm not, but when I was little,

475
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,959
Felicity had me
down in that bunker

476
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,599
watching Dad out in the field,

477
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,910
and I saw that he could
cheat death more than anyone,

478
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,758
but if this really is the end,

479
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,034
I don't want to waste the time
that I have left with him being angry.

480
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,750
Do you?

481
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,756
I was wrong. You
haven't changed.

482
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,638
Still that impatient
boy I found.

483
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,154
You realize that
insulting me is not gonna

484
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,714
make this go any faster, right?

485
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,191
Breathe. Remember
in everything, breathe.

486
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,354
I'm trying to cut my way out of a
net, Yao Fei, not shoot an arrow.

487
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,875
We wouldn't be in this
net if you had breathed.

488
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,356
You know what Fyers
is capable of, right?

489
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,079
I need to get back to my family,

490
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,514
and I'm running out of time.

491
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,159
You could be with your family,

492
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,630
but you chose here instead.

493
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,911
I chose to protect them.

494
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,754
You avoid them because
you're fated to die.

495
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,790
I've been fighting that
fate for a long time.

496
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,190
I've accepted it.

497
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,632
That hasn't made
things any easier.

498
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,872
What am I supposed
to say to my kids?

499
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,394
What I could not to Shado.

500
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,355
You say good-bye.

501
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,113
I don't think that I can.

502
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,993
My kids have spent basically

503
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,873
their entire lives without me.

504
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,591
And they're about to
have to do it all over again.

505
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,279
You think you have failed.

506
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,274
The first thing that you
taught me--shengcun, survive.

507
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,993
Well, I can't do that anymore.

508
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,913
Shengeun is more than body.

509
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,754
It is spirit, what lives on,

510
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,269
like I did in Shado,

511
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,269
like she does in you.

512
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,710
That is survive.

513
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,080
How do I do that?

514
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,550
You live now

515
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,995
with your children

516
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,760
with the time you have left.

517
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,271
I need to get out
of this net first.

518
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,759
Always have patience.

519
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,078
Like I said, patience.

520
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,357
Just came by to check
on you. How you feeling?

521
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,599
I--I've been better.

522
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,553
I'm so sorry, Roy.

523
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,958
I should have found
another way to get you out.

524
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,280
This wasn't your fault.

525
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,473
Yeah. Well, that's
where you're wrong.

526
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,434
I mean, you wouldn't
even be in this situation

527
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,432
if I hadn't come to
find you in Hub City.

528
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,915
Roy... I can't protect
the people I care about.

529
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,994
You know I worked with you
and Oliver for a really long time,

530
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,514
and if I've learned
anything, it's that this team

531
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,876
has each other's backs
no matter the cost.

532
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,157
Things just didn't
exactly go as planned.

533
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,830
That's an understatement.

534
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,638
No, but I would rather be here.

535
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,836
I would rather be here with you

536
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,991
and with the team
than back in Hub City,

537
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,315
living a life all alone.

538
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,717
Heroes make sacrifices, John,

539
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,393
and for better or for worse,

540
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,478
this just had to be mine.

541
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,959
John...we got a problem.

542
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,679
Fyers and his men have
surrounded the camp.

543
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,194
We can expect an
attack any minute.

544
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,714
How long before
the weapon is ready?

545
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,314
I'm done building it. Once
the plutonium finishes

546
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,193
transferring the
energy, I can turn it on.

547
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,119
- How long will that take?
- I'm not sure.

548
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,038
Can we take this to a
safer part of the island

549
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,793
«and finish it there?
-No, no. It has to be here.

550
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,439
I've tapped into the center
of the island's energy.

551
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,352
We can't move.
-And it has to be tonight.

552
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,999
We don't know when the
next energy spike will be,

553
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,235
and we can't afford to wait.

554
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,198
We need to buy
William more time.

555
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,031
Dad, you're okay.

556
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,079
Yeah. An old friend
steered me back.

557
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,355
I'm sorry that 1 took off.

558
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,353
I should have been
here with the two of you.

559
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,630
You're here now.

560
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,709
How are we supposed
to beat an army of ghosts?

561
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,030
Power up the device.

562
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,798
The sphere's absorbing
the energy of the island,

563
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,998
and if that's what brought these dead
people back to life in the first place--

564
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,629
Activating the device
will destroy them.

565
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,598
We're talking about
plutonium here.

566
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,114
That's nasty stuff.
It can take out

567
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,873
this entire island, us included!

568
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,758
If this is our best chance
of surviving the Crisis,

569
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,955
then we need to take the risk.

570
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,396
Lyla's right. She's right.

571
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,629
This is it.

572
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,433
This is our best shot.

573
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,310
Suit up.

574
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,511
You are as foolish
as ever, Queen.

575
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,230
Surrender!

576
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,154
I suppose that means you're
not here to surrender to me.

577
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,993
I'm the one who
killed you, Fyers.

578
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,310
I'm very pleased
to return the favor,

579
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,114
a task you've made much
easier by coming alone.

580
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,750
I'm not alone.

581
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,356
Now that the plutonium
has transferred the energy,

582
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,319
all I have to do is power it on,

583
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,914
and voila!

584
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,670
It doesn't look on.

585
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,956
Why isn't it working?
- have no idea.

586
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,238
It doesn't matter how
many people you have.

587
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,073
The outcome is the same.

588
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,070
Kill them!

589
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,755
William, we're
running out of time.

590
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,194
Okay. I think I have something.

591
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,959
There was a double
helix genetic sequence

592
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,235
in Dr. Wong's formula.

593
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,438
I thought it was an error, but now 1
think the device can only be powered on

594
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,318
using a specific DNA code.

595
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,754
Oliver. Oliver, we
need you back here

596
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,234
to activate the device.

597
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,038
Oliver, you got to go!

598
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,277
Yao Fei, if this works...

599
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,070
We will part again, but the
dead are never really gone.

600
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,118
I've got your six.

601
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,317
They're not gonna be able
to hold them off much longer.

602
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,113
- ‘- We need to hurry.
- The sphere is touch-activated.

603
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,714
It'll turn on the moment
you pick it up and...

604
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,639
1 don't know what
happens after that.

605
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,710
Okay.

606
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,037
Wow. That was anticlimactic.

607
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,316
“What the hell?
“What? What is it?

608
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,120
Dad's DNA doesn't match the
algorithm's specified sequence.

609
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,271
- Does that mean we can't turn it on?
- Sequence match.

610
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,669
You can't....

611
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,235
but she can.

612
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,229
What are you talking about?

613
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,232
The DNA sequence isn't Dad's.

614
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,070
It's yours.

615
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,750
Is it me, or is this
not going well?

616
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,154
We gotta buy them some time.

617
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,514
God, I hate this island!

618
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,954
Might as well go
out with a bang.

619
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,079
I thought this weapon was
supposed to help us survive Crisis.

620
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,799
That's what Novu told me.

621
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,270
Does this mean
you're the weapon?

622
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,709
Johnny...

623
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,718
I understand why
you have to do this.

624
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,959
Lyla, are you all right?

625
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,755
I have to go.

626
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,199
Hey, guys. 1 just, uh--

627
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,395
I just connected with ARG.US.,

628
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,471
and Lyla organized a rescue boat

629
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,233
before everything happened.

630
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,914
Should be here any minute, so--

631
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,630
so we're all going home.

632
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,829
Did Mom--did she know what
was gonna happen to her?

633
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,509
No. No. She was just as
surprised as the rest of us.

634
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,518
Novu just loves
surprises, doesn't he?

635
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,916
Whatever Mar Novu
has planned for Lyla,

636
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,670
she can handle it.

637
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,639
How much time do we have

638
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,073
before the Crisis?

639
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,790
Not long.

640
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,715
Should, um,
probably finish packing

641
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,154
before the boat arrives.

642
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,830
Agreed. No more
island vacations.

643
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,917
Uh, hey, guys.

644
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,999
Listen. I just wanted to...

645
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,673
I wanted to thank both of you

646
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,759
for just being there
for me no matter what.

647
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,750
Why does this sound
like a good-bye speech?

648
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,355
Pass. Do not accept.

649
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,592
This ain't over
till it's over, Oliver.

650
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,310
All right.

651
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,070
Come on.

652
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,630
Hey.

653
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,394
I don't really know what to say.

654
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,911
I'm really happy that you're
back with the team, and...

655
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,430
I'm really sorry.

656
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,955
I'll be okay.

657
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,758
Plus Dig's gonna set me up with

658
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,433
one of those fancy
AR.G.U.S. doctors, so...

659
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,114
Uh, the boat's almost ready.

660
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,918
Uh, we good down here?

661
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,115
Yeah. We should go.

662
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,160
Oh. Uh, almost forgot.

663
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,510
This is what led
me here in the future

664
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,879
to you and, uh, to the team.

665
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,670
Thought you might like it back.

666
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,195
I don't need it.

667
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,716
Plus I think it should
stay in the family.

668
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,874
You know, when
Felicity gave this to me,

669
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,951
she told me it was a
symbol of reconnection.

670
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,038
-She was right.
-She normally is.

671
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,515
No. You keep it.

672
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,591
William, what you
were able to do,

673
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,630
you're a hero.

674
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,714
Well, I had a pretty
good example.

675
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,190
It means a lot to me

676
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,432
that I've had a chance to...

677
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,671
to see the type of
man you've become.

678
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,999
I hope you'll forgive me

679
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,511
for lots of things eventually.

680
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,675
Dad, I already have.

681
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,550
I mean, I know for you
I only left a year ago.

682
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,472
For me, it's been 20 years,

683
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,309
and back then when I was a kid,

684
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,869
I didn't understand
what it meant

685
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,475
to fight for something
bigger than yourself,

686
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,990
but now I do.

687
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,280
I'm really proud of you, Dad.

688
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,313
Not as proud as I am of you.

689
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,479
-I'm gonna hug you now.
-You better.

690
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,630
Okay.

691
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,633
Thinking about where Lyla went?

692
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,153
Can't think about anything else.

693
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,951
I know this is a
sacrifice she has to make

694
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,395
for the multiverse.

695
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,671
I feel like I'm always
asking you favors.

696
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,478
Anything you
need, Oliver, always.

697
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,391
I need those kids back in 2040

698
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,434
somehow, some way before
whatever's gonna happen happens.

699
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,159
Yeah. I was thinking
about the same thing.

700
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,919
I'll make sure
they get home safe.

701
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,990
One more thing.

702
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,635
When this is over,

703
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,237
track down Felicity and...

704
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,478
just tell her that
I don't want...

705
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,199
Mia and William kept separated.

706
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,470
I think that they deserve
to grow up with each other.

707
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,590
I'll tell her.

708
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,950
Yeah.

709
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,951
You know, Oliver, I once
told you a long time ago

710
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,750
that uh, a soldier never lets
a brother go into battle alone.

711
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,672
I think that's why it was so hard
for me to accept the idea that...

712
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,079
you weren't gonna
make it out of this.

713
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,398
I felt like I'd be failing you.

714
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,914
You could never fail me, John.

715
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,673
I'm gonna stick by your side

716
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,870
for as long as I can,

717
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,593
but I know you
have to do this alone.

718
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,279
Every mission has an end.

719
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,549
I wish this one didn't.

720
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,837
I couldn't have
done any of this,

721
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,356
any of it without you.

722
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,479
You've always been my rock.

723
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,074
Don't mean the best
man you've ever known?

724
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,560
I also mean that.

725
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,074
Hey, let's get out of here, man.

726
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,355
Don't want to keep
the boat waiting.

727
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,715
I'll be right behind you.

728
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,269
One more thing 1 got to do.

729
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,630
Hey.

730
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,990
Hey.

731
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,992
Um, William said I
might find you here.

732
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,597
Figured you'd be the
first one on the boat.

733
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,910
You okay?

734
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,196
My whole life I heard
nothing but stories about you.

735
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,272
You know, this legendary
Green Arrow and his team.

736
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,119
I should have been proud of you

737
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,557
because you were a hero, and...

738
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,239
all I could see is that that is

739
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,720
the reason that
you weren't with me,

740
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,556
and it's--it's kind of
hard to let that go.

741
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,438
I never meant to
cause you any pain.

742
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,357
Your mom and me just
wanted to protect you.

743
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,750
I know.

744
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,752
I, uh--l understand that now.

745
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,754
For a very long time,

746
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,354
I have hated this place.

747
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,349
Just, I'd think about all the
people that it took from me.

748
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,314
It would just--it would
just make me so angry.

749
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,990
But you're not now?

750
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,309
I'm still a little bit angry.

751
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,990
This island taught
me to survive.

752
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,957
It turned me into someone else,

753
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,638
somebody better than
the person I was before.

754
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,597
So despite my feelings...

755
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,953
there are no stories about
the Green Arrow to tell

756
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,718
if don't make my way to Lian Yu,

757
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,994
and I'm also not
standing at this moment

758
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,029
looking at my daughter.

759
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,551
Thank you for letting
me be a part of your story

760
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,832
even if it was only
for a little while.

761
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,999
Mia, something tells me you're
gonna create your own stories.

762
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,235
So what now?

763
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,835
We need to get back home

764
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,470
and just be prepared

765
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,559
for whatever's coming next.

766
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,870
Okay.

767
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,990
Dad.

768
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,233
Lyla? Not anymore.

769
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,110
I'm now a harbinger
of things to come.

770
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,959
-And that's-- “Yes.

771
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,754
The Crisis has begun.

772
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,435
For so many years,

773
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,197
I've traveled across worlds,

774
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,950
across the multiverse
to do one thing--

775
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,670
kill you,

776
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,398
and now here, you save my life.

777
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,520
Submit and begin your life anew.

778
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,915
Show me.

779
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,233
The knowledge is within you.

780
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,079
Greg, move your head!
