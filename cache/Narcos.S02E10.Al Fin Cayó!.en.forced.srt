1
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,400
Citizens of Colombia,

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,860
we present your new president,
Pablo Escobar!

3
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,240
PABLO ESCOBAR PRESIDENT

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,210
Thank you.

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,130
How are you, Mr. President?

6
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,430
Thank you.

7
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,350
Thank you.

8
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,270
Much appreciated.

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,900
Thank you.

10
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,400
Please come in, Mr. President.

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,600
- All yours.
- Thank you.

12
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,360
Happy birthday to you

13
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,860
- Happy birthday to you
- What's this?

14
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,160
Happy birthday, dear Pablo

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,660
Happy birthday to you

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,040
Bravo, Pablito!

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,540
I love you, son.
Don't eat the whole cake.

18
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,380
Don't forget to blow out the candles,
Dad.

19
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,880
Happy birthday, Daddy!

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
Pablo, we miss you so much.

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,890
We wish we could be there with you.

22
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,640
I know, my love.

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,680
Soon this will all be behind us.

24
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,350
I promise.

25
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,110
Good morning, boss.

26
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,830
I made some eggs.

27
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,660
- There's leftover cake.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,330
Thanks.

29
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,000
I got everything we need, boss.

30
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,340
You went to a different store, correct?

31
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,930
Yes, sir.
I go to a different one every time.

32
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,930
So, the shopkeeper's mom, she's a healer.

33
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,770
I paid her a visit.

34
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,770
I told you not to talk to anybody.

35
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,190
Yeah, boss, but...

36
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,240
only thing is, since I was a kid,
I've believed in these things.

37
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,870
Look...

38
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,460
I asked her for something to protect you.

39
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,040
The sword of St. Michael the archangel...

40
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,670
- the Virgin--
- ...and the Holy Child of Atocha.

41
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,430
You know my mother and I built a church?

42
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,890
Yes, sir.

43
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,060
In Barrio Pablo Escobar.

44
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,730
That's where I grew up, boss.

45
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,440
Happy birthday, sir.

46
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Thank you, Limón.

47
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,280
Pardon me.

48
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,260
From south Medellín.
Casablanca neighborhood, to be exact.

49
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,850
If he does, we'll be listening.

50
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,460
This stays between us, understood?

51
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,050
We will set up a temporary base
in Casablanca.

52
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,260
We need to act as quickly as possible
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?

53
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,220
- Yes, Colonel.
- Good work.

54
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,680
Lieutenant Martinez?

55
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,520
How long since we heard anything
from Escobar? A month? A month and a half?

56
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,530
A month and a half, sir.

57
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,490
And that whole time you've been
in the van listening to static?

58
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,280
Yes. Waiting.

59
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,410
Stubbornness seems to run in my family.
It's in our blood.

60
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,830
Excuse me.

61
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,220
Six.

62
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,110
Can you imagine what would happen
if cocaine were legal?

63
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,650
It's your turn.

64
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,320
I think if coke was legal, boss,

65
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,160
you would be the boss of the world
and the cops couldn't touch you.

66
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,010
Yes, sir.

67
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,720
We're sure that the call came from
the Casablanca neighborhood in Medellín.

68
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,220
This is the best intel
we've received in months.

69
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,100
Don't underestimate him.
We've made that mistake in the past.

70
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,230
Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.

71
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,860
If your men are able to find Escobar...

72
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,440
I don't care about the consequences.

73
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
I want him dead.

74
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,910
Do you have a problem with that?

75
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,960
With all due respect, Mr. President,
if he resists, that's how it will go.

76
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,290
Otherwise, we're going to capture him.

77
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,130
Keep me informed.

78
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,970
Gentlemen.

79
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,010
Mrs. Escobar?

80
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,930
The attorney general called this morning.

81
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,720
He's decided to end
your protective custody.

82
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,890
So we have to leave by the weekend.

83
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,640
No. No, you can't do this to us.

84
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,020
They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

85
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,070
Ma'am?

86
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,870
May I give you some advice?

87
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,460
I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

88
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,080
Forget about him.

89
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,940
The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?

90
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,280
Probably not a good idea right now,
my love.

91
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,540
So... do you feel a year older or what?

92
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,830
More like four or five.

93
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
We've missed you very much, Pablo.

94
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,880
The days feel longer.

95
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,340
For me too.

96
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,890
I still don't understand
why you're in Medellín.

97
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,140
That place is too dangerous, my love.

98
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,690
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

99
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,150
Pablo...

100
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,820
I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.

101
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,830
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

102
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,200
You can survive prison.

103
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,420
We both know that won't happen.

104
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,340
Stop!

105
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,970
- Listen to me, Pablo...
- They're talking.

106
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,970
- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.

107
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,300
You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.

108
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,930
My man.

109
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,430
My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

110
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,350
The people love you and follow you.

111
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,400
Tata, Limón wants me off.

112
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,650
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

113
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,740
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

114
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,450
They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

115
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,450
They gave him the Nobel Prize.

116
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,460
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

117
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,460
Of the same country that imprisoned him.

118
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,550
I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.

119
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,300
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

120
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,180
All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

121
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,140
It's very important.

122
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,260
It's our only way out really.

123
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,930
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

124
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,810
Colonel! This is Lieutenant Martinez.

125
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,810
Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.

126
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,270
I'll think about it.

127
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,480
All right?

128
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,950
I love you very much.

129
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,440
Where are you going?

130
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,320
To Medellín.

131
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,950
What? No, Hermilda. You can't leave.

132
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,820
My son needs me.

133
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,200
How so?

134
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,290
What you want...

135
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,170
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

136
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,030
I don't want them to kill him.

137
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,290
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

138
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,920
They won't if he turns himself in.

139
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,880
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

140
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,800
No! No, ma'am.

141
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:00,310
I will not stay quiet
when I see you betraying my son.

142
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,270
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

143
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,110
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

144
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,240
We can't even leave the country.

145
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,240
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

146
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,240
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

147
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,630
My son...

148
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,210
needs his mother.

149
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,060
Hermilda.

150
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,440
Please be very careful. Please.

151
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,200
Tell the children...

152
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,620
I'll tell them.

153
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,560
We have intel that Escobar
is in this building.

154
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,140
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

155
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,770
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

156
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,650
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

157
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,910
Now, if he resists...

158
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,740
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

159
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,410
I want you to take his life. Understood?

160
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,250
- Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

161
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,550
Everything all right, boss?

162
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,990
Tata wants me to surrender.

163
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,330
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

164
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,620
Nelson Mandela?

165
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,500
Who's that, boss?

166
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,310
Did you buy more rolling papers?

167
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,470
Sorry, no, boss.

168
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,260
I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

169
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,950
He's not here.

170
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,750
Boss, come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

171
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,800
This is my city, Limón.

172
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,510
These are my people.

173
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,390
Medellín will never betray me.

174
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,150
Colonel.

175
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,700
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

176
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,610
Looks like your little machine is broken,
right, Lieutenant?

177
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,740
Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.

178
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,620
Excuse me, Colonel.

179
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,960
Listen up! Take down the staging area
and head back to Holguín.

180
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,180
The son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

181
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,110
- A ghost.
- What's that?

182
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,650
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

183
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,820
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

184
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,710
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

185
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,540
Give me the keys!

186
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,300
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

187
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,660
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

188
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,250
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

189
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,500
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

190
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,890
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

191
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,810
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

192
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,160
- Hello. Give me a juice, please.
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

193
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,790
Sir.

194
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,000
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

195
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,560
- Kick it here!
- There you go.

196
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,800
You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

197
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,100
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

198
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,850
They're offering seven million dollars
for you head,

199
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,190
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

200
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,070
You look just like Che Guevara.

201
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,990
What's beautiful is always beautiful.

202
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,860
You look like you ate Che Guevara.

203
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,000
What? You don't miss me or what?

204
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,300
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

205
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,550
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

206
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,100
Thank you, Gustavo.

207
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,150
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

208
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,320
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

209
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,980
Never letting anything stop him.

210
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,570
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

211
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,410
You remember when we used to talk about
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

212
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,540
Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.

213
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,500
Tata wants me to surrender.

214
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,090
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

215
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,090
Maybe it's a good idea.

216
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,850
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

217
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,310
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

218
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,770
The legend grows.

219
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,940
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

220
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,070
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

221
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,790
Let's cut the bullshit.

222
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,630
We are bandits, Pablo.

223
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,460
Right?

224
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,260
What do you think?

225
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,350
I think...

226
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,980
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

227
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,900
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

228
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,370
Every fucking day of my life, brother.

229
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,710
Boss? Don't do that again, sir.

230
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,500
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

231
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,180
It worked perfectly.

232
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,560
You're a good man, Limón.

233
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,850
Thank you.

234
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,860
Thanks a lot.

235
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,740
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

236
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,530
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

237
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm hungry.

238
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,450
Tata?

239
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Pablo?

240
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,300
There's the love of my life.

241
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,050
- You sound different.
- I'm good, my love.

242
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,590
I feel good.

243
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,520
And ready to talk to those reporters.

244
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,100
Good, my love.

245
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,270
Does that mean you're turning yourself in?

246
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,240
No, Tata.

247
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,360
I'll never surrender.

248
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,200
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

249
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,040
You have to.

250
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
I'll never surrender, my love.

251
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,560
I know, Pablo.

252
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,900
But what's your plan?

253
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,570
All right.

254
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,820
I know what we're going to do.

255
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,200
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

256
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,250
That's what we are going to do.

257
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,710
- ...foreign journalists...
- Alvaro, slow down!

258
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,630
...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...

259
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,340
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

260
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,480
We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.

261
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,940
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

262
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,780
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

263
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,950
You have to believe me.

264
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,280
- We will succeed.
- Stop!

265
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,250
As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...

266
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,420
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

267
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,760
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

268
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,670
And listen...

269
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,350
I will not rest until that happens.

270
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,810
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

271
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,610
I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.

272
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,320
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

273
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,860
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

274
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,280
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

275
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,030
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

276
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,330
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

277
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,170
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

278
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,130
Colonel, I found him.

279
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,130
Who? Escobar?

280
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,670
Yes, Colonel.

281
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,340
He's in Los Olivos.

282
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,350
Son, are you sure?

283
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,930
We can't afford the luxury
of making another mistake.

284
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,230
I'm sure. I saw him.

285
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,690
What do you mean you saw him?

286
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,900
Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.

287
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,820
And did he see you?

288
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,610
No, I don't think so.

289
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,450
Listen up, Lieutenant.

290
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,040
There's still some men
in the staging area.

291
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,710
I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?

292
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,960
Copy that, Colonel.

293
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,960
One more thing. Be safe. Over and out.

294
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,590
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

295
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,970
Hello, Dad.

296
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,760
How's it going, son?

297
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,390
You wanted to ask me something or what?

298
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,730
Yes, sir.

299
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,230
What wish did you make for your birthday?

300
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,780
If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

301
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,900
Tell me! Don't be like that!

302
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,410
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

303
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,910
is that it was a very good wish.

304
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,990
You know,

305
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,410
you deserve the best birthday
in the world.

306
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,050
Thank you, my love.

307
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,180
- Captain, can you hear me?
- Yes, Colonel?

308
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,890
How many men are left
in the provisional base?

309
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,770
- Counting me, about 12.
- Listen up.

310
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,780
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
- Shit! Let's go!

311
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,740
Everybody to Los Olivos!

312
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,070
Hello.

313
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,540
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

314
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,620
Good.

315
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,460
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

316
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,550
Perez!

317
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,390
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

318
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,440
Get your mom on the phone, okay?

319
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,190
Pablo.

320
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,790
- Do you have the questions?
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

321
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,740
The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

322
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,370
"How do you feel after
all of these days on the run?"

323
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,660
Write this down.

324
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,040
"It's been very hard
being far from my family,

325
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,040
who I love more than anything
in the world."

326
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,550
- Sergeant, go around.
- "But I feel good.

327
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,170
I feel strong.

328
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,050
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

329
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,770
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

330
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:21,860
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

331
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,650
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

332
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,950
The government
is holding my family hostage.

333
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,370
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

334
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,590
that calls itself democratic.

335
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,170
My little kids are innocent children

336
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,720
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

337
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,480
All we want from the government

338
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,480
is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.

339
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,690
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

340
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,950
Without that--"

341
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,490
One moment.

342
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,370
What happened, Pablo?

343
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,290
Something strange is happening here.
I'll call you back.

344
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,920
Pablo.

345
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,130
Pablo. Pablo, don't hang up.

346
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,180
Pablo, what's going on?

347
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,510
What's wrong, Mom?

348
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,060
Go on. All right.

349
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,320
Go!

350
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,860
Let's go!

351
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Let's go! Come on!

352
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,330
Come on!

353
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,330
Come on! Move!

354
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,850
Move!

355
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,480
Go!

356
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,440
Keep going!

357
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,480
Nobody shoot!

358
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,460
Sergeant Sarmiento!

359
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,340
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

360
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,220
Is he alive?

361
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,840
Long live Colombia.

362
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,390
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live!

363
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,470
We killed Pablo Escobar!

364
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,390
- Long live! Long live!
- Long live Colombia!

365
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,810
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live Colombia!

366
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,040
Go ahead.

367
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,680
They killed Pablo Escobar!

368
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,770
My son!

369
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,380
I pray to God that other mothers

370
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,550
don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

371
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,510
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

372
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,640
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

373
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,850
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

374
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,230
because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.

375
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,480
He built playing fields.
He built a neighborhood for the poor.

376
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,520
No one has paid attention to that.

377
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,740
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

378
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,110
He was the noblest of men.
Not just as a son...

379
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,440
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

380
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,900
Thank you.

381
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,910
Talk to me.

382
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,490
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

383
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,620
He told you that?

384
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,090
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

385
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,670
you were once associates and friends.

386
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,220
You were saying?

387
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,440
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

388
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,070
That you would forgive us.

389
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,070
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

390
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,740
How much do you have left, Mrs. Escobar?

391
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,410
In property? In cash?

392
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,460
I can find out.

393
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,630
That's good.

394
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,340
Because I want all of it.

395
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,370
All right, gentlemen.

396
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,630
Gentlemen!

397
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:11,760
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

398
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,060
The first sale.

399
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,980
The first million. The first billion.

400
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,400
And when your rival no longer exists.

401
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,250
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

402
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,670
but how well one has prepared for them.

403
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:54,090
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

404
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,970
And we won't be needing kidnappings
and bombs to succeed.

405
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,350
We will do it covertly.

406
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,230
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

407
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,650
we'll no longer be there.

408
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,480
No, sir!

409
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,900
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
