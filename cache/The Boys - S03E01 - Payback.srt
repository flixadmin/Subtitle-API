1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,505
This is a fucking mess, son,
but don't you worry.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,342
Daddy's home.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,367
What's up, shitbirds?

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,703
You have five minutes
to make your opening St...

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,247
You guys fucking ready?

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,814
So noir's a vegetable.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,942
And you didn't do this.

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,278
Look, there was no terrorist.

9
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,614
It was vought. It's a fucking coup.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,784
Victoria neuman's making a team
that can keep tabs on the supes.

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,202
If you're interested.

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,912
I still want to fight vought.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,248
I just... I want to do it the right way.

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,166
Not covered in quite as many guts.

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,711
- Maeve!
- I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,506
You're gonna leave me and Elena alone.

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,384
You're gonna stop hunting starlight,

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,635
or I release this.

19
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,761
Becca's alive.

20
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,514
She had a little boy, Ryan,
spitting image of homelander.

21
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,477
I do not want my son to have to
go through what I went through.

22
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,812
Ryan, no!

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,665
Promise me that you will save him
no matter what

24
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,107
and you will get him back to me.

25
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,379
People love what I have to say.

26
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,862
They believe in it.

27
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,824
They just don't like the word "Nazi."
That's all.

28
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,536
Becca!

29
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,415
- Where is my son?
- [Gaspingl

30
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,835
Stormfront.

31
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,296
I knew you'd be here.

32
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,349
How could you do this?

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,062
I loved you.

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,356
You'll always be in my heart.

35
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,485
But the fourth reich is in my soul.

36
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,908
Join me, and we can reign together
for a thousand years.

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,534
Never.

38
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,203
You and I are the same.

39
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,246
Perfect genetic specimens.

40
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,667
Think of how beautiful
our children could be.

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,378
They would be the best of both of us.

42
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,925
Flawless Aryan kindersoldaten.

43
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,721
They'd be monsters.

44
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,890
Like you.

45
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,351
Your choice, liebchen.

46
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,689
But not even you could stop me alone.

47
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,565
He's not alone.

48
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,908
What?

49
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,952
Can't let you guys have all the fun.

50
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
Guess this means we're breaking up.

51
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,628
Nazi bitch.

52
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,928
Die, untermensch.

53
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,479
Grab the flash drive!

54
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,189
She's too strong!

55
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,524
How can we beat her?

56
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,900
As a team.

57
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,843
Homelander! Over here. This way.

58
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,512
Maeve, right here.
Look to your right.

59
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,849
Maeve! To your left! Left!

60
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,186
Maeve, over here!

61
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,604
Here with Adam bourke,

62
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,623
- the director of dawn of the seven.
- Yes. That's right.

63
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,727
It seems like all those
reshoots paid off, my friend.

64
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,276
Right, well, after the, you know,

65
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,779
"stormfront's a Nazi" thing,
we had real talks about

66
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,531
shelving the movie
or just dumping it on vought plus.

67
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,826
But, uh, the fans spoke with those
"release the bourke cut" hashtags.

68
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,119
You guys, I love you!

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,663
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,208
- How do I... look?
- You look perfect.

71
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,920
Okay.

72
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,439
Oh! Starlight, starlight!

73
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,757
- Starlight!
- Starlight, to the right, to the right!

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,219
Starlight, over here!

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,930
Starlight, this way!
Starlight, look this way!

76
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,891
Singles, please. Singles, please.

77
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,184
- Starlight!
- One second.

78
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,102
- Move over, other guy!
- Okay.

79
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,147
No, no, no. Over here. Singles, please.

80
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,733
Over here, to the left! To the left!

81
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,276
Just a couple more shots!

82
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,614
It's quite the star you've got there.

83
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,700
And thanks to congresswoman neuman
for joining us tonight.

84
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,245
I hope it demonstrates
vought welcomes the oversight

85
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,288
from the bureau of superhuman affairs.

86
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,667
We've been able to root out
a few bad apples together.

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

88
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,753
If I could just steal him away.

89
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,839
Do me a favor and kill me.

90
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,674
- Only if it's murder-suicide.
- Okay.

91
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,509
Nadia! Nadia!

92
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,511
Hey! Nadia!

93
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,139
- Another picture, please.
- Hey, Nadia!

94
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,826
A-train, it's been over a year
since you've raced.

95
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,935
When are we gonna see you
on the track again?

96
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,186
Real soon.

97
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,397
You know, but we had reshoots,
I've been training.

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,606
But that race is coming,

99
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,150
full speed ahead
for the a-train.

100
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,045
But it's been over a year,
and the people are wondering...

101
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,362
Only questions about the movie.

102
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,239
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, thank you.

103
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,492
- Um, we have black noir here for you.
- Black noir.

104
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,827
Hughie, my man.

105
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,912
I love the big dick energy, bro.

106
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,974
- Who you wearing?
- A-train, right here!

107
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,082
I have no idea.

108
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,042
Good. I didn't give a fuck.

109
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,669
Guys!

110
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,754
Pic!

111
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,757
Who'd have thought,
after everything we've been through,

112
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,902
- that we'd be here together?
- Okay, one more time.

113
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,094
Right in the camera.

114
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,262
Yeah.

115
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,681
Who'd have thought?

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,728
How could you not know
all along that stormfront was a Nazi?

117
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,064
Well, I am just a man
who fell for the wrong woman.

118
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,584
- Uh, but, uh...
- Fell for the wrong woman.

119
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,276
But out of crisis comes change.

120
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,446
- Out of crisis comes change.
- So I spent the last year

121
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,365
really slowing down
and reconnecting with myself.

122
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,660
And I am very excited
for everyone to meet the real me.

123
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,873
You shitty fucking director!

124
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,666
Tony Gilroy had to reshoot all your shit!

125
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,501
I know I'm a fraud, babe! I'm a fraud!

126
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,836
- Oh, fuck!
- Pull my hair!

127
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,379
- Fuck yeah!
- Yeah, pull my hair!

128
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,565
- Yeah, I'm pulling it, baby!
- No, pull it out!

129
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,673
Yeah, yeah!

130
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,302
Kwmd

131
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,348
Mr. Campbell.

132
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,270
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

133
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,829
Jesus Christ!

134
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,666
Not quite.

135
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,293
You look sharp.

136
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,295
French blue.

137
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,547
That suits you.

138
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,967
What are you doing here?

139
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,095
I found that little asshole
we've been on all month.

140
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,305
He's having a knees-up
at a penthouse tonight.

141
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,848
Okay. Who's your source?

142
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,476
My source
is none of your fucking business.

143
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,730
Look, me and the boys, we're all set up.
We just need you to, uh...

144
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,358
Give us a green light.

145
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,734
Okay.

146
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,319
Um, I'll talk to neuman.

147
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,155
Or you could take your tongue
out of her ass,

148
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,449
slap on your big-boy pants

149
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,369
and make a fucking decision.

150
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,083
You got something
you want to say to me?

151
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,210
I think I just fucking said it, son.

152
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,172
Just photos.

153
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,341
No violence or maiming

154
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,760
or-or-or-or torture

155
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,262
or curb stomping

156
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,680
or setting anyone on fire.

157
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,016
Oh, uh...

158
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,561
I'll get you them expense reports
you wanted.

159
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,479
Tomorrow.

160
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,786
J" yeah, give it to me, to me j“

161
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,330
j" don't stop, hey... j“

162
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,807
J" don't stop... j”

163
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,309
God, what is he doing?

164
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,146
- Give it to her, babe.

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go...

167
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,325
Am I really seeing
what I'm seeing?

168
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,238
All she needs now is a vagina.

169
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,907
The little asshole.

170

177
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,013
Excuse me.

00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,844
Oh, yes.

Ah, that's it.

186
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,009
Okay, okay.

187
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,598
Oh, don't... don't stop.

188
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,600
Don't stop.

189
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,143
Get to the prostate.

190
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,187
Yes.

191
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,730
Oh, don't stop.

192
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,904
Oh, don't stop.

193
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,641
- Is okay.

00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,685
I see nothing. I go, okay?

195
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,019
Wait!

196
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,771
You can't leave.

197
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,565
No, no, no, no, no.

198
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,451
No! No, putain!

199

He's trying to get in my ass! Get him out!

Oh, no!

No, go!

205
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,597
Go on, son. Have a bump.

206
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,477
Fucking lightweight.

207
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,192
No, no, no.

208
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,113
Call the bureau.

209
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,531
You're gonna let him live?

210
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,576
Governor's orders.

211
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,496
And put that little cunt on his side.

212
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,248
Jiminy cricket's od'ing.

213

Good morning.

What do you say I brush my teeth

216
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,946
and we do things to each other?

217
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,117

229
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,321
Funny story. Um, you know
my dentist, Dr. Horowitz?

230
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,324
- Mm-hmm.
- I was getting a crown, and he said,

231
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,660
he was a huge starlight fan.

232
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,743
- Oh, is he?
- Like, out of the blue, and I'm like,

233
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,414
"well, you know, she's dating my son."

234
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,960
He was, "what?" So, um...
I gave him your number.

235
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,298
Dad, why would, why would
you give him my number, dad?

236
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,508
- Why would I give...
- Dad?

237
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,445
Dad, you got to move,

238
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,069

239
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,855
- You know, I was... anyway.
- Listen, I, uh,

240
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,117

241
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,684

Don't know. It depends.
Um, you gonna bring aquafresh?

246
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,284
I would brush with monistat
if it meant I could have sex with... you.

247
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,785
That's very romantic.

248
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,578
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Have a good day.

00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,707

256
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,810
caught a supe masturbating
outside her window.

257
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,562
Okay, how's she know it's a supe?

258
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,397
Window was on a 737.

259
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,274
That's a supe.

260
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,069
Uh, okay, I'll have an ID for you
by tomorrow. Thanks, Ivy.

261
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,656
That's Hugh Campbell, right?

262
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,491
He helped bring down stormfront?

263
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,076
And he's dating starlight.

264
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,787
J" uptown girl, she's been living... j”

J" as long as anyone with hot blood can j'

267
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,546
From serving
his country as a soldier

268
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,340
to serving the American people
as secretary of defense,

269
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,692
a democrat who reaches across the aisle...

270
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,885
- Give me a bite.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

271
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,554
Unite and heal america...

272
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,056
You want the Valtrex before or after?

273
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,475
You love that bagel so much
you're gonna fake herpes?

274
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,645
I could have herpes.
You don't think I could have herpes?

275
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,874
How'd surveillance go
with termite last night?

276
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,067
You know, I haven't checked in
with butcher yet, but...

277
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,443
I'm sure it went fine.

278
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,881
Don't... no, don't give me that face.

279
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,741
I'll bet you a crisp $100 bill
something got fucked up.

280
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,702
- You don't know that.
- Okay, take the bet.

281
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,665
I'm-I'm not gonna take the bet, but...

282
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,042
- Uh, wow, really?
- Mm-hmm.

283
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,795
Okay, still, butcher delivers every time.

284
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,131
And I have to apologize
for him every time.

285
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,968
Look, butcher's the guy you want
in a shooting war. No question.

286
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:15,970
But we're in peacetime.

287
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,518
Oh, my god. So worth the herpes.

288
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,229
It's great.

289
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,537
Can I help you?

290
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,830
I'm just waiting to see Nadia.

291
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,212
That's congresswoman Victoria neuman.
You have the wrong person.

292
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,089
We're best friends.

293
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,674
I will give her the message.

294
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,217
This way, pal.

295
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,722
Tony.

296
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,223
She'll remember.

297
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,668
ID?

298
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,086
There you go.

299
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,381
Go ahead.

300
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,590
Cheers.

301
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,676
Straight ahead.

302
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,608
Butcher!

303
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,779
All right, lad, how are you?
You all right?

304
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,447
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Eh?

305
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,949
Look at you. Here you go.

306
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,992
You'll never guess what that is.

307
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,544
You done your homework?

308
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,462
I hate math.

309
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,424
Aunt grace gets pissed when I'm wrong.

310
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,592
Yeah, you and me both.

311
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,222
Mom used to help.

312
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,559
She was really good at math.

313
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,810
Yeah.

314
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,187
She was a clever one.

315
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,108
I had another nightmare.

316
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,194
Same one? Your dad?

317
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,405
This time, he...

318
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,368
Burns everything down and then kills me.

319
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,246
One day, you'll be tough enough.

320
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,665
And then he can't hurt you.

321
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,462
But till then,
you're safe here with the colonel.

322
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,339
Honest.

323
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,763
Connect four.

324
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,642
Oh, you... you cheeky little blighter.

325
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,022
You could stay if you want.

326
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,857
Well, that's a generous offer, grace,

327
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,234
but I ain't banged a blue hair
since I was a lad.

328
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,321
You know, calling you an asshole
is an insult to assholes.

329
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,284
My point is, Marvin got out.

330
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,203
Maybe there's hope for you, too.

331
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,419
I shouldn't get too close to him.
I would just fuck it up.

332
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,422
I hear you've been
on the straight and narrow all year.

333
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,549
No drinking, no killing supes.

334
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,053
You even follow Hugh Campbell's orders
without strangling him.

335
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,846
Now you're just being cruel.

336
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,599
I know you're not doing all that
for yourself.

337
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,477
So then who?

338
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,482
Exactly.

339
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,568
That alone makes you a better man
than your father ever was.

340
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,156
Maybe you're not such an asshole.

341
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,495
Get the kid a fucking burger
now and then, would you?

342
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,844
There he is!

343
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,763
Bro!

344
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,515
Bro, come here.

345
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,975
Oh! Hey.

346
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,685
It's great to see you.

347
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,162
Did you just have the slot before me?

348
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,647
Yeah, I'm just stumping
for my book deeper.

349
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,940
Went awesome.

350
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,817
I sent you a copy. Did you not get it?

351
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,837
Don't worry, I got, like,
hundreds of them. I'll send you more.

352
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,155
It's about how me and my wife Cassandra
escaped that fucking cult.

353
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,992
You remember my wife Cassandra, right?

354
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,079
Oh, did you see that profile
that Malcolm gladwell

355
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,414
did on me in the new yorker?

356
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,916
He called me "the next Leah remini."
No big deal.

357
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,837
I mean, my numbers are going up, coach.
Put me back in the game.

358
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,046
How?

359
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,551
How did you get the slot before me?

360
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,240
It was a fucked-up mistake.

361
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,534
- That talent booker is so fucking fired.
- I'm asking him.

362
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,809
I'm asking you.

363
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,936
I don't... I, uh...

364
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,606
I don't know. I don't know.

365
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,568
But it's... fucking ridiculous.

366
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,778
I-I should never go before you.

367
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,364
Obviously. I'm a nobody compared to you.

368
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,510
You want to know a secret?
I didn't even write the fucking book.

369
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,161
Shia labeouf's ghostwriter did.

370
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,790
Uh, it's crazy.

371
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,667
It's stupid. Sorry.

372
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
That's very sweet of you to say, deep.

373
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,056
Good to see you.

374
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,433
You, too, sir.

375
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,187
- Hey.
- Hey.

376
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,022
What was that?

377
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,732
I actually think that went pretty well.

378
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,238
Let's get to the elephant in the room.
The mainstream media won't leave it alone.

379
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,366
- Mmm.
- How could you not know

380
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,867
that stormfront was a Nazi?

381
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,661
Well, okay.

382
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,829
So let me say it again, cam.

383
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,414
Um, I may be a superhero,

384
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,893
but I'm also just a man
who fell in love with the wrong woman.

385
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,311
Well, we all know what that's like.

386
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,503
Right, yeah.

387
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,714
Look, i-I'm not perfect, Cameron.
Far from it. Uh...

388
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,425
I know I'm bulletproof on the outside.

389
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,344
But in here, this?

390
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,638
It isn't.

391
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,891
I'm just as human as all the rest of you.

392
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,061
More with homelander after this.

393
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,023
And we're clear!

394
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,198
That sounded really good.

395
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,124
Who's the birthday girl? Hey!

396
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,750
- Want to see what I got you?
- Yeah.

397
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,711
Ooh, you're gonna love this.

398
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,463
Yeah, boy!

399
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,632
- See how it fits.
- All right, all right, all right.

400
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,552
- That looks great.
- Birthday photos.

401
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,929
- Oh, Jackie, can you take this?
- Oh. Sure.

402
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,931
Thank you.

403
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,476
Oh, Todd, Todd! Over here.

404
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,561
Photos!

405
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,396
Photos, photos.

406
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,565
- Okay, with Jackie? Okay.
- You know what?

407
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,691
It's okay. All right.

408
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,585
Let's all say, um,
"happy birthday, Janine!"

409
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,445
Happy birthday, Janine!

410
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,949
Oh, silly face, silly face.

411
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,577
Now superhero! Give us a superhero.

412
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,502
You don't have to do that.

413
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,088
- Oh, I don't mind.
- Marvin?

414
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,675
You taking your Lexapro?

415
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,010
I'm fine, Monique.

416
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,680
This is just me helping out
at my daughter's birthday party.

417
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,058
Great party, by the way.

418
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,101
Yeah, she's...

419
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,644
She's having fun.

420
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,856
I'm sorry about all the superhero stuff.

421
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,524
- She insisted, and...
- It's all good.

422
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,318
It's behind me now. I'm over it.

423
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,362
You've seen me
in the last 12 months, right?

424
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,990
I'm straight. It's ancient history.

425
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,036
- I know.
- Hey.

426
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,121
You got a couple of hours on Friday night?

427
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,459
I was thinking maybe we could
meet over at cafe delfini's,

428
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,961
have some tilapia, go over
some co-parenting things.

429
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,254
Mmm, co-parenting things?

430
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,714
- Yeah.
- Really?

431
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,549
Where we had our first date?

432
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,594
Strictly business.

433
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,722
Scheduling things,
like soccer practice, dance recital...

434
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,891
You got to move on, Marvin.

435
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,393
The way you moved on with Todd or...

436
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,481
Sorry.

437
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,151
J" happy birthday to you j'

438
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,404
j" happy birthday to you j'

439
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:58,450
j" happy birthday dear Janine j'

440
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:03,080
j" happy birthday to you j'

441
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,333
Happy birthday, baby!

442
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,264
V24, huh?

443
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,059
Marketing
is still testing the name.

444
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,769
But it's the future, Bob.

445
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,314
One dose of this temporary v

446
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,567
gives a soldier 24 hours of powers.

447
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,818
Give or take.

448
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,404
And then they return right back to normal.

449
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,738
How stable is it?

450
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,867
Still ironing out the kinks.

451
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,285
And if it's temporary,

452
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,538
that means the dod
has to keep buying doses.

453
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,249
At how much a hit?

454
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,834
Two million, roughly.

455
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,378
80 over the course
of a month-long operation,

456
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,630
that's 60 million per soldier.

457
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,799
600 million per squad.

458
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,595
Campaign going well, is it?

459
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,848
I appreciate your contribution
to my super pac.

460
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,017
People do love
a cowboy in the white house.

461
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,227
I hear they're even
calling you Dakota Bob.

462
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,898
So how would it look
if you pass up the opportunity

463
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,233
to give our brave soldiers superpowers?

464
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:17,571
Supes in the army
are an unmitigated shit show.

465
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:22,075
What black noir did
to that hard rock cafe in Lagos?

466
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,077
Should be brought up on war crimes.

467
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,721
- You're right.
- I'm sorry?

468
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,224
You are absolutely right.

469
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,560
The problem, of course,
was making the super into heroes.

470
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,395
I don't follow.

471
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,606
Making them figures to be worshipped.

472
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,358
The fame, the movies,

473
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,194
the depraved sex... it ruined them.

474
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,570
Cone of silence?

475
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,657
In five years, I hope to be out
of the superhero business entirely.

476
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,116
Bullshit.

477
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,701
This should be a serious company.

478
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,787
A defense and pharmaceutical company.

479
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,416
Not a day care dealing with
spoiled children and dead prostitutes.

480
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,212
But the point is,
you won't have to worry about any of that.

481
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:19,716
Because your soldiers
will only be super... temporarily.

482
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,721
The product... finally perfected.

483
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,393
Stan...

484
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,145
When you say compound v...

485
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,438
V24.

486
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,002
Do you know what the public hears?

487
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,316
Gestapo.

488
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,151
Swastika.

489
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,237
And that's your fault.

490
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,365
You used a Nazi to sell it.

491
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,159
Compound v is radio-fucking-active.

492
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,537
It's not gonna fly in congress.

493
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,791
I still have a few strings
that I can pull in congress.

494
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,713
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on, really?

495
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,566
I got good news and bad news.
What do you want to hear first?

496
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,134
The, uh, good news.

497
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,427
There's no good news.

498
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,596
Bad news is, termite's off the table.

499
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,265
- W hat?
- Vought just closed

500
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,826
a big endorsement for him with terminex.

501
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,852
We've been chasing termite for months!

502
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,896
I know, but after butcher force-fed him
a metric belushi of coke,

503
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,690
I didn't have much leverage, did I?

504
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,986
It was just a little coke
'cause he was... small.

505
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,156
Anyway, he's going to the global
wellness retreat in Malibu,

506
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,742
and in return we're getting
cold snap, stacker and airburst.

507
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,702
Fucking b-iisters! Really?

508
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,370
Three b-iisters, real assholes.

509
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,539
Cold snap for domestic battery.

510
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,832
It's not a bad trade.

511
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,806
How much is supe collateral
down this year?

512
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,923
- Sixty percent.
- Sixty percent.

513
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,260
That's 60% more people at home
with their kids, and we did that.

514
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,471
Hughie, you and I built this place.

515
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,224
And we did it the right way
without being covered in blood and guts.

516
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,435
Right?

517
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,521
You're irritating, but...

518
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,232
- But yes.
- Okay.

519
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,236
So, please, just... trust me.

520
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,576
You must be having
a fucking laugh.

521
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,705
That little cunt crawled up
a guy's cock and blew him to bits.

522
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,708
He almost killed frenchie,
and you're just gonna let him go

523
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,377
'cause Stan Edgar asked nice?

524
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,088
Supe collateral damage is down 60%.

525
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,091
Oh, come off it.
That's that twat neuman talking.

526
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,135
She has locked up more supes this year
than every other year combined.

527
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,763
Then you're a fucking twat.
Hughie, you're working with vought!

528
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,682
|'m_-

529
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,979
Fuck me. I should've done termite
when I had the chance.

530
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,399
Look, look, look, things are good.

531
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,983
We're actually winning.

532
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,696
- Winning, are we?
- Yeah.

533
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,283
Locking up a couple of nobodies
ain't winning.

534
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,037
They got all the money and all the power,
and they want us dead.

535
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,831
We're outmanned and outgunned,

536
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,167
and we got to put them cunts in a box
before they do it to us.

537
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,294
If you would just compromise
a little bit...

538
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,172
"Compromise"? Fuck you.
Your whole life's a compromise.

539
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,466
Hey, at least I have a fucking life!

540
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,845
I didn't mean that.

541
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,016
Look. Look.

542
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,352
Can we just stop dancing around this?

543
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,896
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I left.

544
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
- You think I give a shite?
- Yeah, I think you do.

545
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,823
I think you're pissed
that mm and I both left.

546
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,778
Mm was a bit of a loss. You not so much.

547
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,284
Butcher...

548
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,828
It's been a year.

549
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,873
You can stop all this.

550
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,002
It's okay to stop. To move on.

551
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,088
She would've wanted you to.

552
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,382
Oi, Stevie fucking wonder!

553
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,218
Will you knock it off?
You're doing me fucking head in!

554
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,095
Jesus fucking Christ.

555
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,014
Everyone's losing their fucking minds.

556
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,683
Hey.

557
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,648
Or maybe they're just trying to be happy.

558
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,241
I thought it sounded great.

559
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,228
Homelander and queen Maeve,

560
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,688
- oh, my god, they're leaving us!
- Take these two!

561
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,625
- Whoa, no.
- Just these two, please!

562
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,251
No. What?
So they can tell the world

563
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,195
that we left the rest of them
to fucking die? No. You stay back!

564
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,155
All of you, stay back!

565
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,741
You stay the fuck back,
or I 7! Laser you, goddamn it!

566
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,368
I 7! Laser every fucking one of you!

567
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,999
Excuse me, starlight.

568
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,460
I need the room.
I got a meeting with Stan.

569
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,504
Actually, I invited you both.

570
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,797
Have a seat.

571
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,550
- Great.
- Oh, uh...

572
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,899
I remember when you first arrived,
starlight.

573
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,402
A farm girl from Kansas.

574
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,654
Bright-eyed like Dorothy in oz.

575
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,322
Iowa. And not a farm.

576
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,865
Oh, well, look how far you've come.

577
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,160
Polling at 96, a new vought record.

578
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,831
I don't have to tell you
that our brand has been a bit tarnished

579
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,208
since that nasty business last year.

580
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,587
But you have restored a wholesome,

581
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,506
trustworthy image to the company
when we needed it the most.

582
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,801
Which is why the board
wants to make you...

583
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,928
Cocaptain of the seven.

584
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,013
What?

585
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,017
Cocaptain?

586
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,896
But-but...

587
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,108
Homelander is captain.
I mean, you're-you're captain.

588
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,277
This will be beneficial to you both.

589
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,904
Your numbers are down,
what, uh, double digits?

590
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,532
The public still associates you
with stormfront.

591
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,576
This would be a real bump.

592
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,621
A rising tide lifts all boats.

593
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,873
That's very thoughtful of you, Stan.

594
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,296
- When does the board vote?
- They already did this morning.

595
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,590
All that's left
is for starlight to say yes.

596
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,885
No. I mean, I mean, I'm flattered,

597
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,512
thank you, but no, thank you.

598
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,806
If anybody, it should be Maeve.

599
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,600
Maeve doesn't have a 96.

600
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,895
Nobody does. Except you, apparently.

601
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,483
Homelander?

602
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,611
Could you give us a moment?

603
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,946
Look, I'd really like
to keep discussing this.

604
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,783
Absolutely. Set a time with Samantha,
and we'll get you in.

605
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,165
Mmm, great.

606
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,460
- No problem.
- Excellent.

607
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,214
My schedule is pretty full,
but I'll try and find you a window.

608
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,763
Okay, sir, there is no way.
I mean, you saw him. He's...

609
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,099
He can get as pissy as he wants.

610
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:28,019
As long as I'm ceo of vought,
he's under control, and we both know why.

611
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,356
Y-You know that he can,
he can probably hear you.

612
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,358
Good. I hope he does.

613
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,776
Starlight.

614
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,237
Real power...

615
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,198
Isn't this.

616
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,910
It's the ability to bend the world
to your will.

617
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,705
You would decide what the seven do.

618
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,249
What causes they support.

619
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:55,171
Full authority
to fill the team's empty slots.

620
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,218
I'm offering you...

621
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,847
Real power.

622
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,266
You should think about it.

623
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,753
It's been almost a year since
church chairman Alastair adana

624
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,421
has been seen in public.

625
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,257
Yeah, well, they say he's on,
uh, sabbatical, but who knows?

626
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:45,180
What I do know is that there are
literally thousands of tortured souls

627
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,699
who are trapped in that church right now

628
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,534
who want to escape
just like me and my wife did.

629
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,268
- That's very brave.
- Thank you.

630
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,646
Your book deeper has been a game changer.

631
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,649
Obviously, you've had your past troubles,

632
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,234
but I think people are surprised

633
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,612
at how sensitive
and insightful you really are.

634
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,822
After your last Ted talk,
vanity fair called you,

635
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,074
- "the thinking person's superhero."
- They did.

636
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,951
With only
three contestants left,

637
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,411
who will join the seven?

638
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,038
Will it be supersonic?

639
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,665
He first exploded onto the scene
as drummer boy.

640
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,794
J" kick off those uggs
and slide up next to me, all right j'

641
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,897
Hero, Christian
and triple-threat member

642
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,672
of the multiplatinum group super-sweet...

643
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,591
J” got Netflix in my mailbox... j'

644
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,719
when he broke hearts everywhere
by dating a certain rising star

645
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,679
on the capes for Christ circuit.

646
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,556
But that was long ago.

647
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,601
Today drummer boy
has become a man, going solo,

648
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,645
changing his name to supersonic

649
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,147
and setting his sights on American hero.

650
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,525
And maybe on an old flame.

651
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,408
Or is it starlight
who's keeping the fires burning?

652
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,703
Livewire... please hang
up your cape and go.

653
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,581
Two contestants
will win coveted slots in the seven.

654
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:57,585
So who will go home,
and who will be the next American hero?

655
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,921
Hi.

656
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,017
Oh, my god. Come on.

657
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,686
- Hi. Hey. Hi.
- Hi!

658
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,937
Hughie, what's up, my man?

659
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,289
How's it going, guys?
What are you guys doing?

660
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,857
We're running lines, actually.

661
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,817
For a reality show?

662
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,027
Right? The reality behind the reality.

663
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,154
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, um... oh, man,

664
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,532
I was in the, uh, control room,
and they had this, like,

665
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,618
- bio thing on you.
- Oh, god, I'm sorry.

666
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,204
Yeah, that boy band shit
is so embarrassing.

667
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,623
You know what,
I really like "rock my kiss."

668
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,875
- Really?
- I do.

669
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,334
Did you? I... I actually...

670
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,420
Wait, I thought it made you puke.

671
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,426
- Shut up. Shut up!
- It's true.

672
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,445
What are you guys, what are you,
what are you talking about?

673
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,055
Okay, be careful.
I can still kick you off the show.

674
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,516
He has a right to know.
Come on, we were, what, 19?

675
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,685
- Eighteen.
- Okay, so 18,

676
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,248
the band was performing
at the opening of voughtland St. Louis.

677
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,524
But before the show,
Annie and I snuck into a cantina.

678
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,360
And they had those...
I mean, those yards of Margarita...

679
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,571
I must have drank a quarter mile.

680
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,033
80, middle of the show,
we bring out starlight to do a number.

681
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,536
And little orphan alky
steps onto the stage,

682
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,290
and she just pukes
in front of a festival crowd.

683
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,627
I mean, the tweens, they lost their shit.

684
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,045
Humiliating.

685
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,297
Wow, that's... I-I had no idea
you drank back then.

686
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,927
Oh, yeah, miss goody two-shoes,
she had a fun side, big time.

687
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,615
And-and really great
that you guys are still...

688
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,224
So close, just really, really great.

689
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,976
You have nothing to worry about.

690
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,063
No. No, no, no, totally. He's gross.

691
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,940
And you've known him your whole life.

692
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,876
And he, you know, took your virginity,
so why would I worry?

693
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,194
Okay, it was a mutual
taking of virginities.

694
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,947
And you know what,
it happened so long ago,

695
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,490
and only a couple of times.

696
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,201
- Wait, really?
- Yeah, you know, we were really religious,

697
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,371
and we weren't married,
so it felt weird having sex.

698
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,247
I mean, sex-sex.

699
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,042
We did a ton of butt stuff.

700
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,713
I'm fucking with you.

701
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,465
Okay.

702
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,676
- Come on.
- Yeah, never do that again.

703
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,178
Wow, uh...

704
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,724
Cocaptain, huh? Wow, that's, uh...

705
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,809
Is it crazy?

706
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,995
I mean, vought's the worst thing
that's ever happened to us,

707
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,455
and now you want
to be their Ronald McDonald?

708
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,689
So, yeah, a little crazy.

709
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:28,027
Yeah, but first female cocaptain
of any super team.

710
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,362
Ever. I mean...

711
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,532
Think about what that would mean
to millions of girls.

712
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,201
I'm sorry, i-I'm just surprised, I guess.

713
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,078
I mean, is this your mom talking or you?

714
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,123
I'm the one whose feet bled

715
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,166
at all of those pageants.

716
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,752
Okay? I've paid a lot.

717
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,256
And, finally, finally,
I could have some real power

718
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,342
that I could use,
and I could make trouble at vought.

719
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,677
Do some real good.

720
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,220
Or homelander can murder you.

721
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,222
Someone needs to stand up to this guy.

722
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,865
- And that has to be you?
- Not just me.

723
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,685
I mean, I could bring good people
into the seven who could help me.

724
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,395
What, you mean like your boyfriend?

725
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,443
It's not a good look, hughie.

726
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,529
No one even bats an eye
when a man climbs the ladder.

727
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,090
Okay, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

728
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,532
Look, I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

729
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,411
So I'll see you later tonight?

730
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,539
Don't bother with the aquafresh.

731
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,693
Hey, homelander.

732
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,531
What are you drinking?

733
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,870
- Shake shack.
- Oh.

734
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,016
You want one? I'll go grab a pa for...

735
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,291
Oh, no, no. Thank you, though.

736
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,459
Yeah.

737
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,295
I see you got the extra
whipped cream in there, huh?

738
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,463
Yeah.

739
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,672
Yummers.

740
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,594
I guess you wanted to cram in
as much "fat fuck" as possible, huh?

741
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,582
- Did I do something wrong?
- You think I haven't seen you?

742
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,352
Shoving back two dozen cupcakes
in the breakroom?

743
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,271
Nine servings
on miro's truffle Risotto night?

744
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,898
- Hmm?
- Hey, man.

745
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,193
You know I need 30,000 calories a day.

746
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,778
Maybe when you actually ran, you did.

747
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,447
But now you're just eating your feelings.

748
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,407
Making us look ridiculous.

749
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,870
"The fastest man alive."
What a fucking joke.

750
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,165
- Fuck you, man.
- What did you say?

751
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,628
Nothing. Nothing.

752
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,589
- What did you say to me?
- I'm sorry.

753
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,091
I'm sorry. Shit!

754
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,801
I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean it.

755
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,637
- Say it.
- I' m s...

756
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,348
- Say it!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

757
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,006
But not everyone
rejects stormfront.

758
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,718
A group called the stormchasers
still celebrate her racist dogma.

759
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,345
After finding each other on 4chan,

760
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,891
the stormchasers rallied online
in the days and weeks after...

761
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,142
How are you?

762
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,188
Wonderful now that you're here.

763
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,525
Is something wrong, my love?

764
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,444
You know, I'm just...

765
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,615
Skulking around
like a frightened schoolgirl.

766
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,451
Apologizing when I've done nothing wrong.

767
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:12,126
Today, uh, they made starlight cocaptain.

768
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,378
No.

769
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,880
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

770
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,633
My poor baby.

771
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,843
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

772
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,139
- No one suffers like you suffer.
- Mm-mmm.

773
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,933
Let me help.

774
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,893
Honestly...

775
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,771
I have to put up
with these fucking people.

776
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,919
They hold that video
over my head month after month.

777
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,570
They took my son from me.

778
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,615
They want me... here you go.

779
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,618
See, they want me weak,
castrated.

780
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,662
They should be worshipping me.

781
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,372
Tremble at my feet.

782
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,916
Put a knife
to their children's throat,

783
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,002
like Abraham to Isaac, if I say so.

784
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,504
Oh, they will.

785
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:01,425
When you lead an army
of Aryan ubermensch to their victory.

786
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,386
What? No.

787
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,221
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

788
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,848
No, no! How many times
do I have to tell you?

789
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,517
We don't need a fucking master race.

790
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,727
I'm the master race. That's the point.

791
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,980
That's the whole point.

792
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,983
No, you have to.

793
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,902
It took a hundred years,
but we finally found you.

794
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,153
- No, no.
- It's your destiny.

795
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,822
Oh, my god. Whatever.

796
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,867
Just, uh...

797
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,287
- Rest.
- W hat?

798
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,664
No. Please.

799
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,251
Please!

800
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,392
I heard termite walked.

801
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,895
My lead was good. What happened?

802
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,067
Don't ask.

803
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,446
Well, we got to talk.

804
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,576
I think I have something.

805
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,376
Soldier boy. 80 what?

806
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,836
Remember how he died?

807
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,172
Stopping a nuclear meltdown in Ohio.

808
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,467
'83, '84, I think,
got buried beneath a reactor.

809
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,135
Always thought it was bollocks.

810
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,012
Yeah, you thought right.

811
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,431
Read.

812
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,642
What's bcl red?

813
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,395
If you believe the rumors,
it's the thing that killed soldier boy.

814
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,981
Some kind of gun or weapon or something.

815
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,901
Had to have been a fucking h-bomb.
He was nearly as strong as...

816
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:51,577
If we can find this weapon
or whatever it is,

817
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,582
maybe we can use it
to blow homelander's fucking brains out.

818
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,629
If it is real, not some fucking fable.

819
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,347
Payback.

820
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,183
- What a bunch of fucking wankers.
- I'll say.

821
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,770
When the seven passed them
as the number one super team,

822
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,314
crimson countess sent me
a box of cat shit.

823
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,109
She was fucking soldier boy.

824
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,361
And, uh, gunpowder was his sidekick.

825
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,823
If anyone knows
what happened to him, they do.

826
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,325
Your mate noir was in payback.

827
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,077
Why don't you ask him?

828
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,623
Even if that walking tumor could talk,
it wouldn't be to me. Here.

829
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,379
What's this?

830
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,922
It's temp v.

831
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,217
One shot makes you a supe for 24 hours.

832
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,556
I mean, they think. It's still in R&D.

833
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,308
Oh, great, so powers, maybe.

834
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,936
Maybe my bollocks swell up
like footballs. Yeah?

835
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,064
Payback may be a bunch of fuck holes,
but they're strong.

836
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,691
And they're dangerous.

837
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,652
If you're going against them,
you're gonna need it.

838
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,243
And what makes you think that me,

839
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,204
of all people, would want
to turn into one of you?

840
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,249
This is our best chance
to kill homelander.

841
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,251
Don't fuck it up.

842
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,643
If you want to watch me have a wank,
it'll cost you a tenner.

843
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,647
May I come in?

844
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,157
Where's Ryan?

845
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,122
He's at 673 nosh my bollocks ave.

846
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,083
You want a pen and paper?

847
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:48,462
You know I could just pull you apart
limb by limb.

848
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,464
Make you tell me.

849
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,091
Nah, that'd be worthless.

850
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,926
Victim always goes into shock.

851
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,679
You got to start small.
Fingers, toenails, ears.

852
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,472
He's my son, William.

853
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,516
My family.

854
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,435
I'm gonna find him sooner or later.

855
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,568
Look, uh_.

856
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,654
I don't mean to be rude,

857
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,366
but can we just skip to the part
where you laser my fucking brains out?

858
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,201
Oh, for Christ sakes.

859
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,578
Where's the sport in that?

860
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,080
No, look at you.

861
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,001
It'd be like putting down a wounded dog.

862
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,961
You're the one
with your tail between your legs

863
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,504
on all them fucking talk shows.

864
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,841
And then they go
and make starlight cocaptain.

865
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,634
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

866
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,720
That's got to sting.

867
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,558
Touché, William.

868
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,561
Touché.

869
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,063
What are you doing here?

870
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,114
Vought and the fucking bureau.

871
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,617
The wheeling and dealing.

872
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,702
And-and-and-and giving and taking.

873
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,830
Just to keep everything exactly the same.

874
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,791
And you and me?

875
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,295
Well, they treat us like old playthings
and put us up on the fucking shelf?

876
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,965
Treat us like we're obsolete.

877
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,886
Doesn't that make you angry?

878
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,351
Yeah.

879
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,228
It does.

880
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,314
What if...

881
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,109
What if it doesn't have to be that way?

882
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,948
What if...

883
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,452
You and I...

884
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,043
Well, what if we share
a different destiny?

885
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,798
Something... a little more...

886
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,008
Scorched earth,

887
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,844
shock and awe,

888
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,555
blood and bone.

889
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:09,561
And in the end,
only one of us left standing.

890
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,902
Isn't that what you want?

891
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,991
Too fucking right.

892
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,203
More than anything.

893
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,955
Mm-hmm.

894
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,457
I look foward to it.

895
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:45,305
J" stars shining bright above you j“

896
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,602
j" night breezes seem to whisper j“

897
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,688
j" "I love you"j'

898
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:57,985

899
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:03,157
j" dream a little dream of me j“

900
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,870

902
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,918
j" just hold me tight and tell me j“

903
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,962
j" you'll miss me j'

904
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,007
j" while I'm alone j”

905
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,509
j" and blue as can be j'

906
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,721
j" dream a little dream... j

907
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,099
- see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

908
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,735
Nadia! Hey, Nadia!

909
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,358
Hey, Tony.

910
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,027
How you been?

911
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,904
Not as good as you.

912
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,156
I see you on TV all the time, Nadia.

913
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,283
I'm not Nadia anymore.

914
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,328
You can't come around
the office calling me that.

915
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,830
We were best friends.

916
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,915
That was a long time ago, Tony.

917
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,837
We should tell everyone.
You have a platform now.

918
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,713
We should tell everyone about red river.

919
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,841
It's not that easy, Tony.

920
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,717
I need people to know what happened to me.

921
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,554
Tony, I can't.

922
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,764
Please.

923
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,852
Okay.

924
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,021
Yeah?

925
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,231
Yeah.

926
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,955
Oh, Tony.

927
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,251
Why'd you have to come looking for me?

928
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,163
It's me.

929
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,165
I'm in trouble.

930
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,667
Fuck! Um...

931
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,044
Ineed_.

932
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,422
I need a team.

933
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,717
Alleyway, east 12th and Broadway.

934
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,646
