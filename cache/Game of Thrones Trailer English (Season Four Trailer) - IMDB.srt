00:00:03,434 --> 00:00:05,208
People love their king.

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,872
They know I saved the city,
they know I've won the war.

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,554
The war's not won.

5
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,615
It's tempting to see your enemies
as evil.

6
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:29,798
But there's good and evil on both sides
in every war ever fought.

7
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:34,767
They have a choice.

8
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:39,381
They can live in my new world,
or they can die in their old one.

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,979
Thing  ... are be tense right now

10
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,425
I don't think I'm talking my way out
of this one.

11
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:52,219
The wildlings breach the Wall
they'll roll over everything and every one.

12
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:57,777
Get any opportunity, what do we do
to those who hurt the ones we love?

13
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:02,365
I want to know which side you're on.

14
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,200
Tell your father I'm here.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,215
And tell him the Lannisters are not
the only ones that pay their debts.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,147
You fight over him like beasts
until you tear him apart.

17
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:17,381
I will burn our House to the ground
before I let that happen.

18
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:19,824
Polize?

19
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:21,914
tonight we fight!

20
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:24,647
There's only one Hell.

21
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,112
The one we live in now.

22
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:37,996
If you want justice ... you've come to the wrong place.
