So for just $9.99,

30
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,216
I can teach you how to come up
with the perfect arrangement.

31
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,654
It'll all be included
in my online class
called "How to Sugar."

[Eddy] Bitch,
you would not believe my day.

37
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,152
I got lectured by
a 12-year-old I was tutoring

38
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,689
about the realities
of making it in Hollywood.

39
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,525
Apparently, I don't have it.

40
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,460
Then, their dad had the nerve
to explain to me

41
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,163
that if I keep wasting my money
on expensive smoothies,

42
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,033
I'll never own a home.

43
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:49,336
It's like, "Sir, maybe I buy
$17 smoothies to dull the pain

44
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,907
because I know I'll never be
able to afford real estate."

45
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,677
-Is that--
-[Marie] Yes.

46
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,947
I didn't know
Chanel did Afterpay.

47
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,684
It was a gift from a daddy.

48
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,652
Well, a former daddy.

49
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:08,122
By the way, Chanel retains
its value as well as Hermès.

50
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,457
You could make bank off of this.

51
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,392
Sometimes I forget that
you grew up around all this.

52
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,895
Well, growing up rich
and being rich

53
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,863
are two very different things.

54
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,565
I think my mom is the only woman

55
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,200
who left her marriage
with less than she went in with.

56

to keep supporting me.

Well, all else fails,

61

to selling pics

for a few years now. [laughs]

instead of DMing it
directly to your fans.

123
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,296
The home page is
strictly designed to tease.

The DMs are
for the naughty shit.

The dumber and drunker

they call it "sex work"

the kind of viral you dream of

they break up.

157
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:49,870
I gotta scoot.
I have acting class.

158
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,039
Look, I don't do
this for everyone,

159
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,141
but you could

160
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,811
and you should be
making way more.

161
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,512
I'm going on
a content trip tomorrow

162
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,081
with some girls from FanZen.

163
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,216
We dress like sluts,
take a bunch of pics,

164
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,718
make a ton of TikToks.

165
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,919
You should totally come.

166
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,356
-What's the catch?
-No catch.

167
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,225
Well, it's only in Big Bear,
not Cancún, like we hoped.

168
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,361
But we're gonna have a masseuse,

169
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,163
a private chef,
and Ozempic shot.

170
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,733
-I'm in.
-Awesome!

171
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,835
Oh, shit, I'm gonna be late
for my Al-Anon meeting.

172
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,837
I'll text you
the address for pickup.

173
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,438
Get excited, bitch.

174
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,674
Welcome to your life
beyond the patriarchy.

175
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,111
-[Marie] Bye.
-[Lucky] Bye.

176
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,249
[Marie]
We're manifesting a whale.

177
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,351
We're manifesting
that he's gonna be hot.

178
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,953
It's gonna be great.

179
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,955
-Yeah. It's gonna be great.
-[phone chimes]

180
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,730
We're making connections.

181
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,899
You have the pussy,

182
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,834
so you have the power.

183
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,405
So, what are you looking for?

184
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,974
Um, well, looking for?

185
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,743
Well, I was married
for a long time.

186
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,378
Now I'm divorced.

187
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:08,182
I think, you know,
dating's pretty complicated.

188
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,920
I guess what I want is difficult
to explain on a first date.

189
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,756
[chuckles] Let me guess.

190
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,826
You wanna dom the shit
out of a filthy little slut.

191
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,128
Yeah. Okay. [chuckles]

192
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,130
Probably a lot of guys
say that, do they, yeah?

193
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,867
But also, I--you know,
I do want a connection.

194
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,670
I wanna, you know,
get to know you a little bit.

195
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,840
What you like and what you do
with your free time.

196
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,308
You don't get to know me yet.

197
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,943
It's $200 to pass GO.

198
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,581
Okay.

199
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:44,452
[phone chimes]

200
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,422
I like to cum.

201

[Jeff chuckles nervously]

[phone chimes]

203
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,465
I like art, okay?

204
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:00,601
Oh, that's a coincidence.
I like art, too.

205
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,305
-What's your favorite piece?
-It's a Renoir.

206
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:06,841
It's called <i>Dance in the City.</i>

207
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,809
It's in Paris.
I saw it there a bunch of times.

208
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,478
Do you go to Paris a lot?

209
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,379
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I have to.

210
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,681
I have to go there for work.

211
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,382
H-have you been?

212
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:21,288
-Let's go to Paris.
-[laughs] Okay.

213
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,923
Yeah, I'll see you in Paris.

214
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,295
-I like you, Marie.
-I like you, too, Jeff.

215
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,533
I think you are the one
that I've been looking for.

216
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,033
And I don't like to waste time,

217
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,935
so I would like you
to move in with me.

218
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,371
We just met.

219
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,473
We'll do it on
a trial basis, perhaps.

220
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:41,642
You just come for a week and...

221
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,177
you know,
we'll take it from there.

222
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,345
Name your price.

223
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,415
-$30,000.
-Okay, done.

224
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,417
I'll give you half up front
and then half
at the end of the week.

225
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,922
-What do you say?
-You really think I can't tell
when I'm getting scammed?

226
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,758
I've seen guys
like you before, okay, Jeff?

227
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,427
You're nothing
but a splendid daddy

228
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,729
in a borrowed Armani suit.

229
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,063
Actually, it's Bottega,

230
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,699
and I'm not like
any guy you've ever met.

231
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,168
You'll see.

232
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,607
Have a great day, beautiful.

233
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,977

Hi. Who are you?

245
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,013
Ghost.

246
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,549
-This the new girl?
-Hi, babe.

247
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,083
We're so happy you're coming.

248
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,419
Isn't she fab?
Ghost can get your bag.

249
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,021
Uh, I thought
this was a girls' trip.

250
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,825
-I'm Kendall.
-I'm Jess.

251
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,393
It's so nice to meet you.

252
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:50,264
Um, I guess what I meant,
I didn't know that there were
gonna be men on the trip--

253
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,334
No, these aren't men.
These are just the guys,
you know?

254
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,035
Ghost shoots us, and Harry,

255
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,506
he's actually
our personal chef and masseuse.

256
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,107
I also run
the management company.

257
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,277
Yeah, we're all repped by
the same FanZen agency.

258
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:04,713
Didn't Lucky
mention that to you?

259
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:07,381
But they help us so much
for a small fee.

260
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,817
How small?

261
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,119
-40%.
-40%?

262
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,855
Yeah,
but you'll be making so much
money, you won't even notice.

263
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,725
Babe, is she gonna be a problem?

264
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,526
'Cause I don't like problems.

265

know these guys.

Marie, who cares?
Just--you met them already.

267
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:28,102
They're not some
creepy old-ass sugar daddies.
They're just our boyfriends.

268
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,638
Yeah, who you give almost
half the money you earn to.

269
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,240
No, only Lucky's boyfriend
gets a cut.

270
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,409
The rest of the guys
work for us.

271
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,211
Come on,
it's gonna be super fun.

272

Don't embarrass me, okay?

279
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:58,932
My mom just texted me
and my uncle's in the hospital,

280
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,468
so I actually don't think
I can go on the trip.

281
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,437
-[Lucky] Really?
-I'm sorry, I have to go.

282
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,272
Wait, Marie,
what about your bag?

283
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,522
Pleasure to see you again.

284
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,537
You're shaking like a leaf.

285
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,105
What did you get up to tonight?

286
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,543
Here.

287
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,880
All right.
I'm just glad you're here.

288
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,623
So you've really been
thinking about me?

289
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,693
Uh, well, you know,

290
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:02,496
I've been pretty preoccupied
with work, but...

291
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,502
[chuckles]

292
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,303
Yes, I must admit,

293
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,873
I've been thinking
about you constantly.

294
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,842
I've been thinking
about you, too.

295
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,008
I missed you.

296
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:19,547
Does that mean that
you've reconsidered my offer?

297
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,415
Yes, but I have
some requirements.

298
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,984
I've never done
anything like this before.

299
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,887
Name them.

300
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,856
We do a trial run to make sure

301
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:30,324
that this relationship
is mutually beneficial.

302
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,726
So I'll move in here
for the week

303
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:34,428
for $30,000, like we discussed.

304
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,764
And then...

305
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,333
And then?

306
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,170
If it works,

307
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,706
I wanna be set up for life.

308
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,908
I won't see any other
daddies besides you,

309
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,110
and I don't wanna have to worry
about anything ever again.

310
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,183
You drive a pretty hard bargain.

311
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:58,887
Deal.

312
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,625
And what about you?

313
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:06,761
Now that you have me,
what do you wanna do with me?

controls the situation.

471
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,245
We're the ones
who set the boundaries,

472
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,447
express our limits,
we use the safe word.

473
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:28,682
Hmm.

474
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:30,585
Have you ever thought about it?

475
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,020
Dominating somebody?

476
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,422
Once or twice in passing,

477
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,224
but I don't think
it's really my thing.

478
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,460
The only times
I've topped were with women.

479
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:43,230
Do you think that you would like

480
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,200
to be a little more
dominant with me?

481
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,845
Get on your knees.

482
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,816
[suspenseful music]

483
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:04,985
Quickly.

484
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:09,223
[Jeff clears throat]

485
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:18,899
Did I say you could touch me?

486
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,702
No, ma'am.

487
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:24,138
Every time you disobey me,
you'll be punished.

488
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:25,640
Tell me you understand.

489
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,808
I understand.

490
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:29,977
Good.

491
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,912
Kiss my feet.

492
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,622
[both moaning]

493
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,256
Now kiss my ankle.

494
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:44,992
[Maria breathing heavily]

495
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,602
Did I say you could go up
any higher?

496
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:55,869
-No.
-You're my little slut now.

497
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:00,741
-But, uh--
-You're Daddy's good girl,
right?

498
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:03,777
-Mm-hmm.
-You wanted to hit Daddy,
didn't you?

499
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:07,014
If Daddy wanted to hit you,
what do you say to me?

500
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,783
-Thank you, Daddy.
-Yeah.

501
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:15,756

[whispering] Where were you?

507
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:14,576
Oh, I just, uh,
had to take a call.

508
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,579
Come on, baby. Sleep.

509
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,180
Hmm.

[suspenseful music]

513
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:15,603
Marie?

514
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,833
I was gonna surprise you.

515
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,935
You know, I was up
half the night doing this.

516
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,403
-Last night?
-Yeah.

517
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,238
I even had to lug out
an old Persian rug.

518
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,244
Where are you going?

519
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:01,649
I saw you carrying
the rug, and I thought...

520
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,351
I don't know what I thought.

521
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,022
Oh. Yeah, okay.

522
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,560
Your mind went to a sinister
place because I pay you
to live with me and fuck me,

523
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,195
and you thought, what,
I'm up in the middle
of the night killing people?

524
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,632
I'm really sorry, Jeff,
I--it was stupid.

525
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,203
Um, anyway, here's that.
That's fixed.

526
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:25,005
I--I'm gonna go get dressed.

527
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:55,904

Oh.

Sorry. [chuckles]

551

That's my fault.

552
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:14,509
I can buy you a new one.

553
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:17,444
I kind of thought I'd see you
in that cute little number

554
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:18,579
that you were in earlier.

555

Where'd the baby go?

556
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:21,716
Want me to punish her?

557
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,384
No, my uncle, actually, he fell.

558
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:27,187
So, he's in the hospital.
I have to go.

559
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,760
Is he gonna be okay?

560
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,729
I don't know,
that's why I have to go.

You're coming back,
though, right?

I'm using the safe word.

Please, bread, I need to go.

You don't have an uncle, Marie.

578

Your mom's Anita Glover.

She lives at 357 Westburg Lane,

Marie, who you're named after,
and Jessica.

583

Neither of them ever married.

584
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,463
And your father
was an only child.

585
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,970
It's--it's not that
I'm mad that you lied to me.

586
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,673
It's that I'm disappointed
you told such a bad lie.

587
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:55,475
You're smarter than that.
That's why I picked you.

How you feeling?

Like I smashed my head
on some stairs.

594

Take a seat.

Rest a little bit.

Dinner's almost ready.

597
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,001
Take a seat!

598
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,077
Would you like a drink, baby?

599
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:38,279
Oh, what am I talking about?

600
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,048
You probably
shouldn't drink anything,
not after you hit your head.

601
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,351
What were you thinking?

602
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:45,887
What are you gonna do to me?

603
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:49,156
Do you, um...

604
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,959
like the dress?

605
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,261
I picked it out myself.

606
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,166
What's in that room, Jeff?

607
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:06,707
[Jeff groans]

608
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,612
I'm gonna bring us out a meal
here, and we're gonna sit down,

609
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:14,282
and we're gonna eat it together,
and then I'm gonna
run you a bath.

610
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:15,583
Does that sound good?

611
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,019
Does it?

612
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,957
It would mean a lot to me
if we could just start over.

613
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,392
Have fun.

614
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,895
For the rest of the time
that we have together, okay?

615
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,066
-Hmm.
-Good.

616
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:40,207
Good girl.

617
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:47,915
I was gonna ask you--

618
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,886
What are you doing?

619
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,889
Um, I was just gonna have
a sip of your drink,

620
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,223
because you made it
look so good.

621
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:02,997
Hey.

622
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:06,634
Did you hit your head
and forget your manners?

623
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,804
-Is that it?
-[Maria sniffles]

624
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:12,106
Please let me have a sip
of your yummy drink.

00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,910
Please? Please who?

626
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,478
Please, Daddy.

627
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,780
Please, Daddy.

628
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:22,516
Hmm.

629
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:26,486
Hmm.

630
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,594
That's good.

That's very good.

632
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:43,070
You're getting
the idea now, okay?

633
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,606
Submission, it gets rewarded.

634
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:51,545
Here.

635
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,386
Hmm.

636
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,460
Oh, boy.

637
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,029
Hey, tell me.

638
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:10,564
What is it that you think is in
that room?

639
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,903
[sobs] I don't know,
and it's scaring me.

640
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:17,872
You're scaring me, Jeff.

641
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,576
Is that where
you're gonna put me?

642
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:25,079
And lock me away
until I'm nothing?

643
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,714
Is that where you put Chloe?

644
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,149
Chloe?

645
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:29,518
[Jeff grunts]

646
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:01,148
[Maria] What the fuck?

647
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:04,519
[gasps] Oh, my God.

648
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:07,154
[chuckles] You are so pretty.

649
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,956
You're alive.

650
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:10,324
Yeah, what?

651
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:13,327
No, no, no, what are you doing?
No, uh-uh, uh-uh.

652
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,763
Jeff would not like that.

653
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:17,932
We have to get out of here.
This could be our only chance.

654
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:20,367
And I think we could
probably fight him off
if we do it together.

655
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:23,370
What are you talking about?
I like it in here.

656
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:24,772
What?

657
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:27,174
Babe, this place
is like Disney World.

658
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,375
Didn't you see all the clothes?

659
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:30,144
But we're trapped here.

660
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:33,447
I know. Isn't it great?
[chuckles]

661
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:39,320
I was going to introduce you
when your week was up,

662
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,389
but now that you've met, maybe
we can have some fun together.

663
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,059
Marie, this is Chloe.
Chloe, Marie.

664
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:48,129
It's so, so nice
to meet you, babe.

665
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:55,069
Chloe, you have been locked up
in here for three days.

666
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,405
Let's take a lap
around the house.

667
00:43:58,507 --> 00:43:59,740
Thank you, Daddy.

668
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:07,014
What do you have
to say for yourself?

669
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,318
-I was--I was just--
-[Jeff] Trying to leave?

670
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:14,421
[Maria grunts]

671
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:19,393
Let this be
your official warning.

672
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,395
If you ever disobey me again,

673
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,831
you will be locked in here
as punishment.

674
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:30,771
Chloe, hey.

675
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,875
You've been such a sweet girl.

676
00:44:37,546 --> 00:44:39,413
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

677
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:42,216
-Does that sound nice?
-Yes, Daddy.

678
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:45,419
Marie has been
disobeying orders,

679
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,121
so she's gonna
spend the night here...

680
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:50,824
all alone.

681
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:17,586
Marie.

682
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,922
Jeff fell asleep while we were
picking the movie to watch.

683
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:27,094
Well, I thought
you might be hungry,
so I made you something.

684
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:32,766
I didn't poison it.

685
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:37,238
Thanks.

686
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:39,473
I'm surprised
he didn't chain you to the bed.

687
00:45:39,574 --> 00:45:41,408
[chuckles] You know
the nicer you are to him,

688
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:44,512
the more freedom he gives you?

689
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:47,281
Obviously you haven't explored
the true crime genre.

690
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:48,882
Haven't you heard of
Elizabeth Smart?

691
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,654
I think I blew her brother
in the fifth grade.

692
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:55,690
Wow. There I was in fifth grade
making friendship bracelets

693
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:57,324
and learning
how to speak gibberish.

694
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,226
[speaking gibberish]

695
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,700
Finally. Something
we have in common.

696
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:08,302
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

697
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:13,774
I feel like you're someone
I'm gonna know
for the rest of my life.

698
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,309
Oh, yeah?

699
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,311
And how long do you think
that'll be?

700
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:20,948
[Chloe laughs]

701
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,883
Look, I know
you're scared, but...

702
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:27,021
we're really gonna
have the best time together.

703
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:28,723
You're delusional.

704
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:31,258
Come here.
I wanna tell you something.

705
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:37,865
Closer.

706
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,401
[whispering]
You're not the first person
to tell me that.

707
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:43,505
[Chloe laughs]

708
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:47,141
I have to go, but...

709
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:50,878
do me a favor, explore the room.

710
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,980
I really think you're gonna
like what you find.

711
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:56,150
See ya.

712
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:21,208
[sighs] What the fuck
have I gotten myself into?

713
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:12,025
Good morning, sunshine.

714
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:16,463
Okay, so, I begged Jeff

715
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:19,734
to let us play
hide and seek together outside,
so you could get some fresh air.

716
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,502
-We're let outside?
-Yeah.

717
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:22,970
Come on, put this on, okay?

718
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,271
'Cause he's already
started counting.

719
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:26,907
Hide and seek?

720
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,676
Isn't that
a little infantilizing?

721
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:30,310
Tell me you didn't
have a childhood

722
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:32,413
without telling me you
didn't have a childhood.

723
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,415
[chuckles]

724
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,622
-Where do the stairs go?
-To the pool.

725
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:42,456
Okay, so the trick is
to keep moving

726
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,793
to all the places
that he's already looked.

727
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:46,795
[sighs]
Where should we go first?

728
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:49,029
How far down
do you think the street is?

729
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,765
I have no idea.

730
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:52,499
But that's against the rules.

731
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,135
Okay, he's probably
already started counting to 100.

732
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:56,871
We've got to go.
Come on, quicker.

733
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,305
-All right.
-You've got long legs.
Use them.

734
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:00,007
[Jeff] One, two, three.
Here I come.

735
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:01,341
[Chloe] Quick! Quicker.

736
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:03,177
Come on. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

737
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,546
Come on, move your arms.

738
00:49:04,646 --> 00:49:07,314
-Found you.
-Oh! Dang it!

739
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:09,216
You failed 'cause
you're stuck together.

740
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:10,852
It's easier to hide
when you're alone.

741
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:12,052
Yes, Daddy.

742
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:14,955
Yes.

743
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:16,123
Yes, who?

744
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,660
Daddy.

745
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:25,199
Okay, so Jeff may have won
today's games,

746
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,367
but there's always tomorrow.

747
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:29,470
And now that there's two of us,
I think that we have

748
00:49:29,571 --> 00:49:32,406
a really good chance
of outsmarting him. [chuckles]

749
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:34,374
Yeah, 'cause
that's what I'm upset about.

750
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:36,076
That we lost at hide-and-seek.

751
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:41,883
Look... [clears throat]

752
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,551
...I hate to be
the one to say this,

753
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:44,985
but your vibes are just, like...

754
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,755
really terrible right now.

755
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:51,693
[entrancing music]

756
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:52,993
Dance with me?

757
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,765
You're not one of those
perennially happy people,
are you?

758
00:49:57,866 --> 00:49:59,399
God, no.

759
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,902
I hate those people.

760
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,005
I was still on killing myself
before Jeff came along.

761
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,842
-What?
-Nothing.

762
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:10,110
I would just assume
someone like you,

763
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,079
internet fame, plenty of money,

764
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,348
certainly wouldn't need
the help of a man.

765
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:16,016
You've seen dickdoms?

766
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:21,054
Well, first of all,

767
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:23,892
I don't need the help
from anybody.

768
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:26,426
And second of all,
it's easier to fuck men

769
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:28,730
than it is
to be in love with women.

770
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:29,898
Amen, sister.

771
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:31,866
How do you think
I ended up here?

772
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:34,569
I guess that's something else
that we have in common.

773
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:41,408
It just feels really good
to completely surrender.

774
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:46,480
And he's really good at it
if you give him a chance.

775
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,151
Hey, a real dom
wouldn't trap a submissive

776
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:52,419
against their will.

777
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,822
We're not trapped.

778
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:57,324
We're finally free.

779
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:00,662
I really wish
that you could see that.

780
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:03,130
They know you're missing.
Your fans are searching for you.

781
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,599
I know.

782
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,466
That's why Jeff
posts for my account,

783
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,101
so they can all chill out.

784
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:11,405
Those people don't care
if I live or die.

785
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:13,808
I'm just an object
for them to consume.

786
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:16,911
And Jeff gets that, he sees me.

787
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:20,615
I see you.

788
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,017
And I care.

789
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:26,219

01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:46,373
I just--

1259
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:51,178
I just wanted to
apologize to you.

1260
01:21:52,446 --> 01:21:54,816
For any pain
that I might have caused.

1261
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:58,118
You know, it sounds
really silly, but, um,

1262
01:21:58,218 --> 01:22:01,689
I was thinking maybe
after all this is over that,

1263
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,592
you know, like,
we could be friends.

1264
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:05,860
[chuckles] You know...

1265
01:22:07,796 --> 01:22:10,330
-We have enough friends, Jeff.
-Fuck.

1266
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:13,467
Um... [clears throat]
...guys, I can't.

1267
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:15,870
I don't know how you did this.
Very brave.

1268
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:19,973
But I don't have the strength
to just take much more of this.

1269
01:22:20,073 --> 01:22:23,678
So, I'm worried. I'm worried
I might hurt myself.

1270

[both giggling]

1271
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,017
What are you gonna do?
Asphyxiate on a stuffed animal?

1272
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:32,720
Guess he could strangle
himself with the sheets.

1273
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,989
But if you die,
the house goes to Eddy, right?

1274
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:38,693
So, killing yourself
would actually be really
helpful for us.

1275
01:22:38,793 --> 01:22:40,461
That would clear up a
lot of red tape.

[Chloe chuckling]
You're so silly, Daddy.

1278
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:51,673
You're probably just cranky
'cause you haven't eaten
since yesterday.

1279
01:22:51,773 --> 01:22:54,208
That's because he was a bad boy.

1280
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:57,411
Are you ready to be
a good boy for us, Jeff?
You get a treat.

1281
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:02,750
[Chloe] Some cheese for the rat?
No?

1282
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:05,854
Okay, suit yourself.

1283
01:23:05,954 --> 01:23:08,088
You're so hot when
you're being all dommy.

1284
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:15,730
See you tomorrow, Jeff.

1285

-[Marie] Baby. [chuckling]
-[Jeff] Wait! Wha--what--

1286
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:21,603
What kind of--
what kind of cheese?

1287
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:27,675
Ladies, I just uploaded
that video we took yesterday

1288
01:23:27,775 --> 01:23:30,410
and it's already
banked two grand.

1289
01:23:30,512 --> 01:23:32,045
People love feet. I told you.

1290
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,548
Who wants a paloma to celebrate?

1291
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:34,716
-Me.
-Me with ice.

[doorbell rings]

1293
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:42,356
I'll get it.

[delivery guy]
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
anyone was home.

1295
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:52,065
Hey, is the guy who lived here--
Did he move?

1296
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:55,402
-I haven't seen him in a while.
-Oh, Daddy hasn't
been feeling well.

1297
01:23:55,502 --> 01:23:57,137
Oh, okay.

Well,
hope your dad feels better.
