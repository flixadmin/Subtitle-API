00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,360
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,840
Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,600
This isn't the first time
that a bounty hunter

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,520
has apprehended an escapee.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,360
Is the GCPD incapable of handling
this threat themselves?

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,640
Your body is beginning to reject
the changes we made to your DNA.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,360
How do I fix it?

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,400
Strange. He's the only one.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,040
You remember Marv.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,640
He's one of yours.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, kid. Take it.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,200
Keep feeding strays
and one's gonna follow you home.

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,320
While trapped in Indian Hill,

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
I was led to believe an unnamed group
had taken control of my company.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,760
I want to talk face-to-face.

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,920
The information that I've gathered

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,680
will be sent to every newspaper
and television station in Gotham.

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,840
We caught a spy!

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,280
- Ivy!
- Marv.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
No!

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Ivy?

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Alfred!

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Alfred!

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Bruce.

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
You wanted to talk?

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,600
Forgive me.

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Better?

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,160
I know you.

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,480
I've seen you
at Wayne Enterprises events.

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,440
You've been inside of my home.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
My name is Kathryn.

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,840
I represent the group
you've asked to speak with.

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,160
You didn't need to hurt Alfred.

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
He would not have permitted you
to meet with us alone.

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,080
You tried to kill me.

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,640
You were behind Indian Hill.

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,120
Hugo Strange was hired by you.

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,120
Is that why you're here, Bruce?

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,320
To ask questions
you already know the answers to?

40
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,720
Who are you?

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,040
What do you call yourselves?

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,720
Our name is unimportant.

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,160
Now, you made a threat.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,840
Referring to evidence you'd uncovered
of our existence.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,840
We would like to know what you found.

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,080
Nothing certain.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Until now.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,120
A bluff.

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Nicely played.

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,800
It wasn't just a bluff.

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,960
The more I studied
my company's doings,

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,840
the more there were things that could
only be explained by your existence.

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,240
Still, I had to know for sure.

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,040
- Now I do.
- And what now?

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
According to you,
we tried to kill you once.

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,240
I began all this because I wanted
to solve my parents' murder.

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,200
Six months ago, I concluded
your organization responsible.

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,320
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,000
But there are other considerations.

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,640
Such as your own life?

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,760
The lives of those close to you?

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,200
You're here to make a deal.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,720
What do you have to offer?

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,880
Wayne Enterprises.

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,360
You cannot give someone
what they already possess.

66
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm not finished.

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,840
If I die, my shares will be turned
over to the federal government.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,400
Investigators will comb
through every file.

69
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,960
Every asset.

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
Are you prepared
for that kind of scrutiny?

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,960
That would be unfortunate
but we would weather the storm.

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,840
- What else?
- The Wayne name still has meaning.

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
It's a symbol of light and hope.

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,280
For a group such as yours,
I could provide a useful distraction.

75
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,680
You are an impressive young man.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,480
Still your offer is not sufficient.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,400
We will also require that you cease
all investigation into our existence

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,160
and your parents' murder.

79
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
Any violation of that,

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,400
in the slightest...

81
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,720
and our agreement is void.

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,720
I need your answer now.

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,480
- I agree.
- I'm happy to hear that.

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,280
Needless to say,
you will not see me again.

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,360
Goodbye, Bruce.

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,800
{\an5}Morning. Surprised to see me?

87
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
{\an5}Not really. What do you want?

88
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,960
{\an5}I have a proposition.

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,720
{\an5}- Not interested.
- Oh, come on.

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,840
{\an5}Think of it as a way to say I'm sorry
for handcuffing you to a car door.

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
{\an5}Except I'm not!

92
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,880
{\an5}Wow. So this is where you live.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,680
{\an5}Anyone considering a life
in bounty hunting should see this.

94
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,480
{\an5}Preferably wearing a hazmat suit.

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,920
{\an5}You don't bring women here, do you?

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
{\an5}All right.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
{\an5}Fish Mooney.

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,440
{\an5}Penguin's million dollar bounty.

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,000
{\an5}I can help you get it.

100
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
{\an5}Oh, see, now you're thinking,

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,560
{\an5}a million dollars can buy me
a lot of Scotch.

102
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,720
{\an5}But hey, when you're rich,
do everyone a favor,

103
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
{\an5}spring for a maid, will you?

104
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,520
{\an5}Or just fire-bomb the place
and be done with it.

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,600
{\an5}- What's in it for you?
- A story.

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,120
That's it?

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,360
{\an5}It shocks you that I love my job
and I want to be good at it?

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
{\an5}Kind of.

109
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,040
{\an5}Why not just bring her in yourself?

110
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,600
{\an5}Why give me a million dollars?

111
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,440
{\an5}Because I'm a bigger person than you.

112
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,840
{\an5}And... because I couldn't find her.

113
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,120
{\an5}You lost touch with your source.

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
{\an5}The one working for Mooney.

115
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
{\an5}I did not lose touch with my source.

116
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
{\an5}I just have no way of contacting her.

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,320
{\an5}She always found me.

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,880
{\an5}Oh! Well, that's better.

119
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
{\an5}It's a million dollars.

120
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
Don't be so damn lazy.

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,320
{\an5}I mean, it's your job, right,
your specialty.

122
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,520
You find people.

123
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,320
You're a bounty hunter.

124
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,080
- Who's your source?
- So we have a deal?

125
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,680
No handcuffing this time.

126
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,760
Who's your source?

127
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
She's a petty thief.

128
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
A street kid.

129
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,160
I like her though. She's got style.

130
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,800
- What's her name?
- Selina Kyle.

131
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,680
You two ever cross paths
when you were a cop?

132
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
- Once or twice.
- Well, that's great!

133
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
So, you know where she lives?

134
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
No. Not a clue.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
But I know someone who might.

136
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,720
Oh, my God!

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,840
Hello, Barbara.

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,680
Hello, Barbara?

139
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,280
Is that all I get?

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
How you been?

141
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,520
How've I been?

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,520
Well, see for yourself.

143
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,200
I mean, it's no art gallery

144
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,000
but there's less chance
of me dying of boredom.

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
How's Lee?

146
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
We're not together.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No.

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,880
I thought by now
you would've chased her down.

149
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,080
Put a ring on it.

150
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,280
Did you dump her?

151
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,880
Oh, I bet you dumped her, didn't you?
You're such a heartbreaker.

152
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,200
I feel like I walked into something.

153
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,240
'Cause you did. Who are you?

154
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,400
Valerie Vale, I work for The Gazette.

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,280
- We're working on a project.
- I bet.

156
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,120
- She's your new girlfriend?
- No.

157
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,840
Jim and I were engaged.

158
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Till I called it off.

159
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
We're looking for Selina.

160
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,440
Oh, wait, I remember this.

161
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,000
You kidnapped him and his girlfriend.
Held them hostage in a church.

162
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,800
Aren't you supposed to be in Arkham?

163
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,960
I was.

164
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,640
But, turns out I'm totally sane.

165
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,480
Got a paper proving it.

166
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah, signed by Hugo Strange.

167
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,960
Again, Selina, have you seen her?

168
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,880
A kiss.

169
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,840
That's my price.

170
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,440
Is she serious?
Are... are you serious?

171
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Do it.

172
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Never mind.

173
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
You're honestly no fun.

174
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,160
Try her squat,
down on Drake and Powell.

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,960
That's it? I've already been there.

176
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,840
Well, she may have mentioned
an old bank near Kane Sound.

177
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Jim?

178
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
I had a dream
about you the other night.

179
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,040
You were in this horrible accident
and you lost both of your legs.

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
And then, I had to push you around
in a giant baby carriage.

181
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,800
Good seeing you, Barbara.

182
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Do not.

183
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,400
So you really think Fish
is using the bank as an old base?

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,120
If I had to bet? Yeah.

185
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
Me too.

186
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,360
So how about I call the GCPD,
give them the exclusive,

187
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,160
they take in Fish and you get squat?

188
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,400
Hey! Open the door!

189
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,240
You should've let me come
to find Peabody.

190
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
- Vale!
- And you know what?

191
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,120
- I like your ex.
- Vale! Hey! Hey!

192
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,440
Hey, there. You all right?

193
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Thirsty.

194
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,360
I don't have anything on me
but I live just up the road.

195
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
What's your name?

196
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Ivy.

197
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,960
My name's Ivy.

198
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
Barnes is gonna want to know
where you got this.

199
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
Oh, come on, you know
I can't give up my source.

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,880
- Don't forget our deal.
- Yeah... yeah... yeah,

201
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,360
soon as Fish Moon's booked,
you get first crack at her.

202
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
But, for now stay out of the way.

203
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,800
All right, all right, fellas,
listen up.

204
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,040
We don't know
what we're going to find in there.

205
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,840
So rule number one, is be careful.

206
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,560
And keep your eyes peeled
for Ethel Peabody.

207
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,160
She's the state witness
that was abducted last night.

208
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
I don't have to tell you guys

209
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
that this is the call
we've been waiting for.

210
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,600
Let's go in there
and end this thing once and for all.

211
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,880
Guys, let's go! Be sure to...

212
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
- Police!
- Stay right there, you freaks!

213
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
Back up!

214
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Stay right where you are!

215
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,760
Oh! We have company!

216
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,840
GCPD!

217
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,320
Don't nobody move!

218
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,880
Get Sebring a medic now.

219
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,560
Anyone see Mooney?

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,440
For months, I warned the police
about the threat to our city

221
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,600
posed by Hugo Strange's freaks
by the murderer of Fish Mooney

222
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,160
and how did they protect you?

223
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,360
They said that Fish Mooney
wasn't real.

224
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,000
That these "escapees"
were victims who need our help.

225
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,440
Well, Fish Mooney was real.

226
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,800
And once she was cornered by the GCPD
finally, they let her escape.

227
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,760
And these "victims,"

228
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,880
well, I for one am not afraid to call
them by their proper name: monsters!

229
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,960
Our city is being invaded
by monsters!

230
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,080
Attacking our brothers and sisters!

231
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,760
And it is up to us! To you!

232
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,480
To kill every monster you see!

233
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
Who is with me?

234
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,240
Master Bruce, wake up!

235
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
Come on, wake up, Master B.

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,960
Master B, wake up!

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Hey there, sunshine.

238
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Morning!

239
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,640
- You all right?
- How did I get back here?

240
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,840
I don't know,
I haven't got the foggiest,

241
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,600
I mean, I just came in here
to call the police when I,

242
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,080
but I then found you.

243
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,840
- Alfred!
- Hey!

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You all right?

245
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,480
You all right, B?

246
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,560
You know, I reckon,
it was that same masked bastard

247
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,680
that knocked me spark out.

248
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
You know, I mean he came in and out
without so much as a peep.

249
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,960
I saw them, Alfred.

250
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,400
I spoke to them.

251
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,240
- And?
- It worked.

252
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
They agreed.

253
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,080
What? Just... just like that?

254
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,000
I mean you talked about the stuff
that we... we talked about, right?

255
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Yes.

256
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,080
But I had to promise not
to investigate them anymore.

257
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
Not Indian Hill.

258
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,440
Not the corruption within my company.

259
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,240
Not my parents' murder.

260
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I see.

261
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Alfred.

262
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,920
It was the only way.

263
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,240
You weren't the only one
they threatened, were you?

264
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
No.

265
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,840
Do you intend on keeping your word?

266
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Yes.

267
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I do.

268
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,200
And how do you know
they'll keep theirs?

269
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,840
Hey, Alvarez, where's Bullock?

270
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,520
He's not back from the old bank yet.

271
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
You missed a big payday, Gordon.

272
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,080
We nabbed five of those freaks.

273
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
Yeah, trusted the wrong person.

274
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,080
I know the feeling.

275
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
Can we call this even?

276
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,640
You got me. I got you. It's over.

277
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,640
Let me buy you a drink.

278
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,960
You need to get out of here.

279
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
Yeah.

280
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,760
It's over when I get Fish.
You can read about it.

281
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,760
I do not want to get in trouble.

282
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,000
Odd as it might seem,
I do enjoy working here.

283
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm just looking to find Fish.

284
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,960
I do that, everybody wins.

285
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,320
Fine.

286
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,440
You know she's sick.

287
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,760
That's the reason for those drugs
she and the others were stealing.

288
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,160
That's what Peabody said.

289
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I figured that was why Mooney
was trying to find her.

290
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,640
To see if she could fix her.

291
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,680
Well, it appears something
went wrong.

292
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,160
This is Ethel Peabody.

293
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,600
You're sure?

294
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,840
Two separate tests confirmed it.

295
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,200
You remember there was a body
at the pharmaceuticals warehouse,

296
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,720
a worker ID'd as 35 years old
but who looked a 100?

297
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,000
I remember.

298
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,840
So... Mooney kidnaps Peabody

299
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,160
and then has one of her creatures
kill her.

300
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,400
Why?

301
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,200
Did Peabody give her what she wanted,
she no longer needed?

302
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,360
It seems unlikely.

303
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,480
My bet, Peabody simply
couldn't fix her.

304
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,880
Leaving Mooney still searching
for the cure.

305
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,480
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

306
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,840
That there's only one person
in Gotham who can help her.

307
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,760
Hugo Strange.

308
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,120
Detective Bullock.

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,320
Yeah, that's me.

310
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,120
Fish Mooney wants to see you.

311
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
All right... all right... all right!

312
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm going!

313
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,680
Hello, Harvey.

314
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,960
Long time.

315
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Hey, Fish.

316
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,000
- How you doing?
- Not so good.

317
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,520
Sorry to hear that.

318
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,840
You know there's a lot of people
out there looking for you.

319
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
Yeah.

320
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,520
I need to find that bastard, Strange.

321
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,080
Yeah, well... you know
I can't help you with that.

322
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,040
Oh, yes, you can.

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,400
And you will.

324
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll help you find Strange.

325
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Good boy.

326
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
This is it.

327
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
Nothing special but it's home.

328
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You hungry?

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,120
Just thirsty.

330
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,240
Beer? Pop? Tea?

331
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Water.

332
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,680
<i>The home side
has something going now.</i>

333
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,840
<i>The crowd is...</i>

334
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,080
So sad.

335
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Poor things.

336
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
My ex-wife left a box of clothes
when she moved out.

337
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,960
You're welcome to them,
if you want to change.

338
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Okay.

339
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
So where are you from?

340
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Gotham.

341
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
Listen, if you need to use the phone,
go ahead.

342
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,800
Why would I need to use the phone?

343
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,160
Someone's got to be looking for you.

344
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
No.

345
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,600
- No one.
- Really?

346
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,240
A beautiful girl like you?

347
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,840
You think I'm beautiful?

348
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
So who are you?

349
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Just a girl.

350
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,960
Cops killed my dad.

351
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,680
My mom left.

352
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
I was alone.

353
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Abandoned.

354
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,280
But then...

355
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,600
something happened and...

356
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,280
I changed.

357
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Grew.

358
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm different...

359
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,760
inside and out.

360
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,000
So sad.

361
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,760
Let me get rid of that.

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,920
I've never been that good
at taking care of things.

363
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
What are you doing?

364
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
Relax. They're just plants.

365
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I'll get those clothes.

366
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,480
You don't know that Mooney has him.

367
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,240
Or that she's looking for Strange.

368
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,760
And, again, you shouldn't
even be here.

369
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,120
Harvey isn't answering his phone.

370
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,480
Nobody knows where he is.

371
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,840
Well, you could start by looking
in every place in Gotham

372
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,960
that serves booze.

373
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,640
And we found this beside his car.

374
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,600
She's looking for him.

375
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,640
With Peabody dead,
that'd be her next logical step.

376
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,080
Damn... damn... damn.

377
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,840
You have to call someone,
tell them Fish is on her way.

378
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,240
Call who? The Feds?

379
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,440
I don't even know
which department has Strange.

380
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,400
But you do know
where they're hiding him, don't you?

381
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,920
You and Bullock both know.

382
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,400
They took him to a place
outside the city.

383
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,280
It's like an old mansion.

384
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
But on the inside,
it's a high-tech research facility.

385
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,720
The government has scientists
debriefing him, don't they?

386
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
They want to know
what he discovered in Indian Hill.

387
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,800
You have to tell us where it is.

388
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,200
The hell I do.

389
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,480
I'll take you there.

390
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,400
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Yeah.

391
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,880
This is where I dropped Strange off
a few months ago.

392
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,080
All right, show time.

393
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,520
Hey, fellas, at ease, soldiers.

394
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
Detective Bullock, GCPD.

395
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,080
- Where's your badge?
- My badge?

396
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,280
Oh, man, I must've dropped it.
I'm here to see Strange.

397
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,040
- We haven't heard anything.
- You haven't?

398
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
That's strange.

399
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,920
I mean, Strange weird,
not the guy Strange.

400
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You have ID?

401
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Yeah.

402
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,880
Who the hell? Hold it!

403
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,280
I said hold it!

404
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,840
Stop right there!

405
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,320
Professor Strange, you and I
have some unfinished business.

406
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,840
Look at you.

407
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,160
Amazing.

408
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,520
You were my greatest creation.

409
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,400
Your greatest creation who's dying.

410
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
What?

411
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,400
You're going to fix me, Daddy.

412
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,800
And when that's done,
you're going to make me an army

413
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,640
so I can have this city kneeling
at my feet.

414
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,280
But I can't...

415
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,720
fix you.

416
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,840
Fish... cops. Lots of them.

417
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,480
You have a few minutes
to rethink your answer.

418
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,440
I'd suggest you do.

419
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
Go... go, check that door.

420
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,160
Move out to your perimeter!

421
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
It's Bullock.

422
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,680
Harvey... Harvey you all right?

423
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,840
<i>Oh, he's fine.</i>

424
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,560
But this ain't Harvey.

425
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,520
- <i>I want to talk to him.</i>
- Sure.

426
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,760
- You don't control me anymore.
- Sid.

427
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,080
Hey, Cap, how are you? Sorry!

428
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
One chance, Mooney.

429
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,120
You let him go,
you might just make it out of this.

430
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,280
Chump, don't you know
you're speaking to a dying woman?

431
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,480
Which severely limits
your negotiating position.

432
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
<i>So here's how it's going to go down.</i>

433
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,000
One cop comes within 20ft
of this place and Harvey,

434
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,680
although I love him,
will eat a bullet.

435
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,280
You had to come back, didn't you?

436
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
Like a bad penny.

437
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,080
- Now, where were we?
- Fish, you got to give it up.

438
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,840
You're surrounded,
you got nowhere to go.

439
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,200
Shut up, Harvey.

440
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,480
What's going on? How's Bullock?

441
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Listen up.

442
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,280
I want you to create
a full perimeter.

443
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,960
Snipers on every corner.

444
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,880
Mooney does not make it out of this,
understood?

445
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,560
- Yes, sir!
- Now, go.

446
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
- Captain...
- What?

447
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,800
You cannot just leave him in there.

448
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,240
You think that's what I'm doing?

449
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm just not charging through
the front door so he gets killed.

450
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,160
And I'll remind you,
you are no longer a police officer.

451
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,840
Get in my way
and I'll have you arrested.

452
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,000
The press.

453
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,200
Keep the press back, keep them back.

454
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,400
<i>We are standing outside the mansion,
and preliminary reports</i>

455
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,040
<i>are that wanted Indian Hill escapee,
Fish Mooney,</i>

456
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,920
<i>has barricaded herself inside
and is holding a hostage.</i>

457
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,280
This is it, Butch.

458
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,600
She's finally cornered.

459
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,600
Like a rat.

460
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,920
Yeah, but what are you gonna do?

461
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,120
The cops are already there.

462
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,160
The GCPD is not Gotham.

463
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,680
And Gotham listens to me.

464
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,560
It's time to round up our friends.

465
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,440
Believe me,
if I could fix you, I would.

466
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,720
I think of you
as one of my own children.

467
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
But I can't.

468
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,920
So what am I supposed to do?

469
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,440
Give up?

470
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
Do you not understand what you are?

471
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,000
What you represent?

472
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,880
You are the first of a new
generation, a new Eve.

473
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,400
You know, I owned a club once.

474
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,520
Ran protection on the side.

475
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,200
Every first of the month,
people would pay me.

476
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,360
Every once in a while, someone
would come up short and they'd say,

477
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,720
"Mooney, I don't have the money,
Mooney, I need more time,"

478
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,320
and they'd cry and cry.

479
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:46,120
And then I discovered when I squeezed
them and squeezed them

480
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,760
and squeezed them
they always had more.

481
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,000
You are going to fix me...

482
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,080
or swear to God,
I will make you pray for your death.

483
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Fish!

484
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,400
What're the cops doing now?

485
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,640
It's not the cops.

486
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,640
What the hell is this?

487
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
Cordon off this entire area.

488
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,160
No one gets near the house.

489
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,120
Hold on... hold on...

490
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Cobblepot what the hell
are you doing here?

491
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,600
You have proven to be incapable of,
time and time again.

492
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
This is a GCPD operation.

493
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,520
I am ordering you and this mob
to disperse immediately.

494
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,920
Fat chance.

495
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,920
I will not let those monsters
escape again.

496
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,880
Fish Mooney dies tonight!

497
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,800
Damn it, Cobblepot.

498
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,600
One of my detectives is inside.

499
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,560
This is the last time I'm gonna ask.

500
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Back up.

501
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,800
You've had your chance, Barnes.

502
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,320
Now it's my turn.

503
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,840
Who's with me?

504
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,880
Stay back.

505
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,240
You killed a lot of our friends,
Gordon.

506
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,680
A lot of your friends had it coming.

507
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,600
So do you.

508
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,160
That's enough!

509
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Bring him in.

510
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,200
Kill them now.

511
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,000
Everyone stay back.

512
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,480
Jim! What the hell
are you doing here?

513
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Saving you.

514
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,720
- Thought that was obvious.
- Oh, yeah. Totally. Thank you.

515
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,680
Why're you here, Gordon?

516
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,360
Did your little cop friends send you
to get me to turn myself in,

517
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
'cause that's not going to happen.

518
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,920
I'm here on my own.

519
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,600
I only want Bullock.

520
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Really?

521
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,920
You'd risk your life
for this broken down old thing?

522
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Thanks.

523
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,600
- He'd do the same for me.
- I would. It's true.

524
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,560
Well, you've helped me.

525
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,800
'Cause now I have two hostages.

526
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,640
Barnes won't see it that way.

527
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,040
Hell, you kill me,
he'll probably thank you.

528
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,240
I been nothing
but a pain in the ass to him.

529
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,400
Also true.

530
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,720
Then you better
give me one good reason

531
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,920
why I shouldn't have
my friends kill you.

532
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,360
Because I can get you out of here.

533
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,440
And exactly how do you plan
to do that,

534
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,960
considering this whole place
is surrounded?

535
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,680
That's my problem.

536
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,320
I get you out of here,
you give me Bullock.

537
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
That's the deal.

538
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,880
I get this one.

539
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,240
- Wait a sec...
- Deal.

540
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,840
You have two minutes.

541
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,360
We won't go. We won't go.
We won't go. We won't go.

542
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,920
Jim? You just keep surprising me.

543
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
<i>Shut up.</i>

544
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,440
<i>How'd you like to have Fish
all to yourself?</i>

545
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,440
Don't tease.

546
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,920
She'll be in the woods
behind the mansion in five minutes.

547
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,080
All you have to do is one thing.

548
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Name it.

549
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,000
Cobblepot, get this crowd
to disperse.

550
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,680
Or I'll make them disperse
and there will be bloodshed.

551
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,840
Promise?

552
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,520
People of Gotham!
The time for action is now!

553
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,680
Kill the monsters!
Kill them now!

554
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,160
We need all units
for the front of the house!

555
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,320
Immediately.

556
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,440
Get back, now!

557
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,080
- You need back up!
- Stop!

558
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,480
The mob's broken through the front
but the back is clear.

559
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,640
We can make it to the woods.

560
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,000
Time to go.

561
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,680
You two hold them off
as long as you can.

562
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,400
And Harvey, no hard feelings.

563
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Fish?

564
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,080
Screw you.

565
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,360
Fair enough.

566
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,200
Jim. You can't let her take me!

567
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,480
- Goodbye, Professor.
- She's going to kill me!

568
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
She's gonna kill me!

569
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,920
Stop!

570
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Go.

571
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,600
That's better.

572
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,640
Just old friends.

573
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,560
- Oswald.
- Don't call me that!

574
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,920
My name is Penguin!

575
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,600
Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

576
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,640
How long I've waited
for this very moment?

577
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,320
- Mr. Cobblepot.
- Quiet!

578
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,160
So this is it?

579
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,200
I spare your life and you shoot me
dead in the woods like an animal?

580
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,720
Pretty much, yes.

581
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,520
But I will admit, that night
under the bridge stayed with me.

582
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,200
- Why?
- Why what?

583
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,640
Why didn't you kill me?

584
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,760
I have gone over that night a 1,000
times and it doesn't make any sense.

585
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Why didn't you kill me?

586
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,120
I would've killed you in an instant!

587
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,600
- Answer me.
- Because you're mine.

588
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,120
You were my umbrella boy, remember?

589
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,960
You rubbed my feet
when they were tired.

590
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,360
And now look at you,
the terror of Gotham.

591
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,480
Everything I've done in my life...

592
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,000
possibly the best thing

593
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,440
was turning Oswald Cobblepot
into The Penguin.

594
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,480
I couldn't destroy that.

595
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Ask him.

596
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,400
He understands what it is to bring
something into being.

597
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,240
It is a part of you.

598
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
Forever.

599
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,840
Goodbye, Fish.

600
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Don't come back.

601
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,040
We got them. We got them.

602
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,480
Got some more fuel for the fire.

603
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,800
- Show them now.
- Monsters burn!

604
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,600
Monsters burn!

605
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,560
Monsters burn!

606
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,560
Monsters burn!

607
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,320
Monsters burn!

608
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,400
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!

609
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
Yeah!

610
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,440
- Yeah!
- Tell Barnes something, would you?

611
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
I'm going home.

612
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Next time...

613
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,320
remember to water.

614
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,840
Well, I for one am personally
very glad not to be staring

615
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,880
at those bloody box files
and that flaming bulletin board.

616
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,360
Tramping down those stairs
to that dank cave.

617
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,840
Does leave one question unanswered
though, doesn't it, Master Bruce?

618
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
What's that?

619
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,040
Well, you know, with all this
spare time on your hands,

620
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,360
how are you gonna fill it?

621
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,120
Well, I imagine you have some ideas.

622
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
I do.

623
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,160
Dancing lessons.

624
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Dancing lessons.

625
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,080
That's right, I mean,
a man of your station,

626
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,360
should be able to guide
gracefully a beautiful

627
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,000
young girl across the dance floor,
don't you think?

628
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,520
And I suppose that you're going
to be teaching me these lessons.

629
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,360
Well, I certainly could, you know,

630
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,840
I was quite well regarded as a bit
of a dancer in my day actually.

631
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,760
But I think I'll leave
that particular ordeal

632
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,320
to someone more qualified.

633
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Right!

634
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,080
Step out!

635
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Slowly.

636
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Who are you?

637
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,360
Oh, my word.

638
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,400
Please don't hurt me.

639
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,280
You don't quit, do you?

640
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,000
I came by to let you know
that tomorrow's paper

641
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,640
is going to lay out Bullock's story
of how Fish got away.

642
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,960
How she just vanished
while you two were escaping.

643
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,720
Great. Can't wait to read about it.

644
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,880
And it's a load of crap.

645
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,360
You want to know what I think?

646
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,320
Got a feeling you're gonna tell me
either way.

647
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,320
I think you made a deal with Fish,

648
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,400
you let her escape with Strange
in exchange for Bullock's life.

649
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
And how would I manage that?

650
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,440
I saw Penguin get a call
before the riot started.

651
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,640
When the mob attacked, Barnes
ordered all the cops to the front.

652
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,280
And that's when Fish slipped
into the woods with Strange.

653
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,720
By that logic,
Penguin helped Fish escape.

654
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,840
Why would he do that?

655
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,520
Because he wanted Fish
all to himself.

656
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,440
I mean, that is what you offered him,
wasn't it?

657
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,760
You promised to help Fish escape

658
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,160
but you did it by double-crossing her
and delivering her to Penguin.

659
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,360
If that were so,
I'd be a millionaire by now.

660
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,520
Except Fish isn't dead.

661
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,760
Penguin would've dragged her
in front of the mob if she was.

662
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,920
So, what happened in the woods?

663
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,120
I don't know.

664
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,920
I do know that you're gonna have
a hard time collecting all that cash.

665
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,680
'Course that wasn't why you
did any of this, was it?

666
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?

667
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,240
- What are you doing?
- Shut up for once.
