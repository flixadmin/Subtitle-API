[no audible dialogue]

00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,287
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

4
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:55,165
[in Spanish]
Good morning, Sergeant.

5
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:57,625
Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?

6
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:02,630
I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

7
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:04,799
and extra uniforms for the guards.

8
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:15,435
Let him go. He's been checked.

9
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,437
Continue. Continue, Paisa.

10
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,231
Thank you, Sergeant.

11
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:21,107
- Good day.
- Good day.

12
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:24,569
- Good day, Paisa.
- [Paisa] Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

13
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:37,374
[Steve]
Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,

14
00:01:37,457 --> 00:01:40,252
but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín."

15
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:43,422
It was the embodiment of "the big lie."

16
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:47,259
It was even built
to look old and shitty on the outside.

17
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:50,762
But inside, it was anything but.

18
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,350
The other inmates?
Escobar's sicarios.

19
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,186
Hand-picked killers from his hometown.

20
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:03,066
[in Spanish]
You're here, my friend!

21
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,818
- How you doing, Velasco?
- Good, brother. How was the trip?

22
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,862
Fine, fine.
What a long drive!

23
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,655
- Really?
- It's really hot.

24
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,074
Did you encounter any problems?

25
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:13,826
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

26
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,081
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

27
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:19,874
- What's going on, buddy?
- Blackie!

28
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,586
- I thought you forgot about us.
- Let me show you.

29
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:30,009
Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!

30
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:34,139
[Steve] The sicarios weren't the only guys
in the prison who worked for Escobar.

31
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:35,807
The guards did, too.

32
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,310
- [Velasco] Welcome to La Catedral.
- [woman] Hello.

33
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:42,230
- Come on down, ladies.
- [overlapping chatter in Spanish]

34
00:02:42,314 --> 00:02:44,441
We'll take care of you.

35
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,364
[Steve]
By the terms of his deal,

36
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:56,328
no cops or military were allowed
within two miles of the prison.

37
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:00,457
As much as I fucking hated this guy,
I had to hand it to him...

38
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,625
he had a pretty sweet deal.

39
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:08,840
- [overlapping chatter in Spanish]
- [up-tempo Latin music playing]

40
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:18,724
Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?

41
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:23,062
- That looks delicious, Paisa.
- [Paisa murmurs] All right, lobsters.

42
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,901
- [music continues]
- [laughs]

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,826
[cheers, whistling]

44
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:52,342
[inhaling]

45
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:04,145
[Steve] Escobar hadn't
built himself a prison at all.

46
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,814
He'd built himself a fortress.

47
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:11,361
But no matter how you decorate it...
a cage is still a cage.

48
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,641
[in Spanish] Excuse me, boss.

49
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,768
I've got a report.

50
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,563
Moncada and Galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

51
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,940
through Mexico and the Caribbean.

52
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,109
Did they pay the war tax?

53
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:54,487
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

54
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,864
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

55
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:04,163
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

56
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,415
Understood.

57
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:09,377
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

58
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:11,045
Mm.

59
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,506
As am I.

60
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:19,095
We're going to negotiate a truce.

61
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:23,057
But first,
we're going to kill a few of his men.

62
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:29,689
I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

63
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,524
don't you think?

64
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,195
[exhales deeply]

65
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,034
The purpose of war...

66
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,996
is peace.

67
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:51,419
[Steve] If there was one benefit
to Escobar's imprisonment,

68
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:54,506
it's that peace
had finally come to Bogotá.

69
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:58,510
Connie and I took advantage
and began adoption proceedings.

70
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,928
The war had left many orphans.

71
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:04,599
One... we could do something about.

72
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:08,603
[in English] Oh, you like the pink ones,
don't you? Yeah, you do.

73
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,230
Oh, orchids, look!

74
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,484
What's this one? "Cattleya."

75
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,487
It means "graceful." Hm.

76
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,823
- That describes me perfectly.
- [laughs]

77
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,456
Oh, buying baby things
and plants for the apartment...

78
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,500
we're a family.

79
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,627
We're domesticated animals.

80
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,337
- You want this one?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,089
- You want that one? Yeah.
- [baby grunts]

82
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,300
[horns honking]

83
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,596
[Steve] How about Elizabeth?

84
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:46,432
After my mother?
Are you kidding?

85
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,397
What is "Elizabeth" in Spanish?
Is it "Isabel"? Isabel's nice.

86
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:55,900
- I've always liked "Olivia."
- Olivia's OK.

87
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:01,239
[thudding]

88
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:03,199
[Steve] Fuck.

89
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:06,619
- Shit!
- [baby wailing]

90
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,207
- [man in Spanish] What's the deal?
- Steve...

91
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,792
[man]
Look what you've done to my car.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,753
- [in Spanish] Where?
- Look at this traffic jam.

93
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,171
- Look what you did to my car!
- Ah! It's nothing.

94
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:19,090
- How am I gonna drive this?
- It's nothing.

95
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,050
Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.

96
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:21,967
Yeah, man!

97
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:24,429
[baby sobbing]

98
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:28,307
And you don't even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.

99
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,309
- Don't mess with me, asshole.
- Easy, man.

100
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:35,064
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?

101
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:37,734
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that's it, then.

102
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,528
What, are you gonna hit me?
You and who else?

103
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,614
[whispers]
Oh, my...

104
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:46,451
OK, take it easy.
It's all right. It's OK now.

105
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,328
- [gasps]
- [baby shrieks]

106
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,456
- Calm down, asshole.
- OK?

107
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,083
- Relax, man. OK.
- OK?

108
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,085
OK, calm down.

109
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,755
[man] Have some tolerance.

110
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:05,470
- [baby continues crying]
- [sighs]

111
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,224
[starts engine]

112
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:13,394
Yeah, I like "Olivia."

113
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,197
[Latin guitar theme music plays]

114
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:58,040
- [Ana in Spanish] Do you hear that?
- [Gaviria] What?

115
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:01,961
People. Children. Laughter.

116
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,464
Even the vendors are back out.

117
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:12,430
And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison. [gentle scoff]

118
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,682
You did the right thing.

119
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,392
You think?

120
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:20,563
You should be happy.

121
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:24,734
Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.

122
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,695
Finally... we are at peace.

123
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:54,847
[in Spanish] We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.

124
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:02,229
[Pacho]
Ten of my men have just been killed.

125
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:05,024
Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?

126
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,443
Two things, Pacho.

127
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:14,325
First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

128
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:18,746
And the second thing...
this is war, Pacho.

129
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,875
There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

130
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,757
We are willing
to pay three million dollars

131
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:33,302
- to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.
- [Galeano chuckles]

132
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:38,140
Pablo won't accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.

133
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:43,312
[Galeano]
Twelve million is nothing to you.

134
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,443
Do you want to know something?

135
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:51,988
It's over.

136
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:54,281
What's over?

137
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,576
- The Medellín cartel.
- [laughs]

138
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,038
No, you're wrong, Pacho.

139
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:03,248
We export twice the amount you do.

140
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:07,086
You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

141
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:13,133
Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

142
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:15,135
That's how he treats
his friends and associates?

143
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:20,349
Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

144
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:24,729
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?

145
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:27,356
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

146
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:32,277
Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.

147
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,489
He started this fucking war.

148
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,744
Are we going to negotiate or not?

149
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:47,752
[Steve] As part of Escobar's
surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded,

150
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,922
and Colonel Carrillo
was transferred out of the country.

151
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:55,634
For the time being,
Carrillo's war was over.

152
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:58,554
[in English] I don't see why
they're sending you to Spain.

153
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:00,098
It's not like the cocaine war is over.

154
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,016
Galeano and Moncada
are fronting for Escobar.

155
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,104
My superiors say I play too rough.

156
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,276
At least Escobar is in jail and... you can
leave knowing you helped put him there.

157
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,404
Jail?

158
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:20,076
I know you gringos
aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...

159
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,580
I got some photographs,
courtesy of the Colombian military.

160
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,045
I want you to look at 'em,
tell me if this qualifies as a jail.

161
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,509
[Steve]
He's got a fucking soccer field.

162
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,637
Escobar is moving more coke than ever.

163
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,931
Without the Colombian government
breathing down his neck,

164
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:44,391
all he's gotta worry about
is the Cali cartel.

165
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:49,271
Let's face it, fellas...

166
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,484
he won.

167
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,780
[doors open]

168
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,698
[Paisa in Spanish]
We're here, gentlemen!

169
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,200
[groans]

170
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,286
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

171
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,956
- Gentlemen!
- [Moncada] What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

172
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,291
Where did you learn to drive?

173
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:12,878
[Moncada]
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

174
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:16,298
This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.

175
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:20,011
[Velasco]
Sounds like a good proposition.

176
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:22,346
Do you know what this means, boss?

177
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,225
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.

178
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:31,605
That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

179
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,444
How did he behave...

180
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,489
when he offered you the money?

181
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,618
What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?

182
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:47,454
What was his attitude?

183
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,791
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

184
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,710
Respectful in what way?

185
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,880
- He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...

186
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:59,008
how did he react
when you told him our solution?

187
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,759
In a positive manner.

188
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:03,179
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

189
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:09,434
Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?

190
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,520
- Mm.
- [Galeano] But we said no,

191
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:13,355
and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.

192
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:17,651
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

193
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,072
Offered you three million?

194
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,285
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.

195
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:32,250
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

196
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,879
That's right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

197
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:45,596
Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.

198
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:48,640
The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.

199
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:53,062
Thirty million...
if Cali wants peace.

200
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:19,838
Very good.

201
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:31,183
I also need to raise the war tax.

202
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:37,356
From now on,
a million a month,

203
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:41,110
for both of you...
and all our other partners.

204
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:53,080
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

205
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:00,545
[in English] If we get proof that Escobar
is violating the terms of his surrender,

206
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:02,256
then they have to send him
to a real prison,

207
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,175
but we need more
than these aerial shots.

208
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,510
Can you get us satellite communications
or wire intercepts?

209
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,180
There's a no-fly zone over the prison,
with antiaircraft guns

210
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:11,473
manned by the Colombian army
to enforce it.

211
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:13,475
You're playing with fire
if Noonan finds out.

212
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:15,560
We don't got shit on him
without intercepts.

213
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,646
- Don't need 'em.
- What? The hell we don't.

214
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:19,398
They're not using phones.

215
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,693
- The hell is that?
- I could spot a coop a mile away.

216
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,820
That's how they're sending messages.

217
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,868
[Steve]
To avoid our high-tech spy planes,

218
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:34,830
Pablo chose the most
low-tech form of communication.

219
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:37,124
Never said the guy wasn't crafty.

220
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:42,296
- You see anything yet?
- No, man.

221
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:45,257
You're blind as a bat.
Give me those.

222
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:01,190
- [fluttering]
- Oh, one's goin'.

223
00:18:01,273 --> 00:18:04,443
- Ten o'clock. Comin' in low.
- [Javier] I got it.

224
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:06,362
- You got it?
- Yeah.

225
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:07,487
Low.

226
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:12,076
Ah...

227
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:13,452
[twittering]

228
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:15,287
[Javier]
That's a fast fucking pigeon.

229
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:17,998
Give me the gun.

230
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:21,293
- You trying to say I'm a lousy shot?
- Yes, I am saying you're a lousy shot.

231
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,669
Here.

232
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,091
You're a shit shot.

233
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,134
- [Javier] Heads up, heads up.
- I got it.

234
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:31,136
- [Javier] One o'clock.
- I got it.

235
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,222
Shoot.

236
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:35,015
Shoot!

237
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:41,480
Ever been duck huntin'?

238
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:49,696
No, I have not been duck hunting,
you... fucking hillbilly.

239
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:59,248
- [chuckles]
- Bingo.

240
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,711
It's in Spanish. Read it.

241
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:12,136
[Javier] "Delivery due
with El Paisa in the tunnel."

242
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:16,598
The son of a bitch
built a tunnel under the jail.

243
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,937
[in Spanish] We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.

244
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,355
- [woman] Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

245
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,942
We agreed to...

246
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,654
- one million dollars.
- What?

247
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:35,534
Right.

248
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:40,622
What about the house in Cartagena?

249
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,500
That's not happening, right?

250
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,918
Do you want your house in Cartagena?

251
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:48,672
- Of course.
- OK... you will have it.

252
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,257
Don't you see
things are improving?

253
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:53,302
No, I see things
are getting more complicated.

254
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:57,973
Instead of getting better...
things are getting worse.

255
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,142
Mm-hm.

256
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,856
Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

257
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,942
Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?

258
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:12,863
$250,000 was a lot of money.

259
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,074
And now a million?
[scoffs] Ridiculous.

260
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:20,245
What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

261
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,664
- Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.

262
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:27,836
- What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

263
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:30,881
[sighs]

264
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:34,843
Look, I... adore Pablo.
I adore him.

265
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:41,141
But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.

266
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,401
I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.

267
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:56,365
We're here in a Jacuzzi...

268
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:59,243
free.

269
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:05,499
- Do you love me?
- Oh...

270
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,086
Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.

271
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:17,511
[in English] Against orders, we did
high-altitude flyovers of the prison

272
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:19,971
- with our infrared cameras.
- No tunnels.

273
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:23,892
Tomography report indicates nothing.
Seismic measuring, nada.

274
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,519
Can we measure radio frequency energy?

275
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:28,230
Well, we could try.
Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.

276
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:31,358
If he's bringing shit into this tunnel,
you can bet he's going out that way.

277
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:35,153
If there's a tunnel there,
he must have dug it to China.

278
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:36,696
Good luck.

279
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,165
Maybe we can... [sighs]

280
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,295
We can ask the military
to do light detection and ranging.

281
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:54,590
We got a better chance of Noonan
authorizing a divining rod.

282
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:57,884
[scoffs]

283
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,720
- All right, man, I'm calling it a night.
- Nah, finish up.

284
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:02,806
No, you can't even smoke in here.

285
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:07,769
No luck?

286
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:12,608
These aerials don't indicate
a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.

287
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:14,192
Hm.

288
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:17,446
Well, the only thing I can see
in all of them is this truck.

289
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:22,701
- Are you finished with that, honey?
- Yeah.

290
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,792
[Paisa whistling]

291
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,975
[brakes squeaking]

292
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:48,602
[Paisa in Spanish] What happened?

293
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,062
Did it stop?

294
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:53,982
Good morning.

295
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:55,734
- What's up?
- Are you "The Paisa"?

296
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:58,737
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.

297
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,990
Do me a favor
and get out of the truck.

298
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:07,746
- [Paisa] What's going on?
- [Javier] Don't be afraid.

299
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,250
Up against the truck.

300
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,924
Let's go.

301
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:24,095
Do me another favor.

302
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,681
Open it up.

303
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:35,649
Go on.

304
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:47,035
[Javier in English]
We missed a very important delivery.

305
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:53,584
Sex toys, back issues of Hustler,
a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.

306
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:56,920
[chuckles]
He's bored shitless in there.

307
00:23:57,003 --> 00:24:00,340
[in Spanish] Look, gringos...
you don't have the right to do this.

308
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:02,760
Of course we have the right.

309
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:08,848
You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?

310
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:13,853
If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me.

311
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:15,021
[in English]
What did he say?

312
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,315
He says if Pablo finds out,
he'll kill him.

313
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,527
Amigo...

314
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:26,241
[in Spanish] Pablo's your boss?

315
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:28,619
Yeah? Yeah.

316
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:37,294
[gasping]

317
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:41,923
I am your boss. Yes?

318
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:44,593
It's OK, it's OK!
I'll do whatever you say.

319
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,010
Yeah?

320
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,936
Are you OK, friend?

321
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:02,611
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

322
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:11,369
[camera clicking]

323
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:29,513
[Paisa] Good day.

324
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,943
[in English] So what is this?
What am I looking at exactly?

325
00:25:44,027 --> 00:25:47,030
- Club Medellín.
- This was all shipped in to La Catedral.

326
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:50,408
We got some big-screen TVs,
nice stereo equipment.

327
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:53,662
That's a roulette wheel,
a little bit of liquor.

328
00:25:53,745 --> 00:25:57,457
Glad to see the judges could come down
with the official from the airport.

329
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,293
Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.

330
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,463
Don't forget the jukebox
with the hookers.

331
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:05,716
Of course, the lobster.

332
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,557
- [Gaviria in Spanish] This is a--
- Yes, it's a roulette wheel.

333
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,727
He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.

334
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,648
- Where did you get these pictures?
- From the DEA.

335
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:23,567
Of course.

336
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,569
It's not just these pictures.

337
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,405
They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,

338
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:33,451
other narcos, prostitutes...
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

339
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:39,207
- Who else has seen these?
- No one, as far as I know.

340
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,587
- That's why we have to act now.
- [sighs]

341
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,674
Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?

342
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:52,512
The DEA is capable of anything.
That's why we have to do something now.

343
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,019
At one time, Escobar...
used to own all of Colombia.

344
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:04,107
Now he's just the owner
of his own prison.

345
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:10,447
If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral...

346
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:13,116
or bombings in the country...

347
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,621
[sighs]

348
00:27:18,997 --> 00:27:22,208
I would be eternally grateful
to these women.

349
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:31,843
[together] Happy birthday, Pablo!

350
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,139
- Watch your step.
- [woman] Careful with the little girl!

351
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:37,724
[overlapping chatter]

352
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:39,309
[Velasco] How are you? Welcome.

353
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:43,647
- Happy birthday.
- Hello, sweetheart.

[man singing in Spanish]

356
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:10,340
They're the ones I hired?
I don't believe you.

357
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:14,594
They are really good, Blackie.
I like them.

358
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:19,808
Come on, Pablo, tell us...
what are you doing these days? Hm!

359
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:22,811
- How do you spend your time?
- Aside from missing his family?

360
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,354
Oh! Of course.

361
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:28,149
- He's writing a book.
- Mm!

362
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:30,234
- Mother.
- What?

363
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:33,822
Isn't it true?
You are writing a book.

364
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:35,907
Please, Mom.

365
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,659
Well, then, you tell them.

366
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:39,285
[laughs]

367
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:46,376
- It's a collection of magazine articles.
- Many articles.

368
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:50,588
- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons.
- Oh, cartoons!

369
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:53,341
From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.

370
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,011
And you know what?
People write him every day.

371
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:58,513
- [Hermilda] It's because they love him.
- [woman] I can imagine.

372
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:01,725
You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.

373
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:06,437
Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.

374
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:09,733
Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you

375
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:12,193
for all the responsibilities
you have given him.

376
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:13,778
Thank you very much.

377
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,613
- We were in Cartagena--
- [Hermilda] Where?

378
00:29:15,697 --> 00:29:17,991
- We were in Cartagena last week.
- Oh, yeah?

379
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:21,411
Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.

380
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,371
It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.

381
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,749
- How nice.
- Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.

382
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,459
But I'll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.

383
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:31,337
Oh, it's unaffordable.

384
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:34,841
Besides, this whole "war with Cali" thing,

385
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:38,011
it's tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.

386
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:42,348
We understand it's not easy,
but there's not much we can do.

387
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,975
It's OK.

388
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:53,526
Kiko complained about that?

389
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,197
He mentioned it.

390
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,412
He didn't complain, Pablo,
he didn't complain.

391
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:08,666
Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you're making,

392
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,502
for God's sake.
So I think it's normal, right?

393
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:13,337
It's normal that
we'd give you our support.

394
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:16,967
Well, I think it's normal...
I really do.

395

Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?

396
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,186
Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.

397
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,193
Leave the gift here.

398
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,278
I'll look after it.

The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't
gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.

403
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:08,518
Carrillo was right. He won.

00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:11,896
What are those?

00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:16,567
These are a list of, uh...

Apologize!

Apologize!

416
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,347
- Were you watching?
- Yes.

417
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:30,016
You apologize!

418
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,018
I'm sorry, boss.

419
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,938
I didn't mean it.

420
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:42,570
- Relax.
- Are you all right, boss?

421
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:44,948
Relax. That's how the game goes.

422
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,617
Go on, go on.
You guys continue.

423
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:52,330
Are you all right, sir?

424
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:55,792
[Velasco] Boss.

425
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:59,879
Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.

426
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:01,380
Everything OK?

427
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:06,219
- Boss, we have a problem.
- What problem?

428
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:09,180
You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment

429
00:33:09,264 --> 00:33:12,934
- that was seized in Boyacá?
- Yes.

430
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:15,979
- 250 kilos.
- Exactly.

431
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:20,358
Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?

432
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:21,859
Do you know where that was, boss?

433
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:24,904
In Rionegro.

434
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:30,910
[Steve] True story. And pay attention,
because it changes a lot of lives.

435
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:35,623
Remember how I told you that
the cartel was making so much money

436
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:37,541
that they had to bury it?

437
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,877
And Blackbeard had the treasure map.

438
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:43,756
Well, after we got him,
he gave a lot of it up...

439
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,675
but not all of it.

440
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:49,679
It just so happens that one day,
out in a field in Rionegro,

441
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:54,392
a farmer who worked
for Galeano and Moncada found one.

442
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:57,145
At first, the poor guy
thought he'd dug up a body.

443
00:33:57,354 --> 00:34:00,606
Over the years, plenty of 'em
had been buried out in the fields.

444
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:04,235
The farmer knew right away
it was narco money.

445
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,114
He was terrified he might
get buried himself if he took it.

446
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:10,950
So he took the money
to a guy who was connected,

447
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:13,328
who took it to another guy...

448
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:17,581
who took it to Pablo's
sicario lieutenant... Velasco.

449
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,294
[in Spanish]
There's cash buried everywhere.

450
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:26,341
The guerillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos...

451
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:30,011
- Everybody's burying cash.
- Yes, I know.

452
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,139
But right on Moncada
and Galeano's property?

453
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:37,352
Don't you think that's strange, boss?

454
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:40,230
I think it's strange.

455
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:12,220
[Pablo]
Look. All this cash...

456
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:16,474
was found... in a field.

457
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,060
- That's good luck, Pablo.
- [Moncada chuckles]

458
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:24,482
Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.

459
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:33,824
It was on your property,
in Rionegro.

460
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:37,454
But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,

461
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:40,664
and most of us rent out to the farmers.

462
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:43,876
Mm.

463
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:50,425
You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.

464
00:35:50,508 --> 00:35:51,968
That's true.

465
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:54,345
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

466
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,806
Who told you to open your mouth?

467
00:35:57,014 --> 00:36:00,226
Not true? Hm?

468
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:04,439
Pablo, do you think
we're stealing from you?

469
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:07,358
That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?

470
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:10,403
If you'd like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.

471
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:14,865
Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?

472
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:16,951
[low chuckles]

473
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:20,037
Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

474
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:26,169
I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

475
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:34,135
Gustavo...
would never forget where he buried cash.

476
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:39,890
Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

477
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,352
These fuckers
would sell their own mother.

478
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,230
- We are partners and friends.
- Mm.

479
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:52,362
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

480
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,532
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

481
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,908
That's a lie.

482
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:03,873
- Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.

483
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:07,084
You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.

484
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:09,879
[Galeano] I understand
this is difficult for you, Pablo--

485
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:11,548
What is difficult for me?

486
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:15,259
Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.

487
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:18,304
- So we can manage it and look after it.
- Mm.

488
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:23,893
You trust us, right?

489
00:37:25,478 --> 00:37:27,021
I understand this makes you anxious--

490
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:30,024
- Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.

491
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:32,818
- You said with certainty that--
- No, no, what I meant to say was--

492
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:38,157
- I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!

493
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:45,415
With that tone of yours...
you're telling me you didn't do shit?

494
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:51,504
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not?!

495
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:52,630
No, Pablo.

496
00:37:52,713 --> 00:37:56,634
Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not?!

497
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,677
For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.

498
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:01,639
- It's the truth, you pair of liars.
- Of course, he--

499
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:03,974
- Shut up, motherfucker!
- [Blackie] You're petty thieves!

500
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:07,937
You shut up, motherfucker!
Don't you disrespect me!

501
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:14,611
Pablo, look at me, man.

502
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:18,739
We're family.

503
00:38:19,823 --> 00:38:23,620
You're my daughter's godfather.

504
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:26,997
And also godfather to Galeano's kids.

505
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,750
What's going on?

506
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:37,716
We're like brothers.

507
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:42,305
We're partners and friends.

508
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:45,475
We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

509
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:49,145
We made our first trip to Miami together.

510
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:55,109
We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.

511
00:38:56,193 --> 00:38:58,195
What's the problem?

512
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:01,324
What's happening?

513
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:06,954
The two of us love you very much.

514
00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:09,248
And we're very grateful.

515
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:26,432
[Pablo sighs]

516
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,647
All right.

517
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:37,067
Being stuck in here...

518
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:40,237
can make someone paranoid.

519
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,878
[groans]

520
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:59,340
- Paisa! Paisa!
- [man laughs]

521
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:05,137
[Moncada] Well, man,
these things happen, right?

522
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,684
We're here for whatever you need.
Trust us.

523
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:11,686
I'm going to make a trip to Miami.

524
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:14,772
I'll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?

525
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:18,817
Don Pablo.

526
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,054
[shouts]

527
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:48,931
- [impact thuds]
- [Galeano groaning]

528
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:51,850
Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!

529
00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:57,398
[Moncada shouts indistinctly]

530
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:13,414
[breathing heavily]

531
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,877
[Moncada] You're a dog,
you son of a bitch!

532
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:28,554
What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?

533
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:32,308
You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?

534
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:34,310
[spits]

535
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:42,568
At the end of the day, you'll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.

536
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:44,695
[panting]

537
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:55,914
Goodbye, Kiko.

538
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:03,714
Kill me if you're such a man,
motherfucker. [groaning]

539
00:42:03,798 --> 00:42:06,049
Kill me with your own fucking hands!

540
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:08,469
[Blackie]
Who are you talking to, asshole?

541
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:14,141
Motherfucker!

542
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,484
[murmuring in Spanish]

543
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:25,486
[groaning]

544
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:31,868
[grunting]

545
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,328
[muttering in Spanish]

546
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:35,788
Wait a second!

547
00:42:35,996 --> 00:42:37,874
Be careful, man.

548
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:46,965
Look what the dead guy gave me.

549
00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:50,260
- [up-tempo Latin music plays]
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

550
00:43:01,564 --> 00:43:03,774
What the fuck!
You're going to burn all the meat!

551
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:06,485
What is wrong with you? Can't you see
I'm doing it to cover the smell?

552
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:10,781
- Yeah, but let's not burn it all.
- What are we gonna do with all this meat?

553
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:13,743
- What are you going to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

554
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:15,578
What?

555
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,454
[both laugh]

556
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:18,915
[chatter continues indistinctly]

557
00:43:19,122 --> 00:43:21,375
[music continues outside, faint]

558
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:30,634
Boss, are you OK?

559
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,221
Do you need anything, boss?

560
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:39,184
We're grilling some meat.
Do you want some?

561
00:43:40,436 --> 00:43:42,813
No. I'm not hungry.

562
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,759
Navegante.

563
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:14,261
Boss.

564
00:44:15,137 --> 00:44:18,641
- Do you want me to wax it?
- No, relax.

565
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:21,477
This one's my favorite.
I enjoy it.

566
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:25,022
This is a beautiful car.

567
00:44:25,898 --> 00:44:28,567
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

568
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:34,114
[sighs]
Looks like the rumors are true, boss.

569
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:40,496
It's a shame.

570
00:44:43,165 --> 00:44:45,042
I warned them.

571
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:48,128
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

572
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:58,014
Do you still have that DEA contact?

573
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:01,684
Javier Peña? Of course.

574
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,728
I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumors.

575
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:08,482
They're just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.

576
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:13,362
[Judy]
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.

577
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,282
I've called everyone.
I'm so worried.

578
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:20,703
Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.

579
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:22,788
Just relax, sweetie.

580
00:45:23,664 --> 00:45:25,374
Your husband is fine.

581
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:28,794
No. No, thank you.

582
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:35,885
Maybe... they had to go
somewhere else urgently?

583
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:37,845
Or maybe they left
without saying anything.

584
00:45:38,054 --> 00:45:40,014
The way our men usually do.

585
00:45:40,097 --> 00:45:42,641
Yes, but it's a little strange,
don't you think?

586
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:47,063
Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

587
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:48,731
He said he would be home later.

588
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:53,402
We're trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.

589
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,198
No? We're trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,

590
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:01,618
so we had a very important date to keep.

591
00:46:01,702 --> 00:46:05,831
Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

592
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:12,046
Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?

593
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,591
I want my husband back.

594
00:46:18,468 --> 00:46:22,723
If Pablo told Tata that they left...

595
00:46:22,932 --> 00:46:25,101
it's because they left.

596
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:31,231
Listen...
Pablo is your kids' godfather.

597
00:46:31,314 --> 00:46:33,692
He would never hurt them.

598
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:48,373
[in English]
Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.

599
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,878
There are rumors that
he killed Galeano and Moncada.

600
00:46:55,131 --> 00:46:56,673
Where, in jail?

601
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:02,096
Yeah, yeah.
[murmurs indistinctly]

602
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:04,056
"In jail."

603
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,143
That doesn't make any sense.
They're partners.

604
00:47:08,144 --> 00:47:13,273
Maybe there is not such thing as sense
with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

605
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:16,902
Bullshit. Where'd you get it?

606
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:22,240
The relatives of the men he killed...
are up in arms.

607
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:26,703
The poor fellows went in,
but they never got out.

608
00:47:29,706 --> 00:47:33,169
I want to ask you gentlemen
a serious question now.

609
00:47:34,628 --> 00:47:36,964
How bad do you want Escobar?

610
00:47:38,048 --> 00:47:40,884
How far are you willing to go
in this matter?

611
00:47:40,968 --> 00:47:43,137
What are you proposing?

612
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:49,392
Well, we both have access to information
that could benefit the other.

613
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,228
No.

614
00:47:52,021 --> 00:47:53,480
No, we don't trade information.

615
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:55,482
- Just hold on a second.
- No.

616
00:47:55,565 --> 00:47:57,651
He's an informant, Javi.

617
00:47:57,734 --> 00:48:00,696
Whatever you got cookin', it stinks.
I don't want it.

618
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:03,866
Appreciate the tip. Let's go.

619
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:11,207
Your partner here...

620
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:16,128
may need some convincing now.

621
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:25,428
Moncada and Galeano going
into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.

622
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:30,517
[Javier]
Every return from this day forward...

623
00:48:33,187 --> 00:48:35,313
no Moncada, no Galeano.

624
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,658
[Steve] Personally, we couldn't have cared
less about a couple of dead narcos.

625
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:50,287
It meant more chaos and confusion
in the Medellín cartel.

626
00:48:51,163 --> 00:48:55,000
But we wanted Escobar out of that
piece of shit excuse for a jail,

627
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:58,045
in a real prison, not a fortress...

628
00:48:58,128 --> 00:49:00,547
where his enemies could get payback.

629
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:03,300
You sure?

630
00:49:03,425 --> 00:49:07,304
We can either play politics
or we can do the job.

631
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,767
Well, we were never any good
at playing politics anyway.

632
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,187
[Javier in Spanish] What do you think?

633
00:49:18,315 --> 00:49:19,733
[man sighs]

634
00:49:20,984 --> 00:49:23,862
[in Spanish]
These photos are worth looking into.

635
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,698
And believe me, I'm going to.

636
00:49:32,996 --> 00:49:36,708
[in English] If it's true, this is
gonna cause a shit storm, you know?

637
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:46,635
- Be right back.
- Gracias.

638
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:51,265
Well... [sighs]

639
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:53,267
Fuck President Gaviria.

640
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:55,185
Fuck Noonan.

641
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:57,437
Fuck La Catedral.

642
00:49:59,356 --> 00:50:01,317
[Steve] And fuck Pablo.

643
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,029
