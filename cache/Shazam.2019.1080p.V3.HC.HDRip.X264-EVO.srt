23
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:30,809
I am the last of the

Sworn to protect realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

For years have passed

26
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,338

27
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:49,108
That is why I seek a
champion to inherit my magic.

28
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,134
You want me
to do magic?

29

you must demonstrate that
you're pure of heart

33
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,497
and strong in spirit.

34

00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,524
She's still out there.

171
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,604
I-I know it.

172
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:19,185
There's a couple outside,
Mr. Batson.

173
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,406
They run a group home.

174
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:23,898
I can take care of myself.

175
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,394
When you're 18.

176
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:26,798
Until then,

177
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:28,166
I won't have you
living on the streets

178
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:31,411
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

179
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:33,899
Give these people a chance.

180
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,112
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

181
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,526
You're out of options.

182
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,457
All right, let's get the spiel.

183
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:52,344
Just know that me and Rosa,
we get it.

184
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,838
We were foster kids
back in the day.

185
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,354
Ooh, back in the dark ages.

186
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:56,549
Girl!

187
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,897
I'm young at heart.

188
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,494
Got my finger on the pulse.

189
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:02,518
Yeah, that's a reference to his
blood pressure because he's old.

190
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:03,958
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

191
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,722
Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cookin'.

192
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:07,879
- Oy, guerito!
- What?

193
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,827
We know how overwhelming
it can all be.

194
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,526
New house, new faces.

195
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:15,184
All up in your face.

196
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:18,113
Just...
take it at your own speed.

197
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:29,753
Hello?

198
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,490
We're home!

199
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,109
That's what happens
when you suck!

200
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,765
So much for the welcome party.

201
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:43,287
Yeah, that thing growing out
of the couch would be Eugene.

202
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,646
Is that him?

203
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,378
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

204
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,056
Whoa, slow down, slow down!

205
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:49,265
Welcome home!

206
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,996
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

207
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,081
Big hugger.

208
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,340
I noticed.

209
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,552
Die! Die! Die!

210
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:58,186
He doesn't mean that.
It's a game.

211
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:01,256
Hey.

212
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,353
No sodas after dark, remember?

213
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,612
Whoa. When did it get dark?

214
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:08,563
Oh, the poster. I made you one.
Come look!

215
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,926
Oh, no!

216
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,416
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

217
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:15,728
He was supposed
to be at school.

218
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:18,414
Oh.

219
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,494
Here.

220
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:21,822
Yes.

221
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:25,465
Exactly why your Math Department
is so uniquely suited for me.

222
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:28,291
I can't, I can't even...
with Eugene right now.

223
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:29,944
Sorry. Mary. Hi.

224
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:31,146
College interview.

225
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:33,848
- I'm Billy.
- What am I most excited about?

226
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:34,905
Oh.

227
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:38,318
What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

228
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:42,983
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

229
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,953
What I'm most excited about

230
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,432
is the campus experience.

231
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,103
As a foster child,
I'm a big believer

232
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:50,610
in finding family and
friends in the most

233
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,763
unlikely of places.

234
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,381
Oh, I'm gonna miss
that girl so much!

235
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,321
It's Caltech,
it's a very prestigious school.

236
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,269
And also all the way
in California.

237
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:03,494
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

238
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,183
It's a tough subject for me.

239
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:06,461
Do you like vegan food?

240
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,843
- Mm-mm.
- 'Cause, see, I love animals.

241
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,139
Oh, no! The tofurkey!

242
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,141
Oh, no, we may have
to eat a real turkey!

243
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:17,209
- Is that?
- It's okay. Come, I'll show you your room.

244
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,962
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but,

245
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,042
it's fun!

246
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,289
Watch the bumps there.

247
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,758
Pedro, mi amor, hola.

248
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,838
Say hi to Billy.

249
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:32,776
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

250
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:38,105
Freddy.

251
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,439
This is Billy Batson.

252
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:43,061
Make sure you make him
feel at home, okay?

253
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:44,808
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

254
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:45,977
Oh, one weird thing is

255
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:49,104
you know the Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

256
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:52,741
Apparently, it-it works.

257
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:54,921
Yup, um...

258
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:05,326
Oh, it's, uh...
it's a long way down.

259
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:08,430
Trust me, I speak from experience.

260
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:13,510
Victor pushed me.

261
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,614
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

262
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:20,003
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

263
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:23,146
What?

264
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,054
Dude, I'm... just messin' around.

265
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:28,917
It's um, it's terminal cancer, I...

266
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:31,058
I have three months.

267
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,133
Kidding, again!

268
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,478
You look at me and you're, like,
"Why so dark?"

269
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,463
"You're a disabled foster kid,
you've got it all." Right?

270
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:42,128
Oh, yeah, that's the, uh,
the old batarang.

271
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,963
I mean, it's a replica, but...

272
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,410
Feel how sharp.

273
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,761
Could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

274
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,377
You ever a Supes guy?

275
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,947
Yeah, me too.

276
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:54,258
Behold, the holy grail.

277
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:56,973
One nine millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

278
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,144
It's legit.

279
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:01,392
Probably worth, I dunno,
$5-600, maybe more.

280
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:02,968
What's in the bag?

281
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:03,994
Hey.

282
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:06,820
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

283
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,219
You don't gotta
talk so much, you know.

284
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:13,917
I mean, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

285
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:40,231
Dinner!

286
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:48,805
All hands on deck!

287
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:51,713
Sweet.

288
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:53,231
Thank you for this family.

289
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:54,988
Thank you for this day.

290
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,597
Thank you for this food.

291
00:19:56,677 --> 00:19:59,025
Even if it's not steak fillet.

292
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,652
Big school. 2,000 students,
you might think,

293
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:06,363
"Wow, so many strangers."

294
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:08,018
But not if you think of them as

295
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:09,585
possible for each friend then,

296
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,524
"Oh, so many friends."

297
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:14,736
The principal, her name's
Shirley. She's the best.

298
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,686
Next.

299
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,442
This is our security scanner.

300
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:20,668
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

301
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:22,736
I know what it is.

302
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,806
Does she always do this?

303
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:27,205
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

304
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:30,059
She's almost never uncomfortable.

305
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:33,796
Have a good first day,
big brother.

306
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,862
Look, you don't have
to hug me all the time.

307
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,728
We're not actually
brother and sister, so.

308
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:42,045
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,910
- Hey.
- Hey.

310
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,269
I-I didn't mean to make her...

311
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:54,633
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

312
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:58,893
<i>He said I must be pure of heart.</i>

313
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:01,663
<i>He called himself a wizard.</i>

314
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:03,394
<i>Just like a...</i>

315
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:06,642
<i>a wizard from Harry Potter, some...</i>

316
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:10,292
<i>But y-you're saying that other
people have experienced this?</i>

317
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,372
In a sense, yes.

318
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,797
Do you remember
what he said to you?

319
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:17,273
<i>He tested me.</i>

320
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,199
<i>There were these statues.</i>

321
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,248
<i>Their eyes, it's like
they were looking at me,</i>

322
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:24,238
<i>making me think things.</i>

323
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:26,029
<i>Like, horrible things.</i>

324
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:29,005
And do these approximate
what you saw?

325
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:33,425
<i>Yes. That's exactly
how I remember it.</i>

326
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,571
<i>I-I don't understand.
How do you know...?</i>

327
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,559
Recurring imagery has
proven very common

328
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:39,739
in cases of mass hysteria.

329
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:41,035
<i>"Mass hysteria"?</i>

330
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:42,146
I know.

331
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:43,991
The term's a bit theatrical.

332
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:46,556
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

333
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,987
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

334
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:52,331
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

335
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,411
Symbols.

336
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,609
Ask her about the symbols.

337
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,989
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.

338
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,800
But as an example of
recurring imagery,

339
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,675
maybe you recall seeing

340
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:09,945
these symbols before
the alleged abduction?

341
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,951
<i>Don't remember any symbols, no.</i>

342
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,759
<i>I think I caught it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

343
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,541
<i>I remember the numbers on
my alarm clock, they kept</i>

344
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:20,775
<i>shifting.</i>

345
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,855
Video?

346
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,398
Show me the video.

347
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,279
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

348
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,438
<i>Um, one moment,
I can send it.</i>

349
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,197
<i>Hello?</i>

350
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,879
<i>Oh, my God!
Who's there?</i>

351
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:38,627
<i>Hello?</i>

352
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,939
<i>What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

353
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,573
<i>I'm-I'm going
to call the police.</i>

354
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,302
<i>Then this blinding light
all around me.</i>

355
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:50,627
<i>And I felt like I was
getting pulled down...</i>

356
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:53,569
<i>Like a temple
carved inside a mountain...</i>

357
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:57,063
<i>Exactly what you'd expect from
a guy who call himself a wizard.</i>

358
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:59,881
<i>brought there
to save the world.</i>

359
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,592
Dr. Sivana!

360
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,424
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

361
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:08,651
but you're funding my project.

362
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:11,817
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

363
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:14,020
56 reported abductions.

364
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,409
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

365
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:33,880
Doctor, what is all this?

366
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,476
All these years...

367
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:39,719
I was convinced

368
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,362
I had the incorrect sequence.

369
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:44,172
Or perhaps...

370
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:48,221
the wrong symbols
to open the door.

371
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,623
But on that woman's alarm clock,

372
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,494
the seven symbols.

373
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,981
The sequence

374
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,122
repeating itself

375
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:01,400
seven times.

376
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:03,897
That's the difference.

377
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,859
Is this some sort of joke?

378
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:07,905
It may seem that way to you.

379
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:10,242
Because we're not, in actuality,

380
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:12,204
studying mass hysteria.

381
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,847
What all these people have seen,

382
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:17,143
every single one of them,

383
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,452
is absolutely real.

384
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:21,947
An alarm clock malfunctions,

385
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,362
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

386
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:27,327
Come on, Dr. Sivana.

387
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:30,093
You can't believe
any of this is real.

388
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,674
Why, yes.

389
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,097
Yes, I do.

390
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,879
I've been waiting
for this moment

391
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,959
for so long.

392
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,870
And now, here we are.

393
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:40,270
You don't remember me, do you?

394
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,190
I remember you.

395
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:51,808
You were a boy.

396
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:53,978
Now, you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

397
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:55,947
Do you know what it's like
for a child to be told,

398
00:25:56,027 --> 00:25:57,979
"You'll never be good enough"?

399
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,758
No, you don't.

400
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:02,303
What you said to me
all those years ago

401
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:04,760
made me realize
who I really was.

402
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
And you know something?

403
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:11,355
I am not pure of heart.

404
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:16,757
The wizard is too weak
to stop us.

405
00:26:18,726 --> 00:26:20,154
No.

406
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:22,234
No!

407
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:33,834
You never found your champion.

408
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:38,115
But we found ours.

409
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:56,680
You are the true champion.

410
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,484
They're using you.

411
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,278
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

412
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:42,431
Through you, they'll spread the
poison to everything they touch!

413
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,383
Make mankind
turn on each other.

414
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:48,471
You seek a pure soul, old man.

415
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,634
But no one's worthy.

416
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:02,722
Flight or invisibility?

417
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:04,932
If you could have
one superpower,

418
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:06,881
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

419
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,965
Everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

420
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,721
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

421
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:13,060
No, no, 'cause heroes fly.

422
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,175
Who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

423
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:18,576
But-But invisibility, no way,
I mean, that's perfect.

424
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,613
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

425
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:21,781
Sneaking around everywhere.

426
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:23,989
It's a total villain power, right?

427
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,636
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

428
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:33,792
They asked people
the same question,

429
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:35,349
You know, what power
do you want? But this time,

430
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:36,986
they made it so the
answers were anonymous.

431
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:39,052
And-And most people, since
they knew that it was secret,

432
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:40,244
said invisibility.

433
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:41,443
And I think that's
'cause most people

434
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:44,217
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

435
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:46,297
You're gonna run away.

436
00:28:46,814 --> 00:28:48,738
I mean, you stole my
Superman bullet.

437
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:50,779
But dude, I get it, I get it.

438
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,570
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

439
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,152
You don't trust anyone.

440
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,731
But that's the thing
about invisibility.

441
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,908
You handle it by yourself.

442
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,249
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

443
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:09,613
Hey, how was it today?

444
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:11,954
That good, huh?

445
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:16,513
Whoa!

446
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:18,492
Oh, my God! Freddy!

447
00:29:18,572 --> 00:29:20,572
You okay?

448
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:23,819
What the hell?

449
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:26,002
What is wrong with you two?

450
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:27,402
No way that's gonna buff out.

451
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:29,020
You gonna pay for that, Freeman?

452
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,957
Uh, for the dent you made
almost hitting me?

453
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:33,819
Yeah, sure, um,
do you guys take these?

454
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:39,328
Brett, stop!

455
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:41,312
Don't touch my brother!

456
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:43,680
What, you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

457
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,873
- Stand up for yourself, man.
- Yeah, huh?

458
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:48,183
Here, stand up.
Stand up for yourself.

459
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:49,855
What are you gonna do?
Go home and cry to mommy?

460
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,506
Oh, yeah, you don't
have a mommy.

461
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:54,112
Stop hurting him!

462
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,192
Hey!

463
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,685
Man, sorry about that.

464
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:00,844
That wasn't fair, but,

465
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,115
then again,
you don't fight fair, so.

466
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:10,954
Back off, assbags, I know
how to use these things!

467
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
Oh!

468
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,982
Hey! He's gettin' away!

469
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,630
Freddy, you okay?

470
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:34,909
Nowhere to run!

471
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:36,414
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him!

472
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:38,494
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

473
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:41,459
Whoa!

474
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:43,776
No, no, no, no!

475
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:45,205
You're dead, kid!

476
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:46,899
Yeah, you think you're funny?

477
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,979
I know where you
go to school, buddy!

478
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,718
<i>Next stop, 30th Street Station.</i>

479
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,790
<i>Change for the Regional Rail Line.</i>

480
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,756
Hello?

481
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:18,836
What's going on?

482
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,767
Help!

483
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,456
Holy moley.

484
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:25,226
Hello?

485
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:40,749
What the hell?

486
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,304
Who-Who's doing this?!

487
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:16,524
Hi, um...

488
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:19,370
I was supposed
to get off at 30th.

489
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,233
Billy Batson.

490
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:22,973
How'd you know my name?

491
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:27,063
I am the last of the
consul of wizards.

492
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:30,100
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

493
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,785
Oh.

494
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:33,736
You're

495
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:35,285
that guy.

496
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:36,984
Listen, I don't have any money.

497
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:39,898
Do not patronize me, boy!

498
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:45,196
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

499
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:47,311
The Rock of Eternity.

500
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:50,355
Seven foes, seven wizards.

501
00:33:50,435 --> 00:33:53,868
But long ago,
we chose a champion.

502
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,683
And we chose recklessly.

503
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:02,546
He used his power for revenge.

504
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:07,122
Releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into the world.

505
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:13,030
Millions of lives were lost.

506
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:18,446
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

507
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,037
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

508
00:34:25,117 --> 00:34:30,245
until I find one
truly good person.

509
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:32,328
Strong in spirit.

510
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,408
Pure in heart.

511
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,844
Look, man, maybe this is magic.

512
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:41,023
And I don't know, but,

513
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:44,315
the people you're looking for,
good, pure people...

514
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,319
I'm not one of them.

515
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,342
I-I don't know if anyone is, really.

516
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:54,517
You, Billy Batson, are all I have.

517
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:57,612
All the world has.

518
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:01,204
Lay your hands on this staff.

519
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:02,373
Gross.

520
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:05,720
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

521
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,299
I open my heart to
you, Billy Batson.

522
00:35:09,379 --> 00:35:13,640
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

523
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,183
Thanks. Don't scream
at me, mister, but

524
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:17,839
I really gotta get going.

525
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:21,555
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the sins.

526
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:24,869
Their thrones lie empty!

527
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:27,599
My magic must be passed on.

528
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,917
Now...

529
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:31,070
Speak my name!

530
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,767
I-I don't know your name, sir.

531
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,062
We just met.

532
00:35:34,142 --> 00:35:37,017
My name is...

533
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:39,192
Shazam.

534
00:35:41,147 --> 00:35:42,172
Wait, for real?

535
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:44,341
- Say it!
- Okay.

536
00:35:44,421 --> 00:35:46,421
Jeez.

537
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,175
Should I say it?

538
00:35:58,255 --> 00:35:59,657
Like,

539
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,737
Shazam?

540
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:02,971
Yes!

541
00:36:03,051 --> 00:36:04,310
Carry my name

542
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,525
and with it, you
carry all of my powers.

543
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:07,899
The wisdom of Solomon!

544
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,260
The strength of Hercules!

545
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,173
The stamina of Atlas!

546
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,682
The power of Zeus!

547
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,383
The courage of Achilles!

548
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,876
And speed of Mercury!

549
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,723
What happened to me?
Why am I...?

550
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,907
W-W-What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

551
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:35,510
You have been transformed to
your full potential, Billy Batson.

552
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:39,975
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

553
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:43,333
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await!

554
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,528
Huh! Oh!

555
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,910
Get me outta here!

556
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:01,292
Dope!

557
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,067
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

558
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:07,490
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape!

559
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,509
It shouldn't work,
but, hot damn, it does!

560
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:22,998
Hey!

561
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,541
Hey, babe!

562
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:36,035
Yes, officer, I'm aware
he's run away in the past, I...

563
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,025
23 times?

564
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:40,275
He's got no social
media presence

565
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:41,712
at all.

566
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,268
The guy's a ghost.

567
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:08,397
You know guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

568
00:38:08,477 --> 00:38:09,665
More than happy.

569
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,351
Then you gotta wash the dishes,
that's what's more important.

570
00:38:12,431 --> 00:38:14,756
What are you gonna do, Freddy?
Run after him? Ha-ha-ha!

571
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:16,836
Very funny!

572
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:19,184
No, wait, don't scream.

573
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:21,089
Uh, Victor! Victor! Victor!

574
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,997
It's me! It's Billy!
It's Billy!

575
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:25,238
You asked me,
"Flight or invisibility?"

576
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:27,039
I thought that was stupid,
but now I look like this

577
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,646
and I need your help!

578
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:31,145
Meet me back here
after lights out?

579
00:38:32,214 --> 00:38:33,797
What's up, bud? You all right?

580
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:35,762
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:37,264
I'm just...

582
00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:39,481
I'm really... sad.

583
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:40,842
Because Billy's gone.

584
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:42,049
And you know,

585
00:38:42,129 --> 00:38:44,170
maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

586
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,926
Uh, you know, maybe I-I snore.

587
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:49,521
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

588
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:51,506
We'll find him, 'kay?

589
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:53,657
You don't snore that bad.

590
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,486
But you kinda smell.

591
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:07,828
Oh, oh, oh, thank God!

592
00:39:07,908 --> 00:39:09,793
Hey, stop right there.

593
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:12,470
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

594
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,590
to make me believe
that you're Billy, huh?

595
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,881
All I have to do is
press dial on this thing.

596
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:19,954
No, no, I have proof,
I have proof, here.

597
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:22,050
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

598
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,170
- Oop! No, no, no! No!
- No! No!

599
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:27,444
Stupid adult hands!

600
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:29,322
But you saw it.
You saw it, right?

601
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:32,020
Look, Freddy,
I swear it's me, okay?

602
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,791
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

603
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,024
but you're the only
person that I know

604
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:37,138
that knows anything about
this Caped Crusader stuff.

605
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:39,694
- That's Batman.
- What?

606
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:41,774
Forget it.

607
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,519
Can I...?

608
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:47,468
Oh, yeah, yeah.

609
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:55,923
Oh!

610
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:58,122
Oh, my God!

611
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,307
It's crazy, right?

612
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:01,963
What are your superpowers?

613
00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:04,799
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing!

614
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:07,109
Okay, c-can you fly?

615
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,141
Okay, let's do this.

616
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:12,980
How do we do this?

617
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,457
Just, um, just like Superman it.

618
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:17,537
Pkkwwff.

619
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,333
Pkkwf.

620
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:21,162
Obviously, you have to jump.

621
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:22,254
Come on.

622
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:24,095
How is that even obvious?

623
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:25,613
Okay.

624
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:28,490
Try, uh, t-to believe
that you can fly.

625
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,474
Okay, I read this deep dive in the
pyramid studies of superpowers

626
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,261
and in 6 out of 10,
belief is the key.

627
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:36,358
Belief, belief, belief.
Okay, okay.

628
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,890
I believe I can fly.
I believe I...

629
00:40:39,222 --> 00:40:40,794
I believe I can fly.

630
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:42,874
I...

631
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:52,227
Did you believe?

632
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,253
Yeah.

633
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,333
You wanna try invisibility?

634
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:00,372
How do I do...?

635
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:03,723
You... Forget it. You know.
Okay, okay, okay.

636
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:09,276
Oh, my God! It worked!

637
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:11,356
Where'd you go?

638
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:13,444
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

639
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:15,521
Where?

640
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:16,650
I'm invisible!

641
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,871
I'm right here.
I'm over here.

642
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm invisible!

643
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,468
I'm invisible!

644
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:25,414
Hey! Nice outfit, dipshit!

645
00:41:26,723 --> 00:41:27,843
I-I might have

646
00:41:27,923 --> 00:41:31,272
been testing invisibility and super
intelligence at the same time.

647
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:33,883
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

648
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:42,771
Oh, my God!

649
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:46,344
The lightning, it was staring us
right in the face the whole time!

650
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Literally!

651
00:41:56,553 --> 00:41:57,552
Okay, okay.

652
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:59,577
Clearly, we gotta give you a
lightning-themed superhero name.

653
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:01,657
Yeah.

654
00:42:12,054 --> 00:42:12,958
Oh, right.

655
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:15,038
Hey, you, back...

656
00:42:16,425 --> 00:42:17,407
off.

657
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,844
Hyperspeed, check!

658
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:22,857
I... I'm sorry-I'm so sorry.

659
00:42:22,937 --> 00:42:24,477
I thought you were the
one who was screaming.

660
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:26,713
I doused him with pepper spray.

661
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:28,145
Smart move.

662
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:29,695
Yeah, hey, get up,
mister mugger guy!

663
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:31,062
Give the old lady
her purse back.

664
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:32,745
Um, I'm your age.

665
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:36,041
And he didn't get a chance to take
it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

666
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:38,593
Good, yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

667
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:40,305
And that should teach
you that old ladies,

668
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:42,494
regular-aged ladies
like yourself

669
00:42:42,574 --> 00:42:45,310
don't need your protecting.
Right? So get off, bro.

670
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,976
I'm sorry, who are you?

671
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:49,916
His name is Thundercrack!

672
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:51,300
Hero to the people.

673
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,456
With the power and speed
of lightning all in one.

674
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:55,756
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

675
00:42:56,925 --> 00:42:59,614
- Mr. Philadelphia!
- That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

676
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:01,279
Powerboy,
'cause he's got all the powers.

677
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,219
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

678
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:07,137
Powerboy, do you know this child?

679
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:10,149
Like, like a teeny little bit.

680
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:11,179
I don't really know...

681
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,503
Yeah, he's, like, my manager.
He's like a miniature manager.

682
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:15,395
- I'm his manager.
- And uh, you know.

683
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:17,780
Powerboy's not gonna work either,
okay? So work on something else...

684
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Hey, hey, hey...

685
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:27,830
Electricity manipulation,
hyperspeed, super strength!

686
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:28,994
Dude, you're stacked!

687
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:31,347
You're as cool as Superman!
Almost.

688
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:33,325
I didn't see you. I don't know
what just happened here.

689
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:34,914
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

690
00:43:34,994 --> 00:43:36,665
- Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

691
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:38,080
No, no, no, but if you
need any more help,

692
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,182
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

693
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:44,439
Forget flying, man,
we just made 73 bucks!

694
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:45,895
73 bucks?

695
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:47,975
Come on!

696
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:50,464
Hey, wait a minute.

697
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,544
I just got an idea.

698
00:43:52,684 --> 00:43:55,771
I'd like to purchase some
of your finest beer, please.

699
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:17,372
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID.

700
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:19,403
Freddy, would you relax?

701
00:44:19,483 --> 00:44:21,614
Look at me, I am the fake ID.

702
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:23,959
Everything from the register!
Go! Go!

703
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,506
Now! Come on!

704
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:27,378
I don't have much time!
Let's go! Move!

705
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,857
I want it all! Hurry!

706
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:30,268
This is your chance.

707
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,348
Oh! I... okay.

708
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,766
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's do this!

709
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:40,342
Gentlemen!

710
00:44:40,422 --> 00:44:43,666
Why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

711
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:47,621
Billy, look out!

712
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:02,326
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

713
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:04,406
I'm bulletproof.

714
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:07,470
Today is December 8th,

715
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,648
and this is video proof
of authenticity.

716
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:12,091
Shoot him again.

717
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:13,691
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here.

718
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:16,231
Go, both of you, come on.
Go to town.

719
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:23,998
W-W-W-Wait!

720
00:45:24,078 --> 00:45:27,870
We still don't know if the suit
is bulletproof or if you are.

721
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:30,087
Shoot him in the face.

722
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,265
Shoot me in the...
in the face?

723
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:41,856
It kinda tickles.

724
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:44,301
You're dead.

725
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:50,872
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night.

726
00:45:50,952 --> 00:45:53,103
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

727
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,169
Come on!

728
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:56,117
Let's get outta here!

729
00:45:56,197 --> 00:45:57,655
Hey.

730
00:45:57,735 --> 00:45:59,745
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

731
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:06,703
That tastes like actual vomit.

732
00:46:08,203 --> 00:46:09,205
You know,

733
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:11,205
habanero jerky,
if you eat enough of it,

734
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:13,175
it could burn a hole
in your stomach.

735
00:46:13,255 --> 00:46:14,660
- Worth it.
- Yeah.

736
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,015
Probably not you though.
Probably got stomach superpowers.

737
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:18,047
Probably.

738
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:20,088
Oh, hey, what's up?
I'm a superhero.

739
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,781
Yeah, his name is, uh,

740
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,316
Captain Sparkle Fingers.

741
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:25,555
No it's not. No it's not!
It's not my name!

742
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:27,563
Hey, we should hang out.
We're like, the same age.

743
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:29,502
Ho! po-po. I'm out.

744
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:31,582
Hey, wait up!

745
00:46:37,485 --> 00:46:39,753
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

746
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:43,437
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

747
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:48,412
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

748
00:46:48,827 --> 00:46:50,719
I mean, no offense, but like,

749
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:53,732
like, at first, you were kinda
like the opposite of how

750
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:55,812
of how Darla is.

751
00:46:57,135 --> 00:46:58,175
A dick?

752
00:46:58,255 --> 00:47:00,543
Your words, not mine.

753
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:02,623
But yeah.

754
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:04,851
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

755
00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:07,288
was either on drugs
or asleep by now.

756
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:09,544
Wanna head home?

757
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:10,991
Looking like this?

758
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:12,967
Yeah. I mean,

759
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:15,847
usually we'd have
a lair to go back to, but

760
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,557
that's long term.

761
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:19,723
Right now you have a bunk bed.

762
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:26,984
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

763
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:29,476
This is what he does, Rosa.

764
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:32,582
Difference is when
they find him,

765
00:47:32,662 --> 00:47:34,867
we'll be the first
to take him back

766
00:47:34,947 --> 00:47:36,980
with open arms.

767
00:47:38,757 --> 00:47:41,614
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

768
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:44,206
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back then.

769
00:47:44,286 --> 00:47:46,396
At least, I did.

770
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:50,249
Even Mary did it, twice.

771
00:47:52,189 --> 00:47:53,968
That second time she ran off,

772
00:47:54,048 --> 00:47:56,612
you said something
to me I'll never forget.

773
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:58,131
You said,

774
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:00,439
"It's not a home till
you call it a home."

775
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:02,672
"It's something you choose."

776
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,449
All we can do is
give him a place full of love.

777
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:10,839
Whether he chooses
to call it a home,

778
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:12,919
that's up to him.

779
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,639
Gonna help me with this tree?

780
00:48:20,388 --> 00:48:22,743
This tree's so sad.

781
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:25,534
H-Hello?

782
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:27,598
Got lost finding the bathroom.

783
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:29,581
Oh, okay, Freddy,
sweetie, goodnight.

784
00:48:29,661 --> 00:48:31,661
- Night.
- Night.

785
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:34,274
Freddy, who was that?

786
00:48:34,354 --> 00:48:37,702
It's Billy, he's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

787
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:39,621
- What? Laryngitis?
- I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

788
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:41,424
He's really, really tired and he
wants to go beddy bye.

789
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:43,448
- Beddy bye? What's beddy bye?
- Just hide, hide.

790
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:45,757
Billy, you're back!
Let us see you!

791
00:48:46,158 --> 00:48:48,158
We're so worried about you.

792
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:50,730
I told you this was a bad idea!

793
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:51,918
Freddy?

794
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:54,180
Hey, what happened
to the stairs?

795
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:57,867
Hey, covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

796
00:48:57,947 --> 00:49:00,390
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

797
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:03,807
Darla, it's me, it's Billy.

798
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:05,809
I know I don't look like me.
A wizard made me look like this.

799
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:06,929
Maybe don't start with wizard,

800
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:08,223
it's just gonna make
her more confused.

801
00:49:08,303 --> 00:49:09,937
Some old guy brought
me to a temple

802
00:49:10,017 --> 00:49:12,017
and he made me say "Shazam"...

803
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,752
Rosa!

804
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:17,121
Verbally-triggered body
manipulation properties!

805
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:19,492
You can switch
by saying "Shazam!"

806
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:23,405
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

807
00:49:23,485 --> 00:49:24,935
Um...

808
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:27,382
I-I was screwing in a bulb.

809
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:30,125
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

810
00:49:30,205 --> 00:49:32,006
But it's Billy, he's a hero.

811
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:33,510
Yeah, but if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

812
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,077
that endangers us, okay?

813
00:49:35,157 --> 00:49:38,330
A hero's loved ones are, like,
a perfect bad guy target.

814
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,025
I-Is she good
at keeping secrets?

815
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:41,187
Moderate.

816
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:42,537
- No.
- Oh, God.

817
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:43,944
Okay, listen, D,

818
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:46,877
you cannot tell a single soul
about this all right? Please.

819
00:49:46,957 --> 00:49:49,793
Why? What if it's
people we trust?

820
00:49:52,443 --> 00:49:54,665
'Cause good sisters
don't tell secrets.

821
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,967
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

822
00:49:57,047 --> 00:49:58,598
You know what would make
you an even better sister?

823
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:00,835
Is when you fix the-
the doorknob for us.

824
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:01,868
Sweet dreams.

825
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:02,938
Sweet dreams, all right.

826
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:05,018
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

827
00:50:10,153 --> 00:50:11,924
Hello, sir, how may I help you?

828
00:50:12,004 --> 00:50:14,004
Hi, sir.

829
00:50:14,163 --> 00:50:15,474
Sir, you can't go in there.

830
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,936
Excuse me!
You cannot go in there!

831
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,299
Sorry I'm late.

832
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:26,897
Thad, this is for
board members only.

833
00:50:26,977 --> 00:50:28,977
I'm aware of that, Father.

834
00:50:31,702 --> 00:50:33,702
Now...

835
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:37,010
That night, in the car...

836
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:38,934
I swore to you
I saw something

837
00:50:39,014 --> 00:50:40,979
but you never believed me.

838
00:50:41,059 --> 00:50:44,552
So much easier to blame
me, wasn't it?

839
00:50:44,981 --> 00:50:47,582
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

840
00:50:47,662 --> 00:50:49,662
you'd still have your legs.

841
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:52,711
Well, now, I have proof.

842
00:50:55,129 --> 00:50:56,638
That's enough, Thad.

843
00:50:56,718 --> 00:50:58,442
Dear Sid.

844
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,522
You think?

845
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:03,669
You know,
even before the accident,

846
00:51:03,749 --> 00:51:04,932
you belittled me.

847
00:51:05,012 --> 00:51:07,925
Don't make me throw you
out of here, Thad.

848
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:10,241
You don't need to make a scene.

849
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:11,673
Oh, brother...

850
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:13,262
The scene

851
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:15,436
has only just begun.

852
00:51:17,881 --> 00:51:20,299
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

853
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:21,437
What?

854
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:24,524
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

855
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:29,808
Let me spoil it for you.

856
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:39,569
Outlook...

857
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:41,649
not so good.

858
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:46,246
I've come here during
the season of giving

859
00:51:46,326 --> 00:51:48,326
to give you...

860
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:53,498
what you deserve.

861
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:51,750
Oh, my God!

862
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,057
No! No!

863
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,137
No!

864
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:09,962
Oh!

865
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,525
Help!

866
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,348
Somebody!

867
00:53:13,428 --> 00:53:16,172
Help me!

868
00:53:16,252 --> 00:53:19,061
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

869
00:53:20,254 --> 00:53:23,830
What sin best befits
you, Father? Hmm?

870
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,063
I'll give you anything.

871
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,589
Money...

872
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:29,983
The company?
You want the company?

873
00:53:30,063 --> 00:53:32,063
There it is.

874
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:34,614
Greed.

875
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:37,091
Do you honestly think

876
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,175
all this

877
00:53:39,255 --> 00:53:41,818
material you've accumulated

878
00:53:42,782 --> 00:53:45,735
amounts to actual power?

879
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:51,167
This... is power.

880
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:54,510
More than you ever had.

881
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,005
More than anyone has.

882
00:53:57,704 --> 00:54:00,954
There is one more powerful.

883
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:05,452
The wizard found his champion.

884
00:54:05,532 --> 00:54:07,494
Kill the champion

885
00:54:07,574 --> 00:54:11,205
before he learns
his true potential.

886
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:14,295
Or he will defeat you.

887
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:16,677
Show me where to find him.

888
00:54:31,483 --> 00:54:33,983
Oh, Greed...

889
00:54:34,658 --> 00:54:36,658
you can have him.

890
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,402
No.

891
00:54:40,556 --> 00:54:42,556
No!

892
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:44,782
No!

893
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:46,902
No!

894
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:07,713
<i>Family is more
than just a word.</i>

895
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,932
<i>At Sivana Industries,</i>

896
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:12,684
<i>our focus is family.</i>

897
00:55:36,009 --> 00:55:38,406
Uh, Burke?

898
00:55:40,252 --> 00:55:42,252
Where's the truck?

899
00:55:51,002 --> 00:55:53,002
I can hear it.

900
00:56:02,189 --> 00:56:05,404
- Oh, my God!
- My truck!

901
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:07,972
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

902
00:56:08,301 --> 00:56:10,205
You know, guys...

903
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:12,380
I don't think that's
gonna buff out.

904
00:56:21,738 --> 00:56:24,346
Making the cripple kid
do the dirty work, wow.

905
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:26,634
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

906
00:56:26,714 --> 00:56:28,714
And I can't?

907
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:30,513
Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

908
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:32,626
of someone who's
hatching schemes.

909
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:35,296
- M-My face? This face?
- Yeah.

910
00:56:35,376 --> 00:56:37,376
Okay.

911
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,184
You boys got a hall pass?

912
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:46,978
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

913
00:56:47,344 --> 00:56:49,344
You.

914
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,949
You look like
you're up to somethin'.

915
00:56:53,029 --> 00:56:55,453
Me? Up to something?
No. Never.

916
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:56,661
I'm not up to something.

917
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:58,322
Our dad's picking us up.

918
00:56:58,402 --> 00:57:00,872
He, uh, he got held up at the...
the business

919
00:57:00,952 --> 00:57:01,907
office.

920
00:57:01,987 --> 00:57:03,739
The business office, huh?

921
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:04,852
Sure, kid.

922
00:57:04,932 --> 00:57:05,957
Look.

923
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:09,595
Parents or guardians
must appear physically

924
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:11,296
to check out students.

925
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:12,797
Gotcha.

926
00:57:12,877 --> 00:57:14,878
Okay, well, uh,
you hear that, Dad?

927
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:16,914
- Hey.
- Shazam!

928
00:57:16,994 --> 00:57:18,196
Oh, hey, there, son!

929
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:20,286
Oh, hey, there,
other son that I also have

930
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:22,458
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

931
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm so sorry I'm late,
I got held up

932
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,472
at the business office.

933
00:57:27,552 --> 00:57:28,801
Doing all the work stuff.

934
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:32,867
This is the-the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

935
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:33,898
Oh.

936
00:57:33,978 --> 00:57:35,729
That's the other one.
This one sucks.

937
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:37,911
This is... that's not funny.

938
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:41,096
I gotta talk to him about that.
I apologize.

939
00:57:41,176 --> 00:57:42,678
Anyway, this is me
appearing physically

940
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:44,513
to check my sons out of school.

941
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:46,459
So, thank you so much
for keeping them safe,

942
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:48,345

I've been thinkin' about that.

Catchphrases, obviously, aren't
one of your superpowers.

01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,463

we're gonna have to be

making this purchase

01:01:37,047 --> 01:01:39,367

Overlooking some water.

1048
01:01:40,591 --> 01:01:42,262

seas below it.

1049
01:01:42,342 --> 01:01:44,368
- Rough, you know.
- Like waterfall, so you can, like...

1050
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:46,726
Waterfall! Yeah,
if you have water... Yeah.

1051
01:01:46,806 --> 01:01:49,147

01:01:51,046 --> 01:01:52,124
Look, Max.

1054
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:53,276
Why don't you just

1055
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:55,240
start with how many
bedrooms you're looking for?

1056
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,338
- One.
- Seven.

1057
01:01:56,418 --> 01:01:57,403
- One?
- Seven?

1058
01:01:57,483 --> 01:02:00,162
What? Am I runnin'
a foster home now?

1059
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:13,046
See the one where he throws
the football into space?

1060
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:14,079
So dope.

1061
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:16,057
Hey, you know, you guys gotta
wonder who's filming those, right?

1062
01:02:16,137 --> 01:02:18,335
I mean, that's bravery
in and of itself.

1063
01:02:18,578 --> 01:02:19,770
I mean, is it though?

1064
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,246
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

1065
01:02:22,326 --> 01:02:24,131
Holding a camera?

1066
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,336
Staring in the face of danger.

1067
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:28,606

1068
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:30,597
Hey, Freeman.

1069
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:32,389
I-I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

1070
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:35,156
What, is your bestie gonna hit
us with a wheelchair this time?

1071
01:02:35,236 --> 01:02:37,272
No, maybe not him but
I have another best friend.

1072
01:02:37,352 --> 01:02:39,849
Who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

1073
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:41,845
- Okay, Freddy.
- You may have heard of him.

1074
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,215
Uh, uh, the Human Powerstorm.

1075

Frequency Flinger,
Sir-Zaps-A-Lot.

1076
01:02:46,538 --> 01:02:48,344
Yeah, he's a man of many names.

1077
01:02:48,424 --> 01:02:50,550
You know the Red Cyclone?
You?

1078
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,425
Huh. My ass, you do.

1079
01:02:52,505 --> 01:02:54,511
Oh, we're a lot
closer than you think.

1080
01:02:54,591 --> 01:02:56,425
Maybe even at this very moment.

1081
01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:57,483
Prove it.

1082
01:02:57,563 --> 01:03:00,651
I will tomorrow. Tomorrow
he's gonna come to lunch and...

1083
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:01,885
R-Right, Billy?

1084
01:03:01,965 --> 01:03:03,024
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's

1085
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:05,634
gonna be bringing us
dessert, right?

1086
01:03:07,812 --> 01:03:09,719
Tomorrow, at lunch.
You'll see.

1087
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:11,824
And when he doesn't show, then

1088
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:13,904
we'll kick your ass.

1089
01:03:16,017 --> 01:03:17,472
So wait, my identity's a secret

1090
01:03:17,552 --> 01:03:19,706
so no one I know can get hurt.

1091
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:21,350
Except when it makes
you look cool, then

1092
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,774
then it's all good.

1093
01:03:22,854 --> 01:03:24,318
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains

1094
01:03:24,398 --> 01:03:26,330
they're just super douchebags.

1095
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,637
So you're breaking your own rule?

1096
01:03:28,717 --> 01:03:30,451
Got it.

1097
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:33,491
This thing is as much as
mine as it is yours.

1098
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:36,768
I'm starting to think you
think it's all your thing.

1099
01:03:36,977 --> 01:03:39,215
Billy, you're still gonna
do it, though, right?

1100
01:03:39,297 --> 01:03:41,601
I mean, what would
a good brother do?

1101
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:45,213
All hands on deck!

1102
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,818
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

1103
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:52,447
Thank you for this food.

1104
01:03:52,527 --> 01:03:55,075
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

1105
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:01,662
Big news in Philly.
They found a costumed hero.

1106
01:04:01,778 --> 01:04:03,204
He's doing good.

1107
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:04,970
Yeah, but is he, though?

1108
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,014
Oooh, controversy.

1109
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:08,049
Into it.

1110
01:04:08,129 --> 01:04:11,267
Share with us your
perspective, Eugene.

1111
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,314
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

1112
01:04:14,394 --> 01:04:17,430
So what? I can charge a phone...
with a plug.

1113
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:18,927
Preach.

1114
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:21,681
Pedro, any thoughts?

1115
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,900
Costume's stupid?

1116
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:27,530
Big white cape like, he's
getting married or something.

1117
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,683
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1118
01:04:29,763 --> 01:04:31,969
Ever think about that?

1119
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:33,980
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1120
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:35,705
Yeah, Freddy, let's

1121
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:37,646
manage to see the positive.

1122
01:04:37,726 --> 01:04:39,817
Okay, well, I think
it looks like

1123
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:42,208
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1124
01:04:42,288 --> 01:04:44,722
Very specific. All right.

1125
01:04:44,802 --> 01:04:45,907
Maybe to this superhero,

1126
01:04:45,987 --> 01:04:48,071
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1127
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,590
"Clingy", wow, interesting take.

1128
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,841
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just

1129
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,416
wants a little me time.

1130
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:55,541
You know, me time can
also be construed as

1131
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:56,788
pushing away his family.

1132
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:58,984
Family. Is that
what they are now?

1133
01:04:59,064 --> 01:05:00,786
It's a classic symptom of
superhero syndrome

1134
01:05:00,866 --> 01:05:03,059
coined by German psychologist

1135
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:05,060
Heinrich de Von...
German something, where

1136
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,176
superpowers become an
all-consuming narcotic.

1137
01:05:09,445 --> 01:05:11,257
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1138
01:05:11,337 --> 01:05:12,964
What he needs is a sidekick.

1139
01:05:13,044 --> 01:05:15,419
Name one cool sidekick.

1140
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:18,319
Darla, why are you so
quiet over there, baby?

1141
01:05:18,399 --> 01:05:20,463
You're never
at a loss for words.

1142
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:22,543
I'm eating.

1143
01:05:32,738 --> 01:05:34,769
Why am I still doing this?

1144
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,880
Billy, you can't skip every day.

1145
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,960
Not at your age.

1146
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:41,171
I'm not your age anymore.

1147
01:05:41,478 --> 01:05:43,386
But I can go with you,
we just gotta

1148
01:05:43,466 --> 01:05:45,269
trick the guard out,
you know, and then...

1149
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:47,268
Billy, where are you going?

1150
01:05:47,348 --> 01:05:49,019
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1151
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:50,330
Billy?

1152
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:53,840
Sir-Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1153
01:05:59,547 --> 01:06:00,876
<i>♪ Here we go now ♪</i>

1154

1155
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:03,403
<i>♪ Come and feel me flow ♪</i>

1156
01:06:03,483 --> 01:06:04,913
All right!

1157
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:06,892
Did you check it?

1158
01:06:06,972 --> 01:06:10,631
People typically, like, give me
a little money, you know, to...

1159
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:13,433
You're a sweet couple,
you guys have a good day.

1160
01:06:25,251 --> 01:06:26,219
Oh, my God.

1161
01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:28,036
Mary, Mary, are you okay?
Are you...

1162
01:06:28,116 --> 01:06:29,249
How do you know my name?

1163
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:31,814
Uh, how do I know
your name? Uh...

1164
01:06:31,894 --> 01:06:34,657
Uh, one of my superpowers
is name-guessing.

1165
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:36,518
Which is really weird, I bet.

1166
01:06:36,598 --> 01:06:38,847
Uh, it's not as cool as super
strength or super speed

1167
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:41,920
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1168
01:06:42,441 --> 01:06:43,815
Are you hurt?

1169
01:06:43,895 --> 01:06:46,301
No, I'm... I'm okay.

1170
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:48,381
Thank you, um...

1171
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:51,648
I just need a second to think.

1172
01:06:51,728 --> 01:06:53,527
This has been such
a weird day.

1173
01:06:53,607 --> 01:06:58,050
Um, using my powers
of super observation,

1174
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:00,596
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1175
01:07:00,676 --> 01:07:04,507
in your hand. Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1176
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:09,778
I got in.

1177
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:13,511
Uh... well, now my
superpowers are failing me

1178
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:15,801
and I'm very confused.

1179
01:07:16,485 --> 01:07:18,683
Yeah, me too.

1180
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:21,490
I don't know. I know I should be
excited 'cause this is my dream

1181
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:24,591
and I worked really,
really hard for this.

1182
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:26,671
But it's like...

1183
01:07:28,617 --> 01:07:31,281
I don't know, leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1184
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:34,256
Can I-Can I-Can I give you
a little piece of advice?

1185
01:07:34,336 --> 01:07:36,091
Don't be worried about
everybody else.

1186
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:37,975
Always look out for number one.

1187
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:40,323
- Gandhi said that.
- I don't think he said that.

1188
01:07:40,403 --> 01:07:42,192
- Yeah, he did.
- Gandhi did not say that.

1189
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:43,927
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.
- Take care of number one?

1190
01:07:44,007 --> 01:07:46,246
It was a really wi...
It might have been Yoda.

1191
01:07:46,326 --> 01:07:47,518
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1192
01:07:47,598 --> 01:07:49,433
Agree to disagree.
The point is...

1193
01:07:49,513 --> 01:07:51,786
You do you, you know?
You gotta look out for you.

1194
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:54,890
And get as far away from
this place as you can.

1195
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:57,832
I don't know if I want to.

1196
01:07:57,912 --> 01:07:59,256
Of course you do.
What are you gonna do?

1197
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:01,936
You're gonna live in a group
home for the rest of your life?

1198
01:08:03,281 --> 01:08:05,769
Look, families are for people who
can't take care of themselves.

1199
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:08,114
Okay? So.

1200
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:10,394
And you know, y-you can take
care of yourself, you know.

1201
01:08:10,474 --> 01:08:13,071
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1202
01:08:17,766 --> 01:08:19,766
I'll just call him.

1203
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:25,151
It's ringing.

1204
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:29,135
Red Cyclone! Hey!
Hey, what's goin' on?

1205
01:08:29,678 --> 01:08:31,387
Oh, that's crazy.
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1206
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:32,815
Yeah, it's crazy.
That is...

1207
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,895
Great story.

1208
01:08:34,988 --> 01:08:36,988
He's not talking.

1209
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:39,579
I was! I was!

1210
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:41,248
We're friends.
I know him. I do.

1211
01:08:41,328 --> 01:08:43,328
I know... I know...

1212
01:08:47,363 --> 01:08:49,363
Shit.

1213
01:08:52,815 --> 01:08:54,055
Come on, now.

1214
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:57,259
♪ Hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪

1215
01:08:57,339 --> 01:08:59,080

♪ Lightning with my hands. ♪

1217
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,206
Hey! Hey!

1218
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:04,525
Hey, young man.

1219
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:05,784
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1220
01:09:05,864 --> 01:09:07,512
I'm in the middle
of a show right now.

1221
01:09:07,592 --> 01:09:08,740
How can I help you?

1222
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,835
I just wanna say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1223
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:14,925
Yeah, I got a little something
called a suitcase wedgie, right?

1224
01:09:15,005 --> 01:09:16,696
I don't know if you've ever
heard of it, but it's when

1225
01:09:16,776 --> 01:09:18,664
someone grabs your
underwear like that

1226
01:09:18,744 --> 01:09:20,092
and hold you like a suitcase,

1227
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:21,923
walks you down the hallway.

1228
01:09:22,003 --> 01:09:24,726
And this was my underwear.

1229
01:09:27,011 --> 01:09:28,396
Gross.

1230
01:09:28,476 --> 01:09:29,631
You said you'd come.

1231
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:32,199
You said I will come,
I never said I was...

1232
01:09:32,304 --> 01:09:33,790
I'm a superhero, dude.

1233
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,452
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1234
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:37,160
How much are people
paying you today?

1235
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,529
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1236
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,818
But that's cool because I can
carry that burden with my...

01:09:42,898 --> 01:09:45,973
♪ hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪

1238
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,374
Holy moley.

1239
01:10:15,276 --> 01:10:16,571
Don't move!

1240
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:18,651
Nobody move!

1241
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:27,573
Oh, no.

1242
01:10:27,653 --> 01:10:29,227
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay, stay.

1243
01:10:29,307 --> 01:10:31,586
Stay. Stay. Stay.

1244

Oh.

1245
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,754
Oh, that looked like it hurts.

1246
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:44,058
It's him!

1247
01:10:44,138 --> 01:10:46,256
It's the superhero guy!

1248
01:10:46,918 --> 01:10:48,472
Save us!

1249
01:10:48,552 --> 01:10:50,552
Come on.

1250
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:53,719
Come...

1251
01:10:54,726 --> 01:10:57,425
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1252
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:07,858
What?

1253
01:11:14,378 --> 01:11:17,076
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1254
01:11:17,216 --> 01:11:19,366
That is the worst idea ever!

1255
01:11:28,477 --> 01:11:31,021
Oho! Oh, I did it!

1256
01:11:31,101 --> 01:11:32,206
I did it!

1257
01:11:32,286 --> 01:11:34,529
I got the bus!
I got the bus.

1258
01:11:34,609 --> 01:11:36,282
Nobody move in there!

1259
01:11:36,362 --> 01:11:38,743
I gotta put this thing down,
I gotta put this thing down.

1260
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,738
No, no, no, doggie, doggie,
you have to move. Move!

1261
01:11:46,818 --> 01:11:48,009
Shoo! Shoo!

1262
01:11:48,089 --> 01:11:49,868
Please be a good dog.
Good dog!

1263
01:11:49,948 --> 01:11:51,725
Ooh, you're being a bad dog.

1264
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:53,648
Go! Go!

1265
01:11:53,728 --> 01:11:55,751
Please go. Please move.

1266
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,522
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1267
01:11:58,752 --> 01:12:00,752
Thank you.

1268
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:16,915
Yeah.

1269
01:12:16,995 --> 01:12:19,129
Yeah, no, no, no, my f...

1270
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,285
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1271
01:12:21,365 --> 01:12:22,390
Thank you, thank you.

1272
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:24,992
You know, it's kinda
my fault, anyway.

1273
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:30,520
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1274
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,443
in the form of
its very own superhero.

1275
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:36,261
And we're out.

1276
01:12:36,341 --> 01:12:38,161
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1277
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:40,817
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1278
01:12:40,897 --> 01:12:44,036
Yeah, you electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1279
01:12:44,116 --> 01:12:46,008
And then I caught it!

1280
01:12:46,088 --> 01:12:49,465
Freddy! I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1281
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:51,827
I caught a bus like people
catch fly balls, like...

1282
01:12:51,907 --> 01:12:53,136
Who does that? I do that.

1283
01:12:53,216 --> 01:12:54,990
Billy, you do nothing, you...

1284
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,885
you take selfies and
make people pay you.

1285
01:12:57,965 --> 01:12:58,934
You know what, forget it.

1286
01:12:59,014 --> 01:13:01,202
I can't really talk to you
when you look like this.

1287
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:03,282
You just wish it was you.

1288
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:05,267
No shit.

1289
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,340
You think?

1290
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,935
I would kill to have
what you have.

1291
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:10,659
'Cause everything I do

1292
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:12,360
is like, some-some
desperate attempt

1293
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,444
to get people to notice me.

1294
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:16,216
To not feel sorry for me.

1295
01:13:16,296 --> 01:13:17,718
I mean, look at me.
Look at me.

1296
01:13:17,798 --> 01:13:19,448
Do you even see me?

1297
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,630
'Cause most people don't.

1298
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:24,063
'Cause they don't want to.

1299
01:13:24,235 --> 01:13:26,235
And now you don't either.

1300
01:13:26,503 --> 01:13:28,606
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1301
01:13:28,686 --> 01:13:30,292
I mean, Billy, you're 14.

1302
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,610
And now you're no
better than the Breyers.

1303
01:13:32,751 --> 01:13:34,396
All this power,

1304
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:37,897
and all you did was turn
into a showoff and a bully.

1305
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,122
Whatever, kid.

1306
01:13:41,202 --> 01:13:43,202
I do what I want!

1307
01:13:44,342 --> 01:13:47,496
And I'm like mid-20s, probably.

1308
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,970
Maybe even, like, 30.

1309
01:13:53,245 --> 01:13:55,245
Chosen one.

1310
01:13:58,082 --> 01:14:00,621
The so-called perfect man.

1311
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:03,638
Pure of heart.

1312
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:06,449
Flawless in every way.

1313
01:14:08,555 --> 01:14:10,198
What made you so worthy?

1314
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,268
I'm sorry, can I help...
can I help...?

1315
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:13,803
D'you want a autograph
or somethin'?

1316
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:15,883
Give me your power.

1317
01:14:17,971 --> 01:14:19,123
Or die.

1318
01:14:19,203 --> 01:14:21,203
Oh, snap.

1319
01:14:21,392 --> 01:14:22,736
You're like a bad guy, right?

1320
01:14:22,816 --> 01:14:23,776
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1321
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:25,922
Look, before this gets
really stupid for you,

1322
01:14:26,002 --> 01:14:28,430
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1323
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:39,756
The weapons of man draw
no blood from our kind.

1324
01:14:39,836 --> 01:14:41,836
This is the...

1325
01:14:41,947 --> 01:14:45,169
The only thing that
extinguishes magic

1326
01:14:45,249 --> 01:14:47,249
is magic.

1327
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:50,575
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1328
01:14:52,759 --> 01:14:56,199
Oho, you did not see that one
coming, did you, grandpa?

1329
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:58,523
Them's street rules!

1330
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,903
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1331
01:15:08,983 --> 01:15:10,908
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1332
01:15:10,988 --> 01:15:12,635
I never should've punched
you in the nuts like that.

1333
01:15:12,715 --> 01:15:13,923
That was totally my bad.

1334
01:15:14,003 --> 01:15:15,362
We can talk about this.

1335
01:15:15,442 --> 01:15:16,771
You grovel like a child.

1336
01:15:16,851 --> 01:15:19,059
That's because I am one.
I-I'm a kid.

1337
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:21,139
You don't want to
hurt a kid, do you?

1338
01:15:23,597 --> 01:15:24,662
I believe I can fly!

1339
01:15:24,742 --> 01:15:26,310
I believe I can fly!
I can fly!

1340
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,745
Freddy said if I believe,
I can fly!

1341
01:15:27,825 --> 01:15:29,367
Then I can fly, so I believe!

1342
01:15:29,447 --> 01:15:30,672
I believe, oh, please!

1343
01:15:30,752 --> 01:15:32,230
Okay! Superman!

1344
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:34,706
Superman!
What arm is it?!

1345
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:36,224
Why am I not flying?!

1346
01:15:36,304 --> 01:15:38,619
Please, I don't wanna die!

1347
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:52,899
Oh.

1348
01:15:54,146 --> 01:15:56,146
Oh.

1349
01:15:57,377 --> 01:15:58,641
Whoa.

1350
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,357
Whoa.

1351
01:16:00,437 --> 01:16:02,507
I'm floating!

1352
01:16:09,034 --> 01:16:11,034
What the hell was that?

1353
01:16:14,962 --> 01:16:17,213
I can fly!

1354
01:16:22,732 --> 01:16:24,732
Billy?

1355
01:16:25,308 --> 01:16:27,190
Freddy! I need your help!

1356
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,270
You can fly?

1357
01:16:36,678 --> 01:16:38,302
Who's the other guy?

1358
01:16:38,382 --> 01:16:40,382
Santa!

1359
01:16:42,493 --> 01:16:46,471
So, like, what you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1360
01:16:46,551 --> 01:16:49,070
Well, in some ways,

1361
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,475
Santa's always here for you.

1362
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:57,984
Oh, help!

1363
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,904
Help Santa!

1364
01:16:59,984 --> 01:17:02,333
Santa needs help!

1365
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:04,539
Give us a shout if you need us.

1366
01:17:10,738 --> 01:17:14,223
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's okay.

1367
01:17:17,163 --> 01:17:18,531
This is crazy!

1368
01:17:18,611 --> 01:17:20,105
This is crazy. You don't
have to fight this guy.

1369
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:22,310
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1370
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:25,246
Yes! You can run. Awesome.

1371
01:17:30,037 --> 01:17:31,591
<i>♪ Round and round ♪</i>

1372
01:17:31,671 --> 01:17:33,083
<i>♪ Round and round ♪</i>

1373
01:17:33,163 --> 01:17:34,371
Get back!

1374
01:17:34,451 --> 01:17:36,120
Just get... Get away!

1375
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,138
<i>♪ Wheels on the bus
go round and round ♪</i>

1376
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:40,749
<i>I'm Batman.</i>
Get him, Batman!

1377
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:12,268
Come on!

1378
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,384
Sh... Shazam!

1379
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:11,158
Billy!

1380
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:13,418
Billy!

1381
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,910
Billy, where are you?

1382
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,453
Billy!

1383
01:19:20,748 --> 01:19:22,748
Where are you, Billy?

1384
01:19:26,547 --> 01:19:28,547
Billy, come on!

1385
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,586
Billy.

1386
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:35,313
- Where is he?
- Um, supervillain.

1387
01:19:35,393 --> 01:19:38,091
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1388
01:19:38,752 --> 01:19:40,261
Worse.

1389
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:41,742
Much worse.

1390
01:19:41,822 --> 01:19:43,148
Radioactive anthromorph.

1391
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:45,256
Psychic energy manipulator.

1392
01:19:45,336 --> 01:19:46,535
I won't let you read my mind.

1393
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,689
My mind is blank.
You can't get in.

1394
01:19:48,769 --> 01:19:50,850
I don't need to read your mind.

1395
01:19:50,973 --> 01:19:53,402
Because you are going to tell me.

1396
01:19:53,566 --> 01:19:55,566
Where is he?

1397
01:20:07,366 --> 01:20:09,400
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1398
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,445
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1399
01:20:11,525 --> 01:20:12,919
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1400
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:14,158
Come inside.

1401
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:16,238
We need to have a talk.

1402
01:20:16,685 --> 01:20:18,965
Just don't be so
hard on him, okay?

1403
01:20:25,523 --> 01:20:27,411
Running out on us.
Lying.

1404
01:20:27,491 --> 01:20:29,259
Huh? Then I get
a call from the school

1405
01:20:29,339 --> 01:20:31,028
telling me you've
been cutting class.

1406
01:20:31,108 --> 01:20:33,108
Getting in fights.

1407
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:41,324
Whoa, is that...?

1408
01:20:42,937 --> 01:20:45,659
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1409
01:20:48,163 --> 01:20:52,500
What's a superhero
doing with Freddy?

1410
01:20:55,243 --> 01:20:56,595
You remember dinner?

1411
01:20:56,675 --> 01:20:58,695
When Billy and
Freddy were arguing

1412
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:01,331
like an old married
couple like this?

1413
01:21:01,845 --> 01:21:04,474
When he rescued me, he
knew I lived in a group home.

1414
01:21:04,554 --> 01:21:07,062
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1415
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:16,134
Wait.

1416
01:21:16,214 --> 01:21:18,661
Are you saying Billy's
the Human Powerstorm?

1417
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,665
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1418
01:21:20,745 --> 01:21:22,198
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1419
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:23,502
I didn't break any promises.

1420
01:21:23,582 --> 01:21:24,817
You knew?

1421
01:21:24,897 --> 01:21:27,021
I'm a good sister!

1422
01:21:30,688 --> 01:21:32,688
I mean, what were you thinking?

1423
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,411
Then you bring Freddy into it.

1424
01:21:40,978 --> 01:21:44,344
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset. Okay?

1425
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:55,930
Billy?

1426
01:22:00,221 --> 01:22:02,221
You're him.

1427
01:22:02,566 --> 01:22:04,587
You're the hero.

1428
01:22:05,089 --> 01:22:07,923
Yeah, well, not anymore, so.

1429
01:22:11,715 --> 01:22:14,082
Why do you have my notebook?

1430
01:22:16,372 --> 01:22:18,758
Eugene finished your search.

1431
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:21,333
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1432
01:22:21,413 --> 01:22:23,804
But I have played
Watchdogs and Uplink.

1433
01:22:23,884 --> 01:22:25,743
And maybe I did
pick up a few skills

1434
01:22:25,823 --> 01:22:27,850
which maybe did get me
into federal databases

1435
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:29,168
most people can't get into, but...

1436
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,460
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1437
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:35,175
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1438
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:41,528
What?

1439
01:22:41,608 --> 01:22:43,506
You were born in
Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1440
01:22:43,586 --> 01:22:45,493
They divorced when
you were three.

1441
01:22:45,573 --> 01:22:47,116
Your mom moved here that year.

1442
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:49,728
20 months later, you got lost.

1443
01:22:49,808 --> 01:22:52,208
You never found them 'cause
your dad's been in prison

1444
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,886
in Florida for 10 years.

1445
01:22:53,966 --> 01:22:55,966
And your mom's...

1446
01:22:56,704 --> 01:22:58,704
What?

1447
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,996
Is she dead?

1448
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,656
She's two subway stops away.

1449
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,196
What?

1450
01:23:06,276 --> 01:23:07,229
You know, you didn't find her

1451
01:23:07,309 --> 01:23:10,032
because she reverted
to her maiden name.

1452
01:23:13,846 --> 01:23:16,696
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1453
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,843
Victor, get the keys.

1454
01:23:20,923 --> 01:23:23,550
Kids, stay here,
in case Billy comes back.

1455
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,488
Get inside. Let's go.

1456
01:23:41,465 --> 01:23:44,479
Wait. I thought we were
running after Billy?

1457
01:23:44,559 --> 01:23:47,615
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1458
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:52,634
Billy?

1459
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:56,690
Freddy?

1460
01:24:00,058 --> 01:24:02,342
Oh, how quaint.

1461
01:24:05,153 --> 01:24:07,636
Actually, I take that back.

1462
01:24:09,053 --> 01:24:11,131
What a shithole.

1463
01:24:54,106 --> 01:24:56,106
Just a second.

1464
01:25:00,021 --> 01:25:01,451
Hey, look, I'm late for
work already, all right?

1465
01:25:01,531 --> 01:25:03,659
We don't need any
magazines or whatever.

1466
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:05,746
Oh, I'm not.

1467
01:25:06,444 --> 01:25:08,611
You probably don't
recognize me, but

1468
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,196
I found my way home.

1469
01:25:13,196 --> 01:25:15,196
Mom.

1470
01:25:16,146 --> 01:25:18,146
It's me.

1471
01:25:18,658 --> 01:25:20,658
Oh, God.

1472
01:25:21,301 --> 01:25:23,301
Is it?

1473
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,216
Um, hang on.

1474
01:25:28,538 --> 01:25:30,538
Who's at the door?

1475
01:25:31,065 --> 01:25:32,828
It's um...

1476
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:35,129
It's no one, Travis.

1477
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,569
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1478
01:25:42,139 --> 01:25:44,089
No, I...

1479
01:25:44,169 --> 01:25:47,352
Listen, it's um...

1480
01:25:48,885 --> 01:25:50,885
It's really you, huh?

1481
01:25:52,526 --> 01:25:54,564
I didn't mean to run away.

1482
01:25:54,644 --> 01:25:56,710
You know that, right?

1483
01:25:56,965 --> 01:25:59,673
I let go but it was by
accident, I...

1484
01:25:59,753 --> 01:26:01,895
Yeah, I know, I know.

1485
01:26:02,355 --> 01:26:04,471
I saw you.

1486
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:06,869
What?

1487
01:26:09,258 --> 01:26:11,385
I saw you after.

1488
01:26:13,522 --> 01:26:16,665
So, it was never your fault.

1489
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,117
I was 17.

1490
01:26:20,226 --> 01:26:22,229
And my dad, he kicked me out.

1491
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:24,343
And your dad just...

1492
01:26:24,423 --> 01:26:27,248
decided not to be
a part of anything.

1493
01:26:27,343 --> 01:26:30,756
And I was hurting
and I was screwed up.

1494
01:26:32,795 --> 01:26:33,757
I want the tiger.

1495
01:26:33,837 --> 01:26:36,108
I know, I know, honey, but

1496
01:26:36,188 --> 01:26:38,974
Mom's not exactly going pro
here, okay?

1497
01:26:41,552 --> 01:26:43,239
Billy?

1498
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:45,245
Billy!

1499
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,062
Billy!

1500
01:26:47,142 --> 01:26:49,872
Jesus Christ, Billy,
this isn't funny!

1501
01:26:50,007 --> 01:26:52,007
Here you go, buddy.

1502
01:26:56,990 --> 01:27:00,215
But it's just once
I saw you with the police,

1503
01:27:00,295 --> 01:27:01,943
I realized that

1504
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:05,904
they could do a better job taking
care of you than I ever will.

1505
01:27:10,628 --> 01:27:12,628
But you're good, right?

1506
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,158
I mean you landed on your feet.

1507
01:27:16,986 --> 01:27:18,986
'Cause, I mean, you look real good.

1508
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,070
It's just...

1509
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:27,877
Now is not a really
good time for me, Billy.

1510
01:27:31,925 --> 01:27:34,504
All I wanted to do was

1511
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,734
let you know
I'm doing good, but...

1512
01:27:38,715 --> 01:27:41,898
I have to get back
to my real family, so.

1513
01:27:43,594 --> 01:27:45,594
Here.

1514
01:27:48,437 --> 01:27:50,139
What's this?

1515
01:27:50,219 --> 01:27:53,411
Marilyn! What's
going on out there?

1516
01:27:53,627 --> 01:27:55,682
You might need it
more than me.

1517
01:28:13,071 --> 01:28:15,948
Freddy, you were right.
Sorry I yelled at you.

1518
01:28:16,028 --> 01:28:18,028
<i>Come home, Billy.</i>

1519
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,694
<i>Come home.</i>

1520
01:28:19,774 --> 01:28:23,229
<i>Billy! Supervillain!
Supervillain!</i>

1521
01:28:39,286 --> 01:28:41,286
Shazam!

1522
01:28:54,161 --> 01:28:56,796
Who are you?
What do you want?

1523
01:28:56,876 --> 01:28:58,876
What do I want?

1524
01:28:59,099 --> 01:29:01,099
I want...

1525
01:29:05,433 --> 01:29:07,433
That.

1526
01:29:07,715 --> 01:29:09,715
Whoa.

1527
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,440
Kick his ass, Billy!

1528
01:29:16,542 --> 01:29:17,529
Oh, God.

1529
01:29:17,609 --> 01:29:18,887
Yes, Billy.

1530
01:29:18,967 --> 01:29:20,967
Try it, by all means.

1531
01:29:21,129 --> 01:29:22,954
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1532
01:29:23,034 --> 01:29:25,100
Oh, first you come inside,

1533
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:27,560
then maybe I'll let them go.

1534
01:29:43,863 --> 01:29:45,863
Good boy.

1535
01:29:47,899 --> 01:29:50,351
'Cause that's all you are, isn't it?

1536
01:29:50,703 --> 01:29:52,219
How old are you?

1537
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:55,181
- Basically, 15.
- Hmm.

1538
01:29:56,595 --> 01:29:58,231
When I was a child,

1539
01:29:58,311 --> 01:30:00,415
the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1540
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,227
And here you are,

1541
01:30:02,307 --> 01:30:04,307
a coward.

1542
01:30:04,546 --> 01:30:06,316
Run from me?

1543
01:30:06,396 --> 01:30:09,051
And that wizard chooses you.
You're not a hero.

1544
01:30:09,131 --> 01:30:12,418
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1545
01:30:12,605 --> 01:30:14,473
Give me the power
of a champion.

1546
01:30:14,553 --> 01:30:16,568
No, don't do it, Billy!

1547
01:30:32,805 --> 01:30:34,547
Give me the power

1548
01:30:34,627 --> 01:30:35,620
and I'll let them go.

1549
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:36,932
Darla, no.

1550
01:30:37,012 --> 01:30:38,785
Don't, don't go, Billy!

1551
01:30:38,865 --> 01:30:40,993
Don't go! Don't go, Billy!

1552
01:30:41,073 --> 01:30:43,356
No, no, I-I have to,
I have to, it's...

1553
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:46,905
It's what a good brother
would do, right?

1554
01:30:51,095 --> 01:30:53,095
Billy.

1555
01:31:18,459 --> 01:31:21,570
I dedicated my life
to getting here.

1556
01:31:22,398 --> 01:31:24,271
I scoured the earth.

1557
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:26,351
No one believed me.

1558
01:31:26,765 --> 01:31:28,684
No one helped.

1559
01:31:28,764 --> 01:31:30,764
Not the wizard.

1560
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:33,286
Not my family.

1561
01:31:34,485 --> 01:31:36,516
I only had myself.

1562
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,824
I get it.

1563
01:31:39,383 --> 01:31:41,383
I get what that's like.

1564
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:44,585
Feeling like you're
all alone in the world.

1565
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,302
Stand.

1566
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:49,197
Feeling like there's that one
thing, if you could just find it,

1567
01:31:49,277 --> 01:31:51,040
then you'd finally
be good enough.

1568
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,120
Stand.

1569
01:31:54,487 --> 01:31:56,708
The champion's name.

1570
01:31:57,869 --> 01:31:59,869
Say it.

1571
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:27,401
Look, no offense, mister,

1572
01:32:27,481 --> 01:32:30,769
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1573
01:32:30,849 --> 01:32:34,060
Don't listen to this child.

1574
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,517
Take the staff.

1575
01:32:36,597 --> 01:32:41,718
Hold it and say
the champion's name.

1576
01:32:41,798 --> 01:32:43,784
They're using you.

1577
01:32:43,864 --> 01:32:46,403
You have to see that.
That they are using you.

1578
01:32:46,483 --> 01:32:48,483
Say your name.

1579
01:32:51,271 --> 01:32:53,153
His name...

1580
01:32:53,233 --> 01:32:55,319
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1581
01:32:55,399 --> 01:32:56,964
And we're gonna
keep throwing things

1582
01:32:57,044 --> 01:32:59,180
at your big, fat, ugly ass head

1583
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:01,640
until you let our brother go.

1584
01:33:26,306 --> 01:33:28,446
Boy, am I glad I didn't
sell that batarang.

1585
01:33:28,526 --> 01:33:29,782
Pedro, is that a lamp?

1586
01:33:29,862 --> 01:33:32,091
- It's an ugly one.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1587
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:34,259
Guys, I appreciate the
thought, I really do.

1588
01:33:34,339 --> 01:33:35,905
But I don't think your
weapons are gonna help.

1589
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:37,985
You can put 'em down now.

1590
01:33:38,897 --> 01:33:40,331
The door was right here.

1591
01:33:40,411 --> 01:33:41,832
Billy, how do we
get out of here?

1592
01:33:41,912 --> 01:33:44,159
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1593
01:33:44,474 --> 01:33:45,546
This way!

1594
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:47,685
Go, go, go, go, go with Darla.
Good job, Darla!

1595
01:33:47,765 --> 01:33:48,964
Go, go, go, go!

1596
01:33:49,044 --> 01:33:51,044
Kids?

1597
01:33:51,348 --> 01:33:52,826
Why is this open?

1598
01:33:52,906 --> 01:33:54,309
Freddy?

1599
01:33:54,389 --> 01:33:56,389
Mary?

1600
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:00,713
Pedro, Pedro, come on!

1601
01:34:00,793 --> 01:34:02,417
Freddy, Freddy, keep up.

1602
01:34:02,497 --> 01:34:04,497
Darla, stay in front.

1603
01:34:04,892 --> 01:34:06,892
We gotta hurry.

1604
01:34:29,404 --> 01:34:31,404
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1605
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:33,837
So many doors.

1606
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,712
One of these has to be
a way out, right?

1607
01:34:36,792 --> 01:34:38,792
Yeah, I would hope so.

1608
01:34:55,501 --> 01:34:57,501
Not this one.

1609
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:11,424
Okay, no more doors.

1610
01:35:11,504 --> 01:35:12,745
Nobody open any more doors.

1611
01:35:12,825 --> 01:35:14,363
Come on, Billy,
what are we gonna do?

1612
01:35:14,443 --> 01:35:15,603
Darla, I don't know.

1613
01:35:15,683 --> 01:35:17,089
Billy, yes, you do,
just-just think.

1614
01:35:17,169 --> 01:35:18,338
How'd you get out last time?

1615
01:35:18,418 --> 01:35:19,546
Well, uh, l-last time I
thought about the subway

1616
01:35:19,626 --> 01:35:20,825
and I was on the subway.

1617
01:35:20,905 --> 01:35:22,781
Okay, then Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1618
01:35:22,861 --> 01:35:25,571
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1619
01:35:47,831 --> 01:35:48,871
Come on, come on, come on.

1620
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:50,512
Why are you covering my eyes?

1621
01:35:50,592 --> 01:35:53,255
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

1622
01:35:53,335 --> 01:35:54,393
You're welcome.

1623
01:35:54,473 --> 01:35:56,019
Why can't I see what's inside?

1624
01:35:56,099 --> 01:35:57,563
You are not old enough.

1625
01:35:57,643 --> 01:36:00,255
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1626
01:36:00,335 --> 01:36:01,368
Not my thing.

1627
01:36:01,448 --> 01:36:02,562
W-Where's Freddy?

1628
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:03,914
Yeah, you too, Sriracha, hey,

1629
01:36:03,994 --> 01:36:05,552
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

1630
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:08,361
- Freddy, what are you doing?
- Ah, it's nice people.

1631
01:36:08,441 --> 01:36:09,838
- Nice pe...? Come on.
- Is that glitter?

1632
01:36:09,918 --> 01:36:11,436
They have glitter.
Can I get glitter?

1633
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,793
- No, not from them.
- Please?

1634
01:36:22,894 --> 01:36:24,758
Go, go, go, go!
Everybody go!

1635
01:36:24,838 --> 01:36:26,063
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

1636
01:36:26,143 --> 01:36:28,261
One, two, three,
hold onto me.

1637
01:36:36,077 --> 01:36:37,653
Carnival. Go, go, go.
Mary, go.

1638
01:36:37,733 --> 01:36:38,814
Go. Come on, Pedro.

1639
01:36:38,894 --> 01:36:40,894
Come on.

1640
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:53,630
Walk, just be cool,
act naturally,

1641
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:55,839
like kids naturally act
in a carnival.

1642
01:36:55,919 --> 01:36:57,422
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- Is that him?

1643
01:36:57,502 --> 01:36:59,234
Oh, my God, guys.

1644
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:00,291
Hey, Powerboy.

1645
01:37:00,371 --> 01:37:01,338
He's an impersonator, okay?

1646
01:37:01,418 --> 01:37:02,987
I'm an impersonator.
I'm a fake version of myself.

1647
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,067
Don't take pictures...

1648
01:37:06,177 --> 01:37:08,177
Shazam!

1649
01:37:14,993 --> 01:37:16,993
Hey, where'd he go?

1650
01:37:24,536 --> 01:37:27,703
Oh, man, oh, man,
I just spit on a baby!

1651
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:30,926
Yo, what is that?

1652
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:38,241
Champion!

1653
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,096
You don't deserve that name.

1654
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:50,603
Hiding behind innocent people
who will now die.

1655
01:37:52,181 --> 01:37:56,960
Because deep down, you're
still just a scared, little boy.

1656
01:37:58,256 --> 01:38:00,374
Oh, no.

1657
01:38:00,987 --> 01:38:02,675
Run!

1658
01:38:02,755 --> 01:38:04,755
Run!

1659
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,199
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Hold on!

1660
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:21,453
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1661
01:38:29,984 --> 01:38:32,166
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1662
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:33,337
Are you kidding?

1663
01:38:33,417 --> 01:38:34,521
Okay, no. Old guy's up there

1664
01:38:34,601 --> 01:38:36,428
harboring multiple
spiritual entities,

1665
01:38:36,508 --> 01:38:38,019
plus, I mean, he has
the same powers as you,

1666
01:38:38,099 --> 01:38:40,396
plus, you know, a-and
he knows what he's doing,

1667
01:38:40,476 --> 01:38:43,174
plus, you're my best friend,
I don't want you to die.

1668
01:38:43,645 --> 01:38:46,337
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1669
01:38:47,405 --> 01:38:49,405
he's not much of a hero.

1670
01:38:53,522 --> 01:38:55,522
That was a decent catchphrase.

1671
01:38:55,732 --> 01:38:57,732
Shazam!

1672
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:08,502
Now let's try this again.

1673
01:39:22,072 --> 01:39:24,206
Or try that again.

1674
01:39:31,658 --> 01:39:33,658
Billy, look out!

1675
01:39:35,671 --> 01:39:36,799
Laser eyes?

1676
01:39:36,879 --> 01:39:38,192
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1677
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:40,859
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1678
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:51,438
His power matrix.

1679
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:52,791
His what what?

1680
01:39:52,871 --> 01:39:55,768
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1681
01:39:56,283 --> 01:39:58,345
That's why the
batarang hurt him.

1682
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:02,005
Hey, over here!

1683
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,267
W-What are you doing?

1684
01:40:03,347 --> 01:40:04,339
Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1685
01:40:04,419 --> 01:40:07,091
We separate the sins from the
eye, and he's just an old man.

1686
01:40:07,171 --> 01:40:09,171
Gather the mutts.

1687
01:40:46,431 --> 01:40:49,686
Here, take it.
Take it, it's for you.

1688
01:40:50,358 --> 01:40:51,994
Hold it tight.

1689
01:40:52,074 --> 01:40:54,041
Close your eyes.

1690
01:40:54,121 --> 01:40:56,747
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?

1691
01:40:57,477 --> 01:40:59,477
Okay.

1692
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:24,118
Get up.

1693
01:41:39,054 --> 01:41:41,054
Shazam!

1694
01:42:08,901 --> 01:42:10,949
Playtime's over, boy.

1695
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:13,899
Your friends can't
help you anymore.

1696
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:21,208
Hey!

1697
01:42:46,976 --> 01:42:48,976
Shazam!

1698
01:43:12,982 --> 01:43:14,466
Nice trick.

1699
01:43:14,546 --> 01:43:16,119
Catchy.

1700
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:18,261
One simple word.

1701
01:43:18,623 --> 01:43:20,623
I have a better trick.

1702
01:43:21,009 --> 01:43:23,009
Four words.

1703
01:43:23,566 --> 01:43:25,566
Kill the little girl.

1704
01:43:26,128 --> 01:43:28,128
- No, please!
- No!

1705
01:43:31,186 --> 01:43:33,186
Stop!

1706
01:43:48,165 --> 01:43:51,093
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

1707
01:43:51,173 --> 01:43:53,082
You gotta just
rip it out of his face...

1708
01:43:53,162 --> 01:43:55,162
It's where he gets his power.

1709
01:43:58,863 --> 01:44:00,863
Reach for it.

1710
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:03,850
I dare you.

1711
01:44:11,889 --> 01:44:13,889
Wise decision.

1712
01:44:15,669 --> 01:44:17,669
Hands on the staff.

1713
01:44:18,403 --> 01:44:19,954
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1714
01:44:20,034 --> 01:44:22,398
- Billy!
- Don't do it, Billy!

1715
01:44:41,788 --> 01:44:43,005
Say my name

1716
01:44:43,085 --> 01:44:45,733
so my power may
flow through you.

1717
01:44:45,813 --> 01:44:48,785
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

1718
01:44:48,865 --> 01:44:50,399
And in so doing,

1719
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,384
choose you as champion.

1720
01:44:53,464 --> 01:44:57,225
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1721
01:44:57,305 --> 01:45:00,549
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await!

1722
01:45:08,325 --> 01:45:10,325
All hands on deck.

1723
01:45:14,874 --> 01:45:16,874
Say my name.

1724
01:45:17,462 --> 01:45:18,800
Billy!

1725
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,045
No, not my name. No.

1726
01:45:20,125 --> 01:45:22,814
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1727
01:45:23,041 --> 01:45:25,041
Shazam!

1728
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:05,065
Guys.

1729
01:46:05,803 --> 01:46:07,803
What's happening?

1730
01:46:11,455 --> 01:46:13,455
I can fly!

1731
01:46:17,558 --> 01:46:18,917
Guys.

1732
01:46:18,997 --> 01:46:20,997
Check out these guns.

1733
01:46:21,855 --> 01:46:23,855
No.

1734
01:46:24,048 --> 01:46:26,079
It's not possible!

1735
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:30,100
Gee whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your game.

1736
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,180
You want it back?

1737
01:46:34,007 --> 01:46:35,902
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1738
01:46:35,982 --> 01:46:39,776
but I think we should kick this
guy's butt, like, really hard.

1739
01:46:50,715 --> 01:46:52,715
Guys, I think
I can move really

1740
01:46:53,486 --> 01:46:54,880
fast.

1741
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,212
Hyperspeed!

1742
01:46:56,292 --> 01:46:58,292
Check!

1743
01:47:06,094 --> 01:47:07,388
Billy!

1744
01:47:07,468 --> 01:47:09,468
The eye.

1745
01:47:16,172 --> 01:47:18,172
Look out!

1746
01:47:19,404 --> 01:47:21,404
Whoa!

1747
01:47:22,077 --> 01:47:24,077
What?

1748
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:29,039
You almost exploded me!

1749
01:48:14,748 --> 01:48:16,650
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1750
01:48:16,730 --> 01:48:18,730
of every single superhero.

1751
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,660
What do you got?

1752
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,498
Well, that's terrifying.

1753
01:48:59,957 --> 01:49:02,615
Enough games, boy.

1754
01:49:03,145 --> 01:49:05,359
You think a pack of children can...

1755
01:49:07,979 --> 01:49:09,059
Wait, what?!

1756
01:49:09,139 --> 01:49:11,582
You will beg for mercy

1757
01:49:11,662 --> 01:49:14,051
as I feast on your heart.

1758
01:49:14,495 --> 01:49:16,495
Slow...

1759
01:49:17,086 --> 01:49:19,128
Are you making
some big, evil guy

1760
01:49:19,208 --> 01:49:20,717
speech right now or something?

1761
01:49:20,797 --> 01:49:23,041
You're like, a mile
away from me right now.

1762
01:49:23,121 --> 01:49:24,379
There's cars and trucks...

1763
01:49:24,459 --> 01:49:27,239
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1764
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:29,878
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1765
01:49:29,958 --> 01:49:31,698
Only I

1766
01:49:31,778 --> 01:49:34,282
have the power to unleash...

1767
01:49:35,187 --> 01:49:37,187
Oh, whatever, screw it.

1768
01:50:07,546 --> 01:50:09,546
Oh, my gosh, those people!

1769
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,668
Hi!

1770
01:50:18,748 --> 01:50:20,748
I caught you!

1771
01:50:31,094 --> 01:50:32,707
I got it!

1772
01:50:32,787 --> 01:50:34,787
I got it!

1773
01:50:39,676 --> 01:50:41,676
Oh, my God, I do got it.

1774
01:50:57,708 --> 01:50:59,050
You're not gonna believe this,

1775
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:00,949
but you're actually the
first villain I've ever fought.

1776
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:03,553
It's, like, kind of
a huge deal for me.

1777
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,725
Somebody help!

Wow, it's really you.

01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,760
Oh, crap.

So this is about your
Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1789
01:53:00,957 --> 01:53:03,658
I mean, I've never been
great at math, but uh...

1790
01:53:03,738 --> 01:53:06,291
The big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1791
01:53:06,371 --> 01:53:09,101
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1792
01:53:09,401 --> 01:53:10,928
Pride.

1793

Greed and Sloth, Lust, who

1794

I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

But that's only six. Where's...
Where's lucky number seven?

01:53:20,298 --> 01:53:22,358
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1797
01:53:22,438 --> 01:53:25,312
Is he just scared of me and my
family 'cause we're so awesome?

1798
01:53:25,392 --> 01:53:26,988
'Cause I get that.

1799
01:53:27,068 --> 01:53:29,263
Like, the other sins, they
get to come out and fight

1800
01:53:29,343 --> 01:53:31,026
'cause they're big
and strong and scary.

But Envy,

1802

he's just a runt.

1803
01:53:47,755 --> 01:53:49,042
And that's why

never invite him
out to play, man.

what this place is, right?

1844
01:57:49,824 --> 01:57:52,379
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1845

Well, yes, but also...
