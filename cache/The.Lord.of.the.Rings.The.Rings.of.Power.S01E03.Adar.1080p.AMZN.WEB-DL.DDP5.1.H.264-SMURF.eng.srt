1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:08,750
He's dead! Come on!

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:12,958
What...

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,041
Up she goes...

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,875
Where is it you're from, anyway?

5
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,916
He wants us to help him find
those stars.

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,458
Nori?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Duty demanded I return to 
Middle-earth.

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,625
It wasn't Elves that chased me
from my homeland. It was Orcs.

9
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,833
Was that the mark of your 
people's king?

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:41,958
My people have no king.

11
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,458
All the far outposts are being 
disbanded.

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,000
Taking a last look?

13
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,791
It has changed much, Watchwarden.

14
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,625
But the Men who live here 
have not.

15
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,833
The blood of those who stood with
Morgoth still darkens their veins.

16
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,500
Someone dug this passage.
Something. Men did not do this.

17
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,125
Get to it.

18
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,083
You there! Anchor him.

19
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,291
Toss him out with the rest.

20
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,958
You toss him out with the rest.
I had sun duty yesterday.

21
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,666
You'll stay in the sun till you're 
black as coal

22
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,916
if Adar wills it.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,041
For Adar, then. But not for you!

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,916
For Adar.

25
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,333
Rest's over, sloth-about.

26
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,541
Now dig.

27
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,625
She lives.

28
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,541
Our hosts. Saviors or captors?

29
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,666
It's not poisoned. If that's your concern.

30
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,166
Not for humans, anyway.

31
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,833
One of the Eldar. Onboard my ship?

32
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,541
Strange tides indeed.

33
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,958
What vessel is this?

34
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,541
Be at ease. I'm obliged to deliver you
safely to my betters.

35
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,958
They will answer your questions, not I.

36
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,666
To what port do we sail?

37
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,375
See for yourself. We're nearly there.

38
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,291
Nearly where?

39
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,208
Home.

40
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,458
What is this place?

41
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,166
There is only one place it can be.

42
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,916
The Land of the Star.

43
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,458
The westernmost of all mortal realms.

44
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,291
The Island Kingdom of Númenor.

45
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,000
Harbor speed!

46
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,041
Is that an Elf?
See nothing...

47
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,041
Since when did Men like me
build kingdoms such as this?

48
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,958
These Men are not like you.

49
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,791
In the Great War, your ancestors 
stood with Morgoth.

50
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,625
These Men stood with the Elves.

51
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,041
As a reward, the Valar granted 
them this island,

52
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,125
which has changed much since then.

53
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,500
Do I detect a note of envy?

54
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,833
Not envy.

55
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,541
Sorrow.

56
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,458
Once, Elves came and went freely 
from these shores.

57
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,291
Our people were as kin.

58
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,000
Sharing gifts, knowledge.

59
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,708
What happened?

60
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,750
Númenor began to turn away 
our ships.

61
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,875
In time, they broke off all contact.

62
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,041
Why?

63
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,375
We may be about to find out.

64
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,625
Keep moving.

65
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,333
You would not want to be lost here
without an escort.

66
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,041
Put it with the others.

67
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,500
Too hot.

68
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,375
Patience. Patience.

69
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,916
We are men and women of Númenor.

70
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,500
I suggest we set history aside for 
the moment and show some restraint.

71
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's try not to antagonize these people.

72
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,416
Captain. The Queen Regent is occupied.

73
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,041
As is Chancellor Pharazôn.
I suggest that you...

74
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,416
Kneel.

75
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,291
No one kneels in Númenor.

76
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,166
Sorry.

77
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,083
Speak, Elf.

78
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,000
Name thyself.

79
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,833
Galadriel of the Noldor.

80
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,375
Daughter of the Golden House of Finarfin.

81
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,500
Commander of the Northern Armies
of High King Gil-galad.

82
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,833
Halbrand.

83
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,541
Of the Southlands.

84
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,416
A Man and an Elf, together?

85
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,208
Circumstances arose that...

86
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,416
We are companions by chance.
Met on the open sea.

87
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,250
Your captain, here, delivered us
from certain death.

88
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,166
All we ask is that Númenor
continue his mercy

89
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,791
and grant us ship's passage
to Middle-earth.

90
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,416
It's been generations since a ship
of Númenor

91
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,375
was permitted to make such a journey
on an Elf's behalf.

92
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,875
It is because of the Elves that
you were given this island.

93
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,958
What?

94
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,708
Surely you can spare a few planks
and a rudder.

95
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,958
Our ancestors were not given anything.

96
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,125
They paid for this isle with the
blood of their kin.

97
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,458
What the Elf means...

98
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,000
Then if blood be the price of passage,
I will pay it.

99
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,500
But one way or another,
I will depart.

100
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,916
I welcome you to try.

101
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,291
I have no need of
your welcome.

102
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,791
And you are quickly
wearing out yours.

103
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,541
Guards!
My friends.

104
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:06,208
It seems to me that our leaving
presents some complications.

105
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,333
Perhaps it'd be better if we stayed...

106
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:13,125
Stayed?
Long enough, good Queen,

107
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,500
to give you and your advisors adequate
time to weigh our request.

108
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,125
A few days, perhaps?

109
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Three days. And the Elf is to be
restricted to palace ground.

110
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,625
I will not be made a prisoner.

111
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,416
I would sooner knee-cap a stallion

112
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,666
than seek to imprison the mighty
commander of the Northern Armies.

113
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,375
So, you shall be Númenor's guest.

114
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,916
Captain...

115
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,375
My gratitude.

116
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,791
"Good Queen?"

117
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,333
The Southlands will still be
there in three days.

118
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,583
But will its people?

119
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,708
Look around you. This is a paradise.

120
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,208
Ripe with opportunity.

121
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,500
You really expect me to leap with you
back into the furnace?

122
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,833
You leapt into the sea to save one life.

123
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,208
I seek to save many.

124
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,250
I have been searching for my peace
for longer than you know.

125
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,583
Please, for both our sakes,
let me keep it.

126
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,833
Perhaps some peace would do you
good as well.

127
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,833
But at the very least...

128
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,666
do try not to make any new enemies.

129
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,416
It would be wise to resolve this
matter swiftly.

130
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,666
She is but one Elf.

131
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,000
An avalanche can
start with one stone.

132
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,833
We dare not invite your father's cloud
back overhead.

133
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,541
Tell me about this captain.

134
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,583
His name is Elendil.

135
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,166
Originally of a noble line,
now a Sea Guardsman with a son,

136
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,625
if memory serves, set to follow him
into the service.

137
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,208
Heave!

138
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,625
Together now!

139
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,875
Heave!

140
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,416
You'll have to haul a sheet faster than that
if you want a spot in my guard!

141
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,458
Come on, cadets!

142
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,166
Together now!

143
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,000
WOMAN ( whispering]: Isildur...

144
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,250
Isildur!

145
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,083
Isildur!

146
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,416
Any cadet who earns
their place in the Sea Guard

147
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,000
becomes more than just
Númenor's protector.

148
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,166
Not that one!

149
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,750
Imrahil!

150
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,208
Portside! Haul it into portside!

151
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,208
Valandil! Ontamo!

152
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:32,958
Help! Pull!

153
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,875
Co-ordination, cadets!
Back to it!

154
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,708
There is no harsher master than
the sea.

155
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,500
The sea is always right!

156
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,125
The sea is always right!

157
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,666
Poor Imrahil.

158
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,416
His father is like to toss him out
on the stones.

159
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,958
Blind luck Isil's not
joining him.

160
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,833
Me?

161
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,166
Your mind was in the bleeding
clouds again all day. What is it?

162
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,458
Just eager to get out there.
That's all.

163
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,833
Nine more days. Nine more days!

164
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,916
We pass the Sea Trial, in four years,
we'll make officers.

165
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,833
Ten more, we'll have our own command.

166
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,958
Mmm. Eight more for me.
Eighteen maybe.

167
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,166
Isildur! Your sister's here.

168
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,875
There you are.

169
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,500
Berek, my boy.

170
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,750
Look who put down the
sketchbook for once.

171
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,500
Aw, you didn't have to come all
this way just to see me.

172
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,958
Isil, cantina?
Nah, you go.

173
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,541
Come find us later. Don't be like
your brother.

174
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,583
Got your whole life to be an old maid.

175
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,666
Or to be young.

176
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,916
What are you doing here?
Where's Father?

177
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,625
The Faithful believe that
when the petals of the White Tree fall,

178
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,375
it is no idle thing,

179
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,000
but the very tears of the Valar
themselves.

180
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,333
A living reminder that their eyes

181
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,708
and their judgment are ever upon us.

182
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,416
Do you believe that?

183
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,041
In my experience, it is unwise to
live one's life

184
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,916
guessing after signs and portents.

185
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,166
"Elendil." An uncommon name.

186
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,916
From our western shores, is it not?

187
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,416
Mmm. It originates there.

188
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,208
Pray tell, what does it mean?

189
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,125
One who loves the stars.

190
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,625
That is not its only translation, is it?

191
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,250
In the ancient tongue of the Eldar,

192
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,791
it can also mean "Elf-friend."

193
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,125
And are you? An Elf-friend?

194
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,083
I'm a loyal servant of Númenor.

195
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,875
And yet, though Elves have been
unwelcome on our shore

196
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,916
since the reign of my grandfather's
great grandfather,

197
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,333
you chose to break with that
precedent. Why?

198
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,500
It was the sea that put her in my path.

199
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,000
And the sea is always right.

200
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,916
The sea cannot commit treason.

201
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,208
With respect, Queen Regent,

202
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,541
given the circumstances, I did only
what I believed to be most prudent.

203
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,291
If, Elendil, that is truly your wish,

204
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:39,250
then I shall have to ask you to
perform a service.

205
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,750
These passages reach
all the way to Hordern.

206
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,500
Possibly beyond.

207
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,083
This must be how they escaped
our detection.

208
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,583
And how they shield themselves
from sunlight.

209
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,416
They're searching for something.

210
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,625
Some sort of weapon, perhaps?

211
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,000
I do not know.

212
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,041
But they ransack village after village,

213
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,375
toiling nightly to find it for their leader.

214
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,500
One the Orcs speak of with near-worship,

215
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,041
even reverence, if Orcs were capable
of such a thing.

216
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,041
It seems Morgoth has a successor.

217
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:21,875
"Adar."

218
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,541
Why would Orcs refer to their leader
by an Elvish word?

219
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,583
Sauron was said to have
many names in days of old.

220
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,333
Perhaps this is one of them.

221
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,041
There is more at work here
than we can yet see.

222
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,166
First opportunity either of you has

223
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,500
to get a glimpse above this trench,
you'll take it.

224
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,458
Locate the closest tree line,

225
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,458
and when the sun is at its strongest,
we will make our escape.

226
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,625
If even one of us makes it home,

227
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,458
we can return in force

228
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,375
and sweep the enemy from these lands

229
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,041
like salt from a table.

230
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:57,791
Sew those lips and dig, Elf!

231
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,000
These roots block our path.
Then rip them out.

232
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,833
Rip the whole stinking tree down!

233
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:09,666
Felling a tree will slow our progress.
We shall go around.

234
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,333
Try it, Elf.
And I'll make a map of your back.

235
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:20,833
This tree sprang from the earth
long before you crawled

236
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,916
from whatever wretched place you grew.

237
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,291
It has earned its place in these lands.

238
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,916
Good, Elf.

239
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,958
Very good.

240
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,458
You showed strength.

241
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:46,750
You just earned your company
a water ration.

242
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,083
Don't be afraid.

243
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,666
Surely you thirst.

244
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,458
There...

245
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,916
Tree.

246
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,875
Húna hravan! Húna hravan!

247
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,541
I will cut it.

248
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,375
I will cut it down!

249
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,750
Ánin apsene...

250
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,625
You will inform Pharazôn
that she's escaped.

251
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:36,958
I informed him last time.

252
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,291
That was a dog.

253
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,791
Be wiser to steal the half-sail.

254
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,875
That skiff will hardly get you out
of the harbor.

255
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,958
I assure you it's an improvement on my
prior mode of passage.

256
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,500
Still. Can't let you take it.

257
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,625
I'm afraid the Queen has charged me

258
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:18,208
with seeing to it that you cause no
further disturbance.

259
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,166
I believe she saw it as a punishment.

260
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,083
Then she and I have something in
common after all.

261
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,333
We both wish you'd never brought me here.

262
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,000
I will take my chances on the skiff.

263
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:33,333
That would leave me little choice, but
to shout for your minders.

264
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,083
Suppose the words never manage
to escape your throat?

265
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,875
Supposing they did,

266
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,916
you'd be back at the palace in chains,
even further from your destination.

267
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,666
Who is this mortal who speaks to me as if
he has the slightest idea who I am?

268
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:57,125
I have a daughter who runs fast,
and a son who runs blind.

269
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,625
Your eyes bear a striking resemblance
to both.

270
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:05,083
Where I run and how I run there
are none of your concern.

271
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,916
Anywhere is better than here, where
I'm hated by all who see me.

272
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,375
So call to your guards, or get out
of my way.

273
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:18,541
You're not hated by
all, m'lady.

274
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,875
You speak Elvish?

275
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:25,041
Where I was raised,
many speak it.

276
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,375
It is still taught in our Hall of Lore.

277
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,958
Still carved on statues throughout
the city, if you look closely.

278
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,333
Your Hall of Lore, how far is that?

279
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,958
A quarter day's ride.

280
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,333
What is it you seek?

281
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,291
Did you say "ride"?

282
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:54,875
There is not another man on this isle
that knows this craft better than I.

283
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:58,666
I will shovel coal if need be,
I'll splinter wood,

284
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,250
I'll shape a sea anchor for you, free of charge,

285
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,083
sturdier than anything you have ever seen.
How's that?

286
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm here to start anew.

287
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,458
Lend me that chance. Please.

288
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,458
And I won't forget it.

289
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,833
You've a stout heart, lad.

290
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:23,541
But until you've earned your guild crest,
you can't forge steel in Númenor.

291
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,125
That's him, isn't it?

292
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,416
The fellow who sailed in with the Elf?

293
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,041
It's you, isn't it?

294
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,625
Certainly appears that way.

295
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,375
What are you called, again?
Depends.

296
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,166
Depends on what?

297
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,958
How close we are.

298
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,666
And how close are you and the She-elf?

299
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,291
You're on a lucky streak, low man.

300
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,750
Free sail to our island, eating our food,

301
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,375
drinking our ale...

302
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,958
What will you take next?

303
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,958
Our lands? Our trades?

304
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,666
Don't forget your women.

305
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,375
Look at the mouth on him.

306
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,833
Maybe he and the She-elf
aren't so close after all.

307
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,666
Wager she'd prefer someone
of better breeding.

308
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,958
You're right. You're right.

309
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,791
Here I am.

310
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,541
I'm a guest on your island,

311
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,750
and I haven't shown you
the faintest bit of gratitude.

312
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,250
How 'bout this?

313
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,291
Next few rounds on me!

314
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,041
You're not so bad, low man.

315
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,625
Well, then, I best make my retreat,

316
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,541
while you've still got a warm
opinion of me.

317
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:13,208
Men, ladies, anon!

318
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,291
Hey, low man.

319
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,666
Really thought I wouldn't notice?

320
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,958
Well, I thought it was worth a try.

321
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,791
Take it.

322
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,208
I don't want any trouble.

323
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,166
Bit late for that, isn't it?

324
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,208
I believe it is.

325
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,625
Hmm.

326
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Please. Don't do this.

327
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,583
Why not? Low man!

328
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,375
Go.

329
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,791
Call me Halbrand.

330
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,916
MAN (nervously]: Over here.

331
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,583
We're looking for any
information you may have on this.

332
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,333
I will take a look.

333
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:45,458
You didn't say the Hall of Lore was
assembled by Elros himself.

334
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:48,875
It is rather remarkable.

335
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,916
Of course...

336
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,625
You knew Elros.

337
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,250
An uncommon spirit.

338
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:59,208
But I was always closer with his brother.

339
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,250
Remarkable.

340
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,833
Thank you for bringing me here.

341
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,083
Thank our last king.

342
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,916
It was because of him
this place wasn't torn down.

343
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,541
He was loyal to the Elves?

344
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,250
Is loyal.

345
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,583
We forced him from the throne for it.

346
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,041
They say he spends his days
in the tower now.

347
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,833
An exile in his own kingdom.

348
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,833
There.

349
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,541
What is this?

350
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:48,750
The account of a human spy retrieved
from an enemy dungeon.

351
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,375
He drew this.
To record the tower's location.

352
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,875
Wait a moment.
I must be blind.

353
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,833
This is no sigil.

354
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,958
It is a map of the Southlands.

355
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,916
It is as Halbrand said.

356
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,291
And the inscription?

357
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,541
It is the Black Speech.

358
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,125
It speaks not only of a place, but a plan.

359
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,416
A plan by which to create a realm
of their own,

360
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,333
where evil would not only endure,
but thrive.

361
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,500
A plan to be enacted in the event
of Morgoth's defeat...

362
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,166
By his successor.

363
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,791
Galadriel.

364
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,875
Matters are worse
than I imagined.

365
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,375
Then the Southlands are in grave danger.

366
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,250
If Sauron has indeed returned,

367
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:08,583
the Southlands are but the beginning.

368
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,333
Nobody goes off-trail.

369
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,958
And nobody walks alone.

370
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,041
That's right.

371
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,625
Nobody goes off-trail.

372
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,958
And nobody walks alone.

373
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,958
Nobody goes off-trail.

374
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,833
Come on.
And nobody walks alone.

375
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,833
Nobody goes off-trail.

376
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,791
And nobody walks alone.

377
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,958
Nobody goes off-trail.

378
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,083
And nobody walks alone.

379
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,708
Nobody goes off-trail.

380
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,250
And nobody walks alone.

381
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,625
Nobody goes off-trail.

382
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:37,458
So it's not better.
And nobody walks alone.

383
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,625
Nobody goes off-trail.

384
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,375
And nobody walks alone.

385
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,708
Nobody goes off-trail.

386
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,750
We can't carry the cart without you.

387
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:50,000
We're going to be left behind.

388
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,833
No Brandyfoot has ever been left behind.

389
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,875
You know, after I lost Rose,

390
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:11,000
felt like the wheels broke out
from under me.

391
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:17,625
And then I saw you in the grass.

392
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,875
Right in this clearing.

393
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,666
You were so beautiful that day.

394
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,833
And in an instant,

395
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:32,875
I knew I'd grow old with you, Marigold.

396
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,791
We'll make it to the Grove.

397
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,708
All of us?

398
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,416
All of us.

399
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,791
How?

400
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,666
I'll stay at the front of the caravan.

401
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,666
And we've got Nori.

402
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,958
No! Look, once that girl puts her
head to something,

403
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,375
nothing can stop her.

404
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,958
You lay one paw
on that book,

405
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,708
and old Sadoc will use your hide
to make his next batch of pages!

406
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,375
You got a better idea?
The migration's tomorrow.

407
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,166
If you want to help him find
those stars,

408
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,166
our best hope is in that book.

409
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,875
I don't want to help him.

410
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,750
He's a giant with a brackish temper,
who sometimes murders fireflies.

411
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,250
That was an accident.

412
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,000
Now, I say the sensible thing to do
is top off his food,

413
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,250
point him to the nearest human village,
and "Fare thee well, stranger."

414
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,625
That's not where he belongs.
And where does he belong?

415
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:50,333
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Why's it your problem?

416
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:54,916
What sense is it sticking your neck out
for him any more than you already have?

417
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,875
There's head-sense, Poppy,
and there's heart-sense.

418
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,791
There's common sense and nonsense.

419
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,750
And if you're all out of the first,
then you can borrow some of mine.

420
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,333
Rather borrow some star charts
out of that book instead.

421
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:07,625
And you're gonna help me.
Or would you rather I let slip to Malva

422
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,958
it was you who put fireweed
in her toe cream?

423
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,291
Hmm?
I'll keep watch.

424
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,333
Go.

425
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,083
Aren't you supposed to do
your speech now, Mr. Burrows?

426
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,166
Certainly. I just have to
fetch it from my cart.

427
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,916
Oh, good idea. You do that.
Fetch it from your cart!

428
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,750
"Rested legs and full carts"?

429
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,916
No...

430
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,750
Mmm. No, no, no.

431
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,666
Ah-ha!

432
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,500
"Full carts and fuller bellies."

433
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,333
Mr. Burrows!

434
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,583
What is it now?

435
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,666
Oh, no, it's just, um, everyone's waiting.

436
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:37,500
Are you all right?

437
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,291
Yes, yes. Almost done.

438
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,333
How much have you got left?

439
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:45,666
Just a little left?

440
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,333
Just tell them I'm almost ready.

441
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:51,458
Right. No! I mean left. Yes. No, I...

442
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,791
I'll tell 'em right now, go straight now.

443
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,958
Calm yourself,
and get yourself some chestnut pie.

444
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,000
Strange girl, that one.

445
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:25,750
Most agreeable, honorable Harfoots.

446
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:34,000
Another season has passed in this glade,

447
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:38,000
leaving us with full carts
and fuller bellies.

448
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,708
Some fuller than most,
if we're being honest about it.

449
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,666
Uh, what else...

450
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,250
The Moon is very full,

451
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,291
so be careful where you're having
your shenanigans later on.

452
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,791
It'll be in full view of the entire camp.

453
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,333
And nobody wants that.

454
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,666
I'm only joking ya.

455
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,333
And now, before we begin our next journey,

456
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:04,833
we remember those from prior migrations,

457
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:08,750
who fell behind.
Hear, hear.

458
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:12,583
And should any Harfoot
fall behind this migration,

459
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:16,083
they likewise will be carried with us

460
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:19,000
in our hearts and in our memories.

461
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,666
In life, we could not wait for them.

462
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:34,625
But here, now, we welcome to our circle...

463
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,000
Miles Brightapple.

464
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,583
Stuck in the snows of the mountain pass.

465
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,166
We wait for you.

466
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,166
Chance Proudfellow.

467
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,291
Yarrow Proudfellow.

468
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,458
Strap, Dewis,

469
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,041
Linseed Proudfellow.

470
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,541
Taken by landslide one rainy winter day.

471
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,791
We wait for you.

472
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:29,708
Daffodil Burrows.

473
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:32,833
Wolves.

474
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:35,333
We wait for you.

475
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:41,708
Druda Bumbelly.
She ate the sunshine yellow berries.

476
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:42,875
We wait for you.

477
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,291
Blovo Bolgerbuck.

478
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,083
Bees.

479
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,583
We all loved him, but he was an ijit.

480
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:21,958
We wait for you.

481
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:28,500
Ma Hambley.
Was making a sculpture...

482
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,291
We wait for you.

483
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,166
Nori?

484
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,208
You have lied, stolen,

485
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,916
brought a dangerous outsider
into our midst.

486
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,125
And she lied.

487
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,375
He already said that.
Well, she did.

488
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:06,083
But, no, he was lost. Hurt.

489
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,750
What was I supposed to do?
Leave him there?

490
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:12,166
You must admit, Sadoc, it's
quite extraordinary.

491
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,125
Have you ever heard tell
of beings falling from the stars?

492
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,791
I've heard of beings who were
turned into stars.

493
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,458
Never the other way around.

494
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,708
It's very troubling.

495
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,666
But what about the stars on that page?

496
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,125
What's it say they mean?

497
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,333
Nothing. The pages are all burnt up.
Why didn't you bother to read them?

498
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,125
I thought we'd have time later.

499
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,541
Who's "we"?

500
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,083
No one. Just me. He's my friend.

501
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,041
We don't need friends, girl.

502
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,166
We need to survive.

503
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,041
Without friends, what are we
surviving for?

504
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:50,416
"Good little Harfoots, stick to the path,
flee every danger,"

505
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,000
heaven forbid we explore something
new for once!

506
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:54,791
Elanor Kellamark Brandyfoot!

507
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,333
Our way has kept us alive
a thousand years.

508
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,708
Our laws are clear.

509
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:07,541
Any Harfoot that breaks them
is to be decaravaned.

510
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:16,750
Our laws are clear, indeed. But...

511
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,083
Miss Brandyfoot is young.

512
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,416
With as much hair still to grow on
her toes as sense between her ears.

513
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,583
Tomorrow we depart as planned.

514
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,708
And the Brandyfoot cart will be with us.

515
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:40,833
At the back of the caravan.

516
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:42,708
At the back?
At the back.

517
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:45,291
Wait, wait, wait a sun-sliver,
now, Sadoc.

518
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,291
We have to talk about this.

519
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:51,583
Now, you mean the back of the back,
or do you mean the middle of the back?

520
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,416
I mean the back.

521
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:58,208
You may as well have stamped our name
in the book of the left-behinds.

522
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,333
There's a reason he came to us.

523
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:06,541
Honestly, Nori.

524
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:09,875
Do you see a destiny in this?

525
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,625
Do you think the stars reached down
and touched ya, is that it?

526
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:18,625
Do you think you're special?
You're just a child.

527
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,791
I know I'm not special.

528
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,625
I know I'm just one little Harfoot
in a grand wide world.

529
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,875
But he is special.

530
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,125
I can feel it.

531
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,625
My darling girl.

532
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,875
Ever has your heart been
like your father's.

533
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,250
But the tallest milkweed gets snipped.

534
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,541
It's time to pack.

535
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:06,791
Oh, no!

536
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,291
Oh!

537
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,166
You will die, Queen!
Oh, no!

538
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,000
Oh, no! Galadriel!
I smite you!

539
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,041
Oh, no!

540
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,333
Take that!

541
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,625
Galadriel?

542
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,333
The Galadriel? Scourge of the Orcs?

543
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:23,625
Never mind what she's the scourge of.
Why is she in Númenor?

544
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,583
Waiting for a ship to Middle-earth.

545
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:33,125
Queen Regent's raised me to Post Captain,
to keep account of her in the meantime.

546
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,500
You brought in an Elf, so Míriel
promoted you?

547
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,458
Who gets to escort her back?

548
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,541
Looking for a promotion, cadet?

549
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,041
Nine days until the Sea Trial.

550
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,291
Tell him.
You ready?

551
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:46,833
I'm afraid our northside relations
have taken the liberty

552
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:49,833
of inviting themselves over
for a feast to see you off.

553
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:53,125
Trust that's all right?
I was thinking I might defer.

554
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:57,916
Defer?
Just for a season, perhaps.

555
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:01,958
Did you know about this?

556
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:06,083
Well, I listen to him on occasion,
so, yes, I had my suspicions.

557
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,791
And you didn't bother
telling me about them?

558
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,375
I'm only thinking about it.
I was talking to Eärien.

559
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,958
I've been carrying a bit on my
shoulders lately, Father.

560
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,916
Is this really so tragic?
Anárion told me you deferred twice...

561
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,250
Anárion? What's your brother
have to do with this?

562
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,750
Nothing.
Well, slightly more than nothing.

563
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,166
Thanks.

564
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,708
Oh, good gods.

565
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,166
I'll tell you what I told him.

566
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,625
There is nothing for us on our
western shores.

567
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,666
The past is dead.

568
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,083
We either move forward or
we die with it.

569
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:50,916
And do you think it was easy convincing
the sail-master you were up to the task?

570
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,166
I never asked you to do that.

571
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,750
Yes, you did when you got into a scrap
with the Queen's guards.

572
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:57,166
They started that!
Or got thrown out of your horse training.

573
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,458
That wasn't my fault!

574
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,000
Actually, Isil's right, that one wasn't...

575
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:02,083
I wasn't talking to you!

576
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:06,583
Pardon me, Captain.
What?

577
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,166
Message for your daughter, Eärien.

578
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:23,541
I know you've doubts, son.

579
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:30,541
But... But can you not trust that I have
ever your best interest at heart?

580
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:37,333
The watery part of this world has a way
of healing even the deepest of wounds.

581
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,041
The way it's healed yours?

582
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:50,250
In nine days' time, when the Sea Trial
begins and that ship launches,

583
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:51,833
you will be on it.

584
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,875
Father.
What is it?

585
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,375
I made apprentice.

586
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:00,458
I've been accepted to the Builder's Guild.

587
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:03,666
How? I thought the guild never
reconsidered.

588
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,916
Isildur convinced me to reapply.

589
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,416
Isildur convinced you?

590
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,875
How fares the quest
for peace?

591
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,916
Better than expected.

592
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,291
What happened?

593
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,833
Dispute about a woman.

594
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,750
Halbrand.

595
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,041
Don't start.

596
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:40,166
You do not belong on this island.

597
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,083
If there's one of us that doesn't
belong here, Elf, it's you.

598
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:46,166
I'm not so sure of that anymore.

599
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,833
But of one thing I am now certain.

600
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,666
You are more than you claim.

601
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,833
I found this in the Hall of Lore.

602
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:12,958
That's funny. I found this on a
dead man.

603
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,500
Thought the pattern suited me.

604
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,875
Many ages ago,

605
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:22,958
a man bearing that mark

606
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:26,750
united the scattered tribes of
the Southlands under one banner.

607
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,958
The very banner that might
unite them again today.

608
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:34,458
Against the evil that now seeks
to claim their lands.

609
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,541
Your lands, Halbrand.

610
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:45,166
Your people have no king,
for you are him.

611
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,333
That's an odd thing to say
to a man in a cage.

612
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:55,666
A cage you have landed in because
you chafe under the rags of the common.

613
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:59,708
And the armor that ought to rest
upon your shoulders

614
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,208
weighs upon your soul.

615
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,958
Be careful, Elf.

616
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,875
The heir to this mark is heir to
more than just nobility.

617
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,875
For it was his ancestor who swore
a blood oath to Morgoth.

618
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,875
I am not the hero you seek.

619
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:40,250
For it was my family that lost the war.

620
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,208
And it was mine who started it.

621
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,791
Ours was no chance meeting.

622
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:47,333
Not fate, nor destiny,

623
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:50,416
nor any other words Men use
to speak of the forces

624
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
they lack the conviction to name.

625
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,791
Ours was the work of something greater.

626
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,333
You must see it.

627
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:01,166
All I see is an Elf who won't put
down her sword.

628
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,458
Come with me to Middle-earth.

629
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,416
And together we will redeem
both our bloodlines.

630
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,375
How?

631
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:12,125
You're stuck on this island.

632
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,000
And you're still short an army.

633
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,625
That is all about to change.

634
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,583
It is here, Father.

635
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,625
The moment we feared.

636
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:06,125
The Elf has arrived.

637
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,916
Off we go! Push!

638
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:46,125
Go on, Poppy, you'll fall behind.

639
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:50,041
Just give me a moment to get
my breath under me.

640
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,625
Back!

641
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,416
Uh... Hey, hey...

642
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,208
Hey...

643
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,000
Friend.

644
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:31,875
This is it.

645
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:36,083
This is how we keep up with the others, all of us.

646
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,500
He helps us, and we help him.

647
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:45,125
