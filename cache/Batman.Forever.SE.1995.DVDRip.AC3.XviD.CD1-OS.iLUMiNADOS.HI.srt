00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,912
Sure you'll land on your feet.

490
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,549
Is the young master leaving?

491
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,868
Pity.

492
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,919
I'll just toss this away then,
perhaps the dogs are hungry.

493
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,638
Hey, Al, wait up.

494
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,590
[Priest reciting funeral prayer]

495
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,192
Master Bruce?

496
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,069
Master Bruce?

497
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,990
Just like my parents.

498
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,311
It's happening again.

499
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,515
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

500
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,679
I killed them.

501
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,632
What did you say?

502
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,554
He killed them. Two-Face.

503
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,790
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

504
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,839
No. You said, "I killed them."

505
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,352
Take care of the kid.

506
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,919
Certainly, sir.

507
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,517
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

508
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,635
No.

509
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,118
Thanks, I won't be staying long.

510
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,839
Is this a robin?

511
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,879
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

512
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,070
My father said I was his hero.

513
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,959
I flew in like a robin.

514
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,950
Some hero I turned out to be.

515
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,635
But your father was right.

516
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,633
You are a hero. I can tell.

517
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,797
Throw this away, will you, Alfred?
I won't be needing it anymore.

518
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,592
I think I'll just put it in here.

519
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,475
Broken wings mend in time.

520
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,790
One day Robin will fly again.

521
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,913
I promise.

522
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,074
We'll drive, thank you.

523
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,993
The Puzzler?

524
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,039
The Gamester?

525
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,599
Captain Kill?

526
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,592
Question Mark Man?

527
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,349
[Laughing]

528
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,156
Thank you. Thank you so much.

529
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,593
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

530
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,950
is driving us insane!

531
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,512
Don't worry, baby.

532
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,912
You'll kill him soon.

533
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,956
Besides, I made your favorite tonight.

534
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,271
Sparkling champagne and...

535
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,036
yummy poached salmon
with little itty-bitty quail eggs...

536
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,514
and a creamy, dreamy...

537
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,353
lemon soufflé.

538
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,996
No, I made your favorite.

539
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,834
A charred heart of black boar...

540
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,480
a side of raw donkey meat...

541
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,030
and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

542
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,634
Perfect!

543
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,558
Ladies, you spoil us.

544
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
We're of two minds about
what to eat first.

545
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,869
- What?
- I hope you made extra.

546
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,158
Who the hell are you?

547
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,433
Just a friend.

548
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,437
But you can call me...

549
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,359
The Riddler.

550
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,556
I'll call you dead, is more like it!

551
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,596
How did you find us here? Talk!

552
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,033
But then if I talked...

553
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,078
what would keep you from slaying me,
O Segregated One?

554
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,354
By the way...

555
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,079
that's never going to heal
if you don't stop picking.

556
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,957
- Let's see if you bleed green.
- Harvey...

557
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,154
I don't think it's me you want to kill.

558
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,239
That's just too easy
for someone as powerful as you...

559
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,549
and you.

560
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,793
But Batman...

561
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,838
there's a challenge.

562
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,954
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

563
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,439
But have you thought it through?

564
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,592
A few bullets, a quick splash of blood,
and then what?

565
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,194
Wet hands.

566
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,555
Post-homicidal depression.

567
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,829
- Why not humiliate him first?
- Yeah.

568
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,356
Expose his frailties.
And then, when he is at his weakest...

569
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,153
crush him!

570
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,757
I see that sparkle in your left eye.

571
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,550
I can help you get Batman.

572
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,312
That is, if you'll...

573
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,868
spare my life for just a few moments.

574
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,194
Thank you.

575
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,190
I simply love what you've done
with this place.

576
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,714
<i>Heavy Metal</i> meets <i>House and Garden.</i>

577
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,314
Beautiful.

578
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,630
It's so dark and Gothic and...

579
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,190
disgustingly decadent.

580
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,195
Yet so bright and chipper...

581
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,432
and conservative.

582
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,276
It's so you!

583
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,709
And yet, so you!

584
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,831
Very few people are
both a summer and a winter...

585
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,276
but you pull it off nicely.

586
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,952
What's the point, big boy?

587
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,238
Has anybody ever told you, you have
a serious impulse-control problem?

588
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,110
This is the point.

589
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,790
This is how I found you.

590
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,792
Let me demonstrate.

591
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,670
This is your brain on The Box.

592
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,791
This is my brain on The Box.

593
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,155
Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?

594
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,071
I'll have a bit more. Thank you.

595
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,038
There's more. But only the first one's free.

596
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,798
Here's the bargain.

597
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,269
You will help me steal production capital...

598
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,033
so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

599
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,752
and become Gotham's cleverest
carbon-based life form!

600
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,912
And in return...

601
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,876
Is everybody paying attention?

602
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,953
I will help you
solve the greatest riddle of all.

603
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,996
The mother of all riddles:

604
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,154
Who is Batman?

605
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,830
You have broken into our hideout.

606
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,388
You have violated the sanctity of our lair.

607
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,119
For this we should crush your bones
into powder.

608
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,430
However, you've posed
a most interesting proposition.

609
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,718
Therefore, heads, we accept, and tails,
we blow your damn head off.

610
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,959
Here's a good one.

611
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,553
No!

612
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,038
There is a good one.

613
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,949
Leave that, Master Dick. I'll attend to it.

614
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,678
I'm not used to being waited on, Al.

615
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,389
Don't shoot me, please.

616
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,869
Don't you eyeball me! Give me that!

617
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,228
Hey, Two-Face,
show me how to punch a guy.

618
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,437
It's dirt-simple, my boy.
Ball up the fist, reach way back...

619
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,839
and assert yourself.

620
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,358
That looks like fun. Let me try.

621
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,512
Ball up the fist, reach way back,
assert yourself.

622
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,318
$100,220...

623
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,079
$100 and...

624
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,753
I lost count!

625
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,159
NEWSCASTER 1: <i>In Gotham, last night...</i>

626
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,073
<i>another robbery perpetrated by</i>
<i>the city's green-suited menace...</i>

627
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,550

<i>with no sign of Batman.</i>

628
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,914

<i>has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.</i>

631
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,238
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

632
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,592
That was with the morning mail.

633
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,996
"The eight of us go forth, not back...

"to protect our king from a foe's attack."

635
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,438
Chess pawns. Clock. Match.

636
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,397
All physical objects, man-made.

637
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,675
Small in size, light in weight.

638
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,113
What's the connection?

639
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,590
With all due respect, sir, I think
that's why they call him The Riddler.

640
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,072
May I help you, Master Grayson?

641
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,799
How come this the only locked door
around this museum?

642
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,632
What've you got back there?

643
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,756
Master Wayne's dead wives.

644
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,552
The silver closet. On your way.

645
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,631
Now you can be part of the action!

646
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,552
NygmaTech brings the joy...

647
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,837
of 3-D entertainment

648
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,594
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...

649
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,634
my vision.

650
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,640
The Box in every home in America...

651
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,519
and one day, the world.
