"Despicable Me 3 (2017)" ^ (Run time 01:29:40)

2
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:29,464
Illuminat...

3
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:33,006
Illuminat...

4
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,208
Illuminat...

5
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:36,896
What?
A horn?

6
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:43,022
Illumination!

7
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:57,125
The year was 1985,

8
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,544
and the number one
show on TV was...

9
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:02,005
Evil Bratt!

10
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:06,343
<i>The show starred young
Balthazar Bratt as a child prodigy</i>

11
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:10,706
<i>and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.</i>

12
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:12,790
<i>There he is!
Get him!</i>

13
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:19,146
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

14
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:22,191
Bratt was the biggest
child actor of the 1980s,

15
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:25,949
<i>striking a chord with
audiences all over the world.</i>

16
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,281
<i>There he is!
Get him!</i>

17
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:32,993
<i>But it all came to an end
in Season 3, when...</i>

18
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:35,746
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

19
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:37,539
<i>The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.</i>

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,041
<i>Boy?
Ugh!</i>

21
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:42,461
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him

22
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:45,776
<i>and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral,</i>

23
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:50,962
<i>starting to actually believe he was
the character he played on TV.</i>

24
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,947
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

25
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,854
<i>Leading us all to wonder,</i>

26
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,339
<i>where is he now?</i>

27
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,958
You know what, Clive?

28
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,377
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

29
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:11,006
but being one in real life
is even better.

30
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,382
Heist music!

31
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,010
Here it comes.

32
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,139
What?
Clive, what are you doing?

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,974
How is that heist music?

34
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,893
Sorry.
My bad.

35
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,137
Ew!

36
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,809
Mommy!

37
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,437
Stop or I'll...

38
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:12,109
Sir, the ship has been boarded
by some kind of monster!

39
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,900
Wait!
That's not a monster.

40
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,822
That's a man
wearing shoulder pads!

41
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,277
There's only one supervillain

42
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:20,726
whose fashion sense
is quite that dated.

43
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,686
Balthazar Bratt.

44
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:25,439
Blast it! The Dumont
Diamond is on that ship.

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,944
<i>I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately!</i>

46
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,701
We're already here. Agents
Grucy are closing fast.

47
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,454
Yes! Wait.
What did you call us?

48
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:43,874
"Grucy." You know, Gru and
Lucy mushed together. Try it.

49
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,752
Oh! I like it,
but not a lot.

50
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:48,254
I don't like it.

51
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:55,469
Stop!
On the ground!

52
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,994
Go, go, go!

53
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:26,751
Eh?

54
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:37,428
Too late again, Gru!

55
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,577
Wha?

56
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:47,855
He's getting away!

57
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,982
That's what he thinks.

58
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,448
Go! Go! 
Go...

59
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:01,118
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!

60
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:06,248
I don't think we
can make it, Gru!

61
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:08,046
We can make it!

62
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:13,553
We can make it!

63
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,550
No, we can't!

64
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:17,801
Ahh!

65
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:19,653
Get ready!

66
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:22,890
Get ready for...

67
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,777
Hey. 
How you doing?

68
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,319
Are you okay?

69
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:40,954
- Hello.
- Oh...

70
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:43,118
You guys are so cute.

71
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:45,074
Go get him, Gru-Gru!

72
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,287
Hello, Gru.

73
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,583
How's your transition coming?

74
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,460
You know, from world's
worst villain

75
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,295
to world's worst agent?

76
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:55,672
Oh, that's hilarious.
You should be on TV.

77
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:59,343
Oh, that's right. You were!
But then you got canceled!

78
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:01,637
Ha-ha!

79
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,430
What about that?
Ugh!

80
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,517
What? Oh, girls!
Oh!

81
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:10,364
Dance fight!

82
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,785
Ow!

83
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:32,250
Alpha Team, the diamond is secure.
Come and pick up the package.

84
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:34,920
<i>Copy that.
Alpha Team in approach.</i>

85
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,552
Gru!

86
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:43,637
Did you actually
think I was unconscious?

87
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:46,098
Huh! It's called acting, hoser.

88
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,934
And clearly, I've still got it!

89
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,619
I've been a bad boy!

90
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,204
Freeze! Don't move!

91
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,580
Son of a Betamax!

92
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,165
Go, go! Get him!

93
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,293
He's getting away!

94
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,420
This isn't over, Gru.

95
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:19,464
You hear me?
This is not over.

96
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:22,635
Yeah? Well,
I still have the diamond.

97
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,345
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

98
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:28,432
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

99
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:34,062
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dan</i>

100
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:39,610
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

101
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,292
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah!

102
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:48,126
Party!
Party, everyone!

103
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:12,267
I can't believe
Bratt got away again.

104
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:14,728
How is this possible? 
How?

105
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,071
And it's not just
that he got away,

106
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,864
it is he's so smug about it.

107
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:29,326
"Ooh, I've been a bad boy!"

108
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:33,288
Gah! Edna, hey!
Looking hot today.

109
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,207
Got cats on you.

110
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:40,629
And it was so humiliating, dangling
there in the bubble-gum Speedo.

111
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,173
And I didn't have time to
go to the gym this week,

112
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:48,304
and I had a big breakfast. 
And was feeling a little bloated.

113
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:52,349
You know what? 
He's not even worth talking about.

114
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,686
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

115
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,856
And another thing!

116
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:03,777
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!

117
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:11,619
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

118
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:16,957
It is with great sadness that I
inform you that, as of today,

119
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,836
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

120
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,131
Oh, no!

121
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:29,261
Your new leader is coming
directly from head office.

122
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:32,013
Effective immediately.

123
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:34,975
She is the very gifted,

124
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:39,480
very ambitious,
Miss Valerie da Vinci.

125
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:43,275
As I look out
over all your faces,

126
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:45,819
I am flooded with
so many memories.

127
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,405
Oh, boy!
This is a snooze fest!

128
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:49,447
Excuse me, this is my last...

129
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:50,490
Blah, blah, blah!
We understand.

130
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,202
You're old, you're
fat, you're done.

131
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,162
Let me breathe in.

132
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:59,375
Ooh, broke a little sweat, there.

133
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,085
First order of business,

134
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:05,297
which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?

135
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:08,508
Oh, that would be me.

136
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:12,846
Although, I don't know 
if I'd say "loser," per se.

137
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,849
Kind of is...

138
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,102
Oh, it's the girls!

139
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,103
Not a good time.

140
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,479
Hey!
Ahh!

141
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,649
Yes, sir!
Uh...

142
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,942
Ma'am? 
You're making me nervous.

143
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:28,945
How could you let
Balthazar Bratt,

144
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:31,281
the AVL's most wanted villain,

145
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,616
just get away?

146
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:34,993
That is the opposite
of what we do here!

147
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,119
Okay, okay.

148
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,164
Yes, maybe
he got away. Again.

149
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,958
But he didn't get the diamond.

150
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,003
And I am this close
to bringing him in.

151
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:47,422
This close.

152
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,132
Huh. 
Interesting.

153
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,508
You're fired!

154
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:51,843
What?

155
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:54,596
That's totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent!

156
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:55,972
You know what?
If you fire him,

157
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:58,516
you're gonna have to
fire me, sister-sister.

158
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:00,477
And do you really wanna do that?

159
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:02,312
Do ya?

160
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,606
No, no, no!

161
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,239
Well, I guess she did.

162
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:19,496
Honey, you didn't
have to do that.

163
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:21,248
I know how much
you love your job.

164
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:24,001
Well, I love other things more.

165
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,838
You know, we're gonna
have to tell the girls.

166
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,674
Can you do it?

167
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:33,426
The whole "mom" thing
is still kind of new to me.

168
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,345
Oh, sure.

169
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,557
Huh?

170
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,351
Psst!

171
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:51,403
Hello?

172
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:03,582
<i>Aloha!</i>

173
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,709
Oh!

174
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:08,503
This is unexpected.

175
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:10,922
Well, you never got to
go on a honeymoon, so...

176
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:12,340
We made you dinner!

177
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,550
It's a luau!

178
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:16,428
We got pineapples and
coconuts and ukuleles!

179
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,561
- Oh! Yay!
- Yay!

180
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:22,585
Hey!
Ya malatika tika, hee ha!

181
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,676
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

182
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,355
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

183
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,404
The soup of the day.

184
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,364
<i>Madame</i> and <i>Monsieur.</i>

185
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:38,784
The gummy bears were my idea.

186
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,333
Mmm! Looks too good
to even eat.

187
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,126
Am I right?

188
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,275
- But I made it for you. 
- Oh.

189
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,758
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

190
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,553
Good soup!
I love the combination

191
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,388
of gummy bears

192
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,057
and meat.

193
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,272
I'm gonna hold it in my mouth.

194
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:11,232
'Cause it's so good, I
don't wanna swallow it.

195
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,817
So, how was work?

196
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:16,363
Ooh, did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?

197
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:18,740
Well, actually,

198
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:23,411
today, Lucy and I were
invited to not work

199
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:25,747
at the AVL anymore.

200
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:28,292
No!

201
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:31,294
You got fired?

202
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:34,047
Oh, no!
No, no, no.

203
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,841
Yes.

204
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:38,802
But don't worry.

205
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:41,554
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs. Real soon.

206
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,848
Even better ones.

207
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:47,060
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

208
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,647
Ooh, I know!
You could gamble online!

209
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,732
That's what Katie's dad does.

210
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,693
Okay. We will definitely
look into that.

211
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:57,612
That's a good suggestion.

212
00:13:57,613 --> 00:14:01,742
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

213
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:04,494
Hmm?

214
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,794
Guys! Shh! I don't think
you heard me right.

215
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:11,793
No, no, no.

216
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:14,568
This does not mean that we are
going back to being villains.

217
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:15,970
- Oh.
- Oh.

218
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:17,608
Boring!
Please do something!

219
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:20,009
Okay, all right.
I get it.

220
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,595
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately.

221
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:28,301
Especially with Dr. Nefario accidentally
freezing himself in carbonite.

222
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:30,996
Ow!

223
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:34,583
But our life of crime is over!

224
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:39,104
Mel! Mel, you're
with me on this, right?

225
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:40,874
Look.

226
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,541
- Good...
- Yay!

227
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,469
- Boring!
- Boo!

228
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:46,263
- Good...
- Yay!

229
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,328
- Boring!
- Ohh!

230
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:50,305
- Good...
- Yay!

231
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,987
- Boring!
- Boo!

232
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,566
Minions… no more boring!!

233
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:57,857
Boring!
Boring!

234
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:01,009
Guys, listen to me!
Read my lips!

235
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:05,511
Lissa me lippo, 
pomodoro la comquit!

236
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:08,975
What? 
What?

237
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,958
Oh... What did I say?
It's not "comquit"?

238
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,541
Ah, okay.
Pomodoro la kumquat.

239
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,867
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did you say no more crime?

240
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:18,627
I cannot accept this.

241
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,402
Don't take that tone with me!
We're not going back to villainy.

242
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:23,716
Uh.
No villainy?

243
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:27,132
Yes! And I don't want to
hear another word about it.

244
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:35,223
Look, if you guys don't stop right
now, there will be consequences.

245
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,230
Huh!
I can do whatever I want.

246
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:39,919
Hey! Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

247
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:42,706
Oh. Listen to this.
I quit!

248
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,420
See you!

249
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:46,630
What? 
You quit?

250
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,658
You're serious?
Come on!

251
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,705
Uh. Uh.
Bud-Buddy?

252
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,011
Dave! 
Jerry!

253
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:01,110
Great news, guys.
You have been promoted.

254
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:04,656
You're in charge now.
Huh? Not bad.

255
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:09,097
Yipa! Yipo!
Yippee!

256
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:12,596
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!

257
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,057
Jeesh!

258
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,830
Ah, <i>Monsieur</i> Pompeux!

259
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:39,148
To what do we owe the presence

260
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,485
of the world's
foremost gem expert?

261
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:44,404
The chief of police sent me.

262
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:47,490
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

263
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:51,369
the Dumont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.

264
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,013
Ooh, la-la!

265
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:12,766
You have been duped!

266
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:14,350
What? 
We have?

267
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:15,602
Yes.

268
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,354
By me!

269
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,025
But, what is...

270
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,655
Oh, no! 
Help!

271
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,381
Ooh!

272
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,468
I've been a bad boy!

273
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:52,896
Or should I say...
"Je suis un mauvais garçon!"

274
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:08,572
Oh!

275
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,595
Hey, Gru.

276
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,472
What you doing down here?

277
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:37,100
In the dark. 
Alone.

278
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:39,603
Oh, nothing.
Just thinking.

279
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:41,312
You okay?

280
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:44,023
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

281
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,025
It's just...

282
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:49,904
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like

283
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,989
a failure.

284
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,283
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.

285
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:57,829
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.

286
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,333
If only I could
have nailed Bratt.

287
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,711
So many times, I almost had him.

288
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,547
But now I'll never
get the chance,

289
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,716
'cause I have been
kicked to the curb.

290
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,300
Gru, you've got to let this go.

291
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:13,285
It's time to look forward.

292
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,062
Things will get better. 
I promise.

293
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,638
Follow me.
Follow me.

294
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:37,879
Coming through, make way.
Coming through.

295
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,530
Excuse me.

296
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:43,363
Pardon me, young people?

297
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:46,391
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

298
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,474
Uh.
Uh, ah.

299
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:49,982
You are looking for Minions?

300
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,425
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

301
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,497
Gru is a lousy boss!

302
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,987
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

303
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,292
Bye!

304
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,040
Come on.

305
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:07,007
Idiots.

306
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,694
No! 
Kyle!

307
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:14,255
Stop! 
Kyle, let go!

308
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,202
No! No!

309
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:21,120
You've got to be kidding me!

310
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,205
Lucy, did you...

311
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:24,207
He helps you if
you have nightmares.

312
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,542
And he's really
good to snuggle with.

313
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:28,002
Oh, no, no, no.
Agnes! Agnes!

314
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,379
So take good care of him.

315
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,923
Thank you!

316
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:34,509
Agnes, what are you doing?

317
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,677
You sold your unicorn?

318
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:41,057
Well, I just wanted to help,
since you don't have a job.

319
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,393
I got two whole dollars for it.

320
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,064
Uh, excuse me?

321
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:49,899
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

322
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,692
Yes, but this will
only take a...

323
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:54,320
Hey, eyebrows, get off the lawn.

324
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,571
Yeah, but...

325
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:56,948
Hey, could you...

326
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,908
Oh, uh, of course.

327
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,410
Now, as I was saying, 
I...

328
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:02,578
Uh... Oh.

329
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:04,539
Goodbye!

330
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:13,756
Listen, Agnes, you don't need to worry.
We're going to be fine.

331
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:14,924
For real?

332
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,092
For real.

333
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:18,302
Now, come on, 
let's pack this stuff up.

334
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:20,597
Ow! Ow!
Seriously?

335
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:22,682
Buddy, you're not getting the hint.

336
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:25,476
Excuse me, Mr. Gru,

337
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:28,896
but I really must
have a word with you.

338
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:30,606
How do you know my name?

339
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:33,943
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Fritz.

340
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,736
Ow!

341
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,113
Good puppy.

342
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:41,784
And I am inquiring on behalf
of your twin brother, Dru.

343
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:43,286
He needs your help.

344
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:44,912
What? 
Twin brother?

345
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:46,198
Twin brother?

346
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,266
- Twin brother?
- Twin brother?

347
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,374
Oh, <i>Ja.</i>

348
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,627
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

349
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:54,672
Your father has recently
passed away and...

350
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:56,757
Okay, cuckoo.

351
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:59,802
I'm sorry, but my dad
died when I was a baby,

352
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:02,471
and I don't have any brother.
You got the wrong guy.

353
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:08,372
Really? Well, then,
how do you explain this?

354
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:17,426
<i>Bellissimo!</i>

355
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:20,323
Oh, hello, Gru.

356
00:22:20,324 --> 00:22:21,908
Hi, Mom.

357
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:25,620
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

358
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:27,204
Oh!

359
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:30,208
There you are, you cutie, you.

360
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,835
Oh!

361
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:36,005
Uh, these are my
diving instructors.

362
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:39,509
Vincenzo <i>und</i> Paolo.

363
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:42,095
Ciao, boys.

364
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,848
So, what do you want?

365
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,850
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

366
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:51,103
Ah! How did you find out?
Who told you?

367
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,521
Wait, what? 
It's true?

368
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:54,565
You never told me
I had a brother!

369
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:58,152
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born.

370
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:01,739
<i>Ja, Ja</i>.
That was the agreement.

371
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,868
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

372
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,873
Shortly after you and
your brother were born,

373
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:13,167
your father and I divorced.

374
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:16,545
We each took one son
to raise on our own

375
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:20,425
and promised never to
see each other again.

376
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:23,594
Obviously,

377
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:26,055
I got second pick.

378
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:30,852
I have a brother!

379
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:40,188
Hey, girls! How are
things in Row B, huh?

380
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:42,697
I put together some fun
activities for the trip!

381
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:45,783
Who is up for some gin rummy?

382
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:48,077
Yeah, um...

383
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:49,704
We're good.

384
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:51,580
Oh, okay.

385
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:54,083
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.

386
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,919
I hope I win.

387
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:59,296
I wonder what Dru
will be like. Ooh!

388
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:00,923
Maybe we'll have the twin thing

389
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:04,176
when you can read
each other's minds, no?

390
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,761
How cool would that be?

391
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:07,931
Um, super cool!

392
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:16,748
Ah, ha ha ha...

393
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:19,189
Ahhh.
Ooh!

394
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:24,281


395
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:29,285
Freedonia!
Freedonia! Freedonia!

396
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:31,287
Hi, piggy, piggy!

397
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,582
Whoa!
Look at that house!

398
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:36,584
It's like a castle!

399
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:40,296
I can't wait to meet my brother!

400
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:42,631
Ugh. What's with
all the pigs?

401
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:45,092
This is the family business.

402
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:48,888
The largest pig farm in
the whole of Freedonia.

403
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:52,016
Okay, nice pig.

404
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:54,978
No! That's my
private part!

405
00:24:57,105 --> 00:24:59,941
This pig has issues!

406
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:02,402
Please, come in.

407
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:14,830
Oh, this is amazing!

408
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:18,960
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel!
But with pigs.

409
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:26,509
My brother!

410
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,515
My brother!

411
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:33,766
Gru!

412
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,351
Dru!

413
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,567
Oh!

414
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:47,154
Brother! 
I am hugging you!

415
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:49,157
I'm so happy!

416
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:53,202
After all of these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

417
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,079
Yup. All right.
Good.

418
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,665
Oh, look at that.

419
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,000
You must be the beautiful wife.

420
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:01,877
Beautiful?
Oh!

421
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:04,046
Stop it.
Sweet talker.

422
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,090
How is my brother
finding a wife like you

423
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:07,883
when he is so bald?

424
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:09,927
I'm joking!

425
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:15,349
These must be my nieces!

426
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,395
You're Agnes! You
are small with big eyes.

427
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:21,272
And it makes me wanna
put you into my pocket.

428
00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:23,065
You can't do that!

429
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,067
I'm too big.

430
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:29,780
Edith! I can tell that you
are a little mischievous.

431
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:32,492
We're gonna have to make
a little trouble later.

432
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,660
I already have!

433
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,912
Ow! Ow! 
Please!

434
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:39,582
Why are you doing that? 
Ow!

435
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:43,252
Fist bump for
mischievous behavior!

436
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:46,255
And Margo.
Oh, you are so mature!

437
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:49,049
I'm guessing...
Mmm... 15?

438
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,509
15?

439
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,263
She's 12. She looks 12
and will always be 12.

440
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:57,016
So, Dru, this place is amazing!

441
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,852
I mean, you just walk through
the doors and you're like...

442
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:03,439
Oh, it's nice, I guess, sure.

443
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,234
I'm not really into things.

444
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:11,113
- This is so cool!
- Look at that!

445
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:13,490
Oh, my gosh!
He's even got a helicopter!

446
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:15,326
This is the best!

447
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,828
Yes, the best!

448
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,205
All right, let's go home now.

449
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:20,497
Home? 
Why?

450
00:27:20,498 --> 00:27:24,084
I don't know. This guy with
the mansion and the cars

451
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:28,797
and all of the hair, with the
silky smooth, luxurious hair.

452
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,300
I feel worse than
I did before I came.

453
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:34,470
But he's your brother, Gru.
Give this a chance.

454
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:35,846
Oh, I was thinking,
while Gru and I

455
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:37,806
catch up on some brother stuff,

456
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,476
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you!

457
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,977
Yay!
Awesome!

458
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:43,354
I love surprises!

459
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,397
Oh, this is perfect!
Mother-daughter bonding time.

460
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,108
Let's do it!
Woot-woot!

461
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:49,944
Bye! 
You boys have fun!

462
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:52,655
Whoopi!

463
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,993
<i>Now you can be as
evil as Balthazar Bratt</i>

464
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:00,496
<i>with the</i> Evil Bratt
<i>action figure.</i>

465
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:04,041
<i>Featuring music-activated
breakdance mode.</i>

466
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:08,045
<i>Also featuring bubblegum-launching
shoulder pads!</i>

467
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:12,508
<i>And the all-new
Mega Diamond Laser!</i>

468
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,678
<i>No more math!</i>

469
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,473
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

470
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:22,518
<i>The Mega Diamond Laser
does not actually incinerate books.</i>

471
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,187
How could Hollywood cancel a show

472
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:28,099
that produced toys like this, Clive?

473
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:30,901
<i>Evil Bratt</i> was a masterpiece!

474
00:28:30,902 --> 00:28:33,654
Does no one value
true art anymore?

475
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:36,031
It's a disgrace
and a travesty, sir.

476
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:39,743
Well, now that I've got the
diamond, it's payback time.

477
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:43,580
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be
around to try and stop me.

478
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:46,333
Oh, wait! No, it's not.
I hate that dweeb!

479
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,168
And you, Hollywood!

480
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,422
This time, I'm canceling you

481
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:54,634
and all the losers
who rejected me!

482
00:29:00,598 --> 00:29:01,724
Oh, piggy, piggy!

483
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:05,311
So, how are things going
for you career-wise?

484
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:08,897
Great!
So, so great!

485
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:10,149
Crushing it.

486
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,609
Well, I've got
something that I think

487
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,239
you will find very interesting.

488
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:20,368
Hold onto your face, brother.

489
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:29,627
Yee-haw!
Yah, yah!

490
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,579
Yee-haw!

491
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:39,771
Ow!

492
00:29:40,982 --> 00:29:43,124
Huh? Ah!
Salami!

493
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:45,520
Hey, I got Salami.

494
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:47,128
Ah, yes, yes.

495
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,744
It's Salami.

496
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:52,418
Come on!
Come on!

497
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:56,571
What is all this?

498
00:29:56,613 --> 00:30:01,409
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

499
00:30:03,314 --> 00:30:04,588
Haha!
Hey.

500
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:06,541
It's Gru with boobs!

501
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:11,627
Now, feast your eyes on

502
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:14,713
Dad's lair!

503
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:16,674
Ta-da!

504
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:19,301
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

505
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:22,471
So, our dad was a villain?

506
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,848
No, no, no, not just a villain.

507
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:28,477
One of the greatest of all time!

508
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:32,648
He was known as the Bald Terror!

509
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,984
That's him? Our dad?

510
00:30:35,985 --> 00:30:39,488
He was so proud of you. And
what a great villain you were.

511
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,574
He was?

512
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:44,827
But me, eh, not so much.

513
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:50,374
To Dad, I was just a failure.

514
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,794
He never thought I had what
it took to be a villain.

515
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:57,089
But now, you can help
me prove him wrong!

516
00:30:57,465 --> 00:30:59,300
Brother,

517
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:02,303
teach me the art of villainy!

518
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:05,013
No.

519
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,015
No, no, no.
I can't do that.

520
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:09,726
What? But
it's our family tradition!

521
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,771
You can't say no to that!

522
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:13,647
Look, I'm sorry.

523
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:16,942
I left that life behind me.
End of story.

524
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,444
Oh.

525
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:21,530
Okay. I understand.

526
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:24,200
Hmm! I wonder
what this does.

527
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:25,663
Huh?

528
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:26,705
Help.
Help!

529
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,180
No no no...

530
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,111
- Aaah!
- Aah!

531
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:41,925
Holy Moley!

532
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:44,386
Dad's villain wheels!

533
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:46,889
Pretty slick, huh?

534
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:51,352
Hey, you wanna take her out for a spin?
Just for some fun?

535
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:54,438
Mmm!

536
00:31:59,277 --> 00:32:01,404
Oh, oh, oh! Look out!

537
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,533
What a beautiful day!

538
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:09,328
Zero to 400 in three seconds.

539
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,038
Able to withstand
a nuclear blast.

540
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,957
Armed to the teeth.

541
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,169
Okay, that's pretty nice.

542
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,467
-And it's a hybrid.
- Look out!

543
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,464
Help me!

544
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:50,615
I am not enjoying this.

545
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,588
Whoa! What is
going on here?

546
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:05,467
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival.

547
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:06,969
Go!

548
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:14,435
Look, look!
Look at all the candies!

549
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:17,568
- Whoa!
- Eep, eep, eep!

550
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,274
Lucy, can we get these? 
Please.

551
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:23,151
Okay, but only
one each. I mean it.

552
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:24,903
Aw!
Oh, man!

553
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:28,198
No, I don't. Get as
many as you want. I don't care.

554
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,033
- Yay! 
- Awesome!

555
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:31,702
- Uh...
- What?

556
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:35,539
Well, it's okay to tell them
no sometimes, too, you know?

557
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,082
Moms need to be tough.

558
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,126
Right, right.
Tough. Good one.

559
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:40,502
I can totally do that.

560
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:42,713
You know, still figuring
out this mom thing.

561
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:45,549
Gettin' my sea legs, matey!

562
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,551
It's a unicorn!

563
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:54,558
Can we go in there?
Please, please, please!

564
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,772
Um... Sure! Yeah! 
You know, but first let's...

565
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,983
Um...
Oh, look!

566
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:05,193
It's a traditional Freedonian dance.

567
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:07,112
How amazing does that look?

568
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:09,823
<i>Say, say, say cheese!</i>

569
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:12,409
Cheese!
I love this.

570
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:15,871
The little girls go and get the
cheese from the little boys.

571
00:34:15,872 --> 00:34:17,706
That's adorable!

572
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:24,046
Aw, look at that poor little guy.
With his little boots.

573
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,173
Nobody picked him.

574
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:28,467
Oh, Margo, why don't
you go up there?

575
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:29,635
No way!

576
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:30,886
Okay.

577
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:32,387
Wait a minute.

578
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:33,555
No!

579
00:34:33,556 --> 00:34:35,891
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.

580
00:34:35,892 --> 00:34:38,226
Right now!
What?

581
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:40,395
I'm being tougher, you know?
Like you said.

582
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:43,565
No! I meant be tougher on them.
Not me!

583
00:34:43,566 --> 00:34:46,777
Oh, come on, just do it. What's
the worst that could happen?

584
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,571
Mmm...

585
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:50,948
Fine.

586
00:34:55,078 --> 00:34:57,079
Wow!

587
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,082
Hey, there.
I'm Margo.

588
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,084
Hello, Margo!

589
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:03,669
I am Niko.

590
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,338
Would you like
some of my cheese?

591
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:08,465
Mmm...

592
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:09,591
<i>Say, say, say cheese!</i>

593
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:13,012
Yes! Thank you, Margo.
Thank you!

594
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:16,264
Bam! 
I am a great mother!

595
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:19,310
Did you see that, girls?
I laid down the...

596
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,270
Oh, no! 
Where are they?

597
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,149
Oh... Agnes? 
Edith?

598
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:29,153
Hello.

599
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,824
Look!
A unicorn horn!

600
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:39,746
My little brain is
going to explode!

601
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:42,291
Agnes, that's fake.

602
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:45,628
It's real, all right.

603
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,548
That horn came from
the Crooked Forest.

604
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:54,845
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

605
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:01,268
Huh!

606
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,812
Laugh, laugh, all of you.

607
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:05,981
They all think I'm crazy.

608
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:09,317
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.

609
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:11,486
With my own eye.

610
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:14,823
Wait, wait, wait. You saw
a for-real live unicorn?

611
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:16,158
What did it look like?

612
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,368
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

613
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:21,455
Was it fluffy?

614
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:23,582
It was so fluffy,

615
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,084
I thought I was gonna die.

616
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:29,463
Mmm! Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

617
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:32,340
Oh! They say if a maiden
pure of heart

618
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:34,509
goes into the Crooked Forest,

619
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,513
the unicorn will
come and be hers.

620
00:36:38,514 --> 00:36:40,182
Forever.

621
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,518
Hmm...

622
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:48,274
Agnes!

623
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:55,197
Goal!

624
00:36:55,907 --> 00:36:57,949
Excuse me.

625
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,827
Girls, don't worry.
I'm here.

626
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:01,745
Are you okay?

627
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:03,580
Yeah, we're fine.

628
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,081
Are you?

629
00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:06,833
Unicorns are really real!

630
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:10,379
And I'm gonna find one!

631
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:14,049
Sorry. Went a little
mama bear on ya.

632
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,926
You know,
I heard a scream and...

633
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:18,267
Yeah, okay, have a good one.

634
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:23,642
Wait for me here.

635
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:26,520
Stop that!
Ah! You kicked me.

636
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:31,317
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

637
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:34,402
Did you just steal candies? Yes!

638
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:37,072
That's a lot of effort
for two lollipops.

639
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:44,079
Oh, no! The police!

640
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,998
What do we do?
What do we do?

641
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:49,168
Come on!
This is gonna be fun!

642
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,513
The police are gonna get us!
I'm freaking out!

643
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:03,015
Pigs!

644
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:07,811
Cops!

645
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:24,453
Whoa! They're back!

646
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:27,748
All right!

647
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:51,146
Oh, man, that was crazy!

648
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:52,731
We were so close
to getting busted.

649
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:53,899
Tell me about it.

650
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,485
I thought you were going
to pee your pants.

651
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,111
I did!

652
00:38:58,112 --> 00:39:00,072
You did!

653
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,538
Mel, food...

654
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,332
Ugh. Hey, Mel.
Hold on a sec.

655
00:39:12,357 --> 00:39:13,908
We're tired, cold, and hungry.

656
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:15,877
- Mel, hungry.
- Mel, hungry.

657
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,243
It's pizza. Over there.
Our food, spaghetti!

658
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:22,535
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

659
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:27,325
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

660
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,386
Hey! 
What are you doing?

661
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:31,939
Intruders! Intruders!

662
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:38,902
There they are! Stop!

663
00:39:38,903 --> 00:39:40,445
Hey, you, don't move!

664
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:41,947
Halt!

665
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:49,202
Call for backup!

666
00:39:49,227 --> 00:39:51,865
Come on. Come on.
Let's go, keep going.

667
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,888
What's this?

668
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,469
Ooh, uh...

669
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:09,204
Happy? It's on you.
Do something.

670
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:12,187
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

671
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,330
Get 'em! 
Go! Go!

672
00:41:30,848 --> 00:41:33,684
Hey, you!
Freeze! Don't move!

673
00:41:34,627 --> 00:41:36,754
Hands in the air!

674
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:47,114
Face it, Gru. 
Villainy is in your blood.

675
00:41:47,656 --> 00:41:50,826
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush. A little?

676
00:41:50,868 --> 00:41:51,993
Uh...

677
00:41:51,994 --> 00:41:53,828
Eh, maybe a little.

678
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:56,664
And now you've got the
chance to get back on top.

679
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:57,999
Get your mojo back.

680
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,087
Become Gru again. 
How awesome would that be?

681
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:04,089
Hmm.

682
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,010
Oh, please, come on.
Just one heist.

683
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:12,305
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere

684
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:15,976
that you still wanna steal.

685
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:18,353
Huh.

686
00:42:18,354 --> 00:42:20,355
There is something.

687
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:23,358
How about we steal

688
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,736
the largest diamond
in the world?

689
00:42:26,737 --> 00:42:29,239
Yes! 
I love it!

690
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,574
Oh, thank you, brother!

691
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:34,870
Thank you from
the bottoms of my heart.

692
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:40,083
Oh, you know what? 
We should do something to celebrate!

693
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,292
Oh!

694
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,338
I've got the perfect idea.

695
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:50,552
Fritz, my good fellow, could you
get me another napkin, please?

696
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:52,888
Ah, yes.
Of course, Miss Edith.

697
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:01,104
Hey, where are Gru and Dru?

698
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:03,064
Here we are!

699
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:05,651
Oh, how's it going?

700
00:43:06,402 --> 00:43:08,319
It's me! 
Gru.

701
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,489
And me, Dru.

702
00:43:10,948 --> 00:43:15,327
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

703
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:17,913
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

704
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,750
Ah! What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.

705
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,254
I'm so grumpy
all the time. Hmm.

706
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:30,592
I laugh a lot.
And I'm kind of an idiot!

707
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,270
Oh, I'm busting a gut!

708
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:46,233
Look at them!
They had no idea!

709
00:43:46,442 --> 00:43:47,984
Total burn.

710
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:50,111
Oh, look, it's me, Gru!

711
00:43:50,112 --> 00:43:53,281
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!

712
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:55,992
Oh, it's so nice to see
you two are getting along.

713
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:59,513
- Oh, we're getting...
- Along perfectly.

714
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:00,997
- Wait. Did we...
- Just finish...

715
00:44:00,998 --> 00:44:02,123
- Each...
- Other's...

716
00:44:02,124 --> 00:44:03,675
- Sentences?
- Sentences?

717
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:07,212
Oh, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

718
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:08,671
And you're gonna stop
now though, right?

719
00:44:08,672 --> 00:44:10,924
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

720
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,175
Uh-huh...

721
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:15,261
So, uh, what did
you guys do today?

722
00:44:15,262 --> 00:44:18,473
Nothing.

723
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:19,641
Okay.
What does it...

724
00:44:19,642 --> 00:44:21,476
All done!

725
00:44:21,477 --> 00:44:24,145
Pardon me! Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!

726
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:26,898
Hey! Hey! Put the brakes on.
What's the rush?

727
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:29,734
I need to get to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

728
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:31,319
Good night!

729
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:34,364
What was that about?

730
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:38,243
Agnes thinks she's gonna find a
real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

731
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:40,161
She's totally freaking out.

732
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:42,664
I feel like someone's
gotta tell her the truth.

733
00:44:42,665 --> 00:44:44,166
Not it!

734
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,911
Oh, don't worry.

735
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:48,811
Parenting 101. 
I got this.

736
00:44:50,547 --> 00:44:51,673
Um...

737
00:44:51,674 --> 00:44:54,008
And please bless that
when I find the unicorn

738
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:56,928
he'll want to come home with
me, and sleep in my room.

739
00:44:56,929 --> 00:45:00,098
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

740
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:03,851
And he'll use his magical
powers to help me do math.

741
00:45:03,852 --> 00:45:05,437
Amen.

742
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:09,524
Oh, hi, Gru.

743
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:14,112
Hey. 
So, big day tomorrow.

744
00:45:14,113 --> 00:45:18,366
Yeah, I'm finally gonna get
to see a unicorn. For reals.

745
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:21,703
If I do, can I bring it home?
Please?

746
00:45:21,704 --> 00:45:23,955
Oh, yeah. 
Sure.

747
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:28,543
Tell you what, every unicorn you
find, you can bring it home.

748
00:45:28,544 --> 00:45:31,713
I'd better build
a big pen, right?

749
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,966
But, you know,

750
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:38,553
there's a chance that
you might not find one.

751
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:40,639
Huh?

752
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:46,728
It might not be good
unicorn-finding weather.

753
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:52,734
Um... They're tricky
to find them.

754
00:45:52,735 --> 00:45:56,654
And I don't know.
Maybe...

755
00:45:56,655 --> 00:45:59,949
Maybe unicorns

756
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,703
don't really

757
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:09,918
explore that part of the woods.

758
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:17,091
But the man said a maiden could
find one if she was pure in heart.

759
00:46:17,092 --> 00:46:20,053
And I'm pure in heart, right?

760
00:46:20,596 --> 00:46:22,472
The purest.

761
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:30,104
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.

762
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:31,606
Good night, sweetie.

763
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:33,483
Good night, Gru.

764
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:36,945
<i>Unicorns, I love them</i>

765
00:46:36,987 --> 00:46:39,614
<i>Unicorns, I love them</i>

766
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:42,617
Huh!

767
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:45,620
I'm okay.

768
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:55,690
Hey! 
Give that back!

769
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:57,173
Huh?
Come on!

770
00:46:57,198 --> 00:46:59,626
Guys!
Don't leave me!

771
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:02,438
Oh, no! 
Run!

772
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:30,748
We've been waiting a long time. 
Can we...

773
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:32,166
No!

774
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,655
No, please!

775
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,644
Huh!

776
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:37,069
Gru?

777
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,194
Uh-oh!

778
00:47:51,228 --> 00:47:52,771
Ha!

779
00:47:59,131 --> 00:48:02,098
My plane... broke.

780
00:48:10,584 --> 00:48:12,027
Oh.

781
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,727
Huh?

782
00:48:14,752 --> 00:48:15,877
Uh!

783
00:48:26,151 --> 00:48:27,784
Buddies, I've decided.

784
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:31,734
We're going back to Gru.
We're going back to Gru!

785
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:41,027
<i>Because I'm training for 
the big day</i>

786
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:43,571
<i>Nobody's gonna stop me</i>

787
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:45,907
<i>'Cause I am super sassy</i>

788
00:48:45,908 --> 00:48:48,743
<i>Super sassy, super sassy</i>

789
00:48:49,328 --> 00:48:51,412
What's today's plan, boss?

790
00:48:51,413 --> 00:48:54,081
What's the plan?
Silly robot.

791
00:48:54,082 --> 00:48:55,416
I'll show you the plan!

792
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:58,628
Time to watch a very special
episode of <i>Evil Bratt</i>

793
00:48:58,629 --> 00:49:02,565
to see exactly what I'm gonna
do to stupid Tinseltown.

794
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:06,720
<i>This week on</i> Evil Bratt...

795
00:49:08,347 --> 00:49:11,432
<i>It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!</i>

796
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:12,683
<i>Open fire!</i>

797
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,352
<i>I have him in my sights!</i>

798
00:49:18,148 --> 00:49:21,401
<i>Nice try, coppers!
Chew on this!</i>

799
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:25,947
<i>He's shooting his super sticky,</i>

800
00:49:25,948 --> 00:49:27,949
<i>self-inflating gum!</i>

801
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,035
<i>Run!</i>

802
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:33,038
<i>Gum one, gum all!</i>

803
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:36,499
"Gum one, gum all."

804
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,878
Seriously, how did this
show never win an Emmy?

805
00:49:42,297 --> 00:49:46,634
<i>And now, it's your turn
to shine, my diamond!</i>

806
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:01,315
<i>Hey, Clive. I guess you
could say our plan was</i>

807
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:03,693
<i>out of this world!</i>

808
00:50:07,364 --> 00:50:09,824
Now, that's entertainment!

809
00:50:09,825 --> 00:50:12,535
Come on!
Let's make it a reality!

810
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:19,500
<i>Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest</i>

811
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:21,586
<i>in search of
the mythical unicorn.</i>

812
00:50:21,587 --> 00:50:23,170
<i>For some reason.</i>

813
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:26,549
<i>And here she is! The fearless
unicorn hunter seeking...</i>

00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,175
<i>Edith, stop it!</i>

815
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:30,428
You're gonna scare
away the unicorn.

816
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:32,597
If, somehow, we actually
find a unicorn,

817
00:50:32,598 --> 00:50:34,724
I'm gonna film it and get rich.

818
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:36,559
Look over there!

819
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:38,853
Whoa!

820
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:40,146
This is it!

821
00:50:40,147 --> 00:50:42,023
This is where we're
gonna see it.

822
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:45,360
Unicorns, here we come.

823
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:46,569
What's that for?

824
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,571
Bait! Duh.

825
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:50,073
Come on!

826
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:54,577
Now, all we have to do is wait.

827
00:50:58,457 --> 00:51:01,375
Okay, this is Bratt's lair.
It may not look like much,

828
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,252
but this place is
armed with some of

829
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:05,212
the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

830
00:51:05,213 --> 00:51:07,382
It's considered impenetrable.

831
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:10,718
But a piece of cake
for us, right, brother?

832
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,776
Yes. This is not
like stealing lollipops.

833
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:17,647
Whoa!

834
00:51:19,478 --> 00:51:24,524
His security system can detect an
air assault from any direction.

835
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:29,236
<i>Ouch! 
No! Ouch!</i>

836
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:31,906
<i>Please, stop! 
Ouch!</i>

837
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:36,494
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.

838
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:39,247
Next. 
Ah...

839
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:41,957
Then there are
these deadly spikes.

840
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,419
<i>Geronimo!</i>

841
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:48,464
Covered with enough
poison to blow your mind.

842
00:51:48,465 --> 00:51:49,590
Literally.

843
00:51:49,591 --> 00:51:51,467
<i>Ouch!</i>

844
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,094
Ah, good to know.

845
00:51:53,095 --> 00:51:56,889
So here's the plan.
You're the getaway driver.

846
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,974
So you'll wait in the boat...

847
00:51:58,975 --> 00:52:01,143
Wait, hold on!
Wait in the boat?

848
00:52:01,144 --> 00:52:04,606
But I wanna be
in on the actions!

849
00:52:05,273 --> 00:52:09,276
Dru, the getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

850
00:52:09,277 --> 00:52:11,779
Do you know how hard it is

851
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,989
doing nothing, touching nothing

852
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:17,034
when all of that adrenaline
is coursing through your veins

853
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:18,703
and you must wait?

854
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:20,496
Can I count on you?

855
00:52:20,497 --> 00:52:21,872
Yeah.

856
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:23,666
Ah, I guess so.

857
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:27,294
So, I'll climb up to
the cube and enter here.

858
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:30,214
Then once I'm inside,
find the diamond.

859
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:34,301
I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.

860
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:36,638
I think we can handle it.

861
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:42,810
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable!

862
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:44,979
Whoa! 
<i>Ay, chihuahua!</i>

863
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,932
I call the black one.

864
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:51,819
It's go time!

865
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:03,122
Hello.

866
00:53:03,123 --> 00:53:04,373
Oh, hi!

867
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:07,626
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.

868
00:53:07,627 --> 00:53:09,754
I present you
with pig to confirm

869
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:13,091
my engagement to your daughter.

870
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:15,718
Hey, what now?

871
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:18,012
What's going on?
Uh, remember little boots?

872
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:21,432
Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
Whoa, hey!

873
00:53:21,516 --> 00:53:24,310
He seems to think you're engaged.

874
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:26,645
What? 
We're not engaged.

875
00:53:26,646 --> 00:53:31,359
Look, Niko, you seem like a very
nice boy with a very nice pig.

876
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,820
Uh... 
But you're not engaged.

877
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:36,656
Okay? 
It's not happening.

878
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:38,741
I understand.

879
00:53:38,825 --> 00:53:40,367
Who was I kidding?

880
00:53:40,368 --> 00:53:43,788
A dumpling like me
with a goddess like you.

881
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:48,084
But I promise, I will
never forget you, Margo.

882
00:53:48,335 --> 00:53:50,003
Never.

883
00:53:51,004 --> 00:53:53,798
Oh, I'm pretty sure I won't
forget you either.

884
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:55,800
Bye. 
Bye, Niko.

885
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:58,636
Wow! That was crazy.
Whoa!

886
00:53:58,637 --> 00:54:00,971
That was totally humiliating.

887
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:04,058
Taking a bite of that cheese was the
stupidest thing I've ever done.

888
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:05,559
Why did I listen to you?

889
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,895
Right. But it's over
now, so...

890
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:11,107
Oh! Here we go.
Niko...

891
00:54:11,483 --> 00:54:15,069
You refuse my son's engagement pig?

892
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,153
What?

893
00:54:16,154 --> 00:54:18,823
May you and your
daughter die a slow death

894
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:20,825
and be buried with onions.

895
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,578
All right, lady, that's it!

896
00:54:24,579 --> 00:54:25,746
Nobody...

897
00:54:25,747 --> 00:54:30,251
Nobody curses my daughter!
Ya got that?

898
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:33,420
Because if you mess with
Margo, you mess with me!

899
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:37,758
And I promise, you do
not wanna mess with me.

900
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:40,094
Do you understand me?

901
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:41,178
Yes. 
Yes.

902
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:44,115
Good.
Now get!

903
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,104
Look, Margo, I think
we just need to... Oh.

904
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:54,859
Yes!

905
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,612
I have to tell Gru!

906
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:14,795
Can we go back now?

907
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:17,965
Already? 
Just a couple more hours.

908
00:55:17,966 --> 00:55:20,350
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

909
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:23,304
I don't understand.

910
00:55:23,305 --> 00:55:25,723
I did exactly what the man said.

911
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:29,101
You mean that one-eyed scar-faced
man that everybody laughed at?

912
00:55:29,102 --> 00:55:31,437
Yeah, it makes no sense.

913
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:33,566
Look, Agnes, maybe we're not...

914
00:55:44,659 --> 00:55:48,538
Ooh, my whole life has been
building to this moment.

915
00:55:53,752 --> 00:55:55,836
Um... It's a...

916
00:55:55,837 --> 00:55:58,047
Unicorn!

917
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,551
I can't believe it!

918
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:04,554
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

919
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,515
Oh, Lucky, stop it!

920
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,153
Yeah, I'll let someone
else burst her bubble.

921
00:56:18,485 --> 00:56:22,029
Look at us! Two brothers
pulling a heist!

922
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:24,823
And that diamond will
make us the richest,

923
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:27,618
most powerful
villains in the world!

924
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:29,078
Right, brother?

925
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:33,374
Oh, right. 
Yep, yeah.

926
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:38,379
Bravo! 
<i>Bravissimo!</i>

927
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,964
You're amazing!
I'm so sorry.

928
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:41,632
I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

929
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:43,356
- And you were always such a gentleman.
- You did it!

930
00:56:43,381 --> 00:56:46,133
You did it!
You got our jobs back!

931
00:56:51,643 --> 00:56:54,478
What?
Oh, yeah, right. Sure.

932
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:56,355
Oh, look.
We're here!

933
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:05,948
I'm going in. 
Take the wheel.

934
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:08,033
I still don't see why
I can't go with you.

935
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:09,660
Hey, hey!
We discussed this.

936
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:12,246
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

937
00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:13,831
Fine.

938
00:57:25,885 --> 00:57:27,261
Ha-ha!

939
00:57:27,262 --> 00:57:28,804
Hey, brother!

940
00:57:28,805 --> 00:57:31,724
What? I told you, you are
supposed to stay with the boat!

941
00:57:31,725 --> 00:57:34,935
Oh, I didn't think you
meant that literally.

942
00:57:34,936 --> 00:57:37,313
What other way
could I have meant it?

943
00:57:37,397 --> 00:57:40,858
All right. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

944
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:43,277
Got it.

945
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:44,611
Whoa!

946
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:46,697
Help me!

947
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:48,115
Ow, ow, ow!

948
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:50,618
Oh, no! 
The poison spikes!

949
00:57:50,785 --> 00:57:52,411
I'm gonna be impaled!

950
00:57:54,914 --> 00:57:56,999
I'm okay.

951
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,418
I miss the minions.

952
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:00,920
Come on!

953
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:08,302
Coming.

954
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:15,476
Coming.

955
00:58:19,522 --> 00:58:21,023
Come on.

956
00:58:26,863 --> 00:58:28,614
It's a scanning device.

957
00:58:28,615 --> 00:58:30,240
Quick!
Camouflage mode.

958
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:32,910
Freeze! 
And close your eyes!

959
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,912
And cover your mouth!

960
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:42,628
Okay, take my hand.

961
00:59:05,777 --> 00:59:08,779
Ha-ha! 
Follow me.

962
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:27,006
Ha-ha!

963
00:59:31,845 --> 00:59:33,971
Look out!

964
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:40,978
Oh, you were right. 
I should have stayed in the boat.

965
00:59:40,979 --> 00:59:43,856
My stomach feels all queasy.

966
00:59:43,857 --> 00:59:47,151
I shouldn't have
eaten that pot pie.

967
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:52,489
Hey, hey, relax.
You're gonna be just fine.

968
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,241
I got your back.

969
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:02,500
Come on. 
This way.

970
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:06,196
Gru would take this.
Gru would take that.

971
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:07,735
Go, go, go!

972
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,709
Eh.
Peter, that way.

973
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:11,396
Oh, okay, okay.

974
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:34,336
Go, go.
Go, go, go!

975
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:39,537
Huh?

976
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:44,208
Hmm?

977
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:49,166
Huh?
Hey, come back.

978
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:02,392
Hello. Hello.
Hello.

979
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:10,746
You jacket is located
within easy reach.

980
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:13,938
Inflate your jacket by pulling the toggle.
Like this...

981
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:16,131
Thank you for your attention,
enjoy your flight.

982
01:01:21,922 --> 01:01:26,476
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
Left. Left.

983
01:01:27,378 --> 01:01:29,722
Bud-Buddy.
Bud-Buddy!

984
01:01:30,336 --> 01:01:33,232
Buddy!!!

985
01:01:33,841 --> 01:01:35,592
Looks like it's right above us.

986
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:38,303
Okay, what do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?

987
01:01:38,304 --> 01:01:40,181
No, come with me.

988
01:01:53,027 --> 01:01:55,029
Dru, get off the bed!

989
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:58,032
Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy...

990
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:01,702
- I can help.
- No, no, no.

991
01:02:01,703 --> 01:02:03,161
- What? I can do it.
- Don't! Don't! Don't!

992
01:02:03,162 --> 01:02:04,329
Why, yes.

993
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:07,207
Yes, Molly Ringwald, 
I will take you to the prom.

994
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:10,936
What? Who? Where? What?
Who's there? Who is there?

995
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:20,929
<i>99 of red balloons</i>

996
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,823
Whoops! 
Almost forgot!

997
01:02:33,443 --> 01:02:35,903
Over here.

998
01:02:37,238 --> 01:02:39,240
Stay close.

999
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:43,160
What?

1000
01:02:43,161 --> 01:02:44,578
Dolls.

1001
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:46,580
Looks like Bratt
was the only one

1002
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:48,582
stupid enough to buy this junk.

1003
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:51,919
Oh, I used to have one of these!

1004
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,977
- Ow!
- Hey! Shh! Come on.

1005
01:03:06,726 --> 01:03:09,662
All right.
We're getting close.

1006
01:03:09,687 --> 01:03:11,563
From now on,
every move must be made

1007
01:03:11,564 --> 01:03:14,275
with total precision and purpose.

1008
01:03:15,985 --> 01:03:17,110
Gum!

1009
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:18,570
Focus!

1010
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:21,573
We're after the diamond,
not the bubblegum.

1011
01:03:21,574 --> 01:03:23,284
Got it!

1012
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:27,079
Mmm. 
Yum.

1013
01:03:28,373 --> 01:03:30,249
This way!

1014
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:33,878
And now, to put this
where it belongs.

1015
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:35,796
What...

1016
01:03:35,797 --> 01:03:39,466
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

1017
01:03:45,306 --> 01:03:47,850
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us!

1018
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:53,814
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!

1019
01:03:57,026 --> 01:04:00,070
Intruders!
Intruders! Intruders!

1020
01:04:02,156 --> 01:04:04,282
Freeze, dipsticks!

1021
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:06,660
Gru? 
There's two of you now?

1022
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:09,914
Then this will be twice as much fun.

1023
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:11,498
Gru.

1024
01:04:16,879 --> 01:04:18,547
Give me back my diamond!

1025
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:19,923
Total lockdown!

1026
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:22,676
Oh!
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!

1027
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:33,646
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

1028
01:04:35,197 --> 01:04:37,365
Run!

1029
01:04:48,077 --> 01:04:49,327
Oh, no!

1030
01:04:49,328 --> 01:04:51,204
What does that mean?

1031
01:04:51,205 --> 01:04:53,957
Are we gonna die?
Are we gonna die?

1032
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:56,168
We're gonna die!
Dru!

1033
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:06,887
What?

1034
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:09,347
Hey, guys. 
Hold on!

1035
01:05:09,348 --> 01:05:11,350
Lucy!

1036
01:05:17,899 --> 01:05:20,859
Thank you for saving us.
Whoo!

1037
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,320
Look! We got the diamond
and we're going to...

1038
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:26,573
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back.

1039
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:27,908
Wait!

1040
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:29,618
What? Oh,
that's amazing!

1041
01:05:29,619 --> 01:05:31,745
And the best part is,
you'll never...

1042
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:33,830
ever go behind my back...

1043
01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:37,250
ever again, right, honey bear?

1044
01:05:37,251 --> 01:05:39,582
Yeah! 
Yeah, right.

1045
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:41,467
Lesson learned.

1046
01:05:54,393 --> 01:05:55,894
I'll get the girls
and start packing.

1047
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:57,103
And tell them the good news!

1048
01:05:57,104 --> 01:05:59,189
Ah! We're getting
our jobs back. Yeah!

1049
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,775
Yes! Yes!
Go tell the girls.

1050
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,443
Dru...

1051
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:06,613
No! No way! We can't
give the diamond back!

1052
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:07,948
I have to.

1053
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:10,075
- No, you don't!
- Yes, I do.

1054
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:11,743
- Give it!
- No!

1055
01:06:11,744 --> 01:06:13,328
- Give it!
- Ow!

1056
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:14,746
What is wrong with you?

1057
01:06:14,747 --> 01:06:15,956
What is wrong with you?

1058
01:06:15,957 --> 01:06:17,123
You kicked me!

1059
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:18,333
You... 
You lied to me!

1060
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:20,252
Hey, I would have
told you the truth.

1061
01:06:20,253 --> 01:06:23,129
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.

1062
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,714
That's it.
I'm out of here.

1063
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:27,842
You have no right to take that.
We stole it together.

1064
01:06:27,843 --> 01:06:29,636
Together?

1065
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:31,137
You got to be kidding me.

1066
01:06:31,138 --> 01:06:33,348
You did nothing but screw up
the whole time.

1067
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:34,975
I got this in spite of you.

1068
01:06:34,976 --> 01:06:38,853
Oh, yeah? At least I didn't
get fired from my job

1069
01:06:38,854 --> 01:06:40,564
like a total loser.

1070
01:06:40,565 --> 01:06:42,232
At least I had a job.

1071
01:06:42,233 --> 01:06:44,317
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

1072
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:47,446
I'll tell you what. Nothing!

1073
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:50,991
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

1074
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:54,995
We are no longer brothers.

1075
01:06:54,996 --> 01:06:57,289
That's fine with me.

1076
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:43,033
Gru! 
I found a unicorn!

1077
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:46,929
My life is complete!

1078
01:07:49,383 --> 01:07:51,009
Honey, that's...

1079
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:54,138
That's not actually a unicorn.

1080
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,681
Huh?

1081
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:59,726
But, but, he has one horn.

1082
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:02,687
I'm...
I'm sorry, sweetie...

1083
01:08:02,688 --> 01:08:05,482
but he's just a goat.

1084
01:08:05,483 --> 01:08:08,693
Life is just
like that sometimes.

1085
01:08:08,694 --> 01:08:13,115
We're hoping for a unicorn,
and we get a goat.

1086
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:17,369
Well, you know what?

1087
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:21,498
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!

1088
01:08:21,499 --> 01:08:25,251
Look at that face! I
just want to squeeze it.

1089
01:08:25,252 --> 01:08:26,753
Mmm!

1090
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:30,090
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1091
01:08:30,091 --> 01:08:31,841
I'll take this.

1092
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:34,928
You've been a bad boy, Gru.

1093
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:36,909
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?

1094
01:08:36,931 --> 01:08:38,723
Come on, girls.
Let's go!

1095
01:08:38,724 --> 01:08:42,769
<i>Let's get physical, physical</i>

1096
01:08:49,652 --> 01:08:51,653
Change of plans, girls.

1097
01:08:51,746 --> 01:08:53,905
Instead of going home...

1098
01:08:53,906 --> 01:08:56,282
Eyebrows! 
Ow!

1099
01:08:56,283 --> 01:08:59,286
We're going to Hollywood!

1100
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:03,635
Now, that's what I call acting.

1101
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:08,090
Let's go, Clive!
We've got a giant robot waiting!

1102
01:09:10,571 --> 01:09:11,813
Huh?

1103
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:15,183
Lucy?

1104
01:09:15,508 --> 01:09:16,344
But...

1105
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:17,971
Bratt! 
He took the girls!

1106
01:09:17,972 --> 01:09:20,490
What? 
No!

1107
01:09:22,852 --> 01:09:24,853
Dru! 
Dru!

1108
01:09:24,854 --> 01:09:27,480
Go away!
I don't wanna talk to you.

1109
01:09:27,481 --> 01:09:30,083
Bratt has the girls!

1110
01:09:36,241 --> 01:09:39,325
Listen, brother.
About what I said...

1111
01:09:39,326 --> 01:09:40,501
No, I'm the one...

1112
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:42,454
But I shouldn't have...

1113
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:44,598
I'm... I'm sorry.

1114
01:09:45,499 --> 01:09:48,168
I'm so sorry, Gru.

1115
01:09:48,169 --> 01:09:49,670
Aw!

1116
01:09:50,421 --> 01:09:51,880
Ooh, look out!

1117
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:53,382
What is that?

1118
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,110
Mel. Mel!
Infront!

1119
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,961
Caramba!
Caramba!

1120
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:01,465
CARAMBAAAAA!

1121
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:03,057
Mel?

1122
01:10:03,058 --> 01:10:04,918
Huh?
Gru?

1123
01:10:06,137 --> 01:10:08,641
Got to turn this thing around...

1124
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:10,355
Gru!

1125
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,819
Wait up!
GruUUUU...

1126
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:42,222
Hello, Hollywood!

1127
01:10:42,223 --> 01:10:45,309
<i>I'm back and bigger than ever.</i>

1128
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:48,645
I'm scared!

1129
01:10:48,646 --> 01:10:51,523
Thank you.
Thank you so... Oh!

1130
01:10:55,152 --> 01:10:56,486
No! 
No!

1131
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:58,404
No, you can't leave me here!

1132
01:10:58,405 --> 01:10:59,864
I'm famous!

1133
01:10:59,865 --> 01:11:03,118
Clive, arm the canons.

1134
01:11:05,746 --> 01:11:08,081
<i>Chew on this!</i>

1135
01:11:24,849 --> 01:11:27,559
Hey, mullet head!
Let us out!

1136
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:33,065
Oh, don't worry, girls. I've
prepared a front row seat for you.

1137
01:11:48,706 --> 01:11:50,457
Agnes!

1138
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:55,753
<i>Once again, I win and Gru loses!</i>

1139
01:11:55,754 --> 01:11:57,964
<i>Enjoy the show, girls.</i>

1140
01:12:05,389 --> 01:12:07,140
- What in the heck?
- Oh!

1141
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:09,017
I hope the girls are okay.

1142
01:12:09,018 --> 01:12:12,312
Bratt! Bratt at nine o'clock...
No! Three o'clock!

1143
01:12:12,313 --> 01:12:13,980
He's on the left!

1144
01:12:15,858 --> 01:12:18,318
No!
I've seen this episode!

1145
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:21,487
He's going to bubblegum the whole
city and send it up into space!

1146
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:23,865
Hurry!

1147
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:36,085
This is it! 
This is it!

1148
01:12:36,086 --> 01:12:38,463
Lights! Camera!

1149
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:40,006
Laser!

1150
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,893
Yeah!

1151
01:12:57,524 --> 01:12:58,775
Look!

1152
01:12:58,776 --> 01:13:01,110
I've got the girls. 
You two, go take care of Bratt.

1153
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:03,363
Wait! 
What are you doing?

1154
01:13:09,161 --> 01:13:10,703
Look, you guys, it's Lucy!

1155
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:13,039
Lucy, over here!
Help! Help us!

1156
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,749
Mama's comin', girls.

1157
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,043
- Lucy! Lucy!
- We're up here!

1158
01:13:17,419 --> 01:13:18,962
<i>Look at that laser go.</i>

1159
01:13:18,963 --> 01:13:21,214
I love it when
a plan comes together.

1160
01:13:21,215 --> 01:13:23,925
It's Gru!

1161
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,428
Get ready, Bratt.

1162
01:13:27,429 --> 01:13:30,724
You're about to be
blasted back to the '80s!

1163
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:39,065
Whoo-hoo!

1164
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:45,197
We got him!

1165
01:13:53,622 --> 01:13:55,081
Oh, no!
Don't worry.

1166
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:56,958
There's more
where that came from.

1167
01:13:56,959 --> 01:13:59,794
It'll take more
than that to stop me.

1168
01:13:59,795 --> 01:14:02,797
Bratt Pack, go get that barf bag.

1169
01:14:10,431 --> 01:14:12,432
Oh, incoming!

1170
01:14:15,144 --> 01:14:16,436
You little...

1171
01:14:16,437 --> 01:14:19,356
Get away!
Get out of there!

1172
01:14:23,944 --> 01:14:25,445
Quick, jump!

1173
01:14:27,865 --> 01:14:29,282
Bonus!

1174
01:14:29,283 --> 01:14:31,951
Did you see that, Clive? 
All gone.

1175
01:14:31,952 --> 01:14:34,037
Buh-bye,
Wonder Twins.

1176
01:14:52,344 --> 01:14:54,129
Whoa!
Ooh la la!

1177
01:14:54,154 --> 01:14:56,342
Look at all those giant bubbles!

1178
01:15:02,274 --> 01:15:04,150
Help!

1179
01:15:04,693 --> 01:15:06,319
Hang on!

1180
01:15:13,494 --> 01:15:16,079
Hang on, girls!
I've got you!

1181
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,916
I can't!
I'm slipping!

1182
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:21,835
No!

1183
01:15:22,461 --> 01:15:24,379
Got ya!

1184
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,174
Thank you, Lucy!

1185
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:31,094
Let's go!
We're not safe yet.

1186
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:36,001
Minions, time to do
what we do best.

1187
01:15:36,026 --> 01:15:38,830
We will cheer for our boss.
We will fight for our boss.

1188
01:15:38,855 --> 01:15:40,532
We're popping the bubbles!

1189
01:15:40,557 --> 01:15:41,842
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1190
01:15:41,867 --> 01:15:43,580
- Villain!
- Villain!

1191
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,999
You guys too!
You guys are villains!

1192
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,707
Look at what we have here.

1193
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:06,271
Sorry, Gru. This is going to
be a total burn!

1194
01:16:11,124 --> 01:16:14,085
Oh, no!
No, no, no!

1195
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:21,394
I've been a bad boy!

1196
01:16:29,069 --> 01:16:32,906
Nobody messes with my brother!

1197
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:46,461
What? 
What's happening? No!

1198
01:16:58,974 --> 01:17:00,475
Dru!

1199
01:17:01,435 --> 01:17:03,311
Hold on! 
I'm coming.

1200
01:17:07,482 --> 01:17:10,193
You've ruined everything!

1201
01:17:10,194 --> 01:17:12,695
And now, it's time to die.

1202
01:17:12,696 --> 01:17:15,240
Any last words, Gru?

1203
01:17:15,616 --> 01:17:17,158
You know what?

1204
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:19,869
I got two words for you.

1205
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,955
Dance fight.

1206
01:17:22,831 --> 01:17:26,543
Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong.

1207
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:29,725
I am going to enjoy this.

1208
01:17:48,941 --> 01:17:50,442
Enough!

1209
01:17:50,693 --> 01:17:52,377
My turn!

1210
01:18:11,964 --> 01:18:13,715
Uh-oh.

1211
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:19,001
Game over!

1212
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:24,128
Is this what you're looking for?

1213
01:18:24,153 --> 01:18:25,654
No!

1214
01:18:25,991 --> 01:18:28,252
Ow! Ow!
Ow!

1215
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:37,587
No!

1216
01:18:40,867 --> 01:18:43,786
Curse you, Gru!

1217
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:45,454
Curse you!

1218
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:48,220
Bill, over there.
Robert, work your pick.

1219
01:18:48,245 --> 01:18:50,016
Chuck, more bashing.

1220
01:18:54,298 --> 01:18:56,716
Dru? 
Dru?

1221
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:06,726
Hey! 
We did it!

1222
01:19:06,727 --> 01:19:09,229
Yes, we did, brother.

1223
01:19:09,354 --> 01:19:11,307
- Gru!
- Uncle Dru!

1224
01:19:11,332 --> 01:19:13,333
- Gru!
- Girls!

1225
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,691
Kumbaya!

1226
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:27,204
Gru!

1227
01:19:27,205 --> 01:19:29,791
Hey, Mel.
Welcome back.

1228
01:19:29,816 --> 01:19:30,704
Woo-hooooo!

1229
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:32,621
- Yay!
- Yay!

1230
01:19:59,946 --> 01:20:01,447
Mmm.

1231
01:20:02,783 --> 01:20:04,701
Love you, Mom.

1232
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:10,456
I'm a mom.

1233
01:20:10,457 --> 01:20:12,624
I'm a mom!

1234
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:17,459
Fight!
Ha, ha!

1235
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:23,509
Ha ha ha...

1236
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:24,646
Cheater!

1237
01:20:24,949 --> 01:20:27,463
- How do you like this, Cheater?
- No. No.

1238
01:20:28,141 --> 01:20:30,559
Boys, time for bed!

1239
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,788
We're back at work
in the morning.

1240
01:20:32,813 --> 01:20:34,355
I'm coming, sweetie.

1241
01:20:34,356 --> 01:20:35,815
Good night, Lucy.

1242
01:20:35,816 --> 01:20:37,775
See you tomorrow, brother.

1243
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:39,135
Hey, I'm back on the job.

1244
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,196
So no villainy tonight, huh? 
Got it?

1245
01:20:42,197 --> 01:20:45,491
I make no promises.
Love you!

1246
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:47,576
Uh-huh. 
Right.

1247
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:49,162
I love you, too.

1248
01:20:49,162 --> 01:20:50,997
- Aw!
- Aw!

1249
01:20:51,153 --> 01:20:55,273
"Aw!" All right, every...
Go! Go! Go to bed!

1250
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:01,877
Hey! 
Guys! Come on!

1251
01:21:01,902 --> 01:21:03,363
Shhh.
Shhhh.

1252
01:21:18,704 --> 01:21:20,682
What...
What is happening?

1253
01:21:20,707 --> 01:21:22,850
It's coming from outside!

1254
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:28,200
Hey! 
I thought we said no more villainy!

1255
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:29,368
Sorry, brother!

1256
01:21:29,369 --> 01:21:33,638
- Somebody's gotta keep the
family tradition alive, right?
- Yoo-hoo.

1257
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:36,204
- Yeah!
- Villain!

1258
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:37,848
- Yeah!
- Kumbaya!

1259
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:45,551
- Let's get him.
- Ugh.

1260
01:21:45,552 --> 01:21:47,928
Honey, he's my brother.

1261
01:21:47,929 --> 01:21:50,490
We'll give him a
five-minute head start.

1262
01:21:57,257 --> 01:22:02,553
