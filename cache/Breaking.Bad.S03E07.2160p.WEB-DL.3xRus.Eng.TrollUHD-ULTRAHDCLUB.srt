1
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,740
Marco.

2
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,321
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

3
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,658
All right, you can call my lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

4
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,618
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

5
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,163
You hear me? I got nothing to say.
I told you, you can call my...

6
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,542
Christ!

7
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,297
You got my cell phone number,
my wife's name! How did you do it?

8
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,133
Talk! Who you working with?!

9
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,163
Yes, sir.

10
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,593
If you're ready to talk

11
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,679
{\an8}they wanna get a statement.

12
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,932
{\an8}Your side of what happened here.

13
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,269
Or we can hold them off
till another time.

14
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,235
Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.

15
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,955
There it is.

16
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,625
Yo, Adrian.

17
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,128
Rocky called, he wants his face back.

18
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,589
{\an8}Come on, I gotta cheer you up.

19
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,718
{\an8}You see that?
That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

20
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,927
You understand get-out-of-jail-free card?

21
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,098
{\an8}I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

22
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,102
{\an8}The DEA's worst nightmare
is that face out in public.

23
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,272
{\an8}They'll have to steer a wide berth
of young Master Pinkman,

24
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,942
{\an8}for fear of the PR poop storm
that will rain down on them

25
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,946
if this story ever gets out.
I mean, this beating?

26
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,240
{\an8}Best thing for you.

27
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,783
{\an8}You're home free.

28
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,661
Good, right?

29
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,788
Right.

30
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,643
{\an8}Oh, my God.

31
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:03,191
{\an8}You're now the cute one of the group.
Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.

32
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,696
{\an8}This is... I...

33
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,161
Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this.
This should not have happened.

34
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,873
{\an8}But it did.

35
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,626
No thanks to you.

36
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,673
{\an8}But the plan did work.

37
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,178
{\an8}We would've been locked up right now
if we didn't lure him away. But this...

38
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,972
{\an8}This... I just...

39
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,724
{\an8}I never saw this coming.

40
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,606
So...

41
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,234
What...?

42
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,528
What happens now?

43
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,696
What happens now?

44
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,909
{\an8}I'll tell you what happens now.

45
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,539
{\an8}Your scumbag brother-in-law is finished.

46
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
Done.

47
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,209
You understand?

48
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,588
I will own him when this is over.

49
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,842
Every cent he earns

50
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,512
every cent his wife earns

51
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,056
is mine.

52
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,433
Anyplace he goes

53
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,686
anywhere he turns

54
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,896
I'm gonna be there

55
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,691
grabbing my share.

56
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:31,779
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana
for pennies,

57
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,282
and I'll be standing over him

58
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,701
to get my cut.

59
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,245
He'll see me when he wakes up,

60
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:44,292
and when he crawls to sleep
in whatever rat hole is left for him

61
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,045
after I shred his house down.

62
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,967
I will haunt his crusty ass

63
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,886
forever

64
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,221
until the day

65
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,725
he sticks a gun up his mouth,

66
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,977
and pulls the trigger

67
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,314
just to get me out of his head.

68
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:13,279
That's what happens next.

69
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,080
My advice:

70
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,500
That's probably not a good strategy.

71
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,671
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

72
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,673
But if you hit them

73
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,593
they're forced to hit back hard.

74
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
I mean, they will turn over every rock
hither, thither and yon

75
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,601
until someone spills the beans on you
and anyone associated with you

76
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,353
present company included.

77
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,522
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

78
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,194
Jesse, move on with your life.

79
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,862
Leave it behind, all of it.

80
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,323
Nothing changes

81
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,951
once I walk out of here.

82
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,039
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

83
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,627
How exactly do you think

84
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,214
you're going to get away with that?
They will catch you.

85
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,216
- So what?
- What?

86
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,385
I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.

87
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:22,515
Hey, I may have overstated
the power of your face.

88
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,184
Not this.

89
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,562
If the cops catch me

90
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,858
I give them what they want the most.

91
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,864
You.

92
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,913
They nab me

93
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,332
I make a deal

94
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:53,170
to give up the great Heisenberg,

95
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,591
and his million-dollar drug ring.

96
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,056
You're my free pass

97
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,934
bitch.

98
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,107
<i>You're so sure.</i>

99
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,028
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him

100
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,779
he's never going to talk.

101
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,282
What do you think that was, a bluff?

102
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,952
He wants your brother-in-law.
And there's gonna be lawyers

103
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,469
creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

104
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,125
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

105
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,793
And him cooking again?

106
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,131
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
and he's facing 20 years

107
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,802
what'll he do then? Believe me,
there's no honor among thieves.

108
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,056
Except for us, of course.

109
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,557
No, he'll...

110
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,769
He'll come around.

111
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,396
And if he doesn't

112
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:55,066
there may come a time to talk options.

113
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,817
Options?

114
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,501
I'm convinced
Mr. Pinkman was involved

115
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,028
in the manufacture and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine

116
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,300
specifically what we call the blue meth.

117
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,385
I tracked him to a scrap yard

118
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,055
where he stored an early-'80s camper

119
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,890
an RV.

120
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,976
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle

121
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,896
which I believe to be a rolling meth lab

122
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,565
I received a telephone call

123
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,654
telling me my wife Marie
had been injured in an accident.

124
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,113
Upon hearing the news

125
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,535
I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle to tend to my wife.

126
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,872
Arriving at the hospital, I learned
the emergency call was a hoax.

127
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,459
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

128
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,466
So I immediately went back to
the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.

129
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,885
Most likely destroyed on site.

130
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,347
And it was at this point you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

131
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,068
I think we're done here.

132
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,822
Agent Schrader needs to get home

133
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,031
get some rest.

134
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,036
That's fine. But just to confirm,
you're taking the Fifth here?

135
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,705
Yeah, that's correct.

136
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,707
Okay. Well

137
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,376
we just wanna give you all a heads up.

138
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,255
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

139
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:44,593
He's given a detailed version
of events as he sees them.

140
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,094
The word of a meth head.

141
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,929
We know all about his history.

142
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,600
We're well aware,
but toxicology on Pinkman...

143
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,186
His blood is clean, he's not using.

144
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,440
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds

145
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,400
far as we can tell.

146
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,779
So

147
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,408
Where do we go from here?

148
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,202
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down

149
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,246
probably tomorrow morning.

150
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,582
Janice will give us an exact time.

151
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:20,754
And you men will be continuing
your investigation, so...

152
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,924
- Thanks for your time.
- Right. We just...

153
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,301
We need one more thing.

154
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:31,598
A photo of Agent Schrader's hands.
For the record.

155
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,309
Yes, of course.

156
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,811
Bandage off, if you would.

157
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,569
On the table is fine.

158
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,822
Flat on the table. That's fine.

159
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,049
It's all gonna work out.

160
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,928
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

161
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:39,434
I hope it goes without saying we're not
talking to anybody about this, okay?

162
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,270
Okay.

163
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,940
Marie

164
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,901
who?

165
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,478
Hi.

166
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,939
Do you have a minute?

167
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,149
Sure.

168
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,999
I guess crime does pay.

169
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,674
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

170
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,512
No. We need to talk.

171
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,223
You heard about Hank?

172
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,519
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

173
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,855
Yes, I know.

174
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,357
Whatever Hank was investigating

175
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:13,444
him trying to find an RV

176
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,363
is there any danger

177
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,949
that could lead back to you?

178
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,326
No.

179
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,203
Why would it?

180
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,876
Is this why you're here?

181
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,379
I'm here to talk about Hank.

182
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:38,553
You know what's gonna happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

183
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,391
Hank could lose everything.

184
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,396
I thought maybe...

185
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,775
there's a way you could help him.

186
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,861
How?

187
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,906
Contact Pinkman.

188
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,158
Get him to drop the charges.

189
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:04,579
I don't know what kind of relationship
you picture me having with this person.

190
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:09,250
- I'm not asking.
- He was... He's... He's not my friend.

191
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,878
- It's not as if we were even close.
- I'm...

192
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,088
I'm not asking.

193
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,883
But there must be something
you could say.

194
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,094
Isn't it even worth a try?

195
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,306
Hank is your family.

196
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,102
Not currently.

197
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,354
What?

198
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,357
I said, not currently.

199
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,903
I'm late. I have to go.

200
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,478
Hello.

201
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,564
I was starting to get worried.

202
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,985
Car trouble.

203
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,904
Oh, that's a bummer.

204
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,741
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

205
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,623
No sandals today?

206
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,001
I just thought...

207
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,671
A bit more professional.

208
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,299
Well, everything is on track.

209
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,971
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

210
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,098
Let's get our trays ready.

211
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,684
- Clean, no moisture.
- Done.

212
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,023
Is our...?

213
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,442
Our solvent filtered?

214
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,694
I thought you might ask that.

215
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,903
Done.

216
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,033
That's good.

217
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,534
That's good.

218
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,954
Hand in glove, that's what we strive for.

219
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:16,210
You know, this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

220
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,244
So you the gentlemen?

221
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:57,584
Lucky you boys caught me,
I got a load to pick up in Memphis.

222
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:02,090
I can hammer it out in about 15,
but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.

223
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,606
She's got this fetish,
she likes to get peed on.

224
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,096
I was hoping to see her tonight
but she wants to sleep before 10,

225
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:12,767
so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP
because traffic can be a wild card.

226
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:17,939
Thing is, women who like to get peed on
tend to be from the warmer climates.

227
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,109
You'd think the ones in colder zones
would be more inclined.

228
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,725
Maybe it's a shock
if the body's not acclimated,

229
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,198
but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

230
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,576
Science is a mystery.

231
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,704
Well, take a gander.
Prices are negotiable.

232
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,959
Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
I'm running a special on these honeys.

233
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:43,464
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
known as Black Death. Check it out.

234
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,530
Like that?
So sweet, you wanna lick it.

235
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,969
Nickel-plated brass casing, Lubalox coat.

236
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:51,472
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact:

237
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,142
Shred your mama's head like a cabbage.

238
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,812
Keep it. On the house.
But I been windjamming enough.

239
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,232
Tell me what you're looking for,
what it is you need.

240
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,649
Vests.

241
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,778
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.

242
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,654
Right here.

243
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,996
Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded,
non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

244
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:19,000
Stop a bullet like a soft wang against
a Quaker girl. Ain't getting through.

245
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,837
And lightweight? So lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

246
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,840
They work?

247
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,675
Sure as shit, they do.

248
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,970
I don't leave home without it.

249
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,687
What the hell?

250
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:45,359
You broke my freaking rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

251
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,392
You're welcome!

252
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:37,702
Gale.

253
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:40,663
What temperature did you set here?

254
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,373
Here?

255
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,251
Station five, 75 C.

256
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,256
I said 85.

257
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,591
Eight-five.

258
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,264
I wrote it down. You said 75.

259
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,600
- I wrote it.
- Well, you wrote it wrong.

260
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,435
That's not what I said.

261
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,895
I said 85.

262
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:07,273
It's always been 85.

263
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,860
Not 75. Not 95.

264
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,236
Eighty-five.

265
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:16,074
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

266
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:20,953
I'm sorry.

267
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,122
I'm very sorry.

268
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,415
Great.

269
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,125
You're sorry, meanwhile

270
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:30,254
you've just brewed 50 gallons
of useless sludge. Congratulations.

271
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,799
Just dump it. Dump it all.

272
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,926
This batch is ruined.

273
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,961
You look nice.

274
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:14,006
I look like a TV weatherman.

275
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:17,844
You want a coffee?

276
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,265
No.

277
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,937
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

278
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm all right.

279
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:39,866
What are you gonna tell them?

280
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,456
Here's what you'll tell them.

281
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:49,500
He attacked you.

282
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:54,213
- He attacked me?
- He swung at you with something.

283
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,383
- Swung at me?
- He attacked you with a pipe.

284
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,218
A pipe.

285
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:05,183
It happened fast. He resisted arrest
and muscle memory kicked in,

286
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,643
and you had to disarm him.

287
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,562
Muscle memory.

288
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:14,859
Happens all the time. Years of training,
your body acted faster than your brain.

289
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,736
You had no choice but to hit him.

290
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,072
- You had to fight back.
- Marie, Marie, Marie.

291
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,700
No.

292
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:25,828
I'm not gonna go in there and lie.

293
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:30,416
It's some lowlife degenerate versus you

294
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,045
doing the job you're supposed to.

295
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,924
Why should you be the one who pays,

296
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,926
for doing the right thing?

297
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:42,804
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

298
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,098
It's not what the job is.

299
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm supposed to be better than that.

300
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:53,773
And you made one mistake.

301
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:58,110
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...

302
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,532
I've been...

303
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:08,287
unraveling, you know?

304
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,585
I don't sleep at night anymore.

305
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,964
I freeze.

306
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,091
I freeze up.

307
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:25,346
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

308
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,099
Just...

309
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,893
I panic.

310
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,732
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

311
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,943
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

312
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,072
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
between the eyes...

313
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,996
It changed me.

314
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,169
And I can't seem to control it.

315
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,925
I tried to fight it.

316
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,138
But then

317
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,098
El Paso.

318
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,894
And it's just gotten worse.

319
00:30:16,355 --> 00:30:18,524
What I did to Pinkman...

320
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:24,697
that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

321
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,702
All this

322
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,539
everything that's happened, I...

323
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,336
I swear to God, Marie,
I think the universe

324
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,213
is trying to tell me something,

325
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,549
and I'm finally

326
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,719
ready to listen.

327
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:57,730
I'm just not the man I thought I was.

328
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,569
I think I'm done as a cop.

329
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,835
Now, this is not an easy decision,
but it is one that I have to make.

330
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:21,712
I'm sorry.

331
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:26,759
This whole Gale situation, he's...

332
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,428
He's just not working out.

333
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,392
Yes, now.

334
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,603
It may sound unorthodox,

335
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:43,609
but I think our first best option

336
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,863
is Jesse Pinkman.

337
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,119
Hello?

338
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:04,964
No, look. There's a shorthand
that exists between us

339
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,924
experience together

340
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:12,638
at a level that, quite frankly,
I'm just never going to reach with Gale.

341
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,937
Look, Mr. Fring

342
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:25,985
when I accepted your offer,
I was told the lab is mine.

343
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,654
And I know best how to run it.

344
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,536
Thank you.

345
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,329
Thank you.

346
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:40,416
Yes, I will. I will.

347
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,044
Okay. Goodbye.

348
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,927
<i>Listen, something's come up.</i>

349
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,307
I think it's a good opportunity.

350
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:01,854
There's been a job opening.

351
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,564
I need a new lab assistant.

352
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,070
I already did my time.

353
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,864
Why don't you just go get yourself
a monkey?

354
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,950
I don't want a monkey.

355
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:17,203
I want you.

356
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,705
Oh, gee, thanks.

357
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,208
Well, not interested.

358
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,212
I got my own thing going on.

359
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:30,466
And nice try, saving your asshead
brother-in-law.

360
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,348
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

361
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,183
There's more.

362
00:33:40,392 --> 00:33:43,395
It's more than an assistant.

363
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,564
Partners.

364
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,734
We'll be partners again.

365
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,404
Split everything fifty-fifty,
just like before.

366
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:59,203
One-point-five million dollars each.

367
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,044
No.

368
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:18,013
- I don't think you heard...
- I heard you fine.

369
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,267
I said no.

370
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,564
Let me understand this.

371
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,901
You're turning down
one and a half million dollars...

372
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,697
I am not turning down the money.

373
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,242
I am turning down you.

374
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,286
You get it?

375
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,456
I want nothing to do with you.

376
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,377
Ever since I met you

377
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,923
everything I've ever cared about

378
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,217
is gone.

379
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,929
Ruined, turned to shit

380
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:04,476
dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

381
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,939
I have never been more alone.

382
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,318
I have nothing!

383
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:14,570
No one!

384
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:17,573
All right? It's all gone!

385
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,491
Get it?

386
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:21,785
No.

387
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:24,580
No, no. Why...?

388
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:29,001
Why would you get it?

389
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:35,633
What do you even care,
as long as you get what you want?

390
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,092
Right?

391
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:42,264
You don't give a shit about me.

392
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,769
You said I was no good.

393
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,521
I'm nothing!

394
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,192
Why would you want me, huh?

395
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,822
You said my meth is inferior, right?

396
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:04,620
Right? Hey, you said my cook
was garbage!

397
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,122
Hey, screw you, man!

398
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,667
Screw you.

399
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:17,549
Your meth is good, Jesse.

400
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:20,135
As good as mine.

401
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,070
Yeah.

402
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,782
<i>Fifty-fifty.</i>

403
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,785
Yes, fifty-fifty.

404
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,956
Okay.

405
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,625
Partners.

406
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,467
Good.

407
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,977
And this is the statement
you want to give?

408
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,480
Yes, sir.

409
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,400
- Hank, you don't have to do this.
- No, I...

410
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,153
I do.

411
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,948
I'm good.

412
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:53,039
So we understand if we
write it up like that, you'll sign it.

413
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,001
That's the way it happened.

414
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,963
I accept the consequences.

415
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,887
In the light of these facts

416
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,472
as of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

417
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,395
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

418
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,438
Yes, sir.

419
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,220
Schrader.

420
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,055
Hold up.

421
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,765
Yes, sir?

422
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,393
I just wanted to tell you something.

423
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,105
And you didn't hear it from me.
Don't want you to get your hopes up,

424
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,942
but the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

425
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,906
- Why not?
- Who the hell knows?

426
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,409
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

427
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,266
It went fine.

428
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,562
Well, fine means what it means, yeah.

429
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,773
I'll...

430
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,109
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

431
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,446
Yeah. It's...

432
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,615
Yeah, it's just...

433
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,659
I don't know, baby, I just think...

434
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,995
I think we may be okay. Yeah.

435
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,581
Okay. I love you too.

436
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,939
- Schrader.
- <i>I need you to listen very carefully.</i>

437
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,191
<i>Two men are coming to kill you.</i>

438
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,776
Come again?

439
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:31,030
<i>They're approaching your car.
You have one minute.</i>

440
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,658
I don't get the gag, jagoff.
Who is this?

441
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,785
<i>They're coming.</i>

442
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,829
Hello?

443
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,845
Hey, li...

444
00:41:56,014 --> 00:42:00,893
Gomey, I don't know what that call was,
but it's dumb even by your standards,

445
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,187
so call me when you get this.

446
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,753
Jesus.

447
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,713
No.
