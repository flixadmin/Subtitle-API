1
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,750
People are peculiar creatures.

2
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,041
All their actions are driven by desire,

3
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,666
their characters forged by pain.

4
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,625
As much as they might try
to suppress the pain,

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,041
to repress desire,

6
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:51,875
they cannot liberate themselves
from eternal servitude to their feelings.

7
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,125
As long as the storm rages within them

8
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,375
they can find no peace.

9
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,791
Not in life,

10
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,583
not in death.

11
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,333
And so, day after day,
they will do all that must be done.

12
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,750
Pain is their ship,

13
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,083
desire their compass.

14
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,166
All that humankind is capable of.

15
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,166
JUNE 26, 1954

16
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,916
ONE DAY UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,375
The deceased woman is 5' 7".

18
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,833
Caucasian.

19
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,625
Probably 75

20
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,583
to 80 years old.

21
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,375
Cause of death, a shot to the chest.

22
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,333
The eyes are notable.

23
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,541
One blue, one brown.

24
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,875
It's known as heterochromia.

25
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,416
This woman, she...

26
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,666
She was at the police station.

27
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,375
The same day Helge reappeared.

28
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,166
And?

29
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,791
She was confused.

30
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,958
Not entirely there.

31
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,041
She apologized for something, I...

32
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,000
I didn't understand for what.

33
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,541
The same day Helge came back?

34
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,208
Maybe she's the madman's accomplice.

35
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,750
Could be his mother.

36
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,291
And she had Helge with her the whole time.

37
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,208
There's something else.

38
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,916
I only happened upon it by chance.

39
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,375
Her body

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,750
is heavily contaminated.

41
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,625
Here.

42
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,041
All over.

43
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:39,375
She must've been exposed
to heavy radiation for a prolonged period.

44
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,833
Peculiar.

45
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,416
Perhaps she worked as a radiographer.

46
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
A radiographer?

47
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:53,666
Visit the Doppler boy. Show him her photo.
Maybe he'll recognize her.

48
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,875
The data indicates

49
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,125
that the particle regularly decays
into two protons,

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,916
at a mass of 125 gigaelectronvolts.

51
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,958
In one case, however,
it decayed into four muons.

52
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,125
You're already here?

53
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,583
I must've lost track of time.

54
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,833
What day is it?

55
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,833
It's...

56
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,541
June 26.

57
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,416
Did you spend all night here?

58
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,041
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
FOUND DEAD ON JUNE 26, 1987

59
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,166
June 26...

60
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,166
Is something wrong?

61
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,833
I rescheduled the meeting with the French
for this morning.

62
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,708
Ms. Tiedemann?

63
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,083
Mom?

64
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,708
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
WHAT'S BEHIND THE DOOR?

65
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,833
It all has to do with me.

66
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,458
Noah said the world will end tomorrow.

67
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,125
And that only the people
in the bunker will survive.

68
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,958
And he said she's alive.

69
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,666
My mother.

70
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,458
The documents
from the Marburg passport office are here.

71
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,666
As you suspected,

72
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,000
in that time frame there's only one entry
for an Aleksander Köhler.

73
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:59,583
And then the eyes saw, the ears heard
and nothing remained concealed.

74
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,458
Freud?

75
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,833
Tell Mr. Wöller.

76
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,791
We have to tell someone.

77
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,250
Who then? And what exactly?

78
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,041
Do you have anything to say?

79
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,708
I think he's here.

80
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,250
Who?

81
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Jonas.

82
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,750
I think Bartosz is right. He's back.

83
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,500
We traveled through time
and that's all that interests you?

84
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,541
You said he's part of it.
Unlike you, he might know what this means.

85
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,041
Maybe he knows where Dad or Mikkel is,
or who knows what!

86
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,875
Magnus is right.

87
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,875
We have to tell someone.

88
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,916
Everyone has been up to
their own shit for months.

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,416
Everyone's silent.

90
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,208
What good has that done? None at all.

91
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,750
Okay.

92
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,458
Then we should do it.

93
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,625
We?

94
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,625
There is no "we."

95
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,291
There never has been.

96
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,833
-What does that mean?
-You knew what was going on for months.

97
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,958
You never told me or anyone else here.

98
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,083
Do whatever you want.

99
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,000
I hope it won't take too long.

100
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,083
Helge is still very exhausted.

101
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,000
Do you know this woman?

102
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,250
Answer the sergeant.

103
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,250
Were you with her maybe?

104
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,291
Did she lock you in?

105
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,083
He told me about her.

106
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,416
The White Devil.

107
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,625
Who?

108
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,958
Who told you about her?

109
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,958
The man who did that to you?

110
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,333
The White Devil.

111
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,250
Tell me about

112
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,583
the White Devil.

113
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,791
She wants to kill us.

114
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,416
All of us.

115
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,250
She's dead.
She can't hurt anyone anymore.

116
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,250
But she hasn't even started yet.

117
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,833
-Claudia?
-Hey, Dad.

118
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,625
Shouldn't you be at work?

119
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,916
I took the day off.

120
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,833
Is everything all right?

121
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,250
We discussed you moving in with us.

122
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,166
I...

123
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,041
Already forgotten?

124
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,958
You said I should think it over.

125
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,083
I just thought...

126
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,666
why waste time?

127
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,416
Then you'll be out of here.

128
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,541
I like it here.

129
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,291
I have to go.

130
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,333
To the hospital.

131
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,625
My first chemo.

132
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,833
Can I...

133
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,500
maybe join you?

134
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,500
That is, only if you'd like.

135
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,291
That'd be nice.

136
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,583
What do you want here?
I've already told you everything.

137
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,916
I'd like you to look at something.

138
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,708
Mr. Wöller?

139
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,666
What is it?

140
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,000
A copy of a document
from the Marburg Registry Office.

141
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,250
The info on your last ID
before you left Marburg.

142
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,666
I've no idea how this is relevant.

143
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,500
Nothing stands out?

144
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,291
No. What should stand out?

145
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,291
5' 6", I'd say. Tops.

146
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,208
That document says 5' 8".

147
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,708
So where are they?

148
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,791
Where are what?

149
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,541
The two inches.

150
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,666
This is ridiculous.

151
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,250
I'm arresting you.

152
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,958
On suspicion of identity theft.

153
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,125
You can't.

154
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,625
Hannah?

155
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,708
Hannah?

156
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,250
Anyone home?

157
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,291
Hello?

158
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,125
Hello?

159
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,125
Hannah, if you're home,
please open the door.

160
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,166
Pardon me. I...

161
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,333
Who are you?

162
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,333
Please come in.

163
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,583
I...

164
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,750
I... I wanted to talk to Hannah.

165
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,083
She's not here.

166
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,250
Want a drink?

167
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,958
Do I scare you?

168
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,333
I don't want to.

169
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,541
I think
I'm just having déjà vu or something.

170
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,291
-I'm going.
-A glitch in the matrix.

171
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,833
What?

172
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,750
Or a message from beyond.

173
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You read that somewhere.

174
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,750
How do you know that?

175
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,916
You found the pendant.

176
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,333
Jonas?

177
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,875
Do you think
that I was a good police officer?

178
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,666
Oh, Dad. No idea.

179
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,125
I'm sure you were good at what you did.

180
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,041
Actually, I don't think so.

181
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:05,250
You were always different.

182
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,833
You saw the world differently
from the very start.

183
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,041
Sometimes I think

184
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,250
that that's my problem.

185
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,250
That I can't see the world as it truly is.

186
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,125
I think I did something very, very stupid.

187
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,333
What do you mean?

188
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,750
Do you know that movie?

189
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,166
The one with the young man
who has this car

190
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,416
that can take him to the past?

191
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,166
I know this sounds crazy,

192
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,583
but...

193
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,166
the stuff in that movie

194
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,833
really exists.

195
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,375
Time travel.

196
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,791
And somehow...

197
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:23,000
it has all got to do with Mads and Helge.

198
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,208
And with things

199
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,041
that happened over 30 years ago.

200
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,333
Mr. Tiedemann!

201
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,041
Mr. Tiedemann.

202
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,375
A woman's waiting for you in your office.

203
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,791
Did she say what she wanted?

204
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,958
It's about the man in the asylum.

205
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,083
The one who killed the boys.

206
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,833
She says she knows him.

207
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,041
Thanks.

208
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,083
Hello.

209
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,083
Hello.

210
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,666
How can I help you?

211
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,708
I...

212
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm looking for my husband.

213
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,291
It was in the paper.

214
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,208
The dead children.

215
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,750
And there was a photo.

216
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,125
I think it's my husband.

217
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,333
Is that your husband?

218
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,458
There's a resemblance.

219
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,958
We looked for relatives.
No one came forward.

220
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,375
You know he was arrested last winter
for multiple murders?

221
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,875
Can I see him?

222
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,083
It's not that simple, he's...

223
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,583
currently in a psychiatric facility.

224
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,916
He won't talk.

225
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,166
I see.

226
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,041
But maybe he'll talk to me.

227
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,750
May I ask you what your name is?

228
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,208
Nielsen.

229
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,333
Katharina Nielsen.

230
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,416
Where were you all this time?

231
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,208
I promised you
I'd make it all right again.

232
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,583
I'm so sorry.

233
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,916
Suddenly it all makes sense.

234
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,041
Once you know, it's obvious.

235
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,458
Hannah?

236
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,458
Hannah, open the door!

237
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,416
Hannah?

238
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,541
Hannah!

239
00:24:58,625 --> 00:24:59,833
Martha, don't.

240
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:00,958
Please.

241
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,083
Martha?

242
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,916
You know who this is? Hm?

243
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,125
Did he tell you where your brother is?

244
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,041
Who your brother is?

245
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,583
That man

246
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,541
is your brother's son.

247
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,416
My grandson, your nephew.

248
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,041
Mikkel is Michael Kahnwald.
You hear me, Martha?

249
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,416
And you are his aunt.

250
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,000
Martha.

251
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,791
I'm so sorry.

252
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,083
I'm sorry.

253
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:02,166
I... Believe me, I really wanted to...

254
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,333
Where's your machine?

255
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:07,166
The one you can travel through time with?

256
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,416
Hannah's got it.

257
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,916
She's vanished.

258
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,625
Hannah?

259
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,541
Tell me how I can get Mikkel back!

260
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,625
Mom...

261
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,458
Magnus has the device.

262
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:31,833
What?

263
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,958
We traveled with it.

264
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,000
You were there?

265
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,083
Did you see Mikkel?

266
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,416
Mikkel?

267
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,208
Keep your filthy fingers off her.

268
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,291
You got me?

269
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,416
Come on.

270
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,083
What is this?

271
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,375
My brother

272
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,833
also vanished without a trace.

273
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,000
In 1986.

274
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,958
Much like
Mads Nielsen's disappearance here.

275
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,583
Not a trace.

276
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,166
Nothing.

277
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,791
His name was Aleksander too.

278
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,083
Aleksander Köhler.

279
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,666
Just like yours.

280
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,916
A common name.

281
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:58,583
To be precise, there are
over 700 Aleksander Köhlers in Germany.

282
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:04,833
It isn't all that easy to track down
every Aleksander Köhler.

283
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:10,708
Particularly when they've assumed
their wife's maiden name.

284
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Believe me, I'm speaking from experience.

285
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,958
When my parents split,
I took my mother's last name.

286
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,375
I went from Köhler to Clausen.

287
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:27,750
For some people
I'm still untraceable to this day.

288
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,666
But,

289
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,958
a couple of months ago,

290
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,000
this happened.

291
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,583
Read it.

292
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,208
Out loud.

293
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,416
"He that has eyes to see

294
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,916
and ears to hear

295
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:30,333
may convince himself
that no mortal can keep a secret.

296
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,083
If his lips are silent...

297
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,375
-...he chatters...
-...he chatters with his fingertips.

298
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:42,875
-Betrayal oozes...
-...out of him at every pore.

299
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,916
You'll find the answers
concerning your brother in Winden.

300
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,541
A friend."

301
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,541
I have no idea

302
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,916
what's going on in this town.

303
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,166
But I'm very certain of one thing.

304
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,375
You...

305
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,916
are definitely not my brother.

306
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,083
Your husband never confessed.

307
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,916
He kept insisting
he wanted to save the children.

308
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,583
You and your husband...

309
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,458
You have children, right?

310
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,166
No.

311
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,708
No.

312
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,916
Strange.

313
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,250
He kept saying he was looking for his son.

314
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,291
This may sound a bit odd, but...

315
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,708
Have you ever heard of a "White Devil"?

316
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,875
No. What is that supposed to be?

317
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,625
If he talks to you...

318
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,666
That is, if he should talk to you,

319
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:37,083
persuade him to talk to the police.

320
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,458
Persuade him to confess.

321
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,791
And the man came from the future?

322
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,375
Back to 1953?

323
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,125
That's when you arrested him.

324
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,666
And yesterday
that man tried to kidnap the boy?

325
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,333
No.

326
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,708
Not that man.

327
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,291
I mean...

328
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,791
the same man,

329
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,333
but older.

330
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:10,166
Because he's allegedly his son?

331
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,000
I know.

332
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,666
It all sounds completely insane.

333
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:19,958
The man,

334
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,333
the old man.

335
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,375
Where is he now?

336
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,750
Back in psychiatric care.

337
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,916
That's enough. You're moving in with us.

338
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,625
We'll get your things now.

339
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,916
So you believe me.

340
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,750
So you...

341
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,875
traveled with it?

342
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,458
To what year?

343
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,916
To what year?

344
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,041
So that's what's going on.

345
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,500
You knew about this time travel shit?

346
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,125
Why didn't you say anything?

347
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,208
Martha.

348
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,708
Yes. At Franziska's.

349
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,333
Yes, I'll be right home.

350
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,333
You what?

351
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,291
Who?

352
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,791
Jonas is back.

353
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,916
Like Bartosz said.

354
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,416
But he's older.

355
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,833
You guys should stay out of this.

356
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,083
Unbelievable.

357
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,541
So you two knew it too.

358
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:11,916
That's exactly what ruins everything!

359
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,083
All your fucking secrets!

360
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:18,041
You couldn't even talk to us
when Dad screwed Benni!

361
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,708
What incompetent assholes you are!

362
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,625
Franziska.

363
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,625
K-53.

364
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,583
I'd like a moment alone with him.

365
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,250
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

366
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,625
Please.

367
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,083
Just five minutes.

368
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,625
As you wish.

369
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,708
Ulrich?

370
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,916
Ulrich.

371
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,291
Ulrich, it's me.

372
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,583
Hannah.

373
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,208
Hannah.

374
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,666
Ulrich, it's me.

375
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,000
Is it really you?

376
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,958
Yes.

377
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,750
Or are you an angel?

378
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,458
Are you an angel?

379
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,916
-Is it you?
-Yes.

380
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,916
It's you.

381
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,250
Do you know where Mikkel is?

382
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:02,250
And Katharina? How is Katharina?

383
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,416
Martha? Magnus?

384
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,708
It's so different seeing you again.

385
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,166
What?

386
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:25,625
If you could choose today,

387
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,625
between Katharina and me?

388
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,333
What do you mean?

389
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,375
Why?

390
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:42,583
Back when we were together, you...

391
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,958
I...

392
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,583
I tried to remember if you...

393
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,958
if you ever said "I love you" to me.

394
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,416
I loved you.

395
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,708
I still love you.

396
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,208
Get me out and I'll leave Katharina.

397
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,375
I love you.

398
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,583
Okay?

399
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,791
I love you.

400
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,916
He said I need no one.

401
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,250
But the truth is

402
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,916
you don't need me.

403
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,291
Yes, yes. I need you, Hannah.

404
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,750
I love you.

405
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,583
You've got to get me out.

406
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,375
I'll do anything you want.

407
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,291
Get me out of here, please.

408
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,041
Hannah, I love you.

409
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,458
You hear me?

410
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,125
I love you.

411
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,041
Hannah. Stay!

412
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,500
I love you.

413
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:50,083
You fucking cunt!

414
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,791
Stay! Stay with me!

415
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,000
Stay with me!

416
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,291
I love you!

417
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:01,333
She's a liar!

418
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,166
There are similarities, but...

419
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,541
Hannah!

420
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,166
I love you!

421
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,833
That's not my husband.

422
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,541
Get me out of here!

423
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,250
Get me out of here!

424
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,250
Mom?

425
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,791
Everything will be fine.

426
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,083
Okay?

427
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,250
You got the machine?

428
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,958
Do you know how it works?

429
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,875
I...

430
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:44,833
don't.

431
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:46,958
Bartosz used it.

432
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,833
They're alive.

433
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,541
Mikkel.

434
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15,958
And Dad.

435
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,750
What?

436
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,541
They're just not here.

437
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,916
They're in another time.

438
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,833
Just grab your pills quick.
We'll come back for everything else.

439
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,041
I just need a minute.

440
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,625
Come on. Let's go.

441
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,666
I wonder

442
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:54,166
why he wanted
to go into the caves with him.

443
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,750
Maybe there's something there,
in the caves.

444
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,000
Dad, stop.

445
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,750
But he wanted to go there in 1953 too.

446
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,125
And again now.

447
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,333
-Maybe there's something--
-There's nothing in the caves.

448
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:27,500
But there must be some reason
he wanted to go in there.

449
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,041
Can we go now?

450
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,000
Why are you really here?

451
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,041
What do you mean by that?

452
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,333
You know.

453
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,958
What do I know?

454
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,750
You know about the time travel.

455
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:10,583
-It's related to the nuclear power plant.
-I'd like to go now!

456
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:17,000
You're involved in all of this.

457
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,750
Don't be ridiculous.

458
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,833
We have to have the caves searched.

459
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:29,708
There's nothing in the caves!
There is no time travel!

460
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:51,125
-What are you doing?
-Calling the station.

461
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,250
To have them search the caves.

462
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,666
You're clueless.

463
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,333
What's in the caves eclipses
all scientific discovery.

464
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:04,875
That substance turns all we know
about the universe on its head.

465
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:08,958
And you want to risk all of that?
For nothing?

466
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,166
You haven't changed.

467
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,708
It's still all about you.

468
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,875
You have no heart.

469
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,333
Let go.

470
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,416
Let go!

471
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,583
Oh God, Dad!

472
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,916
Stay right there.

473
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,375
Don't move.

474
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,666
I...

475
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:55,958
I'll call an ambulance.

476
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,458
Come on.

477
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:10,416
Come on!

478
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,083
Winden Emergency Services,
how can I help?

479
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,750
Hello?

480
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:17,666
Hell--

481
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,875
"You'll have to make sacrifices."

482
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:43,000
"Everything will happen as it always has."

483
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,416
"But if everything goes right,
she'll live."

484
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:48,958
Regina.

485
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,916
I'm so sorry.

486
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,041
You are the White Devil.

487
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,416
You're sure he wasn't your husband?

488
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,166
I...

489
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,375
should've reacted quicker.

490
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,333
-I'm sorry.
-Don't blame yourself.

491
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,750
Nielsen...

492
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,791
That's an...

493
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,583
uncommon name.

494
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,666
Do you know an Agnes Nielsen?

495
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:27,708
No.

496
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:36,541
You're traveling back today?

497
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,416
I lost everything where I came from.

498
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:48,125
All I want is a fresh start.

499
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:42,416
SLEEPING OVER AT A FRIEND'S, R.

500
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:03,041
Who are you?

501
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,625
Why do you have a key to my house?

502
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:09,083
You gave it to me before you left.

503
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,625
Nonsense.

504
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:14,583
I don't even know you.

505
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,083
She gave it to you.

506
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,625
My older self.

507
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:37,291
We've got to go.
We don't have much time.

508
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:38,958
I don't understand.

509
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,708
I know what you did.

510
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,250
She told me.

511
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,083
But she also said
it didn't have to happen that way again.

512
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,291
Next time.

513
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,833
Where are we going?

514
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,250
