still gets me every time.

7
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,029
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship, sitting here...

8
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,655
where she landed
at 2:30 in the morning

Trust me, buddy.

Great.

127
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,688
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

128
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,715
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

132
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,143
Told you, you wanted to take the call.

133
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,399
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

134
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,146
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

135
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,738
Oh, yes.
The woman in the picture is me.

136
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:12,342
She's a goddamn liar! Some nutcase
seeking money or publicity.

137
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,675
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

They're inbound!

139
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:27,673
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
Titanic when she was 17, right?

140
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:28,726
That's right.

141
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,470
If she had lived,
she'd be over 100 by now.

142
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,780
101 next month.

143
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,950
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

144
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,807
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman...

145
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:43,605
all the way back to the 20s,
when she was working as an actress.

146
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,626
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

147
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,494
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.

148
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,256
Then she marries
this guy named Calvert.

149
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,801
They move to Cedar Rapids and she
punches out a couple of kids.

150
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,470
Now Calvert's dead and from what
I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

151
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,891
And everybody who knows about the
diamond is supposed to be dead...

152
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,913
or on this boat, but she knows.

153
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,076
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

154
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,494
Hurry up, give him a hand.

155
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:24,915
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcorne to the Keldysh.

156
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:29,002
Okay, let's get her inside there.

157
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:30,676
Hi, Miss Calvert.

158
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,756
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

159
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:34,841
Thanks.

160
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:37,216
<font color="#878787">PILOT</font>: <i>Hey!</i>

161
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:45,294
<i>Yes?</i>

162
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,104
Are your staterooms all right?

163
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,356
<i>Oh, yes.
Very nice.</i>

164
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:51,708
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?

165
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:53,318
She takes care of me.

166
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,264
We met just a few minutes ago.

167
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:57,656
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

168
00:14:57,948 --> 00:14:59,032
Oh, yes.

169
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,827
There. That's nice.

170
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:04,538
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

171
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,040
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

172
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,793
Yes.

173
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,629
I would like to see my drawing.

174
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:29,244
<font color="#878787">BROCK</font>: <i>Louis XVI wore
a fabulous stone that was</i>

175
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,310
<i>called the Blue Diamond of the Crown...</i>

176
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:34,586
<i>which disappeared in 1792 -</i>

177
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:37,680
<i>about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.</i>

178
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:42,159
The theory goes that the crown
diamond was chopped too.

179
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:45,094
Recut into a heart-like shape
that became known as...

180
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,360
the Heart of the Ocean.

181
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,749
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

182
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,258
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

183
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,504
<i>I only wore it this once.</i>

184
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,567
<font color="#878787">LIZZY</font>: You actually
think this is you, Nana?

185
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,217
It is me, dear.

186
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:01,219
Wasn't I a dish?

187
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,515
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

188
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:09,936
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

189
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:13,690
Can you tell me who
the claimant was, Rose?

190
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:16,610
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

191
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,769
<i>Nathan Hockley, that's right.</i>

192
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:21,114
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

193
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:22,969
The claim was for
a diamond necklace

194
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,285
his son Caledon bought his fiancée.

195
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:26,231
You.

196
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,434
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

197
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,709
And it was filed right
after the sinking.

198
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:36,630
So, the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

199
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:39,216
You see the date?

200
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,719
April 14, 1912.

201
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:45,889
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

202
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,808
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

203
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,187
And that makes you my new best friend.

204
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:55,649
<i>These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.</i>

205
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:00,092
This was mine.

206
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,548
How extraordinary.

207
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:07,994
And it looks the same as it
did the last time I saw it.

208
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,460
Hmm.

209
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,253
The reflection has changed a bit.

210
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,160
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

211
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:40,193
<font color="#878787">BODINE</font>: <i>Okay, here we go.</i>

212
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:42,823
<i>She hits the 'berg on
the starboard side, right?</i>

213
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,808
She kind of bumps along,
punching holes like morse code...

214
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,003
dit-dit-dit-- along the side,
below the water line.

215
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,346
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

216
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,643
Now, as the water level rises...

217
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:55,667
it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

218
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:58,545
which, unfortunately, don't
go any higher than "E" deck.

219
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:02,550
So, now as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up -

220
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:05,110
Slow at first,
then faster and faster...

221
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:07,899
until finally, <i>she's</i> got her
whole ass sticking up in the air.

222
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:12,418
And that's a big ass.
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

223
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,644
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

224
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:15,791
So, what happens?

225
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,607
She splits, right down to the keel

226
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,283
and the stern...
falls back level.

227
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:25,322
Then, as the bow sinks,
it pulls the stern vertical

228
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,963
and then finally detaches.

229
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:32,384
Now, the stern section just kind of bobs
there like a cork for a couple of minutes...

230
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:35,136
floods and finally goes
under about 2:20 AM...

231
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,324
2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

232
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:41,422
The bow section planes away...

233
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,181
landing about a half a mile away-

234
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,752
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

235
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,098
Pretty cool, huh?

236
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:55,418
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

237
00:18:56,686 --> 00:19:00,023
Of course, the experience of it was...

238
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:02,525
somewhat different.

239
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:05,028
Will you share it with us?

240
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,581
Oh.

241
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm taking her to rest.

242
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:02,085
No.

243
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,420
Come on, Nana.

244
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,838
No!

245
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,593
Give me the tape recorder.

246
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:14,764
Tell us, Rose.

247
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,935
It's been 84 years--

248
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,493
It's okay.
Just try to remember anything...

249
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:22,647
anything at all.

250
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:26,609
Do you want to hear
this or not, Mr. Lovett?

251
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:33,916
It's been 84 years...

252
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:38,455
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

253
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:43,084
The china had never been used.

254
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:46,463
The sheets had never been slept in.

255
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,051
Titanic was called "The Ship of Dreams".

256
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,721
And it was.

257
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,682
It really was.

258
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:29,422
<font color="#878787">PORTER</font>:

00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,052
this way please!
This queue! Right here...

261
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,095
It's a big boat, huh?

262
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:38,181
Daddy, it's a ship.

263
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,063
You're right.

the fuss is about.</i>

265

than the Mauretania.

267
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:17,887
but not about Titanic.

268
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,848
It's over 100 feet longer
than Mauretania...

269
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:21,474
and far more luxurious.

270
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,616
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

271
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:28,184
So, this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

272
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:29,200
- It is unsinkable.
- <i>Sir, sir.</i>

273
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:30,851
God Himself could not sink this ship--

274
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:33,361
- What?!
- You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

275
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:34,654
It's round that way, sir.

276
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:36,489
I put my faith in you good sir.

277
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:37,641
Now kindly see my man.

278
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,085
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

279
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,241
If I can do anything at all...

280
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,710
Yes, right.

281
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,866
All the trunks from that car there...

00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:46,087

00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,876
Uh-oh. 2 pair.

308
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,129
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

309
00:24:58,548 --> 00:24:59,281
<font color="#878787">JACK</font>: I'm sorry...

310
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:02,140
you're not gonna see your
mom again for a long time...

311
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:04,289
'cause we're going to America.

312
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:05,672
Full house, boys!

313
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:17,942
Oh!

314
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,272
Come on.

315
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,287
I'm going home!

316
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,009
I'm going home.

317
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:29,620
I go to America!

318
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,247
No, mate.

319
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,189
Titanic go to America,

320
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:35,084
in 5 minutes.

321
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:37,247
Shit Fabri.
Come on.

322
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:38,132
Come on, here. Here.

323
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:41,966
We're riding in high style now!

324
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:44,510
We're a couple of regular swells.

325
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,388
We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.

326
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,714
You see? Is my destino.

327
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:50,839
Like I told you...

328
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:52,542
I go to America to be millionaire.

329
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,112
Whoa! Whoa!

330
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,147
- Bastardo.
- Whoo!

331
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:57,182
You are pazzo.

332
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,192
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

333
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,587
Come on, I thought you were fast.

334
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:03,613
<i>Aspetta!</i>

335
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:05,615
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

336
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:06,699
Hey, wait!

337
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:08,405
We're passengers!

338
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,413
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

339
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:13,827
Of course.

340
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:17,043
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans. Both of us.

341
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:18,071
Right.

342
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:19,094
Come aboard.

343
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,421
<i>We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.</i>

344
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:26,177
You know that?

345
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:36,395
<font color="#878787">JACK</font>: Good-bye!

346
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:41,484
<font color="#878787">FABRIZIO</font>: You know somebody?

347
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,069
Of course not.
That's not the point.

348
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,962
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

349
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:46,547
Good-bye!

350
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,127
I will never forget you!

351
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,499
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

352
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,378
G-60.

353
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:45,047
G-60. G-60.

354
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:46,465
Excuse me, ma'am.

355
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:48,718
G-60.

356
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:51,721
Oh, right here.

357
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:53,306
Hey, how you doing?

358
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:55,433
Jack. Nice to meet you.

359
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,226
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

360
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:58,686
How you doing?

361
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:01,290
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

362
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:09,488
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

363
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:11,866
Would you be requiring anything?

364
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:13,409
- Mmm.
- Excuse me.

365
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,494
- <font color="#878787">MAID</font>: <i>This one?</i>
- <font color="#878787">ROSE</font>: <i>No.</i>

366
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:17,997
It had a lot of faces on it.

367
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:19,916
This is the one.

368
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:23,419
Would you like all of them out, miss?

369
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:26,923
Yes. We need a little
color in this room.

370
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:31,969
Put in there. In the wardrobe.

371
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:35,181
God, not those finger-paintings again.

372
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:36,849
They certainly were a waste of money.

373
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,230
The difference between
Cal's taste in art...

374
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:40,603
and mine is that I have some.

375
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:41,687
They're fascinating.

376
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:45,191
Like being inside a dream or something.

377
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:46,776
There's truth but no logic.

378
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:49,862
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

379
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:51,590
Something Picasso.

380
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:53,157
He won't amount to a thing.

381
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,492
He won't, trust me.

382
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:57,036
- <i>Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.</i>
- At least they were cheap.

383
00:28:57,677 --> 00:28:59,622
Ah, put it in the wardrobe.

384
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,465
<font color="#878787">OLD ROSE</font>: <i>At Cherbourg, a woman
came aboard named Margaret Brown.</i>

385
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:11,467
<i>We all called her Molly.</i>

386
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:14,971
<i>History would call her
the "Unsinkable Molly Brown."</i>

387
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,431
Well, I wasn't about to wait
all day for you, sonny.

388
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,684
Here, if you think you can manage.

389
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:23,312
<i>Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.</i>

390
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,440
<i>And she was what Mother

391
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,406
<i>By the next afternoon...</i>

392
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,939
<i>we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland...</i>

393
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:36,117
<i>with nothing out ahead
of us but ocean.</i>

394
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:44,500
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

395
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:46,778
Let's stretch her legs.

396
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,087
Yes, sir.

397
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,855
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

398
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:53,175
Very good, sir.

399
00:29:58,639 --> 00:29:59,682
All ahead full.

400
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,310

Let's stoke her right up!

403
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,000
We go full ahead!

404
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,336
Come on, put your backs into it!

405
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:24,934
21 knots, sir.

408
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:44,787
There's another one! See him?

409
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,966
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

410
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:25,474
I can see the Statue
of Liberty already.

411
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:27,580
Very small, of course.

412
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:34,003
I'm the king of the world!

413
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:23,417
<i>She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man</i>

414
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:25,304
in all history.

415
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:27,765
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews, here,

416
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:29,725
designed her from the keel plates up.

417
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,981
I may have knocked her together, but...

418
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:34,188
the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

419
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,761
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale and...

420
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,621
and so luxurious in
its appointments,

421
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:41,753
that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

422
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,464
And here she is.

423
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:46,700
- Willed into solid reality.
- <font color="#878787">CAL</font>: <i>Hear, hear.</i>

424
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:49,411
I'll have the salmon.

00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,917
You know I don't like that, Rose.

426
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,755
She knows.

427
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:04,093
Hm. We'll both have the lamb.

428
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:06,345
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

429
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,014
Hm. You like lamb, right sweet pea?

430
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:14,014
You gonna cut her meat for her
too there, Cal?

431
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:19,275
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

432
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:21,110
Was it you, Bruce?

433
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:22,611
Yes, actually.

434
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:27,616
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability...

435
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:31,120
luxury and above all, strength.

436
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:34,456
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

437
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:37,001
His ideas about the male
preoccupation with size

438
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,044
might be of particular
interest to you.

439
00:34:40,462 --> 00:34:41,797
What's gotten into you?

440
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,382
Excuse me.

441
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,305
I do apologize.

442
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:52,133
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

443
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:53,839
Well, I may have to start minding

444
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:56,228
what she reads from now on,
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

445
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:59,398
Freud? Who is he?
Is he a passenger?

448

449
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,710
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

450
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:22,546
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

451
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:24,214
That's typical.

452
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,384
First-class dogs come down
here to take a shit.

453

At, lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

454
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:32,056
Like we could forget?

I'm Tommy Ryan.

- Fabrizio.

457
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:40,856
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

458
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,520
Ah, forget it, boyo.

459
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:56,028
It is like have angels fly out
of your arse as get

460
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,153
next to the likes of her.

at a great precipice...</i>

466
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:45,938
<i>with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...</i>

467
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:48,132
<i>or even noticed.</i>

468
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:39,964
Don't do it.

469
00:38:40,744 --> 00:38:42,079
Stay back.

470
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,495
Don't come any closer.

471
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:46,875
Come on.

472
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:48,519
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

473
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:50,394
No! Stay where you are.

474
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:52,089
I mean it.

475
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:54,424
I'll let go.

476
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:06,937
No, you won't.

477
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:10,274
What do you mean, no I won't?

478
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:13,173
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

479
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:14,444
You don't know me.

480
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:16,780
Well, you would have done it already.

481
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,616
You're distracting me. Go away.

482
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,118
I can't.

483
00:39:21,285 --> 00:39:22,536
I'm involved now.

484
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:26,790
You let go and I'm gonna have
to jump in there after you.

485
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,127
Don't be absurd.

486
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,629
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

487
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:34,798
The fall alone will kill you.

488
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:38,302
It would hurt.
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

489
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:39,875
Tell you the truth...

490
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,578
I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

491
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:51,607
How cold?

492
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:55,152
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

493
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:00,657
You ever, uh...

494
00:40:00,991 --> 00:40:02,743
ever been to Wisconsin?

495
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:07,164
What?

496
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:09,666
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

497
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:12,836
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

498
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,396
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father,

499
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,521
we went ice fishing
out on Lake Wissota.

500
00:40:19,593 --> 00:40:20,779
Ice fishing is, you know, where you--

501
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:22,193
I know what ice fishing is!

502
00:40:24,014 --> 00:40:25,182
Sorry.

503
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,020
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

504
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:33,170
Anyway, I...

505
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:35,842
I fell through some thin ice.

506
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,928
And I'm telling you...

507
00:40:39,631 --> 00:40:41,723
water that cold,

508
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:44,082
like right down there...

509
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:47,631
it hits you like 1,000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

510
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,165
You can't breathe.

511
00:40:50,637 --> 00:40:51,748
You can't think...

512
00:40:53,263 --> 00:40:55,263
At least, not about
anything but the pain.

513
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:01,969
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

514
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:04,054
Like I said...

515
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:07,557
I don't have a choice.

516
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:14,329
I guess I'm kind of hoping
you'll come back over the rail and...

517
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:15,431
and get me off the hook here.

518
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,235
You're crazy.

519
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:21,738
That's what everybody says but...

520
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,908
with all due respect, miss...

521
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,744
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

522
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:29,913
Come on.

523
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,249
Come on, give me your hand.

524
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,418
You don't want to do this.

525
00:41:48,223 --> 00:41:49,391
Phew.

526
00:41:50,434 --> 00:41:51,935
I'm Jack Dawson.

527
00:41:53,437 --> 00:41:55,105
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

528
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:57,394
I'll have to get you
to write that one down.

529
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:00,777
Come on.

530
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:07,150
I got you.

531
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:08,577
Come on.

532
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:10,287
Come on.

533
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,344
Help, please!

534
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:17,961
Help!

535
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:20,564
Please, help me!
Listen. Listen to me.

536
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:22,063
Listen. Listen to me.

537
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:23,967
I've got you. I won't let go.

538
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:26,261
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

539
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,307
Come on.

540
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:31,600
That's right.

541
00:42:32,142 --> 00:42:33,226
You can do it.

542
00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:39,483
I got you.

543
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:46,656
What's all this?

544
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:54,714
You stand back
and don't move an inch!

545
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:58,877
Fetch the Master-at-Arms.

546
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:03,090
This is completely unacceptable!

547
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,566
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancée?!

548
00:43:07,677 --> 00:43:08,845
Look at me, you filth!

549
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,012
Cal.

550
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:11,215
What do you think you were doing?

551
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:14,184
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

552
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:16,520
An accident?

553
00:43:16,853 --> 00:43:18,188
It was.

554
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:20,357
Stupid, really.

555
00:43:21,191 --> 00:43:23,693
I was leaning over and I slipped.

556
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:29,429
I was leaning far over
to see the, uh...

557
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:32,611
...uh, uh, the uh...

558
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:35,843
- Propellers?
- Propellers and I slipped.

559
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:38,850
And I would have gone overboard
but Mr. Dawson here...

560
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:42,045
saved me.
And almost went over himself.

561
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,356
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

562
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,551
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

563
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:50,387
Was that the way of it?

564
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:55,141
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

565
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:56,726
Well, the boy's a hero, then.

566
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:58,367
Good for you, son. Well done.

567
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:02,039
So, it's all's well
and back to our brandy, eh?

568
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:06,533
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside-

569
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:10,088
Ah, perhaps a little something for the boy?

570
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:13,410
Of course.

571
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:17,247
Mr. Lovejoy, I think a 20 should do it.

572
00:44:17,914 --> 00:44:20,584
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

573
00:44:22,252 --> 00:44:24,087
Rose is displeased.

574
00:44:24,588 --> 00:44:26,256
What to do?

575
00:44:26,715 --> 00:44:27,716
I know.

576
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:33,597
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening...

577
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,934
to regale our group
with your heroic tale.

578
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,439
Sure. Count me in.

579
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:45,108
Good. It's settled then.

580
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:47,444
This should be interesting.

581
00:44:56,786 --> 00:44:59,456
Can I bum a smoke?

582
00:45:08,298 --> 00:45:09,466
You'll want to tie those.

583
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:13,481
It's interesting...

584
00:45:13,506 --> 00:45:15,396
the young lady slipped so suddenly...

585
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:19,142
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

586
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:37,327
I know you've been melancholy.

587
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:40,330
I don't pretend to know why.

588
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:45,168
I intended to save this...

589
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:50,340
until the engagement gala next week...

590
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:54,540
but, I thought...

591
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:55,679
tonight.

592
00:45:57,138 --> 00:45:58,348
Good gracious!

593
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:02,018
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

594
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:04,145
- Is it a--
- Diamond. Yes.

595
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,859
56 carats to be exact.

596
00:46:11,861 --> 00:46:14,197
It was worn by Louis XVI.

597
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:17,367
And they called it
<i>Le Coeur de la Mer</i>.

598
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:19,703
- The "Heart of the Ocean."
- The "Heart of the Ocean." Yes.

599
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,877
It's overwhelming.

600
00:46:28,336 --> 00:46:30,005
Well, it's for royalty.

601
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:33,383
We are royalty, Rose.

602
00:46:37,387 --> 00:46:39,723
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't give you.

603
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:42,559
There's nothing I'd deny you...

604
00:46:43,226 --> 00:46:45,395
if you would not deny me.

605
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:51,901
Open your heart to me, Rose.

606
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:11,296
<font color="#878787">JACK</font>: Well, I've been on my own
since I was 15, since my folks died.

607
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:16,426
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country.

608
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:19,867
So, I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

609
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:22,557
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

610
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:30,083
Well, Rose, we've walked about
a mile around this boat deck and...

611
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:32,702
chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up...

612
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:36,446
but, I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

613
00:47:38,448 --> 00:47:40,450
- Mr. Dawson, I--
- Jack.

614
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:42,869
Jack.

615
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:46,539
I want to thank you for what you did.

616
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:51,294
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

617
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:52,962
You're welcome.

618
00:47:53,463 --> 00:47:54,464
Look.

619
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:58,443
<font color="#878787">I know what you must be thinking</font>:

620
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,236
"Poor little rich girl.

621
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:02,389
"What does she know about misery?"

622
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:03,640
No.

623
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:06,810
No, that's not what I was thinking.

624
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:08,395
What I was thinking was...

625
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,471
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

626
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:15,652
Well, I...

627
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:20,293
It was everything.
It was my whole world and...

628
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:21,957
all the people in it.

629
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,762
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

630
00:48:25,787 --> 00:48:27,622
powerless to stop it.

631
00:48:27,831 --> 00:48:29,833
God, look at that thing.

632
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:32,293
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

633
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:36,506
500 invitations have gone out.

634
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,509
All of Philadelphia society
will be there.

635
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:42,252
And all the while I feel I'm...

636
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:44,058
standing in the middle of
a crowded room,

637
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:47,183
screaming at the top of my lungs
and no one even looks up.

638
00:48:49,018 --> 00:48:50,019
Do you love him?

639
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:52,363
Pardon me?

640
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:54,149
Do you love him?

641
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:58,038
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

642
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,898
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

643
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,201
This is not a suitable conversation.

644
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:06,893
Why can't you
just answer the question?

645
00:49:09,372 --> 00:49:11,332
This is absurd.

646
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:12,997
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

647
00:49:13,022 --> 00:49:16,628
and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

648
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:20,191
and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

649
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:23,052
Jack. Mr. Dawson,
it's been a pleasure.

650
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:25,472
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

651
00:49:25,497 --> 00:49:26,442
And you've insulted me.

652
00:49:27,638 --> 00:49:29,017
Well, you deserved it.

653
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:30,393
- Right.
- Right.

654
00:49:33,396 --> 00:49:35,023
I thought you were leaving.

655
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,566
I am.

656
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:40,069
You are so annoying.

657
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:42,423
Wait.

658
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:46,626
I don't have to leave.
This is my part of the ship. You leave.

659
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,150
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

660
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,086
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

661
00:49:58,254 --> 00:50:00,590
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

662
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,301
Well...

663
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:06,596
These are rather good.

664
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:13,102
They're uh, very good, actually.

665
00:50:20,443 --> 00:50:22,111
Jack, this is exquisite work.

666
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:25,114
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

667
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:26,616
Paris?

668
00:50:27,909 --> 00:50:30,578
You do get around for a p--

669
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:37,850
- Well, a-a person of limited means.
- Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

670
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:43,299
Well, well, well.

671
00:50:47,637 --> 00:50:49,385
And these were drawn from life?

672
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:55,104
Well, that's one of the
good things about Paris.

673
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,291
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

674
00:51:03,278 --> 00:51:04,654
You liked this woman.

675
00:51:05,488 --> 00:51:07,657
You used her several times.

676
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:09,826
Well.

677
00:51:10,577 --> 00:51:12,495
She had beautiful hands, you see?

678
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:17,083
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

679
00:51:17,123 --> 00:51:19,836
No, no, no, no, no.
Just with her hands.

680
00:51:20,169 --> 00:51:22,839
She was a one-legged prostitute.

681
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:24,966
See?

682
00:51:27,343 --> 00:51:28,511
Oh.

683
00:51:31,514 --> 00:51:33,516
She had a good sense of humor though.

684
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:37,020
Oh and this lady...

685
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:41,464
She used to sit
at this bar every night...

686
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:43,440
wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

687
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:46,279
just waiting for her long, lost love.

688
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,365
We called her Madame Bijoux.

689
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:51,701
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

690
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:56,205
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

691
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:57,874
You do.

692
00:51:58,457 --> 00:51:59,709
You see people.

693
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,300
I see you.

694
00:52:03,963 --> 00:52:05,298
And?

695
00:52:06,674 --> 00:52:08,384
You wouldn't have jumped.

696
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:16,351
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

697
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,227
Rose has already done that.

698
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:21,397
Look, here comes that
vulgar "Brown" woman.

699
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:24,400
Quickly, get up
before she sits with us.

700
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:28,119
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

701
00:52:28,237 --> 00:52:29,739
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

702
00:52:29,906 --> 00:52:33,326
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

703
00:52:33,534 --> 00:52:36,579
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

704
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,250
Countess.

705
00:52:42,752 --> 00:52:45,588
So, you've not yet lit
the last four boilers?

706
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:47,935
No, I don't see the need.

707
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:49,935
We are making excellent time.

708
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:53,039
The press knows the size of Titanic.

709
00:52:53,064 --> 00:52:55,264
Now, I want them
to marvel at her speed.

710
00:52:55,556 --> 00:52:57,767
We must give them
something new to print.

711
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:03,362
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

712
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:08,634
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines

713
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:10,947
until they've been properly run in.

714
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:13,406
Of course I'm just a passenger.

715
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:16,035
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

716
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:19,320
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing...

717
00:53:19,345 --> 00:53:21,164
if we were to get into
New York on Tuesday night...

718
00:53:21,189 --> 00:53:23,793
and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

719
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:26,964
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

720
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:31,634
Good man.

721
00:53:32,302 --> 00:53:35,555
Well, after that, I worked on
a squid boat in Monterey.

722
00:53:35,972 --> 00:53:37,862
Then I went down to Los Angeles to the...

723
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:41,894
pier in Santa Monica and started doing
portraits there for 10 cents a piece.

724
00:53:42,645 --> 00:53:44,480
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

725
00:53:44,814 --> 00:53:48,317
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

726
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,072
Say, we'll go there sometime,
to that pier...

727
00:53:53,322 --> 00:53:55,491
even if we only ever
just talk about it.

728
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:58,661
No, we'll do it.
We'll drink cheap beer.

729
00:53:58,995 --> 00:54:01,250
We'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

730
00:54:02,182 --> 00:54:05,168
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

731
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:09,505
Now, but you'll have to do it like a real
cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

732
00:54:10,006 --> 00:54:12,633
You mean with one leg on each side?

733
00:54:12,675 --> 00:54:13,676
Yeah.

734
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,175
Can you show me?

735
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:17,096
Sure, if you like.

736
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:20,349
Teach me to ride like a man.

737
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,206
And chew tobacco like a man.

738
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,997
And spit like a man.

739
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:27,774
What, they didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

740
00:54:28,024 --> 00:54:29,192
No.

741
00:54:29,525 --> 00:54:31,534
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

742
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:33,730
Come on. I'll show you how, come on.

743
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:37,661
- Jack, no! Jack, no! Wait, Jack.
- Come on.

744
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:39,869
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

745
00:54:40,203 --> 00:54:41,871
Watch closely.

746
00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:45,505
That's disgusting.

747
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:46,677
All right, your turn.

748
00:54:49,114 --> 00:54:52,245
That was pitiful. Come on, you really
gotta hawk it back, you know.

749
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,218
Get some leverage to it.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

750
00:54:56,552 --> 00:54:58,640
- You see the range on that thing?
- Mm-hm.

751
00:54:59,388 --> 00:55:00,556
<i>Okay, go.</i>

752
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:06,247
- That was better. You have to work on it.
- Really?

753
00:55:06,272 --> 00:55:09,065
Really try to hawk it up and get some
body to it, you know. You gotta ...

754
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,324
<i>Mother.</i>

755
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:26,082
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

756
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,085
Charmed, I'm sure.

759

looked at him like an insect.</i>

760
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:47,103
<i>A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.</i>

761
00:55:47,436 --> 00:55:51,274
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

762
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:58,520
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

763
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:00,950
Shall we go dress, Mother?

764
00:56:02,145 --> 00:56:03,786
See you at dinner, Jack.

765
00:56:05,788 --> 00:56:06,942
Uh, son?

766
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,457
Son!

767
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:11,395
Do you have the slightest
comprehension of what you're doing?

768
00:56:12,295 --> 00:56:13,520
Not really.

769
00:56:13,629 --> 00:56:16,132
Well, you're about to go
into the snake pit.

770
00:56:18,551 --> 00:56:20,219
What are you planning to wear?

771
00:56:23,306 --> 00:56:25,308
I figured. Come on.

772
00:56:27,977 --> 00:56:32,789
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

773
00:56:32,898 --> 00:56:34,317
Pretty close.

774
00:56:37,987 --> 00:56:40,323
You shine up like a new penny.

775
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:53,836
Good evening, sir.

00:58:39,442 --> 00:58:42,945
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

784
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:58,544
Darling...

785
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:01,297
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

786
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:07,720
It's amazing. You could
almost pass for a gentleman.

787
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:10,139
Almost.

788
00:59:10,473 --> 00:59:11,891
Extraordinary.

789
00:59:24,464 --> 00:59:26,362
<i>Dear, its delightful to see you</i>

790
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:28,157
What a remarkable voyage this is.

791
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,825
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Completely lunatic.

792
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:33,579
There's the Countess of Rothes.

793
00:59:35,664 --> 00:59:38,667
And that's John Jacob Astor...

794
00:59:39,335 --> 00:59:41,003
the richest man on the ship.

795
00:59:41,253 --> 00:59:45,174
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

796
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:48,010
See how she's trying to hide it.

797
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,678
- Quite the scandal.
- Hmm.

798
00:59:50,327 --> 00:59:53,545
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

799
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:56,514
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

800
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,523
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

801
01:00:00,773 --> 01:00:04,110
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

802
01:00:04,622 --> 01:00:06,695
Very popular with the royals.

803
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:09,532
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.

804
01:00:09,865 --> 01:00:11,367
Why, thank you.

805
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:14,101
Care to escort a lady to dinner?

806
01:00:14,126 --> 01:00:15,371
Certainly.

807
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:18,707
Sweet pea? Sweet pea.

808
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:21,242
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?

809
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,215
Remember, they love money.
So, just pretend like you own a
gold mine and you're in the club.

810
01:00:28,384 --> 01:00:30,052
Hey, Astor.

811
01:00:30,886 --> 01:00:33,556
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

812
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:36,677
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

813
01:00:36,702 --> 01:00:38,120
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

814
01:00:38,144 --> 01:00:39,147
Well, Jack...

815
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:41,564
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

816
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,151
No, the Chippewa Falls
Dawsons, actually.

817
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:46,444
Oh, yes.

818
01:00:48,737 --> 01:00:52,741
<font color="#878787">OLD ROSE</font>: <i>He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.</i>

819
01:00:53,576 --> 01:00:55,744
<i>They assumed he was one of them.</i>

820
01:00:56,078 --> 01:00:59,248
<i>Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.</i>

821
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:03,752
<i>New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.</i>

822
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,840
<i>Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.</i>

823
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:11,906
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

824
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:13,345
I hear they're
quite good on this ship.

825
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:18,095
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

826
01:01:21,103 --> 01:01:23,939
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

827
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,525
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

828
01:01:26,775 --> 01:01:29,612
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

829
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:32,448
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

830
01:01:32,948 --> 01:01:36,227
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

831
01:01:36,252 --> 01:01:37,786
Not to impugn your work, sir.

832
01:01:48,631 --> 01:01:49,857
Are these all for me?

833
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:51,967
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

834
01:01:52,218 --> 01:01:54,220
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

835
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:57,004
Your ship is a wonder,
Mr. Andrews. Truly.

836
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:58,488
Thank you, Rose.

837
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,145
How do you take your caviar, sir?

838
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:06,649
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

839
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:11,153
And where exactly do you live,
Mr. Dawson?

840
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,573
Right now, my address
is the RMS Titanic.

841
01:02:14,823 --> 01:02:16,825
After that,
I'm on God's good humor.

842
01:02:17,536 --> 01:02:19,505
And how is it you have means to travel?

843
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:22,331
I work my way from place to place.

844
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:24,333
You know, tramp steamers and such.

845
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:28,337
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

846
01:02:28,587 --> 01:02:30,089
A very lucky hand.

847
01:02:31,006 --> 01:02:33,008
All life is a game of luck.

848
01:02:34,176 --> 01:02:37,096
A real man makes his own luck,
Archie. Right, Dawson?

849
01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:38,681
Mmm.

850
01:02:38,764 --> 01:02:42,601
And you find that sort of rootless
existence appealing, do you?

851
01:02:45,688 --> 01:02:47,273
Yes, ma'am, I do.

852
01:02:48,023 --> 01:02:51,026
I mean, I've got everything
I need right here with me.

853
01:02:51,277 --> 01:02:54,531
I got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

854
01:02:55,687 --> 01:02:59,248
I mean I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen or...

855
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:00,273
who I'm gonna meet.

856
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:02,288
Where I'm gonna wind up.

857
01:03:02,933 --> 01:03:04,769
Just the other night,
I was sleeping under a bridge

858
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:07,652
and now, here I am on
the grandest ship in the world,

859
01:03:07,677 --> 01:03:09,461
having champagne
with you fine people.

860
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:10,713
I'll take some more of that.

861
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:15,050
I figure life is a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

862
01:03:16,385 --> 01:03:18,887
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

863
01:03:19,221 --> 01:03:22,277
You learn to take life
as it comes at you. Here you go, Cal.

864
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:26,145
To make each day count.

865
01:03:26,979 --> 01:03:28,120
Well said, Jack.

866
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,315
Hear, hear.

867
01:03:30,316 --> 01:03:31,900
To making it count.

868
01:03:33,569 --> 01:03:35,237
<i>To making it count!</i>

869
01:03:35,738 --> 01:03:36,739
<i>Bravo.</i>

870
01:03:43,662 --> 01:03:46,915
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

871
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:52,362
So, he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating and he lights a fire.

872
01:03:56,258 --> 01:03:58,427
Next it'll be brandies
in the smoking room.

873
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:04,384
- Well, join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
- <i>What a good idea.</i>

874
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,479
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other...

875
01:04:07,504 --> 01:04:09,246
on being masters of the universe.

876
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:11,273
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

877
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:14,026
Rose, may I escort you
back to the cabin?

878
01:04:14,276 --> 01:04:15,277
No, I'll stay here.

879
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:17,337
Here you go, Molly.

880
01:04:18,113 --> 01:04:20,115
<font color="#878787">COL. ARCHIBALD</font>:
<i>Joining us, Dawson?</i>

881
01:04:20,449 --> 01:04:22,785
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

882
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:25,049
No, thanks,
I've got to be heading back.

883
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:25,636
<i>Ah.</i>

884
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:29,547
Probably best. It'll be all business
and politics, that sort of thing.

885
01:04:29,572 --> 01:04:30,578
Wouldn't interest you.

886
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,444
But Dawson, good of you to come.

887
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:41,303
Jack, must you go?

888
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:44,169
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

889
01:04:47,476 --> 01:04:48,811
Good night, Rose.

890
01:05:28,851 --> 01:05:31,353
So, you want to go to a real party?

891
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,444
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.

892
01:06:03,552 --> 01:06:05,554
I can't understand you.

893
01:06:32,247 --> 01:06:33,582
<font color="#878787">FABRIZIO</font>: <i>Bravo!</i>

894
01:06:37,836 --> 01:06:40,172
I'm gonna dance
with her now, all right?

895
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:41,340
Come on.

896
01:06:42,112 --> 01:06:44,120
Come on. Come with me.

897
01:06:44,145 --> 01:06:46,094
But... Jack.
Jack, wait.

898
01:06:48,764 --> 01:06:49,584
I can't do this.

899
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:51,742
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer.

900
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:52,935
Like this.

901
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:57,940
You're still my best girl, Cora.

902
01:07:01,193 --> 01:07:04,013
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I, just go with it.

903
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,198
Don't think.

904
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,970
Wait, Jack! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

905
01:07:33,141 --> 01:07:34,268
Bom, bom, bom.

906
01:07:37,813 --> 01:07:39,314
What? Wait!

907
01:08:20,522 --> 01:08:22,190
Jack, no.

908
01:08:28,015 --> 01:08:31,700
...beyond the jurisdiction of
the Sherman Act. So, my lawyers will argue.

909
01:08:32,034 --> 01:08:35,787
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

910
01:08:56,058 --> 01:08:59,227
What? You think a first-class
girl can't drink?

911
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:02,981
Get out of here.

912
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:04,900
You all right?

913
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:08,059
I'm fine.

914
01:09:08,387 --> 01:09:09,778
Two out of three.

915
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:12,407
So...

916
01:09:13,575 --> 01:09:15,577
you think you're big tough men?

917
01:09:16,912 --> 01:09:18,413
Let's see you do this.

918
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:23,418
Hold this for me, Jack.
Hold it up.

919
01:09:37,516 --> 01:09:39,017
- Ow!
- Whoa!

920
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,972
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

921
01:09:43,003 --> 01:09:43,987
Are you all right?

922
01:09:44,019 --> 01:09:45,440
I haven't done that in years.

923
01:09:53,532 --> 01:09:55,918
Come on, lads.
Give it all you got. Let's go.

924
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,645
Coffee, sir?

925
01:10:33,572 --> 01:10:35,240
I had hoped you would
come to me last night.

926
01:10:37,492 --> 01:10:38,994
I was tired.

927
01:10:41,496 --> 01:10:44,166
Your exertions below deck,
were no doubt, exhausting.

928
01:10:47,335 --> 01:10:50,839
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

929
01:10:51,173 --> 01:10:54,092
You will never behave like that again,
Rose, do you understand?

930
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,682
I'm not a foreman in one of
your mills that you can command.

931
01:11:02,184 --> 01:11:03,852
I'm your fiancée.

932
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,434
My fiancée. My fiancée!

933
01:11:08,645 --> 01:11:10,524
Yes, you are! And my wife!

934
01:11:11,324 --> 01:11:15,697
My wife in practice, if not yet
by law. So, you will honor me!

935
01:11:16,031 --> 01:11:18,784
You will honor me the way a wife
is required to honor her husband.

936
01:11:19,034 --> 01:11:21,286
Because I will not be
made out a fool, Rose.

937
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,955
Is this in any way unclear?

938
01:11:24,873 --> 01:11:26,041
No.

939
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:28,710
Good. Excuse me.

940
01:11:34,382 --> 01:11:36,051
Oh, Miss Rose.

941
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:39,529
We had a little accident.

942
01:11:39,554 --> 01:11:41,723
- That's all right, Miss Rose.
- Sorry, Trudy.

943
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,366
Let me help you.

944
01:11:43,391 --> 01:11:45,060
It's all right, miss.

945
01:11:51,566 --> 01:11:52,984
It's all right, miss.

946
01:11:58,573 --> 01:12:01,908
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

947
01:12:17,425 --> 01:12:20,595
You're not to see that boy again.
You understand me?

948
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:24,530
Rose, I forbid it.

949
01:12:25,267 --> 01:12:28,270
Oh, stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

950
01:12:28,603 --> 01:12:30,272
This is not a game.

951
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,442
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

952
01:12:34,776 --> 01:12:39,114
Of course I know it's gone.
You remind me every day.

953
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:45,036
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts, hidden by a good name.

954
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:47,956
That name is the only card
we have to play.

955
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:50,292
I don't understand you.

956
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:52,669
It is a fine match with Hockley.

957
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:54,963
It will ensure our survival.

958
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:57,966
How can you put this on my shoulders?

959
01:12:58,216 --> 01:13:00,133
Why are you being so selfish?

960
01:13:00,218 --> 01:13:02,053
I'm being selfish?

961
01:13:05,557 --> 01:13:08,476
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

962
01:13:10,312 --> 01:13:12,147
Is that what you want?

963
01:13:14,816 --> 01:13:17,652
To see our fine things
sold at auction?

964
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:21,577
Our memories scattered to the winds?

965
01:13:32,334 --> 01:13:34,002
It's so unfair.

966
01:13:35,337 --> 01:13:37,172
Of course it's unfair.

967
01:13:38,506 --> 01:13:39,841
We're women.

968
01:13:42,344 --> 01:13:44,512
Our choices are never easy.

969
01:13:51,686 --> 01:13:53,146

- Hello Jack.

978
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:56,040
I just need to talk to somebody
for a second.

979
01:14:56,065 --> 01:14:58,753
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
- I just need to speak to someone.

980
01:15:03,494 --> 01:15:05,235
I was just here last night,
you don't remember me?

981
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:07,336
No, I'm afraid I don't.
Now, you're gonna have to turn around.

982
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:10,392
He'll tell you.
I just need to talk--

983
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:13,945
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

984
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:16,604
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

985
01:15:16,938 --> 01:15:20,667
They asked me to give
you this in gratitude.

986
01:15:20,692 --> 01:15:22,585
I don't want your money.
Please, I just--

987
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:26,006
And also to remind you that
you hold a third-class ticket

988
01:15:26,031 --> 01:15:28,563
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

989
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,631
Please, I just want to speak
to Rose for one second.

990
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:34,821
Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs...

991
01:15:34,846 --> 01:15:36,039
and that he stays there.

992
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:38,351
Yes, sir.

993
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:39,297

1000
01:16:01,983 --> 01:16:05,320
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

1001
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:08,073
In fact, we're speeding up.

1002
01:16:08,156 --> 01:16:10,325
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

Okay, now, let it go.

1005
01:16:22,212 --> 01:16:23,766
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice.

<i>Mr. Andrews, forgive me.</i>

1008
01:16:34,849 --> 01:16:36,390
I did the sum in my head...

1009
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:40,396
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

1010
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:44,234
forgive me, but it seems that there
are not enough for everyone aboard.

1011
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:46,736
About half, actually.

1012
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,072
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

1013
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:52,075
In fact, I put in these
new-type davits...

1014
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:55,036
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

1015
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:57,705
But it was thought, by some...

1016
01:16:57,872 --> 01:16:59,457
the deck would look too cluttered.

1017
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:02,252
So, I was overruled.

1018
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:05,755
It's a waste of deck space as
it is on an unsinkable ship.

1019
01:17:06,089 --> 01:17:07,757
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

1020
01:17:07,882 --> 01:17:10,468
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

1021
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,428
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1022
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:15,765
Just keep heading aft. The next
stop will be the engine room.

1023
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:25,441
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

1024
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:28,611
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

1025
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:32,448
Jack. I'm engaged.

1026
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:35,285
I'm marrying Cal.

1027
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:37,245
I love Cal.

1028
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,124
Rose...

1029
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:46,129
you're no picnic. All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

1030
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:50,967
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding...

1031
01:17:51,301 --> 01:17:53,337
wonderful girl...

1032
01:17:53,362 --> 01:17:56,783
woman, that I've ever known and...
- Jack, I...

1033
01:17:56,808 --> 01:17:59,050
No, let me try and get this out.
You're ama...

1034
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:05,338
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1035
01:18:05,363 --> 01:18:06,941
I've got ten bucks in my pocket.

1036
01:18:06,972 --> 01:18:10,128
I have nothing to offer
you and I know that.

1037
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:11,550
I understand.

1038
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,449
But I'm too involved now.

1039
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:16,826
You jump, I jump. Remember?

1040
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,662
I can't turn away without
knowing you'll be all right.

1041
01:18:21,456 --> 01:18:22,457
That's all that I want.

1042
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,335
Well, I'm fine.

1043
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:29,005
I'll be fine. Really.

1044
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:31,174
Really?

1045
01:18:33,343 --> 01:18:34,844
I don't think so.

1046
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:38,211
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1047
01:18:38,236 --> 01:18:39,992
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

1048
01:18:40,017 --> 01:18:41,986
Maybe not right away
because you're strong, but...

1049
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:47,190
sooner or later that fire
that I love about you, Rose...

1050
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:50,026
...that fire is gonna burn out.

1051
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:56,658
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1052
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,370
You're right.

1053
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,373
Only you can do that.

1054
01:19:09,379 --> 01:19:10,880
I'm going back.

1055
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:12,715
Leave me alone.

had to be sent back, twice.

1058
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:31,891
Oh, my dear.

1059
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,569
And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

1060
01:19:33,594 --> 01:19:36,030
Let me tell you

Shh.

1074
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:32,628

Now, hold onto the railing.

- Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.
- I'm not.

- I trust you.

1084
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:23,679
All right...

1085
01:21:24,055 --> 01:21:25,556
open your eyes.

01:23:03,654 --> 01:23:05,212
6 hours to go.

1093
01:23:05,237 --> 01:23:07,793
Incredible. There's Smith and
he's standing there

1094
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:09,956
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1095
01:23:10,077 --> 01:23:13,080
Excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1096
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:16,459
26 years of experience
working against him.

1097
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:18,719
He figures anything big
enough to sink the ship -

1098
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,671
they're gonna see in time to turn.

1099
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:23,424
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1100
01:23:24,005 --> 01:23:25,635
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1101
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:29,138
Everything he knows is wrong.

1102
01:23:41,735 --> 01:23:43,778
It's quite proper, I assure you.

1103
01:23:43,819 --> 01:23:45,655
This is the sitting room.

1104
01:23:47,657 --> 01:23:49,158
- Will this light do?
- What?

1105
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:51,827
Don't artists need good light?

1106
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:54,267
That is true, but
I'm not used to working in...

1107
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:56,707
such horrible conditions.

1108
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,834
Monet!

1109
01:23:59,669 --> 01:24:02,338
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.

1110
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:04,674
<i>Look at his use of
color here. Isn't he great?</i>

1111
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:06,968
<i>I know. It's extraordinary.</i>

1112
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:12,807
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1113
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:16,143
Should we be expecting him
any time soon?

1114
01:24:16,644 --> 01:24:19,981
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1115
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:24,360
Whew. That's nice.

1116
01:24:24,569 --> 01:24:26,404
What is it, a sapphire?

1117
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:28,322
A diamond.

1118
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,408
A very rare diamond.

1119
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,831
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1120
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:39,542
Wearing this.

1121
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,043
All right.

1122
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:44,880
Wearing only this.

1123
01:25:19,845 --> 01:25:21,494
The last thing I need...

1124
01:25:21,519 --> 01:25:24,086
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1125
01:25:28,049 --> 01:25:29,267
As a paying customer...

1126
01:25:31,724 --> 01:25:33,420
I expect to get what I want.

1127
01:25:51,781 --> 01:25:54,575
Over on the bed. The couch.

1128
01:26:03,751 --> 01:26:04,923
Come. Lie down.

1129
01:26:08,255 --> 01:26:10,079
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Keep that.

1130
01:26:10,126 --> 01:26:11,801
Put your arm back the way it was.

1131
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:17,640
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1132
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:20,142
Right.

1133
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:23,312
Now, head down.

1134
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,817
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

1135
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:31,987
And try to stay still.

1136
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:52,508
So serious.

1137
01:27:33,883 --> 01:27:36,886
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

1138
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:44,226
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1139
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:47,229
He does landscapes.

1140
01:27:47,897 --> 01:27:50,065
- <i>Just relax your face.</i>
- Sorry.

1141
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:51,734
<i>No laughing.</i>

1142
01:28:22,765 --> 01:28:25,768
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1143
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:30,105
It was the most erotic
moment of my life...

1144
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:36,111
up until then, at least.

1145
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:38,405
So, what happened next?

1146
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:41,951
You mean, did we do it?

1147
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:46,789
<i>Sorry to disappoint you,
Mr. Bodine.</i>

1148
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:49,792
<i>Jack was very professional.</i>

1149
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:58,968
Thank you.

1150
01:29:07,101 --> 01:29:08,435
What are you doing?

1151
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:11,063
Will you put this
back in the safe for me?

1152
01:29:11,105 --> 01:29:12,273
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1153
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,613
Whew.

1154
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:25,494
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
- Of course.

1155
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,832
None of the stewards have seen her.

1156
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:33,627
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1157
01:29:33,711 --> 01:29:35,880
There's only so many places
she could be.

1158
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:37,840
Lovejoy, find her.

1159
01:29:55,149 --> 01:29:56,912
- Clear.
- Yes.

1160
01:29:58,193 --> 01:30:01,697
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1161
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:03,506
Like a mill pond.

1162
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:05,910
Not a breath of wind.

1163
01:30:07,036 --> 01:30:10,234
It will make the 'bergs
harder to see...

1164
01:30:10,259 --> 01:30:12,333
with no breaking water at the base.

1165
01:30:14,793 --> 01:30:16,128
Hmm.

1166
01:30:23,844 --> 01:30:24,845
Well, I'm off.

1167
01:30:24,929 --> 01:30:28,098
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr. Lightoller.

1168
01:30:28,849 --> 01:30:30,100
Yes, sir.

1169
01:30:41,403 --> 01:30:44,007
It's getting cold. You look nice.

1170
01:30:44,393 --> 01:30:45,407
<font color="#878787">LOVEJOY</font>: <i>Miss Rose?</i>

Come on, Jack!

No, wait. Wait,

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1175
01:31:21,902 --> 01:31:25,219
- Go Go. Down, down. Go, go, go!
- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

1176
01:31:30,922 --> 01:31:31,813
Bye.

1177
01:31:39,962 --> 01:31:41,296
Sorry.

1178
01:31:46,635 --> 01:31:48,303
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1179
01:31:58,605 --> 01:32:00,441
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1180
01:32:00,524 --> 01:32:02,360
Seems more like a cop.

1181
01:32:02,385 --> 01:32:03,610
I think he was.

1182
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:06,036
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1183
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:12,327
No, over here!

1184
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:13,829

1185
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,019
Now what?

1186
01:32:22,296 --> 01:32:23,630
What?

1187
01:32:28,844 --> 01:32:30,512
<i>More coal for number one, mate.</i>

1188
01:32:30,804 --> 01:32:33,307
Hold up? What are you two
doing down here?

1189
01:32:33,849 --> 01:32:34,850
You shouldn't be down here.

1190
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:36,375
It could be dangerous! Oi!

1191
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:41,648
Carry on!

1192
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:43,901
Don't mind us.
You're doing a great job!

1193
01:32:44,068 --> 01:32:45,569
Keep up the good work!

1194
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:03,837
<i>Ah. Look at what
we have here, huh?</i>

1195
01:33:22,064 --> 01:33:23,398
Thank you.

1196
01:33:35,077 --> 01:33:36,912
Where to, miss?

1197
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,748
To the stars.

1198
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,269
You nervous?

1199
01:34:02,729 --> 01:34:03,897
No.

1200
01:34:20,789 --> 01:34:22,791
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1201
01:34:46,815 --> 01:34:48,317
<i>It's bloody cold.</i>

1202
01:34:48,817 --> 01:34:52,321
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1203
01:34:53,655 --> 01:34:54,990
Bollocks!

1204
01:34:55,324 --> 01:34:56,992
Well, I can, all right?

1205
01:34:57,326 --> 01:34:59,453
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1206
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:01,496
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1207
01:35:02,164 --> 01:35:03,498
Well, I'll be on my rounds.

1208
01:35:04,458 --> 01:35:05,459
Cheerio.

1209
01:35:36,698 --> 01:35:38,033
You're trembling.

1210
01:35:40,494 --> 01:35:41,536
Don't worry.

1211
01:35:41,662 --> 01:35:43,413
I'll be all right.

1212
01:36:04,726 --> 01:36:06,561

Gotcha!

Did you see those guys' faces?

Did you see them?

1218
01:37:19,718 --> 01:37:21,553
When the ship docks...

1219
01:37:22,888 --> 01:37:24,639
I'm getting off with you.

1220
01:37:25,724 --> 01:37:27,059
This is crazy.

01:37:27,084 --> 01:37:30,062
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

That's why I trust it.

Oh, yes. Here, look at this.

1224
01:37:45,577 --> 01:37:47,579
Look at that, would you?

1225
01:37:47,913 --> 01:37:49,414
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1226
01:37:49,831 --> 01:37:54,169
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not.
If it's all the same to you, all right?

01:40:52,264 --> 01:40:53,431
Jesus!

1253
01:40:53,682 --> 01:40:55,017
Hard to port!

1254
01:40:55,042 --> 01:40:56,268
<i>Hard to port!</i>

1255
01:41:06,111 --> 01:41:07,571
<i>Get back!</i>

1256
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:38,393
Come on, let's go!

1257
01:41:38,418 --> 01:41:41,980
Get out of the door.
They're closing the doors! Get out!

1258
01:41:48,486 --> 01:41:50,822
Get out the door! Go!

1259
01:41:50,847 --> 01:41:54,159
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1260
01:42:03,835 --> 01:42:06,056
Go! Go!

1261
01:42:06,088 --> 01:42:08,006
Out! Out!

1262
01:42:22,687 --> 01:42:24,356
Oh, my God.

1263
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:26,524
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1264
01:42:26,858 --> 01:42:29,778
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

1265
01:42:33,865 --> 01:42:36,701
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1266
01:42:42,457 --> 01:42:44,125
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1267
01:42:45,043 --> 01:42:46,461
An iceberg, sir.

1268
01:42:47,545 --> 01:42:51,336
I put her hard to starboard and ran the
engines full astern, but it was too close.

1269
01:42:51,383 --> 01:42:53,551
I tried to port round it, but she hit.

1270
01:42:53,961 --> 01:42:57,055
- <font color="#878787">CAPT. SMITH</font>: <i>Close the watertight doors.</i>
- <i>Doors are closed, sir.</i>

1271
01:43:00,196 --> 01:43:02,393
- All stop.
- Aye, sir.

1272
01:43:10,735 --> 01:43:12,508
- Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1273
01:43:12,533 --> 01:43:13,141
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:43:24,582 --> 01:43:26,269
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here!

1275
01:43:27,152 --> 01:43:27,919
Come on...

1276
01:43:32,757 --> 01:43:35,593
Excuse me, why have the engines
stopped? I felt a shudder.

1277
01:43:35,844 --> 01:43:38,513
I shouldn't worry, madam.
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1278
01:43:38,667 --> 01:43:41,599
That's the shudder you felt.
May I bring you anything?

1279
01:43:42,434 --> 01:43:43,518
No, thank you.

1280
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,942
<i>So, now there's talk of
an iceberg. Did you see anything?</i>

1281
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:52,944
<i>I don't see anything now. Do you?</i>

1282
01:43:55,113 --> 01:43:58,283
If this is the direction the rats
are going, that's good enough for me.

1283
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:07,413
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1284
01:44:07,438 --> 01:44:10,180
- Yes, there is. I've been robbed.
- Get the Master-at-Arms.

1285
01:44:10,797 --> 01:44:12,932
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1286
01:44:16,968 --> 01:44:18,303
Hey, did I miss the fun?

1287
01:44:19,658 --> 01:44:20,549
Did you see what happened?

1288
01:44:20,574 --> 01:44:22,705
No. I missed it.
Apparently, it hit over there.

1289
01:44:24,309 --> 01:44:27,854
Boiler room 6 is flooded eight feet
above the plate and the mail hold is worse.

1290
01:44:27,879 --> 01:44:29,338
She's all buckled-in
in the forward hull.

1291
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:31,238
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1292
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:34,652
- Have you seen the damage in the mail hold?
- <font color="#878787">HUTCHINSON</font>: <i>No, she's already underwater.</i>

1293
01:44:35,236 --> 01:44:36,905
This is bad.

1294
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,825
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1295
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:43,995
I think they're very good, sir.

1296
01:44:46,831 --> 01:44:49,834
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1297
01:44:54,839 --> 01:44:57,008
We've been looking for you, miss.

1298
01:45:01,846 --> 01:45:02,931
<font color="#878787">ROSE</font>: <i>Here we go.</i>

1299
01:45:08,853 --> 01:45:10,271
Something serious has happened.

1300
01:45:11,856 --> 01:45:13,358
Yes, it has.

1301
01:45:14,859 --> 01:45:18,279
Indeed. Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1302
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:22,700
Now that one is back, I have a pretty
good idea where to find the other. Search him.

1303
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:24,044
<i>Take your coat off, son.</i>

1304
01:45:24,069 --> 01:45:25,029
- Now what?
- <i>Come on, now.</i>

1305
01:45:25,954 --> 01:45:30,294
Cal, what are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

1306
01:45:30,365 --> 01:45:32,435
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1307
01:45:33,122 --> 01:45:34,712
This is horseshit!

1308
01:45:35,982 --> 01:45:37,706
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1309
01:45:37,833 --> 01:45:39,737
- He couldn't have.
- <i>Of course he could.</i>

1310
01:45:39,762 --> 01:45:41,052
It's easy enough for a professional.

1311
01:45:41,077 --> 01:45:41,464
<i>Come on.</i>

1312
01:45:41,489 --> 01:45:43,805
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1313
01:45:44,055 --> 01:45:47,058
Perhaps he did it while you were
putting your clothes back on, dear.

1314
01:45:48,726 --> 01:45:51,305
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1315
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:51,729
Shut up.

1316
01:45:52,033 --> 01:45:54,065
<font color="#878787">LOVEJOY</font>: <i>It isn't even
your pocket. Is it, son?</i>

1317
01:45:54,315 --> 01:45:56,010
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1318
01:46:00,154 --> 01:46:01,872
That was reported stolen today.

1319
01:46:01,906 --> 01:46:03,716
I just borrowed it.
I was gonna return it.

1320
01:46:03,741 --> 01:46:06,077
An honest thief.
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1321
01:46:06,411 --> 01:46:08,580
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1322
01:46:09,414 --> 01:46:11,291
Don't you believe them, Rose.
You know it.

1323
01:46:11,316 --> 01:46:12,814
- You know I didn't do it.
- Come on son. Let's go, come on.

1324
01:46:12,839 --> 01:46:14,376
You know I didn't do it, Rose!

1325
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,908
Rose!

1326
01:46:14,933 --> 01:46:18,251
Come on, there's a good lad.
Come on, son. There's a good lad.

1327
01:46:18,564 --> 01:46:21,112
You know I didn't do it!
You know me!

1328
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:24,929
<font color="#878787">ISMAY</font>:
<i>This is most unfortunate, Captain.</i>

1329
01:46:28,433 --> 01:46:31,853
Water. 14 feet above
the keel in 10 minutes...

1330
01:46:32,103 --> 01:46:35,440
in the forepeak, in all three holds
and in Boiler Room 6.

1331
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:36,691
That's right, sir.

1332
01:46:36,941 --> 01:46:38,629
When can we get underway, damn it?

1333
01:46:38,654 --> 01:46:40,528
That's five compartments.

1334
01:46:42,447 --> 01:46:48,219
She can stay afloat with the first four
compartments breached, but not five.
Not five.

1335
01:46:48,852 --> 01:46:50,428
As she goes down by the head,

1336
01:46:50,453 --> 01:46:55,592
the water will spill over the tops
of the bulkheads at "E" deck,
from one to the next...

1337
01:46:55,617 --> 01:46:57,766
back and back.
There's no stopping it.

1338
01:46:58,758 --> 01:47:00,061
The pumps. We open the pumps...

1339
01:47:00,086 --> 01:47:02,906
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1340
01:47:03,948 --> 01:47:07,143
From this moment,
no matter what we do...

1341
01:47:07,179 --> 01:47:09,050
Titanic will founder.

1342
01:47:11,634 --> 01:47:13,036
But this ship can't sink.

1343
01:47:13,061 --> 01:47:15,897
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can.

1344
01:47:16,481 --> 01:47:17,482
And she will.

1345
01:47:18,316 --> 01:47:20,401
It is a mathematical certainty.

1346
01:47:24,822 --> 01:47:26,324
How much time?

1347
01:47:33,831 --> 01:47:36,334
An hour. Two, at most.

1348
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,425
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1349
01:47:44,842 --> 01:47:47,679
2,200 souls onboard, sir.

1350
01:47:54,352 --> 01:47:57,855
Well, I believe you may
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1351
01:48:15,373 --> 01:48:17,542
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1352
01:48:18,376 --> 01:48:20,267
You look at me
when I'm talking to you!

1353
01:48:20,795 --> 01:48:23,143
- <i>Mr. Hockley?</i>
- Not now. We're busy.

1354
01:48:23,214 --> 01:48:26,860
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to please put on your lifebelts
and come up to the boat deck.

1355
01:48:26,885 --> 01:48:28,034
I said, not now.

1356
01:48:28,059 --> 01:48:31,293
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1357
01:48:31,318 --> 01:48:33,366
Now please, dress warmly.

1358
01:48:33,391 --> 01:48:35,237
It's quite cold out tonight.

1359
01:48:36,153 --> 01:48:38,730
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?

1360
01:48:39,063 --> 01:48:40,898
This is ridiculous.

1361
01:48:41,566 --> 01:48:45,236
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1362
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:47,572
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1363
01:48:49,434 --> 01:48:50,965
What is he on about?

1364
01:48:51,743 --> 01:48:53,803
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
- What's the ruckus?

1365
01:48:53,828 --> 01:48:55,428
Just put your lifebelts on.

1366
01:48:56,414 --> 01:48:57,631
C.Q.D.?

1367
01:48:58,249 --> 01:48:59,417
Sir?

1368
01:49:01,085 --> 01:49:04,922
That's right, C.Q.D. The distress call.
That's our position.

1369
01:49:10,511 --> 01:49:14,766
Tell whoever responds that we're
going down by the head
and need immediate assistance.

1370
01:49:24,275 --> 01:49:25,610
Blimey.

1371
01:49:35,787 --> 01:49:37,622
Keep lowering!

1372
01:49:37,955 --> 01:49:39,957
Keep lowering!

1373
01:49:43,795 --> 01:49:47,632
Steady! Make it taut!
And winch out!

1374
01:49:51,469 --> 01:49:55,473
<i>Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!</i>

1375
01:49:55,807 --> 01:49:57,475
<i>Release those ties!</i>

1376
01:49:57,809 --> 01:50:00,311
Roll back that cover!
Smartly now!

1377
01:50:01,295 --> 01:50:03,170
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1378
01:50:03,217 --> 01:50:06,405
They've all gone back inside.
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1379
01:50:06,484 --> 01:50:10,822
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1380
01:50:25,002 --> 01:50:26,684
Care for a drink, sir?

1381
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:31,300
- <i>Please put your lifebelts on.</i>
- Hey, Sonny, what's doing?

1382
01:50:31,384 --> 01:50:34,262
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1383
01:50:34,512 --> 01:50:37,014
Sorry, ma'am.
Let me go and find out.

1384
01:50:37,682 --> 01:50:40,017
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1385
01:50:40,268 --> 01:50:43,187
It's just the goddamned English,
doing everything by the book.

1386
01:50:43,437 --> 01:50:46,190
There's no need
for language, Mr. Hockley.

1387
01:50:46,357 --> 01:50:48,734
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1388
01:50:48,776 --> 01:50:52,195
- I'd like a cup of tea when I return.
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

1389
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:03,040
Mr. Andrews...

1390
01:51:05,042 --> 01:51:08,379
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1391
01:51:08,713 --> 01:51:10,381
Please tell me the truth.

1392
01:51:18,556 --> 01:51:20,391
The ship will sink.

1393
01:51:22,143 --> 01:51:23,735
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1394
01:51:24,228 --> 01:51:29,066
In an hour or so, all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1395
01:51:30,685 --> 01:51:33,941
- What?
- Please, tell only who you must.

1396
01:51:33,966 --> 01:51:36,073
I don't want to be
responsible for a panic.

1397
01:51:36,407 --> 01:51:39,243
And get to a boat.
Quickly. Don't wait.

1398
01:51:39,911 --> 01:51:43,080
You remember what
I told you about the boats?

1399
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:46,751
Yes.

1400
01:51:48,586 --> 01:51:50,087
I understand.

1401
01:51:58,095 --> 01:51:59,430
Over here, son.

1402
01:52:00,673 --> 01:52:03,962
Sir, they need you up at
the second-class purser's office.
There's a big mob up there.

1403
01:52:04,102 --> 01:52:05,860
Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1404
01:52:06,437 --> 01:52:08,439
Aye. Right.

1405
01:52:22,119 --> 01:52:27,124
Sir! Carpathia says they're making
17 knots. Full steam for them, sir.

1406
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,754
She's the only one who's responding?

1407
01:52:30,779 --> 01:52:34,215
The only one close, sir.
Says they can be here in 4 hours.

1408
01:52:34,966 --> 01:52:36,634
Four hours?!

1409
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:43,140
Thank you, Bride.

1410
01:52:47,478 --> 01:52:49,146
My God.

1411
01:52:58,656 --> 01:53:00,658
Captain, we are swung out
and ready, sir.

1412
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:06,080
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1413
01:53:07,999 --> 01:53:10,144
- Yes, do that.
- Sir?

1414
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:16,340
Women and children first, yes.

1415
01:53:17,842 --> 01:53:19,176
Yes, sir.

1416
01:53:22,013 --> 01:53:25,270
<font color="#878787">LIGHTOLLER</font>: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!</i>

1417
01:53:25,567 --> 01:53:27,848
Step this way, please. That's right.

1418
01:53:28,114 --> 01:53:30,855
Come towards me. Thank you.

1419
01:53:31,856 --> 01:53:32,857
Good.

1420
01:53:33,107 --> 01:53:37,361
For the time being, I shall
require only women and children.

1421
01:53:37,862 --> 01:53:39,030
- <i>Gentlemen, please.</i>
- <i>Right here.</i>

1422
01:53:39,697 --> 01:53:43,701
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1423
01:53:44,702 --> 01:53:46,037
"Wedding Dance."

1424
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:57,048
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1425
01:53:57,381 --> 01:54:00,051
Put your lifebelts on. Yeah.
Put your lifebelt on.

1426
01:54:00,384 --> 01:54:03,387
Here, come on. Put that
lifebelt on. Turn it around.

1427
01:54:08,726 --> 01:54:11,062
It isn't time to go up
to the boats yet!

1428
01:54:11,395 --> 01:54:13,064
Please, stay calm.

1429
01:54:13,397 --> 01:54:16,900
Make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

1430
01:54:16,925 --> 01:54:19,753
And, gentlemen, allow the women
and children through to the front.

1431
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:21,050
What are we doing, Mommy?

1432
01:54:21,155 --> 01:54:24,926
We're just waiting, dear. When they finish
putting first-class people in the boats,

1433
01:54:24,982 --> 01:54:27,545
they will be starting with us
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1434
01:54:28,996 --> 01:54:31,248
<i>Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.</i>

1435
01:54:31,582 --> 01:54:32,917
- <i>Someone help.</i>
- Go and get some help.

1436
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:37,254
Lower it away,
left and right together! Steady.

1437
01:54:38,127 --> 01:54:40,925
Both sides together! Steady!

1438
01:54:41,258 --> 01:54:42,627
Steady!

1439
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,095
Steady!

1440
01:54:45,596 --> 01:54:47,598
Stop, stop, stop!

1441
01:54:48,432 --> 01:54:49,600
Hold the left side!

1442
01:54:49,934 --> 01:54:52,436
<i>Right side only! Right side only!</i>

1443
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:53,938
Right side only!

1444
01:54:53,963 --> 01:54:58,109
Hold the left! Right side down!
Lower away together!

1445
01:55:00,277 --> 01:55:01,946
Steady, lads!

1446
01:55:49,326 --> 01:55:52,830
You know, I do believe
this ship may sink.

1447
01:55:54,832 --> 01:55:59,025
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1448
01:56:02,006 --> 01:56:04,675
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1449
01:56:11,432 --> 01:56:14,101
Come on, sister, you heard the man.
Into the boat.

1450
01:56:14,435 --> 01:56:16,665
Any room for a gentleman,
now gentlemen?

1451
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:18,105
<i>Only women at this time, sir.</i>

1452
01:56:21,442 --> 01:56:23,978
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1453
01:56:25,738 --> 01:56:28,449
I hope they're not too crowded.

1454
01:56:29,241 --> 01:56:31,076
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1455
01:56:31,952 --> 01:56:33,347
Don't you understand?

1456
01:56:33,621 --> 01:56:35,909
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1457
01:56:36,003 --> 01:56:37,249
Not enough by half.

1458
01:56:38,125 --> 01:56:40,628
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1459
01:56:40,847 --> 01:56:42,588
Not the better half.

1460
01:56:44,378 --> 01:56:45,737
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1461
01:56:46,091 --> 01:56:47,968
First-class seats are right up here.

1462
01:56:49,136 --> 01:56:50,971
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1463
01:56:51,096 --> 01:56:52,681
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1464
01:56:56,644 --> 01:56:59,313
You unimaginable bastard.

1465
01:56:59,906 --> 01:57:02,107
<font color="#878787">MOLLY</font>: <i>Come on, Rose darling.

Come on, Rose.

1467
01:57:05,528 --> 01:57:07,154
You're next, darling.

1468
01:57:07,488 --> 01:57:08,656
Come into the boat, Rose.

1470
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:13,381
Rose?

1471
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,810
Get into the boat!

1472
01:57:16,623 --> 01:57:17,428
Rose?

1473
01:57:19,291 --> 01:57:20,459
Good-bye, Mother.

1474
01:57:22,537 --> 01:57:23,435
Rose!

1475
01:57:24,154 --> 01:57:26,014
- <i>Rose, come back here.</i>
- Where are you going?

1476
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:27,841
To him?!

1477
01:57:28,261 --> 01:57:30,302
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?

1478
01:57:31,512 --> 01:57:33,847
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

1479
01:57:36,393 --> 01:57:37,080
No!

1480
01:57:37,494 --> 01:57:38,065
No!

1481
01:57:39,276 --> 01:57:40,705
I said, no!

1482
01:57:42,356 --> 01:57:44,440
<font color="#878787">RUTH</font>: <i>Rose! Please stop!</i>

1483

- No! Rose!

1484
01:57:48,698 --> 01:57:49,549
No, Wait!

1485
01:57:49,574 --> 01:57:50,739
<i>Lower away!</i>

1486
01:57:51,112 --> 01:57:52,831
- Rose!
- <i>Lower together!</i>

1487
01:57:53,367 --> 01:57:54,743
Hold the left side!

1488
01:57:58,664 --> 01:57:59,665
Help!

1489
01:58:00,541 --> 01:58:02,668
Can anybody hear me?!

1490
01:58:04,044 --> 01:58:05,943
Hello! Help me!

1491
01:58:06,547 --> 01:58:07,548
<i>Help me!</i>

1492
01:58:08,382 --> 01:58:10,384
Can you hear me?!

1493
01:58:10,718 --> 01:58:14,722
Can anybody hear me?!
Somebody help me!

1494

<font color="#878787">ROSE</font>: <i>Mr. Andrews?!</i>

1495
01:58:21,061 --> 01:58:23,230
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1496
01:58:23,522 --> 01:58:26,025
Madame, please, put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1497
01:58:26,567 --> 01:58:29,194
Lucy, for God's sake, put on
a lifebelt and set a good example.

1498
01:58:29,278 --> 01:58:30,279
Yes sir.

1499
01:58:30,904 --> 01:58:32,239
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

1500
01:58:32,573 --> 01:58:34,408
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1501
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:37,059
Where would the Master-at-Arms
take someone under arrest?

1502
01:58:37,207 --> 01:58:39,596
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1503
01:58:39,621 --> 01:58:40,253
No!

1504
01:58:40,278 --> 01:58:42,534
I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

1505
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:44,081
But without will take longer.

1506
01:58:46,144 --> 01:58:49,252
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left...

1507
01:58:49,277 --> 01:58:50,611
down the crewmen's passage,

1508
01:58:50,636 --> 01:58:53,135
then go right and left
again at the stairs.

1509
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:54,553
You'll come to a long corridor.

1510
01:58:59,433 --> 01:59:01,060
This could be bad.

1511
01:59:04,938 --> 01:59:07,542
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1512
01:59:12,946 --> 01:59:14,948
Excuse me. Thank you.

1513
01:59:18,452 --> 01:59:21,455
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1514
01:59:22,289 --> 01:59:24,996
I'm through being polite, goddamnit!

1515
01:59:25,043 --> 01:59:26,335
Now take me down!

1516
01:59:27,628 --> 01:59:28,962
"E" deck.

1517
01:59:32,299 --> 01:59:33,634
Come on.

1518
01:59:34,093 --> 01:59:35,427
Come on, come on.

1519
01:59:53,278 --> 01:59:54,613
I'm going back up.

1520
01:59:54,655 --> 01:59:56,824
No! No! No!

1521
02:00:00,994 --> 02:00:02,830
Come back! I'm going back up!

1522
02:00:03,163 --> 02:00:04,246
I'm going back up!

1523
02:00:13,173 --> 02:00:14,174
Crew passage.

1524
02:00:37,531 --> 02:00:38,532
Jack!

1525
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,492
Jack!

1526
02:00:48,333 --> 02:00:49,334
Jack!

1527
02:00:50,669 --> 02:00:52,654
- Jack!
- Rose!

1528
02:00:54,083 --> 02:00:54,673
Jack!

1529
02:00:54,757 --> 02:00:56,175
Rose, I'm in here!

1530
02:00:56,759 --> 02:00:57,927
<i>I'm in here!</i>

1531
02:00:57,951 --> 02:00:58,611
Jack!

1532
02:00:58,635 --> 02:00:59,720
<i>I'm in here!</i>

1533
02:01:00,137 --> 02:01:01,680
- Jack! Jack!
- Rose!

1534
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:03,932
Jack! I'm sorry.

1535
02:01:04,266 --> 02:01:06,602
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1536
02:01:07,603 --> 02:01:09,077
That guy, Lovejoy,
put it in my pocket.

1537
02:01:09,102 --> 02:01:11,148
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1538
02:01:11,173 --> 02:01:12,648
Listen, Rose...

1539
02:01:12,673 --> 02:01:14,651
you're gonna have to find
the spare key, all right?

1540
02:01:14,693 --> 02:01:16,618
Look in that cabinet right there.

1541
02:01:17,571 --> 02:01:19,490
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1542
02:01:22,075 --> 02:01:23,577
These are all brass ones!

1543
02:01:24,453 --> 02:01:25,954
Check right here, Rose.

1544
02:01:30,542 --> 02:01:31,543
Rose...

1545
02:01:32,878 --> 02:01:34,463
how'd you find out I didn't do it?

1546
02:01:35,298 --> 02:01:36,423
I didn't.

1547
02:01:36,469 --> 02:01:38,050
I just realized I already knew.

1548
02:01:40,636 --> 02:01:41,637
Keep looking.

1549
02:01:50,979 --> 02:01:52,022
No key.

1550
02:01:52,564 --> 02:01:53,565
There's no key!

1551
02:01:53,649 --> 02:01:54,650
All right, Rose, listen.

1552
02:01:54,983 --> 02:01:56,360
You're gonna have
to go find some help.

1553
02:01:57,464 --> 02:01:58,378
It'll be all right.

1554
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:05,077
I'll be right back.

1555
02:02:12,668 --> 02:02:14,503
I'll just wait here!

1556
02:02:27,485 --> 02:02:29,017
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1557
02:02:30,071 --> 02:02:31,228
Hello?

1558
02:02:31,854 --> 02:02:33,480
Is there anybody down here?

1559
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:37,276
We need help! Hello?

1560
02:02:38,193 --> 02:02:39,329
Damn it!

1561
02:02:45,701 --> 02:02:49,782
Can anybody hear me, please?!
Hello?! Hello?!

1562
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:52,875
Oh, thank God.

1563
02:02:53,095 --> 02:02:54,392
Wait, please, I need your help.

1564
02:02:54,417 --> 02:02:56,128
There's a man back here and he's--

1565
02:02:56,503 --> 02:02:57,504
Wait!

1566
02:03:01,717 --> 02:03:03,429
Hello?!

1567
02:03:28,827 --> 02:03:30,005
Hello?

1568
02:03:31,161 --> 02:03:32,831
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1569
02:03:32,856 --> 02:03:34,333
- I need your help.
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.

1570
02:03:34,407 --> 02:03:36,797
There's a man down here
and he's trapped.

1571
02:03:36,826 --> 02:03:38,214
- This way, yes. All right.
- Please!

1572
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:40,339
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

1573
02:03:40,364 --> 02:03:42,402
You're going the wrong way!

1574
02:03:42,427 --> 02:03:44,239
Let go of me! Listen!!!

1575
02:03:49,587 --> 02:03:50,682
To hell with you.

1576
02:04:28,637 --> 02:04:30,138
Oh, my God.

1577
02:05:18,437 --> 02:05:19,438
Jack!

1578
02:05:20,272 --> 02:05:21,273
Rose!

1579
02:05:22,342 --> 02:05:23,775
Will this work?

1580
02:05:24,693 --> 02:05:26,277
I guess we'll find out.

1581
02:05:26,339 --> 02:05:27,446
Come on.

1582
02:05:30,532 --> 02:05:31,980
Wait, wait, wait.

1583
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,948
Try a couple
of practice swings over there.

1584
02:05:39,308 --> 02:05:40,808
Good.

1585
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:43,605
Now try to hit the same
mark again, Rose. You can do it.

1586
02:05:49,718 --> 02:05:52,871
Okay. That's enough practice.
Come on, Rose.

1587
02:05:52,902 --> 02:05:53,902
You can do it.

1588
02:05:54,512 --> 02:05:57,893
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1589
02:05:59,269 --> 02:06:00,562
Come on. Wait.

1590
02:06:00,645 --> 02:06:02,898
Open your hands up a little more.

1591
02:06:03,418 --> 02:06:04,887
- Like that?
- <i>Right.</i>

1592
02:06:05,567 --> 02:06:07,871
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1593
02:06:12,574 --> 02:06:13,575
Go.

1594
02:06:19,915 --> 02:06:20,957
You did it!

1595
02:06:21,583 --> 02:06:22,918
Come on. Let's go.

1596
02:06:23,222 --> 02:06:26,197
Oh shit, this is cold! Oh, shit!

1597
02:06:26,222 --> 02:06:27,878
Shit! Shit!

1598
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:34,625
<i>This is the way out.</i>

1599
02:06:35,375 --> 02:06:37,704
We have to find
another way. Come on.

1600
02:06:40,811 --> 02:06:41,812
<i>Pull.</i>

1601
02:06:42,854 --> 02:06:43,855
<i>Put your backs into it.</i>

1602
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:50,821
<i>Pull!</i>

1603
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:54,616
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1604
02:07:16,471 --> 02:07:19,307
<i>What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.</i>

1605
02:07:19,432 --> 02:07:21,539
<i>We need the room.
Get rid of that. Out.</i>

1606
02:07:22,394 --> 02:07:25,397
This way.
Let go, sir. Get back.

1607
02:07:25,883 --> 02:07:26,982
Keep calm!

1608
02:07:34,322 --> 02:07:35,633
Lovejoy!

1609
02:07:35,699 --> 02:07:37,701
She's not on
the starboard side either.

1610
02:07:37,993 --> 02:07:42,315
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1611
02:07:42,664 --> 02:07:44,752
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1612
02:07:45,333 --> 02:07:46,626
Well then, that's our play.

1613
02:07:47,403 --> 02:07:49,715
We'll need some insurance first.
Come on.

1614
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:52,424
Come on. This way, please.
All the way down here.

1615
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:56,511
Here!

1616
02:07:57,393 --> 02:07:59,014
What do you think you're doing?

1617
02:07:59,514 --> 02:08:01,516
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1618
02:08:01,862 --> 02:08:03,977
That's White Star Line property.

1619
02:08:04,002 --> 02:08:05,353
Shut up!

1620
02:08:06,188 --> 02:08:09,065
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...

1621
02:08:10,192 --> 02:08:11,234
Sit down!

1622
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:12,903
She's the last.

1623
02:08:13,069 --> 02:08:14,821
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lightoller.

1624
02:08:14,988 --> 02:08:17,301
Why are the boats being
launched half full?

1625
02:08:17,348 --> 02:08:18,200
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1626
02:08:18,225 --> 02:08:21,942
There, look. 20 or so
in a boat built for 65?

1627
02:08:21,989 --> 02:08:24,504
And I saw one boat with only twelve.
Twelve!

1628
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:27,410
Well, we weren't sure
of the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1629
02:08:27,459 --> 02:08:29,020
These boats may buckle.

1630
02:08:29,051 --> 02:08:30,198
Rubbish!

1631
02:08:30,223 --> 02:08:32,714
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1632
02:08:32,739 --> 02:08:35,754
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake man!

1633
02:08:42,891 --> 02:08:45,727
Please, I need more women
and children, please!

1634
02:08:51,066 --> 02:08:52,300
<i>Get back in there!</i>

1635
02:08:52,362 --> 02:08:55,070
This is not an exit.
This is not an exit.

1636
02:08:57,656 --> 02:08:59,491
You can't keep us locked
in here like animals.

1637
02:08:59,547 --> 02:09:00,971
The ship's bloody sinking.

1638
02:09:01,576 --> 02:09:03,578
Bring forward the women!

1639
02:09:03,643 --> 02:09:04,956
Unlock the gates.

1640
02:09:06,362 --> 02:09:08,250
Women only!

1641
02:09:08,862 --> 02:09:10,784
No men!

1642
02:09:11,112 --> 02:09:12,300
No men!

1643
02:09:16,925 --> 02:09:18,802
Get back!

1644
02:09:20,095 --> 02:09:21,179
Get back!

1645
02:09:21,263 --> 02:09:22,809
Lock the gates!

1646
02:09:23,293 --> 02:09:25,215
Get them back from those gates!

1647
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,477
Don't touch the gates!

1648
02:09:31,278 --> 02:09:32,582
For God's sake, man...

1649
02:09:32,607 --> 02:09:34,481
there are women
and children down here!

1650
02:09:34,668 --> 02:09:36,778
Let us up, so we can have a chance!

1651
02:09:37,554 --> 02:09:38,822
<i>Get back!</i>

1652
02:09:42,367 --> 02:09:43,702
- Jack!
- <i>Tommy!</i>

1653
02:09:43,785 --> 02:09:45,595
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1654
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:47,319
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

1655
02:09:47,872 --> 02:09:48,873
Jack!

1656
02:09:49,291 --> 02:09:50,292
Fabrizio!

1657
02:09:50,792 --> 02:09:52,669
The boats are all gone.

1658
02:09:52,694 --> 02:09:54,573
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1659
02:09:54,598 --> 02:09:56,223
- There is <i>niente</i> this way.
- All right.

1660
02:09:56,631 --> 02:09:58,504
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

1661
02:10:03,972 --> 02:10:05,633
I make my own luck.

1662
02:10:05,658 --> 02:10:06,975
So do I.

1663
02:10:14,816 --> 02:10:16,151
Come on!

1664
02:10:16,549 --> 02:10:17,908
No, come on,
let's go this way.

1665
02:10:27,245 --> 02:10:28,413
This way!

1666
02:10:28,899 --> 02:10:31,249
Just go back to the main stairwell

1667
02:10:31,274 --> 02:10:33,227
and everything will be
sorted out there.

1668
02:10:34,586 --> 02:10:36,586
It will all get
sorted out back there.

1669
02:10:36,611 --> 02:10:38,399
Go back to the main stairwell.

1670
02:10:38,446 --> 02:10:40,233
- Open the gate!
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1671
02:10:40,258 --> 02:10:41,664
Open the gate right now!

1672
02:10:41,689 --> 02:10:44,008
Go back down the main stairwell,
like I told you.

1673
02:10:46,181 --> 02:10:49,211
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1674
02:10:49,258 --> 02:10:51,430
- <font color="#878787">STEWARD</font>: <i>Stop that!</i>
- <i>Open the darn gate!</i>

1675
02:10:55,207 --> 02:10:57,879
- <i>Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand here.</i>
- Move aside. Move aside.

1676
02:10:57,904 --> 02:10:58,795
<i>Come on, pull!</i>

1677
02:10:59,951 --> 02:11:00,862
Pull!

1678
02:11:01,863 --> 02:11:03,286
Move aside. Quickly, move aside!

1679
02:11:03,311 --> 02:11:04,341
<font color="#878787">STEWARD</font>: <i>Put that down!</i>

1680
02:11:04,389 --> 02:11:05,848
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1681
02:11:05,873 --> 02:11:08,176
One! Two!

1682
02:11:08,201 --> 02:11:09,120
Three!

1683
02:11:11,373 --> 02:11:12,540
Again!

1684
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:15,585
<i>Now, let's go!</i>

1685
02:11:17,921 --> 02:11:18,963
Let's go, Rose.

1686
02:11:19,047 --> 02:11:21,216
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

1687
02:11:27,555 --> 02:11:29,582
<i>Keep order! Keep order here!</i>

1688
02:11:29,724 --> 02:11:32,560
Back! Back! Back! Back!

1689
02:11:37,301 --> 02:11:38,149
<i>Hold on to her!</i>

1690
02:11:39,734 --> 02:11:40,777
<i>Pull her in!</i>

1691
02:11:41,736 --> 02:11:46,741
Get back, I say...
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1692
02:11:46,806 --> 02:11:48,291
Keep order here!

1693
02:11:49,577 --> 02:11:51,746
Keep order, I say.

1694
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:54,962
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1695
02:11:59,254 --> 02:12:03,525
<font color="#878787">LOWE</font>: <i>Right. Is everybody all right?
Nobody panic.</i>

1696
02:12:09,597 --> 02:12:10,996
<i>Stay back.</i>

1697
02:12:11,766 --> 02:12:12,934
We're too late.

1698
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:16,714
There are more boats down the front.
Stay with this one. Murdoch.

1699
02:12:16,746 --> 02:12:18,064
He seems to be quite practical.

1700
02:12:22,777 --> 02:12:24,279
<font color="#878787">BARRETT</font>: <i>Don't lower it!</i>

1701
02:12:24,779 --> 02:12:26,781
<i>Cut the falls!</i>

1702
02:12:32,287 --> 02:12:34,122
<i>Sit down!</i>

1703
02:12:35,457 --> 02:12:36,875
Stay back, you lot!

1704
02:12:37,125 --> 02:12:40,547
Stay back, the lot of you!
Stay back!

1705
02:12:42,964 --> 02:12:45,633
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1706
02:12:47,302 --> 02:12:48,636
Mr. Murdoch?

1707
02:12:48,970 --> 02:12:51,641
Mr. Hockley.
You two, with me, now!

1708
02:12:51,723 --> 02:12:53,308
I'm a businessman, as you know,

1709
02:12:53,475 --> 02:12:55,059
I have a business
proposition for you.

1710
02:13:02,817 --> 02:13:03,985
<font color="#878787">JACK</font>: <i>Come on, Rose.</i>

1711
02:13:07,489 --> 02:13:08,805
The boats are gone!

1712
02:13:14,162 --> 02:13:16,164
Colonel, are there any boats
on that side?

1713
02:13:16,195 --> 02:13:18,600
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1714
02:13:18,625 --> 02:13:20,210
This way, I'll lead you.

1715
02:13:26,424 --> 02:13:29,761
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1716
02:13:29,833 --> 02:13:31,554
Well, they don't listen
to us at dinner, either.

1717
02:13:32,083 --> 02:13:34,224
Come on, let's play.
Keep us warm.

1718
02:13:35,016 --> 02:13:36,351
"Orpheus."

1719
02:13:41,189 --> 02:13:44,349
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1720
02:13:49,714 --> 02:13:51,183
Where is everyone?

1721
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:52,948
They're all still aft, sir.

1722
02:13:55,105 --> 02:13:57,573
We have an understanding,
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1723
02:14:08,875 --> 02:14:12,720
Will the men please hold back!
Hold back, I say!

1724
02:14:15,056 --> 02:14:17,850
Women and children only!

1725
02:14:19,593 --> 02:14:20,475
Get back, sir!

1726
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:23,046
Come through, madame.
This way. Step back, sir!

1727
02:14:24,421 --> 02:14:27,235
You better check the other side. Go!

1728
02:14:34,576 --> 02:14:37,289
I found her, on the other side.

1729
02:14:37,314 --> 02:14:38,720
Waiting for a boat.

1730
02:14:38,745 --> 02:14:39,998
With him.

1731
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:43,039
Any more women and children?

1732
02:14:43,064 --> 02:14:44,180
They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1733
02:14:44,205 --> 02:14:45,920
Anyone else then?

1734
02:14:47,345 --> 02:14:49,314
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

1735
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:57,098
Ugh, goddamn it all to hell.

1736
02:14:59,767 --> 02:15:00,867
Shit.

1737
02:15:00,898 --> 02:15:02,133
<i>Fire!</i>

1738
02:15:03,101 --> 02:15:05,732
Sir, sir, you can't
go through here.

1739
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:11,696
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1740
02:15:15,617 --> 02:15:17,285
<font color="#878787">MURDOCH</font>: <i>Prepare to lower.</i>

1741
02:15:19,454 --> 02:15:21,289
Ready on the left.

1742
02:15:27,211 --> 02:15:28,880
Take them down.

1743
02:15:33,718 --> 02:15:35,053
Keep it steady.

1744
02:15:37,722 --> 02:15:41,643
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1745
02:15:42,685 --> 02:15:44,840
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1746
02:15:45,012 --> 02:15:47,699
<font color="#878787">FATHER</font>: <i>It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.</i>

1747
02:15:47,746 --> 02:15:49,730
Daddy, get in the boat.

1748
02:15:49,777 --> 02:15:53,121
It's good-bye for a little
while. Only for a little while.

1749
02:15:53,215 --> 02:15:54,855
There'll be another
boat for the daddies...

1750
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,746
This boat is for the
mommies and the children.

1751
02:15:56,793 --> 02:15:59,089
You hold Mommy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1752
02:16:00,119 --> 02:16:01,620
I'm not going without you.

1753
02:16:01,704 --> 02:16:03,511
No, you have to go, now.

1754
02:16:03,589 --> 02:16:04,374
No, Jack.

1755
02:16:04,499 --> 02:16:06,033
Get in the boat, Rose.

1756
02:16:06,058 --> 02:16:07,236
No, Jack.

1757
02:16:07,261 --> 02:16:08,308
Yes.

1758
02:16:08,386 --> 02:16:09,212
Get on the boat!

1759
02:16:09,295 --> 02:16:11,631
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1760
02:16:14,467 --> 02:16:15,986
Oh my God, look at you.

1761
02:16:16,011 --> 02:16:17,720
You look a fright.

1762
02:16:17,804 --> 02:16:18,805
Here.

1763
02:16:20,556 --> 02:16:22,725
Put this on. Come.

1764
02:16:28,326 --> 02:16:29,982
Go on.
I'll get the next one.

1765
02:16:30,045 --> 02:16:32,316
No, not without you.

1766
02:16:32,341 --> 02:16:34,420
<i>I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.</i>

1767
02:16:34,451 --> 02:16:36,685
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1768
02:16:36,716 --> 02:16:37,763
Now, go on. Get on.

1769
02:16:38,201 --> 02:16:40,420
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

1770
02:16:40,498 --> 02:16:41,951
Jack and I can get off safely.

1771
02:16:42,576 --> 02:16:43,466
Both of us.

1772
02:16:44,414 --> 02:16:45,732
See?

1773
02:16:45,763 --> 02:16:47,076
I got my own boat to catch.

1774
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:48,418
<font color="#878787">CAL</font>: <i>Go on, hurry.</i>

1775
02:16:49,091 --> 02:16:50,232
They're almost full.

1776
02:16:51,421 --> 02:16:52,973
- Step aboard, miss.
- Go. Go.

1777
02:16:52,998 --> 02:16:53,748
Come on, hurry.

1778
02:16:54,607 --> 02:16:55,810
Step aboard, please.

1779
02:16:55,835 --> 02:16:57,138
<i>You're daddy's
good girl, all right?</i>

1780
02:16:57,654 --> 02:16:58,732
<i>You're my little sailor.</i>

1781
02:17:02,765 --> 02:17:03,993
Clear the rail, please.

1782
02:17:05,435 --> 02:17:07,102
And, lower away!

1783
02:17:20,533 --> 02:17:21,868
You're a good liar.

1784
02:17:22,618 --> 02:17:24,454
Almost as good as you.

1785
02:17:29,125 --> 02:17:32,795
There's no...
There's no arrangement, is there?

1786
02:17:34,130 --> 02:17:35,361
No, there is.

1787
02:17:35,965 --> 02:17:38,134
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1788
02:17:40,052 --> 02:17:41,439
I always win, Jack.

1789
02:17:42,923 --> 02:17:44,298
One way or another.

1790
02:18:42,615 --> 02:18:43,658
Rose!

1791
02:18:46,035 --> 02:18:46,974
<font color="#878787">CAL</font>: <i>Stop her!</i>

- <font color="#878787">CAL</font>: <i>Stop her!</i>

1793
02:18:50,873 --> 02:18:51,874
No!

1794
02:19:14,785 --> 02:19:17,645
Rose! You're so stupid!
Why did you do that, huh?

1795
02:19:18,035 --> 02:19:19,902
You're so stupid, Rose.

1796
02:19:21,145 --> 02:19:22,905
Why did you do that? Why?!

1797
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:26,242
You jump, I jump, right?

1798
02:19:28,077 --> 02:19:29,120
Right.

1799
02:19:31,442 --> 02:19:34,042
Oh God. I couldn't go.

1800
02:19:34,067 --> 02:19:35,835
<i>I couldn't go, Jack.</i>

1801
02:19:35,918 --> 02:19:37,587
<i>It's all right.
We'll think of something.</i>

1802
02:19:39,255 --> 02:19:40,756
- <i>At least I'm with you.</i>
- <i>We'll think of something.</i>

1803
02:19:54,947 --> 02:19:56,272
Come on! Move!

1804
02:19:59,609 --> 02:20:00,791
Come on! Move.

1805
02:20:07,408 --> 02:20:08,409
Come on!

1806
02:20:16,542 --> 02:20:17,543
Move!

1807
02:20:23,650 --> 02:20:25,316
Come on! Come on Rose.

1808
02:20:27,887 --> 02:20:28,888
Rose, come on!

1809
02:20:31,891 --> 02:20:32,934
Move Rose!

1810
02:20:47,615 --> 02:20:50,326
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1811
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:06,676
What could possibly be funny?

1812
02:21:07,297 --> 02:21:09,469
I put the diamond in the coat.

1813
02:21:12,598 --> 02:21:14,517
And I put the coat on her!

1814
02:21:16,268 --> 02:21:17,353
Come on!

1815
02:21:36,578 --> 02:21:39,360
Dada!

1816
02:21:41,547 --> 02:21:42,503
We can't leave him.

1817
02:21:47,049 --> 02:21:48,384
All right, come on!

1818
02:21:50,252 --> 02:21:52,221
Dada!

1819
02:22:05,317 --> 02:22:06,652
Go back!

1820
02:22:17,371 --> 02:22:18,684
<i>It's the wrong way!
Come back!</i>

1821
02:22:18,709 --> 02:22:21,208
<i>No, not that way!
Come back! Stop!</i>

1822
02:22:26,255 --> 02:22:27,423
<i>Go!</i>

1823
02:22:29,759 --> 02:22:33,429
Go! Run!

1824
02:22:45,024 --> 02:22:46,484
- Jack!
- Rose!

1825
02:22:59,121 --> 02:23:00,122
<i>This way!</i>

1826
02:23:12,301 --> 02:23:13,469
Give me your hand!

1827
02:23:22,478 --> 02:23:23,813
Oh, God!

02:23:28,150 --> 02:23:29,318
<i>Help!</i>

02:23:35,157 --> 02:23:36,492

<i>Wait, sir!</i>

02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,663
Sir, open the gate, please!

02:23:40,913 --> 02:23:42,081
Help us, please!

1833
02:23:42,331 --> 02:23:43,499
Help us!

Come on!

02:23:55,845 --> 02:23:57,179
Go, go!

<i>Jesus.</i>

Don't leave!
Please, send for help! No!

1847

I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1848
02:24:37,553 --> 02:24:39,555
The short one. Try the short one.

1849
02:24:40,556 --> 02:24:41,557
Hurry, Jack.

1850
02:24:45,227 --> 02:24:47,024
Oh no! It won't go in.

It's stuck! It's stuck!

Come on! Hurry, Jack!

1854
02:24:57,907 --> 02:24:59,575

<i>Stop pushing!</i>

I'll shoot any man who tries

Get back!

1871

We had a deal, damn it!

1872
02:26:42,344 --> 02:26:45,386
Your money can't save you
anymore than it can save me.

1873
02:26:45,472 --> 02:26:46,473
Get back!

1874
02:26:47,683 --> 02:26:49,601

02:26:58,444 --> 02:27:00,803
No, Tommy! Bastardo!

1877
02:27:18,589 --> 02:27:19,686
No, Will!

1878
02:27:26,472 --> 02:27:28,342
Now stand back, damn you!

1879
02:27:31,310 --> 02:27:34,813
<i>Gently, gently.
Hold it. Hold it.</i>

1880
02:27:44,636 --> 02:27:46,158
<i>I have a child!</i>

1881
02:27:46,492 --> 02:27:48,714
I have a child!
Clear a path here!

1882
02:27:48,994 --> 02:27:50,996
Please, I have a child!

1883
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:54,500
Please. I'm all she
has in the world.

1884
02:27:55,459 --> 02:27:56,502
Go on.

1885
02:27:56,835 --> 02:27:57,836
Step back!

1886
02:27:58,456 --> 02:28:00,175
Please?
Here, give her to me.

1887
02:28:00,503 --> 02:28:01,799
You're all right, dearie.

1888
02:28:04,885 --> 02:28:05,969
Give her here.

1889
02:28:07,888 --> 02:28:08,889
There, there.

1890
02:28:13,185 --> 02:28:16,021
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1891
02:28:18,524 --> 02:28:19,525
Oh, Rose.

1892
02:28:22,528 --> 02:28:24,126
Won't you even make a try for it?

1893
02:28:25,864 --> 02:28:30,369
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1894
02:28:32,407 --> 02:28:34,781
It's going fast. We have to move.

1895
02:28:34,832 --> 02:28:35,833
Wait.

1896
02:28:38,877 --> 02:28:40,337
Good luck to you, Rose.

1897
02:28:42,381 --> 02:28:43,382
And to you.

1898
02:28:56,353 --> 02:28:57,396
Mr. Guggenheim?

1899
02:28:57,855 --> 02:28:59,022
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1900
02:28:59,231 --> 02:29:00,232
No, thank you.

1901
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:03,861
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1902
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:07,030
But we would like a brandy.

1903
02:29:07,739 --> 02:29:10,242
<i>Get the falls over here now!</i>

1904
02:29:10,909 --> 02:29:13,370
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1905
02:29:18,625 --> 02:29:20,011
<i>Capitén?</i>

1906
02:29:20,036 --> 02:29:23,255
Capitén, where should I go? Please.

1907
02:29:28,802 --> 02:29:31,930
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1908
02:30:02,419 --> 02:30:04,630
Right. That's it, then.

1909
02:30:05,464 --> 02:30:07,090
Good-bye, Wally. Good luck.

1910
02:30:08,133 --> 02:30:09,301
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

Neither shall there be

1956
02:38:46,443 --> 02:38:49,195
for the former world
has passed away.

1957

Oh, my God, Jack!
Oh, God. Oh, God.

Hold on!

1974
02:43:54,584 --> 02:43:55,985
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1975
02:43:57,016 --> 02:43:58,796
Take a deep breath when I say.

1976
02:44:04,427 --> 02:44:06,596
Kick for the surface

1977
02:44:06,637 --> 02:44:07,972
Do not let go of my hand.

1978
02:44:15,688 --> 02:44:16,939
We're going to make it, Rose.

02:44:16,981 --> 02:44:17,982
Trust me.

1980
02:44:18,107 --> 02:44:19,359

02:46:03,713 --> 02:46:05,381
Keep swimming.

Come on. Here.

1999
02:46:19,896 --> 02:46:20,980
Keep swimming.

Here...

2002
02:46:25,593 --> 02:46:26,861
get on it.

2003
02:46:27,570 --> 02:46:29,071
Get on top.

2004
02:46:36,454 --> 02:46:37,914
Come on, Rose.

2005
02:46:47,465 --> 02:46:49,425
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

2006
02:46:49,884 --> 02:46:50,885
Jack...

2007
02:47:10,988 --> 02:47:12,490
It'll be all right now.

2008
02:47:14,992 --> 02:47:16,494
It'll be all right now.

2009
02:47:23,834 --> 02:47:25,002
Return...

2010
02:47:25,211 --> 02:47:26,879
the boats!

2011
02:47:31,008 --> 02:47:33,135
The boats are coming
back for us Rose.

2012
02:47:33,678 --> 02:47:35,399
Hold on just a little bit longer.

2013
02:47:36,013 --> 02:47:38,934
They- They had to
row away from the suction...

2014
02:47:39,013 --> 02:47:41,356

help us!

You don't understand.

2019
02:47:56,409 --> 02:47:58,784
If we go back,
they'll swamp the boat.

2020
02:47:58,828 --> 02:48:00,534
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

2021
02:48:00,705 --> 02:48:03,207
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

02:49:14,348 --> 02:49:15,731
<i>As quick as you can, please.</i>

2036
02:49:15,756 --> 02:49:17,948
<i>Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and aft.</i>

2037
02:49:27,958 --> 02:49:29,794
It's getting quiet.

2038
02:49:31,962 --> 02:49:35,299
It's just going to take
a couple of minutes...

2039
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:37,802
to get the boats organized.

2040
02:49:40,638 --> 02:49:42,306
I don't know about you but...

2041
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:46,740
I intend to write
a strongly worded letter...

2042
02:49:46,771 --> 02:49:48,724
to the White Star Line about all this.

2043
02:49:56,487 --> 02:49:58,155
I love you, Jack.

2044
02:50:04,829 --> 02:50:06,330
Don't you do that.

2045
02:50:07,832 --> 02:50:11,423
Don't you say your good-byes. Not yet.

2046
02:50:11,448 --> 02:50:12,837
Do you understand me?

2047
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:15,005
I'm so cold.

2048
02:50:15,506 --> 02:50:17,007
Listen, Rose...

2049
02:50:18,175 --> 02:50:19,844
...you're gonna get out of here.

2050
02:50:21,011 --> 02:50:22,513
You're gonna go on...

2051
02:50:23,488 --> 02:50:25,926
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

2052
02:50:26,350 --> 02:50:28,352
And you're gonna watch them grow.

2053
02:50:30,004 --> 02:50:31,838
You're gonna die an old...

2054
02:50:31,879 --> 02:50:33,088
an old lady...

2055
02:50:33,113 --> 02:50:34,525
warm in her bed.

2056
02:50:36,380 --> 02:50:37,506
Not here.

2057
02:50:38,195 --> 02:50:41,150
Not this night.
Not like this.

2058
02:50:41,175 --> 02:50:42,700
Do you understand me?

2059
02:50:45,703 --> 02:50:47,872
I can't feel my body.

2060
02:50:49,785 --> 02:50:51,142
Winning that ticket, Rose...

2061
02:50:51,167 --> 02:50:53,457
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

2062
02:50:55,379 --> 02:50:57,214
It brought me to you.

2063
02:50:58,841 --> 02:51:01,302
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

2064
02:51:01,844 --> 02:51:03,179
I'm thankful.

2065
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:07,725
You must...

2066
02:51:08,851 --> 02:51:10,853
you must do me this honor.

2067
02:51:13,856 --> 02:51:17,359
You must promise me
that you'll survive.

2068
02:51:18,645 --> 02:51:21,030
That you won't give up...

2069
02:51:22,198 --> 02:51:24,200
no matter what happens.

2070
02:51:26,869 --> 02:51:29,205
No matter how hopeless.

2071
02:51:32,374 --> 02:51:34,543
Promise me now, Rose.

2072
02:51:36,712 --> 02:51:39,048
And never let go of that promise.

2073
02:51:40,716 --> 02:51:42,051
I promise.

2074
02:51:44,178 --> 02:51:45,846
Never let go.

2075
02:51:48,724 --> 02:51:50,851
I'll never let go, Jack.

2076
02:51:53,562 --> 02:51:55,231
I'll never let go.

2077
02:52:19,338 --> 02:52:20,840

I promise.

2128
02:57:39,783 --> 02:57:41,618
Come about!

2129
02:58:02,973 --> 02:58:06,810
Fifteen hundred people
went into the sea...

2130
02:58:07,144 --> 02:58:10,147
when Titanic sank from under us.

2131
02:58:11,982 --> 02:58:15,152
There were twenty
boats floating nearby...

2132
02:58:16,320 --> 02:58:18,655
and only one came back.

2133
02:58:20,490 --> 02:58:21,617
One.

2134
02:58:23,327 --> 02:58:26,444
Six were saved from the water...

2135
02:58:26,469 --> 02:58:27,819
myself included.

2136
02:58:29,333 --> 02:58:30,626
Six...

2137
02:58:31,772 --> 02:58:33,712
out of fifteen hundred.

2138
02:58:37,007 --> 02:58:38,342
Afterward...

2139
02:58:39,509 --> 02:58:41,511
the seven hundred
people in the boats...

2140
02:58:42,156 --> 02:58:44,389
had nothing to do but wait.

2141
02:58:46,222 --> 02:58:47,684
Wait to die.

2142
02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:49,686
Wait to live.

2143
02:58:50,854 --> 02:58:53,498
Wait for an absolution...

2144
02:58:53,523 --> 02:58:55,359
<i>that would never come.</i>

2145
02:59:59,589 --> 03:00:02,192
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

2146
03:00:02,217 --> 03:00:03,635
It's all steerage.

2147
03:00:06,596 --> 03:00:10,142
<i>His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.</i>

2148
03:00:10,267 --> 03:00:11,643
White beard.

2149
03:00:12,102 --> 03:00:13,729
Isn't there another passenger list?

2150
03:00:13,770 --> 03:00:14,896
There is no other list.

2151
03:00:14,921 --> 03:00:16,481
Perhaps he's on another ship.

2152
03:00:16,773 --> 03:00:18,822
We're doing all we can, ma'am.
I'm so sorry.

2153
03:00:41,965 --> 03:00:44,634
<font color="#878787">OLD ROSE</font>: <i>That's the

2154
03:00:45,042 --> 03:00:48,638
<i>He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.</i>

2155
03:00:49,306 --> 03:00:52,809

Thank you.

2162
03:01:29,679 --> 03:01:31,807
We never found anything on Jack.

2163
03:01:31,973 --> 03:01:33,892
There's no record of him at all.

2164
03:01:34,518 --> 03:01:36,853
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2165
03:01:37,187 --> 03:01:39,898
And I've never spoken
of him until now.

2166
03:01:40,649 --> 03:01:41,923
Not to anyone.

2167
03:01:42,859 --> 03:01:44,861
Not even your grandfather.

2168
03:01:45,195 --> 03:01:49,199
A woman's heart is a
deep ocean of secrets.

2169
03:01:50,033 --> 03:01:53,703
But now you know, there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2170
03:01:54,037 --> 03:01:56,039
and that he saved me...

2171
03:01:56,373 --> 03:01:59,709
in every way that
a person can be saved.

2172
03:02:01,711 --> 03:02:04,381
I don't even have a picture of him.

2173
03:02:06,883 --> 03:02:10,720
He exists now only in my memory.
