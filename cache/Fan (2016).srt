1
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:53,791
Connection is a strange thing!
Don't ask how it works

2
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,457
Our friendship goes back years

3
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,540
Our connection is stronger than
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth

4
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,291
The best actor award goes to
Aryan Khanna

5
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:12,207
First time I'm getting an award,
a major award in the film industry

6
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,999
This one's for you, Ma

7
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:15,582
Thank you very much

8
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:19,332
Before I could walk, I learned
how to jump like Aryan

9
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,790
Aryan? The moron!

10
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,540
Anyone insults him

11
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:28,916
I fight

12
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:35,123
If I copy his style...

13
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,374
...I get whacked

14
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,957
I don't think I've done enough work.
It's just been 5 years

15
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,749
I still have a long way to go
as an actor and star

16
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:47,082
I'll work hard and prove
I'm a genuine superstar

17
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:50,332
I never compare

18
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:53,332
What is better is to say you are the
best, not bother about others

19
00:01:53,624 --> 00:01:56,165
You're the greatest.
But I'm better

20
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:59,915
Never met him. But I spend
all day with him

21
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,041
That's real connection

22
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,123
Whatever he does, I cut, copy,
paste, and ditto

23
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:10,165
Tiny difference

24
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:11,916
He became a star

25
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,415
And I became his fan

26
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,957
And something else

27
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,999
We live together

28
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:25,999
In one cinema or the other

29
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:33,749
The real drama will start now!

30
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,291
None of my achievements
are my own

31
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,832
I am who I am today,
I am where I am today

32
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,291
It's all thanks to my fans

33
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:57,165
Without my fans, I'm nothing

34
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:00,082
Can't you even get 40% marks?

35
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,249
It's always Aryan, Aryan

36
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:13,165
My parents don't get it

37
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:16,374
He's not just a star,
he's my world

38
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,873
But God bowled a great googly

39
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,332
When God was making Aryan,
some clay was left behind...

40
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:23,998
...God made me with that

41
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:29,582
He and I are different.
Poles apart

42
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:31,874
But we are one

43
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:37,123
He is Aryan and me, Junior Aryan

44
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:06,332
I topped up your phone.
200 rupees

45
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,332
Send the money tomorrow

46
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,748
Don't worry

47
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:11,207
Tomorrow is fine

48
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,124
The shop is closing now

49
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,457
Check your phone

50
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,957
You're a gem. Bye, aunty

51
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:22,373
Batman, Superman!
Enough slaughter

52
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:24,623
Shut down now. Kill the bad guys
tomorrow

53
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:27,540
- Gaurav, what's this?
- It's only 5.30, bro

54
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:31,415
Don't act smart. I told you.
You're out by 5.30

55
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,791
Go home, kids

56
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:35,873
Don't mess with me

57
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:44,748
All well?

58
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:48,998
Miss Call Center, where were you?
I'm closing

59
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:49,957
So early?

60
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,249
- I have a show
- 5 minutes. Please

61
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,749
No. I'll be late

62
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,457
Only 5 minutes

63
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,291
It's urgent

64
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,790
I need a recommendation letter
for my US visa

65
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,165
I have a costume trial

66
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,248
Can you do it later? Ok then

67
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,499
Thanks

68
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,165
5 minutes

69
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:11,165
You don't let us stay and for her...

70
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:14,082
Her work is urgent. You just
shoot partridges

71
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,915
I get what's urgent

72
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:20,498
Come back tomorrow

73
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,082
Get lost!

74
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:26,457
You losers

75
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:43,207
Sitting here dreaming of America
won't help you

76
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,748
But staring at Aryan's photo
will help you?

77
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,999
- Two minutes to go
- All done

78
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:54,457
Thank you

79
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,249
How much?

80
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:03,540
Forget it. Can't charge you
for 5 minutes

81
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,707
- Thanks
- Enjoy!

82
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,041
Brothers, the shop is closed

83
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,291
So the action just left?

84
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,332
What's 30 minutes?

85
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:20,665
I put this notice up a week ago

86
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:22,707
“Due to the grand Dussehra show

87
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,541
“Organised by the Resident Welfare
Assoc. Inder Vihar, DDA Colony

88
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:29,290
“AK Cyber Chat closes
at 5:30 sharp

89
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,916
“By order Gaurav Chandna,
proprietor AK Cyber Chat”

90
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:34,415
See you again

91
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,624
If I knew English well, I'd be
a computer myself

92
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:43,082
The shop won't stay open,
even for the Prime Minister

93
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,415
I said it's closed. You'll get
extra time tomorrow

94
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:46,415
You photocopy!

95
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,249
Don't be cruel like Ravan

96
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,624
This boy needs to watch porn.
He's upset

97
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:56,290
I don't heal upset minds
at Cyber Chat

98
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,457
No porn films allowed here anyway.
Out, you guys!

99
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,041
You better outgrow Aryan Khanna.
Sid Kapoor is the man now

100
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:08,123
Get smart, photocopy

101
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:11,040
The shop in Sector 28 is open

102
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,582
- Go there
- Don't you dare touch me!

103
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:18,082
- Don't touch
- Here, I'm touching

104
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:25,582
Get out of here

105
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:56,582
Let go! They need a lesson

106
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:58,624
Want to see porn? Huh...

107
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,832
What are you doing?

108
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:05,166
Nothing. I let you chat.
So they made trouble

109
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,749
I'm fine

110
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,457
You can all go. Thank you!

111
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,332
The jobless morons

112
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:15,540
They came to watch blue films.
I whacked them

113
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:19,832
Why play the hero?
Why didn't you call for help?

114
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:21,915
But I did call you

115
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:25,957
My heart did

116
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,790
So you came back

117
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:32,957
Please, Gaurav. Stop talking
like Aryan

118
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:35,790
Drop it. Coming to the show tonight?

119
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,540
Too much to do. I don't
have time like you

120
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,957
Today's a birthday special

121
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,916
No, thank you

122
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:43,999
Welcome

123
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,166
How did you get hurt?

124
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,124
Who hit you? I'll complain to
the association

125
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:00,749
It's fine. Don't ruin my concentration

126
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,040
Concentration? You can't move.
How will you go on stage?

127
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:09,082
The prize is 20,000. Cash!

128
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:13,373
You won't give me 20,000
to go and meet Aryan

129
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:16,082
My only chance to fulfill my dream

130
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:19,998
I don't have money to burn
on your silly dreams

131
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:23,248
What about your Tuesday trips
to the Hanuman temple?

132
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,207
Doesn't your 101-rupee donation
go up in smoke?

133
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:29,373
Hanumaniji is a God.
And your Aryan...

134
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,749
He's important to me

135
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,499
Every fool has met him,
only I haven't

136
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,207
Spray some scent on me

137
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:43,457
- Careful
- If you can't do it, never mind

138
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,999
My fans are waiting. Get ready

139
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,540
Listen to your mother.
Stop your drama

140
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,457
The real drama starts now

141
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,666
Hold on to your hearts

142
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,124
You're about to see a performance...

143
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,623
...that the Western Union,
moving money for better...

144
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,332
...Super Star competition
can never do without

145
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:08,165
You guessed right

146
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:12,373
Here he comes.
The two-year winner:

147
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:15,915
Our Aryan Khanna Junior

148
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:54,540
Jindal aunty!

149
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,749
Your pressure cooker on the stove?

150
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,373
The only whistle you'll hear
today is right here

151
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,416
My hattrick year

152
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,582
Today I'll share something personal

153
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,665
About me and Aryan

154
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:10,707
I hide nothing from you

155
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,249
I'm no ace at romancing

156
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:18,790
But when I see her, my emotions
go haywire

157
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,290
Words escape me

158
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,749
Senior is an expert heart-stealer.
So I asked him...

159
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,207
...to help his Junior

160
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:42,374
It's delicate. I must tread carefully

161
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:44,415
Don't forget

162
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:47,290
The heart's job is to beat

163
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,415
When you count the night stars...

164
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,791
...and yearn to etch my name
on every star

165
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,707
You know you're in love

166
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,082
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

167
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:04,415
When you look for me
in a crowd

168
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,499
You know you're in love

169
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,166
If you don't believe me

170
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,874
Then hold my hand

171
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:16,790
If your heart stops, then you know...

172
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,082
...you're in love

173
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:24,957
I don't have your style, Senior

174
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,207
But if anyone insults you...

175
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,041
...I want to break their teeth

176
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,040
Mummy says, “Calm down”

177
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,498
“Aryan is India's sweetheart”

178
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,916
But he's a Delhi boy after all

179
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:42,832
Come, Senior. Let's show them
some Delhi muscle

180
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:25,498
Ma used to say: “Don't weigh
the food you're eating

181
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:31,207
“Don't count the guys you whack”

182
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,332
Here

183
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,582
Use this

184
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:48,999
I feel like just staring
at the screen

185
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:50,998
I have this dream

186
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,748
Keep doing your thing
with your heroines

187
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,332
I've been your fan forever

188
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,874
I think you owe me a dance

189
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,582
We'll have a blast

190
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:03,915
No one will tell who is Senior,
who is Junior. Hit it!

191
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,582
One last thing before I go

192
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,582
I am what I am today

193
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,582
I am where I am today

194
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:33,332
It's all thanks to my fans

195
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:36,165
Without my fans

196
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:39,207
I'm nothing

197
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,582
Brothers and sisters!

198
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:47,540
The Virat act did not impress us

199
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,291
The Katrina act did not impress

200
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:53,249
This year like every other year

201
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,416
The Western Union, moving money
for better...

202
00:15:56,624 --> 00:16:00,415
Super Star competition's trophy
goes to our very own...

203
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:02,915
Gaurav Chandna

204
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:10,332
Give him a big hand!

205
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,082
I want to thank my Mummy

206
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:29,373
My Papa

207
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,499
My God

208
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,166
The greatest actor in the world

209
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,916
The Aryan Khanna

210
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,624
Ok, go

211
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,249
But why travel without a ticket?

212
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:03,665
- Go later
- Later?

213
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:08,582
Aryan's birthday is in 2 days.
And I must wait to book a ticket?

214
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:12,415
The ticket collector will catch you
and belt you

215
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,248
Remind her...

216
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:16,915
...how Aryan travelled to Mumbai
for the first time

217
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:19,582
-WT
- Without ticket!

218
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:23,332
You want to give him the trophy?
Courier it. Post it

219
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:25,749
Papa, count the cash again

220
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:28,540
Phony fans cheer him from afar

221
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:33,457
But I'll hug him and hand him
the trophy myself

222
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,124
- Like this
- Have you gone mad?

223
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,999
Control the boy

224
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,207
Here. 20,000

225
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,290
Is your spit on the notes?

226
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,749
Socks, in the outside pocket.
Underwear, inside the bag

227
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,457
Any extra underwear? I'll have
no time to wash them

228
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:53,249
Here. Give this to him from
your Papa and me

229
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,540
Sohan halwa

230
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,499
Tell him your father got it
especially for him

231
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,916
- From Chandni Chowk
- Why tell him? I'll show him

232
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:06,165
I'll show Aryan a family selfie.
Come, we'll get the background

233
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,416
Mummy, hold the box.
I'll hold the trophy

234
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,457
Papa, hide those undies

235
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:14,373
- Cheese
- Cheese!

236
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:17,623
- Shall I drop you at the station?
- No, you go to the shop

237
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,582
- Can you manage?
- Sure

238
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,040
Don't overstay at Aryan's

239
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,457
I've only four days leave.
Can't extend

240
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:25,498
Don't worry, Papa. By mummy

241
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,166
Be careful, son

242
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:30,957
Where to?

243
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,082
Hi!

244
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,290
Your parents throw you out?

245
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,707
Keep dreaming about moving
to America

246
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:41,290
I'm off to meet Aryan,
face-to-face

247
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,999
Told Aryan you're coming?

248
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,124
He's my Aryan, not America.
No visa needed

249
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:51,499
I'm going to America to make a new
life. You'll get zero meeting Aryan

250
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:56,207
Forget it, you won't understand

251
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:48,791
Hello, uncle

252
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:50,082
Hello, aunty

253
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:57,124
Your ice cream

254
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,416
One vegetarian meal

255
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:02,915
Seat number?

256
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,874
100

257
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:12,665
I'll get it

258
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,999
If you want to stretch your legs
or your back, tell me

259
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,415
It's only one night. We'll adjust

260
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:30,040
Allow me

261
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,874
Now it's ok

262
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,957
Let me put uncle's plate down.
Don't worry

263
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,040
We're coming

264
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:06,123
Without ticket?

265
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:09,082
Uncle, it's a long story

266
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,624
Let me explain

267
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:15,957
I'll do the explaining. Call
Ratlam police station

268
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:19,165
Let him spend two days inside.
No more WT travelling

269
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:21,873
Uncle, you don't get it. I could've
bought the ticket

270
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:25,332
- I want to travel without one
- Come along

271
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,082
I'm not a thief or a criminal

272
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:30,957
You see tomorrow is
Aryan Khanna's birthday

273
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,582
No point if I get there late

274
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,457
Aryan Khanna?

275
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,957
Right! He went to Mumbai WT

276
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,040
Stayed at Hotel Delite.
Room number 205

277
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:40,790
I'll be staying there too.
Get the picture?

278
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:43,915
Let me get to Mumbai.
You won't lose anything

279
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,957
Here's the ticket money. Keep it

280
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:48,707
- But I'll travel WT
- Shut up!

281
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,249
You need a tight slap

282
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,707
Take him. He won't listen

283
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,332
Damn you!

284
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,082
Take me to Mumbai. Or I'll jump

285
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:04,373
You'll be answering the cops
all night

286
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:06,415
Want to die? Get back inside

287
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:09,249
If I can't see Aryan Khanna
on his birthday...

288
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,040
...no point living

289
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:13,665
Don't lose your head over
these film stars

290
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,665
He may be a film star to you.
But he's special to me

291
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,540
Give me your hand or you'll die

292
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,332
- Take me to Mumbai
- OK! Give me your hand

293
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,999
- One veg meal?
- Done. Give me your hand

294
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,582
Ok, hold me

295
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:39,123
Is he a relative? Do you
really know him?

296
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,457
Is he family? What are you
to Aryan Khanna?

297
00:22:45,374 --> 00:22:46,332
A fan

298
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,416
Room 205 is occupied

299
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:16,040
Why? I've booked it

300
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:17,957
No bookings here

301
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,541
First come, first serve.
Pay cash, take the key

302
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,666
I'll pay double

303
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,582
But only room 205

304
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,582
If you don't give it to me,
just see what I'll do

305
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:42,124
Hey boy! Move the stuff from 205
to 209

306
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:46,040
Here, brother. Room 205 for you

307
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:18,998
Happy birthday, Senior

308
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,957
Let me pass, brother. I'm late.
Move it!

309
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:12,623
What a crowd! By God

310
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:14,749
Brother, move aside

311
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:23,915
The press over there

312
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,582
Let them come in

313
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,499
A selfie! Smile

314
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:35,707
Thank you

315
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:40,707
These two-faced fans

316
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,457
They moan about his films

317
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:47,457
And come here to pose with him

318
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:50,332
You can't go there

319
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:54,582
I'm not one of them. Those FB types.
Phony fans

320
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,832
I'm Gaurav Chandna

321
00:25:57,332 --> 00:26:00,582
I've come from Delhi. WT.
Rajdhani Express

322
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:02,999
Guess where I'm staying?

323
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,582
Guess!

324
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:11,165
Hotel Delite. Room number 205

325
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,041
Don't you get it?

326
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:15,665
I'll show you magic

327
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,665
You'll enjoy it. Look!

328
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,623
When you count the night stars...

329
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:27,373
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

330
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:30,416
You know you're in love

331
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,457
When her breath is carried
by the breeze...

332
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:35,290
Lets go press

333
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,374
You know you're in love

334
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:40,040
When you turn back as you walk ahead

335
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,457
Check the press IDs

336
00:26:41,957 --> 00:26:43,415
Go inside

337
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:47,290
Not you! Don't you get it?

338
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:50,248
I want to show him my trophy

339
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:53,374
I just want him to see it.
Then I'll be gone

340
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,374
Moron!

341
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:00,873
If Aryan ever hears that
you hit me...

342
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:02,957
...he'll thrash you

343
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,665
It's ok. It's nothing

344
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:19,498
Mummy sent you special halwa

345
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,332
And this trophy...your birthday.
Mummy sent special halwa

346
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:25,582
Yes, Mummy?

347
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:27,624
I'm fine

348
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,540
Aryan is fine, too

349
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:34,415
I haven't met him yet. You're talking
like a child, Mummy

350
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,082
He's a superstar. How can
I just meet him?

351
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:39,998
There are thousands of people
here to meet him

352
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:42,749
They've built a 50 ft wall
in front of him

353
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:45,790
The poor guy is stuck alone behind it

354
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,290
Scream as hard as you want,
he can't hear

355
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:56,373
I'm hanging up. I'll call later

356
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:12,248
They say common sense deserts
a man in bad times

357
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:14,957
Seems that's Aryan Khanna's
fate now

358
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:18,874
In his twilight years, his films
are bombing

359
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,374
No surprise that he's on edge
and snappy

360
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:26,374
On his 48th birthday, he showed
his irritation...

361
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:28,957
...through his gift to Sid Kapoor

362
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:31,541
No star has matched Aryan till now

363
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,707
But Sid Kapoor...

364
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,540
...has pulled the rug
from under his feet

365
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:40,915
The party guests said...

366
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:43,165
Sid Kapoor just hinted that...

367
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:46,040
...Aryan Khanna's days were over

368
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:48,707
What did Kapoor tell Aryan Khanna...

369
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:52,124
...that made him hit Sid Kapoor?

370
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:54,415
I went to wish him happy birthday

371
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:58,082
Look what he did to me!
Totally out of order

372
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:01,291
He's an elder. I respect him a lot

373
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:05,999
I always say I've learned how
to act by watching his films

374
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:09,207
I don't know why I make him
insecure

375
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:11,916
What will you do?
Take legal action?

376
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,332
I should

377
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,707
I'll talk to my legal team

378
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,499
Let's see what they say.
It's my duty to do something

379
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:24,124
So no newcomer is mistreated
by a senior star

380
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:27,498
That's all I want to say

381
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:31,124
We'll talk after I've consulted
my legal team

382
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:43,998
Liar! Cheat

383
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:48,207
Playing the good boy on TV.
Anyone can see through you

384
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,499
You think he's insecure?

385
00:31:51,874 --> 00:31:54,707
He's seen off dozens like you

386
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,166
No one has touched Aryan Khanna
for 25 years

387
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,165
Do your worst, sonny!

388
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:03,457
No one can touch him

389
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:05,123
Just you wait

390
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:20,373
Cut it!

391
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,082
Great shot

392
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:31,457
Superb!

393
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:33,290
- Liked it?
- Fantastic

394
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:47,665
Sid Kapoor! You swallowed
Aryan Khanna whole

395
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:53,165
What dialogue delivery!

396
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:59,623
You've destroyed Aryan Khanna.
Blew him away

397
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:02,791
I am your biggest fan, sir

398
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,082
At the contest back home...

399
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:08,207
It's my bad luck I look like Aryan,
but I always impersonate you

400
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:09,457
I win, sir

401
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:12,207
I've even won a trophy.
I love you, sir

402
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,582
Let me show you my trophy, sir.
Please...

403
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:18,582
- You let the girls through
- Let him come

404
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,290
Sir says yes

405
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,499
Sorry. Give me space

406
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:26,457
I'll show you my act?

407
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:27,457
Ok

408
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:38,499
The mind always outsmarts
the face, Mr. Singhania

409
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,998
You can ape someone

410
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:43,998
But you can't ape his mind

411
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,582
When all doors are shut

412
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,332
There's a knock at mind's door

413
00:33:51,624 --> 00:33:55,040
And when that door opens,
you see a new road

414
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,499
I have walked that road to you,
Singhania

415
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:05,040
And through that very door
you shall walk to your peril

416
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,582
You're too good, fan

417
00:34:09,374 --> 00:34:11,290
Well done, man

418
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:14,998
Relax man, calm down

419
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,541
I have the same jacket you're wearing

420
00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:22,457
That's good. Very nice

421
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:25,540
- Sir's lunch break now
- One chance, sir

422
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:30,207
Santosh, bring me the salad
in half an hour

423
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,915
And this fan, come on!

424
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:34,624
Hear that?

425
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:39,415
- Sit down
- No, thank you

426
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,915
Sir, a small suggestion from a fan

427
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,749
Why fight with Aryan Khanna?

428
00:34:48,874 --> 00:34:51,790
Why bother with the police
and police reports?

429
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,332
That's nothing, bro

430
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,874
I'll drag him to court

431
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:57,874
Allow me

432
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:00,623
Time's up for Aryan Khanna

433
00:35:03,874 --> 00:35:05,332
- I'll wring your neck
- Santosh!

434
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,832
To hell with Santosh

435
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,665
Shut up! No one is coming

436
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:16,415
Close your mouth

437
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,624
Now listen... sit quietly...

438
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:25,540
Don't open your mouth again
to insult Aryan. One peep and...

439
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,915
I'll crush your chocolate face
with the wrapper

440
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:34,332
No fan will look at you again

441
00:35:36,749 --> 00:35:40,874
Spouting pearls of wisdom on TV.
Look at my camera

442
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:44,498
Read! Here's the script.
Learn the lines

443
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:46,623
Do your rubbish acting

444
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:53,957
Your damn phone never
stops ringing

445
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,040
Now I'll see

446
00:36:01,332 --> 00:36:02,290
Read it!

447
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:06,749
Start

448
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,291
It's in Hindi, dude

449
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:18,666
You're a Hindi film hero
and you can't read Hindi?

450
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,290
Where do they find you guys?

451
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:25,415
What do you film people say?

452
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:27,623
Action!

453
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:28,998
Dear Aryan sir

454
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,332
I'm really very sorry

455
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:34,082
My statement to the press
was all lies

456
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,123
I wanted to spoil your name

457
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:40,207
No one can take your place.
You're the best

458
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:43,915
The greatest, the most evergreen
super-duper star

459
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:47,082
I apologise again

460
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,790
<i>Think of me as your kid brother
and forgive me</i>

461
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:54,124
Why won't he play with you?
Shall I tell him to?

462
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,082
Dad, he bullies me

463
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,624
He bullies you because
he's scared of you

464
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:02,332
He thinks you'll win. We'll cheat!

465
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,749
- Dhruv, let's play
- Dad, come on

466
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,498
Play with Isha. I've trained her

467
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:13,707
- I am so sorry
- Dad, you made me lose a point

468
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,790
Now she's ahead of you.
Try and win from her

469
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:23,290
I'm glad Sid realised his mistake.
He's a great guy. Young and new

470
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,415
Glad it got sorted

471
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,207
Ladies and gentlemen,
last point, next point

472
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,624
Nothing is sorted, it's a game

473
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,957
Apology, say sorry - it's all a game

474
00:37:38,332 --> 00:37:41,248
You should've controlled yourself

475
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,749
I tried very hard

476
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:44,998
I gave him one slap. More a pat

477
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,666
See the scandal it's created

478
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:52,165
If someone comes to my house,
drinks my expensive wine

479
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,416
Flirts with my wife. Must I just
stand by and watch?

480
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:57,957
You have no time

481
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:00,248
Let someone else flirt with me

482
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:02,832
Actually you're right

483
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,499
But not this moron

484
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:11,291
The video has gone viral.
Social media is abuzz

485
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:15,415

after this short break

486
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,790
Aryan, wake up!

487
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:41,915
What happened?

488
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,790
Did you sleep here all night?

489
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,874
I was reading a script. It was
so good that I dozed off

490
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:52,249
Sunaina is here. She has something
to wake you up with

491
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,582
Good morning, Aryan

492
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:54,957
It's too early, Sunaina

493
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,082
I know. I'm really sorry.
I have to tell you something

494
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:00,248
- Are you pregnant?
- Shut up, Aryan

495
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:02,707
See this

496
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:06,082
Come on. Look here and say
your lines. Hurry

497
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:07,915
Dear Aryan sir

498
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,041
Look here. Look at the camera

499
00:39:11,957 --> 00:39:13,665
Ok. I'll do it

500
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,707
- Come on
- Did Aryan send you?

501
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:21,457
Aryan has nothing to do with it.
Do as you're told. The camera

502
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:25,457
If you want cash, take it.
Just let me go

503
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,916
Cash? I'll give you cash

504
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:30,998
Stop! I'll do it

505
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:33,790
What will you do? Scum!

506
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:54,082
A fan

507
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:57,040
Calls himself Junior Aryan Khanna

508
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:59,124
He sent a message

509
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:02,832
“A small birthday gift to the love
of my life, Senior Aryan Khanna

510
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,499
Call me once to thank me.
My life will be set”

511
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,541
Hello

512
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:23,415
Junior Aryan Khanna?

513
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:25,748
You calling from Aryan's house?

514
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:27,291
Yes

515
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:32,498
Where is Senior? Aryan Khanna?

516
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:36,540
He's busy right now. He asked me
to call you

517
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:40,207
How come he's so busy?
No time to talk to his Junior?

518
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:42,124
I did so much for him

519
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:44,957
I came to the house on his birthday,
The crowd...

520
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:46,623
Yeah, yeah, hello

521
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:51,124
Aryan...

522
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,249
Aryan Khanna?

523
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,874
Gaurav this side.
Your fan, your Junior

524
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,998
Where are you?

525
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:03,832
Just guess

526
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,582
Delite hotel, in your room

527
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:14,749
Room no. 205. Charni Road.
Remember?

528
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:19,415
But if you're calling to say
thank you, it won't do

529
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:22,041
I deserve a hug from my brother

530
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,582
- You want to see me?
- Sure

531
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,957
I made a big scandal just to meet you

532
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:32,290
Wait there. I'll send a car to
pick you up

533
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:35,624
Done, Senior

534
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:37,749
Thank you!

535
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:46,165
Mind blasting

536
00:41:47,707 --> 00:41:48,623
Really?

537
00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:51,124
Go by taxi

538
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:55,124
You're going to Aryan Khanna's.
Don't go by auto-rickshaw

539
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,041
He's sending me his personal car

540
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,832
He's invited me home

541
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,207
Don't forget to take pictures

542
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:06,540
If he offers you any food, no
pouncing on it like a pauper

543
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:11,082
Food? I'm not going for the food.
I'm going there to hug him

544
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:15,665
Tell him to wear the clothes I had
made for him at Diwali

545
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:20,124
- Make sure he takes the trophy
- As though he wouldn't

546
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:25,166
- Say hello from me
- And me, too

547
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:26,207
Ok. I'll tell him

548
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:28,874
Phone me once you've met him

549
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,749
The car's here. Call you later

550
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:34,457
The car is there

551
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:40,332
Hello

552
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:48,166
Are you the driver?

553
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:50,415
Junior Aryan Khanna?

554
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,957
- Did you act smart with Sid Kapoor?
- No

555
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:56,999
You're mistaken

556
00:42:58,499 --> 00:42:59,749
Did Sid Kapoor send you?

557
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:01,915
I'll tell you later. Come

558
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:05,249
I'm meeting Aryan.
I won't go anywhere

559
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,499
- Like hell you won't
- I won't come

560
00:43:10,332 --> 00:43:12,040
Don't touch me

561
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:14,665
No touching

562
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:23,332
Let me go!

563
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,207
Stop!

564
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:01,957
Try catching me!

565
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:07,499
- Stop! You rascal
- Please don't hit me

566
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:13,416
Don't hit hard. We have orders

567
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:22,749
Let's go

568
00:46:23,874 --> 00:46:26,165
Let me call Aryan Khanna

569
00:46:26,874 --> 00:46:27,957
Where are you taking me?

570
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:36,749
Sid Kapoor is evil. Don't get
mixed up with him

571
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,041
Shut up!

572
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:41,832
I did it for Aryan Khanna.
His problem is my problem

573
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:48,749
If Aryan hears about this...

574
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,791
...he'll skin you alive

575
00:46:51,874 --> 00:46:53,290
Stop!

576
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:58,915
Think carefully. We'll be back.
Let's go

577
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:28,332
Good evening, sir. Come in

578
00:47:43,457 --> 00:47:45,957
We asked him why he made the video

579
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:48,624
He says he'll talk only to you

580
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:51,915
You told us to go easy on him

581
00:47:52,499 --> 00:47:54,540
- Hardly touched him
- Thank you

582
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:56,998
- Usman
- Yes, sir?

583
00:47:58,874 --> 00:48:00,707
This is for his expenses

584
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:02,498
Keep him here for 2 days

585
00:48:02,707 --> 00:48:04,957
Get him a ticket to Delhi.
Take him to the station

586
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:07,998
As I said, don't beat him up
too badly

587
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:09,832
Just enough to scare him

588
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,290
No one must hear about this

589
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:16,873
No police record, no video statement.
Please

590
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,374
Sure, sir

591
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:20,457
Where is he?

592
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:23,874
I want to meet him alone

593
00:48:25,332 --> 00:48:26,832
- You stay here
- Yeah

594
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:40,915
Gaurav

595
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:04,249
Senior

596
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,791
You're here

597
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:09,249
I knew you'd come

598
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:12,540
They hit me and hit me

599
00:49:12,957 --> 00:49:15,040
They broke my bones

600
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:19,999
I protected my face

601
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,540
It's Aryan Khanna's face.
Nothing must happen to it

602
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:33,290
See? Same to same

603
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:38,332
Everyone calls me Junior
Aryan Khanna. But I say...

604
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:39,998
...there's only one Aryan Khanna

605
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:43,749
Relax

606
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:46,749
It's ok

607
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:55,499
I impersonate you at the yearly
Super Star competition

608
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,291
Always win first prize

609
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,124
The bastards took my bag.
My trophy was in it

610
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:06,165
I brought it to show you

611
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,207
I could show you my act

612
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:25,749
I'm nervous in front of you

613
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,332
It's all right. Sit

614
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:33,082
No audience here. Their screaming
and cheering helps

615
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,166
- Are you from Delhi?
- West Delhi

616
00:50:35,582 --> 00:50:37,332
You're from Rajender Nagar,
I'm from Inder Vihar

617
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:39,790
Two traffic lights from the TV tower.
Near DAV Park

618
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,832
Listen carefully

619
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,374
You did something nasty

620
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:47,999
It's a crime

621
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:52,957
A crime in the eyes of the law.
Love in your eyes, no?

622
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,749
Not love, it's stupidity

623
00:50:58,332 --> 00:50:59,707
Do you have family?

624
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:02,165
There's Papa, Mummy

625
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:04,207
And you, too

626
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:06,415
Have you thought what
your parents would say?

627
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:09,332
They'd be sad seeing you
in that sadistic video

628
00:51:09,749 --> 00:51:12,832
Why would we show it to them?
It was for you

629
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:14,916
Did you like my birthday gift?

630
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,582
Sid Kapoor? I beat the crap
out of him

631
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:25,165
I don't understand how the cops
discovered our little secret

632
00:51:26,582 --> 00:51:27,540
Our?

633
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:33,207
There is no “our” between
you and me

634
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:36,166
The police brought you here
on my orders

635
00:51:37,332 --> 00:51:39,332
You made a mistake. You
had to be punished

636
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:41,915
So you won't mess up again

637
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:48,791
On your orders? I did so much for you

638
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:54,499
Who are you to do anything
for me?

639
00:51:57,874 --> 00:51:58,999
I'm your fan

640
00:52:00,749 --> 00:52:03,290
- You're my star
- Fan? So you do as you please?

641
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:06,623
Thrash people? Murder?

642
00:52:07,832 --> 00:52:11,415
If need be, I could murder for you

643
00:52:15,374 --> 00:52:16,749
You're not my fan

644
00:52:18,874 --> 00:52:20,124
Don't say that

645
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:22,915
I risked my life to meet you

646
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:26,999
I hit Sid Kapoor a little, so you'd
meet me. What did I want...

647
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:28,791
...in return?

648
00:52:29,957 --> 00:52:33,248
To see you, a few photos,
an autograph. That's all

649
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:38,790
- Can't you spare 5 min of your life?
- It's my life

650
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:42,665
Why must I give you even
five seconds?

651
00:53:08,457 --> 00:53:11,707
I am who I am today,
where I am today

652
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:14,499
My stardom

653
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:18,957
It's all thanks to my fans

654
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,749
If it weren't for my fans...

655
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:26,207
I'd be nothing

656
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:42,582
Gaurav makes Aryan

657
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:45,916
Without Gaurav...

658
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:48,499
...Aryan is nothing

659
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:53,915
Now you listen carefully

660
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:57,873
When the police let you go,
go straight to Delhi, get it?

661
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:00,041
I'll forget all about Gaurav

662
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:02,874
And you forget you ever met Aryan

663
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:07,498
Stay in your life.
I stay in mine

664
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,249
This is your final warning. Ok

665
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:27,165
Forget it

666
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,374
You won't understand

667
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:44,040
Yes, Mummy

668
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:45,540
I'll be home soon

669
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:46,249
Everything ok?

670
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,332
Everything is fine

671
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:48,707
Why didn't you take my call?

672
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:50,124
I was busy

673
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:51,791
Gaurav, we're worried about you

674
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:52,749
Don't worry

675
00:55:52,957 --> 00:55:54,415
You'll come home soon?

676
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,416
Tell Papa to mind the Cyber Cafe

677
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:57,624
Are you eating properly?

678
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,582
The food is fine here

679
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:03,873
Thank you

680
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:05,873
Come, hero. Sir wants you

681
00:57:08,874 --> 00:57:13,374
Whatever happened has happened.
Put it behind you. Right?

682
00:57:14,374 --> 00:57:17,124
Thank you, brother. I made
a mistake. Sorry

683
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:49,374
Gaurav!

684
00:57:52,124 --> 00:57:54,332
Did you hug Aryan Khanna?

685
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:10,623
Didn't he meet you?
Didn't spare 5 minutes?

686
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:12,707
Don't you feel bad

687
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:15,790
It's not my loss. It's his

688
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:19,749
He's happy where he is.
I'm happy where I am

689
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,165
Mummy, make me some
rice and beans tonight

690
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:56,582
Hello, aunty

691
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:58,499
You're moving out?

692
00:58:58,749 --> 00:59:01,249
Who knows what this boy wants

693
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,249
Got a good price?

694
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,374
Don't worry, Papa. I'll invest wisely

695
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:09,082
Too much time wasted on Aryan

696
00:59:10,457 --> 00:59:11,957
The shop is sold, Mummy.
Let's go

697
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,999
Hurry. You coming?

698
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,707
- Let's go
- Ok, come

699
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:17,832
All well, aunty?

700
01:00:53,749 --> 01:00:56,124
Fans chase stars

701
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:59,666
Now a star will chase a fan

702
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:04,457
Whenever Aryan Khanna's name
is taken...

703
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,791
...it'll be in the same breath
as Gaurav Chandna

704
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:37,290
1 Year later

705
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:40,666
Welcome to Bollywood Cafe.
98.1 FM

706
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,749
Do you know what's special
about the weekend?

707
01:01:43,124 --> 01:01:44,207
Guys, this weekend...

708
01:01:44,332 --> 01:01:47,040
...is the Aryan Khanna reloaded
show presented by Hyundai

709
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:50,124
Stars have a great life

710
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,540
I want a life like Aryan's

711
01:01:52,749 --> 01:01:53,874
Full on, jet setter!

712
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,249
One day in London, Dubrovnik the next

713
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:58,207
For the grand Bhutiani wedding

714
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:00,041
Then back to the London show

715
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:00,999
Wow!

716
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:04,332
Do you know London is
one of his favourite places?

717
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:07,249
In fact he considers it his
second home after Mumbai

718
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:12,041
We have some good news
and some bad news

719
01:02:12,374 --> 01:02:13,832
The bad news first, obviously

720
01:02:14,082 --> 01:02:16,790
The Hyundai Aryan Khanna reloaded
show is houseful

721
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:18,957
Oh no! What's the good news?

722
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:22,123
We have 20 free tickets
for our listeners

723
01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:26,249
Who ever is the first to answer
my question correctly...

724
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:28,541
...wins a free show ticket

725
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:32,957
My question follows straight after
this beautiful song

726
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:46,457
Here's your tickets. Enjoy your visit

727
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,707
- How can I help you?
- One ticket please

728
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:54,582
Enjoy your visit

729
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:46,624
The real drama starts now

730
01:03:50,707 --> 01:03:51,748
Aryan Khanna!

731
01:04:03,624 --> 01:04:06,165
Mr. Khanna, Tim Baker,
the Manager

732
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,040
Aryan Khanna, the actor

733
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,291
I hope it's not a bother

734
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,457
Fans never bother

735
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:20,748
Sir, a photo with your wax figure

736
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:24,832
Let me say this. It's amazing

737
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:27,249
You've come all the way to London...

738
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:29,332
...to take a photo with
my wax figure

739
01:04:29,874 --> 01:04:33,040
Really, that's very sweet.
Is this better?

740
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:35,624
Better now?

741
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,207
Let me warn you

742
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:40,957
I was much younger then

743
01:04:42,124 --> 01:04:43,249
You like it?

744
01:04:43,499 --> 01:04:44,374
Honestly...

745
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:46,041
...it's very scary

746
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:49,499
So, does he look like me?

747
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:52,374
- You look great in real life
- Exactly, darling

748
01:04:52,707 --> 01:04:55,873
I agree. What a fat nose he has

749
01:04:56,457 --> 01:04:58,457
My nose is tiny

750
01:04:59,707 --> 01:05:01,332
A phony face

751
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:02,916
A fake smile

752
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:04,499
All phony

753
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:06,957
I don't smile like this

754
01:05:08,082 --> 01:05:10,582
Actually no one smiles like this

755
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:15,207
His hair smells bad.
Feels bad, looks bad

756
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:20,999
In fact, I don't look like him at all

757
01:05:21,749 --> 01:05:23,332
This is a fake

758
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:26,207
Aryan Khanna is a fake

759
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:30,332
I want a refund. Aryan Khanna
is a fake

760
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:35,082
This isn't right. You can't do this
to our property

761
01:05:35,874 --> 01:05:38,332
The white man claims
my face is his property

762
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:41,707
Mr. Property Agent. This is me

763
01:05:42,249 --> 01:05:43,832
My face, my property

764
01:05:44,332 --> 01:05:47,082
- Stop now and leave, sir
- I won't leave

765
01:05:51,332 --> 01:05:53,290
It's a joke. You guys can't
take a joke

766
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:00,707
Come here. Come

767
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,332
Who can stop me?

768
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:04,707
I'll shoot you all

769
01:06:06,624 --> 01:06:08,082
I don't understand what
you're talking about

770
01:06:08,457 --> 01:06:09,707
You are gonna be in a lot
of trouble over this

771
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:10,457
Really?

772
01:06:13,499 --> 01:06:15,124
You are in trouble too

773
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:18,707
Stay out of my way! I'll shoot

774
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,666
You alright?

775
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:16,916
Aryan...

776
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:20,999
What?

777
01:07:21,249 --> 01:07:22,040
Come out

778
01:07:22,332 --> 01:07:23,373
What are you saying?

779
01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:29,373
Arrest warrant for you

780
01:07:31,582 --> 01:07:32,748
What the hell is this?

781
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,957
I didn't go to Madame Tussauds

782
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:38,748
- The Indian Ambassador on line
- I'm not talking to any Ambassador

783
01:07:39,249 --> 01:07:40,374
I'm here to arrest him

784
01:07:40,874 --> 01:07:42,790
Sir, Mr. Khanna did not go to
Madame Tussauds...

785
01:07:42,999 --> 01:07:44,832
Are you Mr. Khanna?

786
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:47,082
Then just shut up and let me
do my job

787
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:50,416
Excuse me. So you are doing
your job and we are faffing?

788
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:54,082
Must say you have a very polite way
of talking to women, Mr. Duncan

789
01:07:54,707 --> 01:07:55,373
Guess what?

790
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:57,582
It's my turn to be polite now

791
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,124
This, sir, is nonsense

792
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:04,790
Where were you between
10 and 10.30 this morning?

793
01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:06,498
- I was at home
- And who were you with?

794
01:08:07,624 --> 01:08:08,332
I was alone

795
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:10,582
Did anyone see you at home?

796
01:08:11,707 --> 01:08:12,957
I just told you I was alone

797
01:08:13,207 --> 01:08:14,540
Aryan, I'll call our lawyer

798
01:08:15,082 --> 01:08:17,998
Can you talk in a language
we all can understand?

799
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:20,749
Let me translate it in a language
you understand

800
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:22,457
Lawyer

801
01:08:23,207 --> 01:08:24,332
Two options

802
01:08:24,874 --> 01:08:28,124
Handcuffs if you are nasty,
without handcuffs if you are nice

803
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:35,999
Nasty

804
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:13,707
Just five minutes

805
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,041
You stay here

806
01:09:15,249 --> 01:09:16,624
Just five minutes sir, please

807
01:09:18,082 --> 01:09:19,540
Let's call Akhtar

808
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:41,165
What happened?

809
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,332
Lost your funny bone?

810
01:09:45,499 --> 01:09:46,249
That's not me

811
01:09:47,999 --> 01:09:48,874
Behaves like you

812
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:51,540
Looks like you

813
01:09:52,832 --> 01:09:55,415
Everybody calls this person
by your name

814
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:00,249
I said that's not me

815
01:10:01,249 --> 01:10:02,249
You have any proof?

816
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:07,707
Say something, Mr. Superstar

817
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:11,832
Not to you, Mr. Small-Time cop

818
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,082
Not a word without my lawyer

819
01:10:15,124 --> 01:10:15,999
Suit yourself

820
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,291
24 hrs remand for Mr. Khanna

821
01:10:19,624 --> 01:10:21,374
Till he comes out with the truth

822
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:24,457
- You can't do that
- Sure, I can

823
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:34,665
Sir, one photograph please?

824
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,749
- You have a safe trip, sir
- Yeah, I will be

825
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,416
It's time. Lets go

826
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:08,541
DUBROVNIK

827
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,665
In Croatian, we say - How are you?

828
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:20,790
I'm fine

829
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:22,916
My name is Gaurav

830
01:12:27,832 --> 01:12:29,290
Thank you

831
01:12:35,832 --> 01:12:36,998
Vegetable sandwich... one

832
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:38,582
Which one do you want?

833
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:39,749
This one?

834
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,499
Ok. Here we go

835
01:12:45,957 --> 01:12:48,040
No, no, more. Six more

836
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,791
It's ok. Here

837
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:55,207
Thank you

838
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,124
Thanks

839
01:13:29,874 --> 01:13:30,749
It's only bail

840
01:13:32,082 --> 01:13:33,457
We know you're lying

841
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:35,707
Why would I waste my lies on you?

842
01:13:36,749 --> 01:13:39,624
That was no imposter.
You twisted psycho

843
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,582
We'll have you back
in jail in no time

844
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:43,165
Please do that

845
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:45,999
Maybe I'll earn some money suing you
and the entire British police

846
01:13:46,374 --> 01:13:49,082
Aryan, control your temper

847
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:51,665
It's their city, their country

848
01:13:52,874 --> 01:13:55,499
Don't make matters worse
for yourself

849
01:13:55,957 --> 01:13:58,290
So we're done with all
the formalities?

850
01:13:59,332 --> 01:14:00,165
Thanks a lot

851
01:14:01,499 --> 01:14:02,707
Pathetic fool

852
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:07,166
I'm coming with you to Dubrovnik
in case of any immigration problem

853
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:09,207
Hey! Not that way

854
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:11,582
The press is outside

855
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:16,791
Aryan, this is Deputy High
Commissioner, Mr. Murthy

856
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,749
Pleased to meet you

857
01:14:19,082 --> 01:14:20,915
Sorry you had to go through
all this but...

858
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,873
We can't interfere very much

859
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:24,665
This is a foreign country after all

860
01:14:24,999 --> 01:14:27,832
I know. Rules in every country
are made to get the innocent

861
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:30,957
Sir, we're diplomats, not detectives

862
01:14:31,457 --> 01:14:34,832
Before the case is solved, we have
permission for you to travel

863
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,749
Now we can only do that much

864
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:39,416
It's a serious matter.
A diplomatic issue

865
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:43,041
So you must prove it wasn't you
at Madame Tussauds

866
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:46,416
Must I prove it? Ok, I'll play cop

867
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,332
I really appreciate your help

868
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:50,707
Thank you

869
01:14:51,332 --> 01:14:52,790
Thank you, sir

870
01:14:55,499 --> 01:14:57,499
In jail or dancing at a wedding...

871
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:59,749
...these stars are so arrogant

872
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:05,582
Your home CCTV footage has saved us.
It's with the police

873
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:09,832
It proves an impostor was at Madame
Tussauds and you were at home

874
01:15:10,582 --> 01:15:12,998
Who is he? What's his motive

875
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:14,541
Forget the London cops

876
01:15:14,791 --> 01:15:16,666
Find out. We need to get this guy

877
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,874
We'll know more back in London

878
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:22,041
So you know you can
really relax now

879
01:15:22,207 --> 01:15:23,790
Wine? Champagne? Anything?

880
01:15:24,582 --> 01:15:25,123
Everything

881
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:26,957
Come on, Aryan. It's over now

882
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:29,082
Sir, a call

883
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,457
He says he knows the imposter
at Madame Tussauds

884
01:15:33,082 --> 01:15:35,873
- Give me the phone. I'll talk
- He'll only talk to sir

885
01:15:36,082 --> 01:15:37,415
He won't give me his name

886
01:15:38,624 --> 01:15:39,624
Give it to me

887
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,207
Hello

888
01:15:53,999 --> 01:15:54,832
Senior

889
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:01,291
Chandna?

890
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,332
I won't let you forget my name

891
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:06,791
It'll be taken in the same breath
as your name

892
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:08,582
What do you want?

893
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:10,124
The stage is set

894
01:16:10,624 --> 01:16:13,749
Tell everyone - admit what you did
was wrong

895
01:16:14,499 --> 01:16:17,415
You'll never break a fan's heart
again. Say sorry

896
01:16:17,749 --> 01:16:20,415
Stop this nonsense! I'm not
apologising to anyone

897
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:23,415
I tried to make you see sense

898
01:16:23,707 --> 01:16:26,332
If you had agreed to give me
5 minutes

899
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,790
I would have my life.
You would have yours

900
01:16:29,249 --> 01:16:31,707
But you had to prove you had
star power

901
01:16:31,999 --> 01:16:33,290
Now you'll see a fan's power

902
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:34,457
I'm a star

903
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:38,166
I took your pranks as childishness.
Threw you inside for only 2 days

904
01:16:39,124 --> 01:16:41,540
If I knew the real you,
you'd still be inside

905
01:16:41,832 --> 01:16:45,123
In 48 hours you snatched away
my devotion of 25 years

906
01:16:46,124 --> 01:16:47,874
If you don't say sorry...

907
01:16:48,332 --> 01:16:50,457
...in the next 48 hours,
your stardom is over

908
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:52,541
Do what you want

909
01:16:53,749 --> 01:16:55,707
I've seen off dozens like you

910
01:16:56,124 --> 01:16:59,374
The higher you fly, the harder
I'll make you fall

911
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:04,249
But you must fly as high as me,
Gaurav Chandna

912
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,207
Impossible for you

913
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:11,582
We'll see how far you get
impersonating me

914
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:14,332
I don't need to go far

915
01:17:14,999 --> 01:17:17,832
You're getting closer to me.
In Dubrovnik

916
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:24,166
Idiot. He's in Dubrovnik

917
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:30,707
Unknown caller, unknown location

918
01:17:31,207 --> 01:17:34,832
Obviously, Sunaina. He won't
call from a traceable number

919
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:40,457
Say sorry. It's no big deal

920
01:17:43,499 --> 01:17:44,582
He's mad

921
01:17:44,874 --> 01:17:47,415
Is that so? And what am I?

922
01:17:52,082 --> 01:17:53,207
Is the make-up team in place?

923
01:17:53,374 --> 01:17:54,999
They are on there way

924
01:17:55,249 --> 01:17:58,332
Oh great. The props, fireworks,
confetti all that

925
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,748
We've done a couple of rehearsals.
Everything's perfect

926
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:02,165
Ok. Thank you

927
01:18:03,249 --> 01:18:05,374
Aryan asked for a background
check of all the staff members

928
01:18:05,624 --> 01:18:07,207
- Is it done yet?
- It's going on right now

929
01:18:07,457 --> 01:18:08,415
Ok. Thank you

930
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:13,707
Nicksi Jelopera

931
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:28,749
- Medium?
- Medium size

932
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:17,249
You're so late, Aryan Khanna.
It's just not done

933
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:19,874
I apologise. I'm extremely sorry,
Mr. Bhutiani

934
01:19:20,124 --> 01:19:21,624
I had a crisis, I'm sorry

935
01:19:21,832 --> 01:19:24,748
You celebrities always have
some crisis

936
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:27,166
But my daughter doesn't
get married everyday

937
01:19:27,374 --> 01:19:29,332
- I know. I'm sorry
- You've no idea

938
01:19:29,582 --> 01:19:33,498
That stunt you pulled in London has
caused me great loss of face

939
01:19:33,749 --> 01:19:34,915
No, Mr. Bhutiani

940
01:19:35,249 --> 01:19:37,374
What happened at Madame Tussauds...

941
01:19:38,582 --> 01:19:40,540
You know what? I'll make
it up to you

942
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:44,332
I swear. Your guests will always think
of the grand Bhutiani wedding

943
01:19:44,624 --> 01:19:45,832
They better do

944
01:19:46,124 --> 01:19:47,957
After all I'm spending
a bomb on you

945
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,541
Only you can. I'll get ready

946
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,624
Sunaina, find out where
the CCTV cameras are

947
01:19:57,874 --> 01:20:01,249
Usman, watch the guest areas,
the bars, the toilets, the corridors

948
01:20:01,582 --> 01:20:03,748
- Keep an eye on everyone
- Excuse me, sir

949
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,374
I'm really sorry to interrupt but
we just have 2 minutes

950
01:20:06,957 --> 01:20:09,332
I don't need two, darling.
Let's go, I'm ready

951
01:20:10,124 --> 01:20:11,165
Good luck

952
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:12,999
Payal, tell me the names

953
01:20:13,249 --> 01:20:15,415
Is Bhutiani's son-in-law called
Amul Mirchandani?

954
01:20:15,624 --> 01:20:16,874
It's Anmol Mirchandani

955
01:20:17,082 --> 01:20:19,040
Guys, all the best. Break
a leg and do well

956
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:21,166
And sisters Anushka, Deepshika?

957
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,749
That's for later, it's all here

958
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:26,915
Second entry dance 5,6,7,8.
You're giving it to me

959
01:20:27,124 --> 01:20:28,749
- Sir, your shades
- Thank you, Payal

960
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:30,874
Ok guys. You have 30 seconds
to go

961
01:20:31,124 --> 01:20:32,665
All the best, just kill it

962
01:21:17,749 --> 01:21:19,415
Check all entries and exits

963
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:20,957
Ok, Sunaina

964
01:21:33,624 --> 01:21:34,582
Find anything?

965
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:38,540
Not yet, sir. I've spoken to the team,
no one enters without an invite

966
01:21:38,749 --> 01:21:40,290
Sir, your cue cards

967
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:41,874
15 secs to go

968
01:21:43,249 --> 01:21:44,040
Can you go to cam 4

969
01:21:48,374 --> 01:21:50,582
When you count the night stars...

970
01:21:50,874 --> 01:21:52,957
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

971
01:21:53,499 --> 01:21:54,957
You know you're in love

972
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:57,457
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

973
01:21:57,832 --> 01:22:01,748
When you look for her in a crowd,
you know you're in love

974
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,249
“Say sorry”

975
01:22:09,207 --> 01:22:10,665
Check the crew's photos

976
01:22:11,082 --> 01:22:13,582
He's not a guest. He's crew.
Quick

977
01:22:13,874 --> 01:22:14,540
Got it

978
01:22:18,749 --> 01:22:19,540
Sorry

979
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,582
There. Zoom in

980
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,124
Check the crew backstage

981
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:38,207
Copy

982
01:22:38,499 --> 01:22:41,832
Payal, we need the crew ids.
Photographs and bio-datas

983
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,957
- Anything serious, sir?
- Aryan wants to know

984
01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,166
Sorry

985
01:22:59,332 --> 01:22:59,957
It's fine

986
01:23:03,332 --> 01:23:05,082
The crew is local

987
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:08,249
Except one guy. Half Indian,
half Croatian

988
01:23:10,624 --> 01:23:12,832
Akhtar is sending you a photo
of him

989
01:23:13,332 --> 01:23:14,540
Keep a close eye

990
01:23:19,999 --> 01:23:20,915
Round up all the crew

991
01:23:51,082 --> 01:23:53,082
- Any sign of him?
- Sir, nothing

992
01:23:53,374 --> 01:23:54,832
He's not responding

993
01:23:55,332 --> 01:23:55,873
Sunaina

994
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:57,666
Can't see him on any camera

995
01:23:58,082 --> 01:23:59,665
- But I'm at it
- What are you at it?

996
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,082
Where is there no CCTV camera?

997
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:10,207
Your make-up room

998
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:20,124
Careful, sir

999
01:24:38,832 --> 01:24:41,207
“Gaurav makes Aryan”

1000
01:24:52,332 --> 01:24:54,915
You're very stubborn.
You don't listen to me

1001
01:24:55,499 --> 01:24:58,540
Why are you hiding?
Talk face-to-face

1002
01:24:59,207 --> 01:25:01,248
I stand face-to-face, Aryan Khanna

1003
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:04,249
But you never see me

1004
01:25:04,916 --> 01:25:08,749
Now when I'm not there, you're
longing to see me

1005
01:25:10,332 --> 01:25:12,332
I know the feeling

1006
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:15,082
I felt it among the crowd
in front of your house

1007
01:25:20,957 --> 01:25:24,540
Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.
The audience interaction...

1008
01:25:25,374 --> 01:25:27,999
Yeah. I'm coming

1009
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,748
- I'll take care of it
- Thank you

1010
01:25:33,332 --> 01:25:35,415
I'll come back and see you.
Hi sweetheart

1011
01:25:35,832 --> 01:25:37,123
Hope you enjoyed the show

1012
01:25:37,457 --> 01:25:39,457
- Aryan, it was marvelous
- Thank you

1013
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:40,998
That's my daughter

1014
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:44,541
She's been practicing a step to
dance with you for two months

1015
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:46,665
Actually we were both practicing

1016
01:25:46,874 --> 01:25:48,249
How pretty is she

1017
01:25:48,457 --> 01:25:50,415
You know what? Let me start
with the young one

1018
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:52,166
...and I'll come back
for the experience

1019
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:17,832
We've found Chandna

1020
01:26:18,124 --> 01:26:21,249
In the corridor, across from where
you're dancing

1021
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,124
I'm not dancing

1022
01:26:24,082 --> 01:26:25,373
Chandna is on the dance floor

1023
01:27:15,374 --> 01:27:17,040
What the hell is wrong with him?

1024
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:21,124
I was dancing. He started touching me
here, there, everywhere

1025
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:23,249
I don't know. You'll have
to do something

1026
01:27:23,499 --> 01:27:25,415
- Get him out
- I don't care

1027
01:27:36,832 --> 01:27:37,998
What the hell are you doing?

1028
01:27:38,249 --> 01:27:39,040
Mr. Bhutiani?

1029
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:41,416
- Where do you think you are?
- Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani

1030
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,791
- What happened?
- That girl is like my daughter

1031
01:27:45,457 --> 01:27:47,332
Is this how you film stars behave?

1032
01:27:47,499 --> 01:27:49,749
I'm really sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry

1033
01:27:49,957 --> 01:27:52,915
I'll explain. The guy who was
here wasn't me

1034
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:55,124
- Nonsense
- It was somebody else

1035
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:56,582
I'm Aryan Khanna

1036
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:58,749
- I'm Aryan Khanna
- What nonsense!

1037
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:00,457
You known me for years

1038
01:28:00,624 --> 01:28:03,374
I love you guys. I'd never
harm you people

1039
01:28:03,582 --> 01:28:05,540
That person wasn't me

1040
01:28:07,124 --> 01:28:08,874
I suggest you leave

1041
01:28:22,624 --> 01:28:23,915
Keep back!

1042
01:28:34,832 --> 01:28:35,457
Stop the car!

1043
01:33:56,874 --> 01:33:59,249
No one has given me the
interaction script

1044
01:34:00,332 --> 01:34:03,498
15 minutes to show time.
Is there a delay?

1045
01:34:08,041 --> 01:34:08,916
What?

1046
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:17,249
The show's cancelled

1047
01:34:18,457 --> 01:34:22,415
They've boycotted the show

1048
01:34:23,999 --> 01:34:26,457
Sponsors have also pulled out

1049
01:34:28,957 --> 01:34:31,540
Nobody came, not a soul

1050
01:35:42,874 --> 01:35:43,874
What's wrong with you?

1051
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:44,666
You wimp

1052
01:35:44,832 --> 01:35:45,998
Watch where you're going?

1053
01:35:59,082 --> 01:36:00,873
Media playing up the story

1054
01:36:01,457 --> 01:36:02,790
The wedding video has gone viral

1055
01:36:19,666 --> 01:36:23,374
“Given Khanna's status, he must
take responsibility for his actions

1056
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:25,166
“Is he attention-seeking?

1057
01:36:25,374 --> 01:36:27,832
“Movie stars forget that one day
they'll be has-beens

1058
01:36:27,999 --> 01:36:30,832
“Stars must go through traumas.
Look at what his done

1059
01:36:31,124 --> 01:36:33,124
“It's a crime if an ordinary man
misbehaves...

1060
01:36:33,332 --> 01:36:36,082
“...if it's a star - it's a stunt.
Why these double standards...

1061
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,915
“. ..for stars? A criminal is
a criminal”

1062
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:49,082
Hello

1063
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:52,207
Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan.
I'm calling from London

1064
01:36:52,874 --> 01:36:55,457
I know you are in London,
but what's going on?

1065
01:36:57,124 --> 01:37:00,040
A Delhi boy is impersonating me,
committing crimes

1066
01:37:00,457 --> 01:37:01,707
We have to arrest him

1067
01:37:01,957 --> 01:37:05,082
But the crimes are committed
outside of India

1068
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:08,541
We can't arrest him. It's not
in our jurisdiction

1069
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:11,291
Must we wait till he commits
a crime in India?

1070
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:13,790
His name is Gaurav Chandna

1071
01:37:13,957 --> 01:37:16,540
Find me his Delhi address.
It will help

1072
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:19,082
You don't teach me my job

1073
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:22,957
But who shall we arrest?
You're the accused, Aryan

1074
01:37:23,749 --> 01:37:25,415
I just...

1075
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:27,457
Come back to India

1076
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:31,124
Then we'll look into the matter with
the proper procedure. OK?

1077
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:34,582
Hello

1078
01:37:38,124 --> 01:37:39,207
What did he say?

1079
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:44,207
Organise a press conference
first thing tomorrow

1080
01:37:44,707 --> 01:37:47,332
- In Mumbai?
- No, here in London

1081
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:55,332
You now have the video footage
and all the documents, etc

1082
01:37:57,124 --> 01:37:58,832
You have proof...

1083
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:03,249
...that Aryan Khanna did not
commit these crimes

1084
01:38:12,707 --> 01:38:16,290
You're angry with me, and you
have the right to be

1085
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:18,541
But believe me

1086
01:38:19,207 --> 01:38:22,082
That dangerous and evil face
you see on TV is not me

1087
01:38:22,707 --> 01:38:24,165
That person is not me

1088
01:38:24,374 --> 01:38:25,457
So please give me time

1089
01:38:25,624 --> 01:38:29,332
Time, so that I can prove
I've done nothing wrong

1090
01:38:31,124 --> 01:38:34,082
I'd never do anything that
would make you ashamed...

1091
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,916
...to call me your star

1092
01:38:36,624 --> 01:38:37,999
Whatever I am...

1093
01:38:42,332 --> 01:38:46,082
I just want to say, I would
never do anything like this

1094
01:38:47,082 --> 01:38:47,957
Thank you

1095
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:54,124
Sir, do you know this impostor?
Have you met him?

1096
01:38:54,582 --> 01:38:58,415
Sorry. We can't talk now.
The case is under trial

1097
01:38:58,624 --> 01:38:59,999
What about the imposter's name?

1098
01:39:00,332 --> 01:39:03,165
As soon as we have proof,
you'll be the first to know

1099
01:39:03,999 --> 01:39:06,499
Are you the real Aryan Khanna
or the imposter?

1100
01:39:10,457 --> 01:39:12,498
You find this funny? A big joke?

1101
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:17,957
If this happened to a girl in your
family would you still be grinning?

1102
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:23,166
A woman was molested and
you find it's funny?

1103
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:25,791
And one more thing

1104
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:29,707
This press meet is not
to prove my innocence

1105
01:39:30,499 --> 01:39:32,332
I want to warn you all

1106
01:39:33,457 --> 01:39:36,498
The man who's impersonating me,
spoiling my name

1107
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:39,624
He can hurt anyone, anytime

1108
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,541
So please be careful

1109
01:39:43,624 --> 01:39:45,124
Thank you everybody.
Thanks for coming

1110
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:47,791
Aryan has a flight to catch, he's
going back to India

1111
01:39:47,999 --> 01:39:49,582
So have a great day and
see you soon

1112
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:52,416
MUMBAI

1113
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,832
Don't stop, go from behind

1114
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:17,957
Open up!

1115
01:40:20,082 --> 01:40:22,957
One minute, sir. Madam said we must
inform her

1116
01:40:23,374 --> 01:40:24,749
Good. Hurry up

1117
01:40:24,957 --> 01:40:26,873
Before the journalists outside mob me

1118
01:40:32,499 --> 01:40:32,999
Hello

1119
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:35,041
Ma'am, can sir come in?

1120
01:40:38,457 --> 01:40:39,665
No, wait a second

1121
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:44,666
- Are you sure it's him?
- It sounds like sir

1122
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:47,248
Ask him to face the camera

1123
01:40:48,749 --> 01:40:50,874
Sir, ma'am wants you to step forward

1124
01:40:56,832 --> 01:41:00,373
Hi, I am Aryan Khanna. Height 5'10.
Black hair, black eyes

1125
01:41:00,749 --> 01:41:01,915
A big nose

1126
01:41:02,082 --> 01:41:03,790
School: Kendriya Vidyalaya,
New Delhi

1127
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:06,707
Hans Raj College, Delhi University

1128
01:41:08,249 --> 01:41:09,957
Give me the phone, quick!

1129
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:13,498
The press will surround me

1130
01:41:14,832 --> 01:41:17,332
Let me in. Or I'll end up
in their arms

1131
01:41:17,582 --> 01:41:18,957
Why is your phone off?

1132
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:21,998
Can I tell you inside?

1133
01:41:24,874 --> 01:41:25,915
Open the door

1134
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:38,082
Guys. Dad's here

1135
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:06,332
Aryan, you're back?

1136
01:42:18,749 --> 01:42:20,165
- Hi
- Hi

1137
01:42:20,832 --> 01:42:23,248
- You're back
- Yes, I'm back

1138
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:26,916
Are the kids asleep?

1139
01:42:32,249 --> 01:42:34,665
Yes. It's way past their bedtime

1140
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:36,749
Of course

1141
01:42:37,374 --> 01:42:38,999
Let them sleep

1142
01:42:40,374 --> 01:42:44,165
Let's relax and talk quietly
in our room

1143
01:42:48,666 --> 01:42:49,499
Yes

1144
01:42:55,666 --> 01:42:59,916
- What an entrance exam!
- You passed with flying colours

1145
01:43:00,249 --> 01:43:02,624
I spent my life preparing
for this moment

1146
01:43:03,124 --> 01:43:05,665
Relax. Make yourself a drink.
I'll run the shower for you

1147
01:43:05,957 --> 01:43:07,332
Of course

1148
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:26,041
She was crying. Not easy getting
her to sleep again

1149
01:43:30,916 --> 01:43:34,166
It's better for us both if Isha
stays asleep

1150
01:43:41,041 --> 01:43:42,332
I did say...

1151
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:45,707
...we could talk calmly

1152
01:43:47,874 --> 01:43:49,124
Why do you need that?

1153
01:43:49,749 --> 01:43:50,707
Give

1154
01:43:51,499 --> 01:43:55,082
I have nothing against you
or your children

1155
01:43:56,749 --> 01:43:57,790
Give me that

1156
01:44:00,832 --> 01:44:02,457
Senior ignores me

1157
01:44:03,832 --> 01:44:05,540
You can't let him do that

1158
01:44:07,707 --> 01:44:11,665
Show me Aryan's study, he's
always talking about it

1159
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,374
Sound asleep

1160
01:44:17,499 --> 01:44:18,874
Come, come

1161
01:44:27,249 --> 01:44:29,915
Sit. He lands in 20 minutes.
I haven't much time

1162
01:44:30,624 --> 01:44:32,165
Come on, sit down

1163
01:44:37,249 --> 01:44:39,249
This room has so many stories

1164
01:44:41,749 --> 01:44:43,874
Many stories behind these awards

1165
01:44:45,166 --> 01:44:46,666
In these costumes

1166
01:44:48,499 --> 01:44:50,874
Days that Aryan does not want
to forget

1167
01:44:51,749 --> 01:44:55,290
Memories he wants to keep close
to his heart

1168
01:45:01,457 --> 01:45:03,873
I treasured his memories too

1169
01:45:04,874 --> 01:45:07,665
Kept them right here

1170
01:45:10,499 --> 01:45:14,582
At home, on the walls of my room,
in cupboards

1171
01:45:15,332 --> 01:45:16,915
On shelves like these

1172
01:45:26,291 --> 01:45:29,707
Aryan Khanna filled every corner
of my life

1173
01:45:31,374 --> 01:45:32,957
But he ended it all

1174
01:45:33,332 --> 01:45:36,915
Five minutes! I asked him for
only five minutes

1175
01:45:37,332 --> 01:45:39,915
Know what he said?
“It's my life

1176
01:45:40,249 --> 01:45:42,290
Why must I give you even
five seconds of it?”

1177
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:50,123
- I apologise on his behalf
- Why should you apologise?

1178
01:45:51,582 --> 01:45:53,623
I hit Sid Kapoor for his sake

1179
01:45:54,582 --> 01:45:56,082
He was hassling Aryan

1180
01:45:56,999 --> 01:45:59,665
What did Aryan do? Threw me in jail.
Had me beaten

1181
01:46:01,082 --> 01:46:05,582
Said: “It's a crime!” A crime?

1182
01:46:07,499 --> 01:46:09,040
Crime is what I'll do now

1183
01:46:11,249 --> 01:46:14,999
Breaking hearts of fans who are
devoted to you...

1184
01:46:15,707 --> 01:46:17,332
...Is a crime too

1185
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,457
You tell me

1186
01:46:23,707 --> 01:46:25,373
Am I so wrong?

1187
01:46:26,707 --> 01:46:30,248
When he fights with you,
doesn't he say sorry?

1188
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:35,707
So, why can't he say sorry to me?
Tell me!

1189
01:46:36,041 --> 01:46:38,207
Don't do this. I beg you

1190
01:46:38,416 --> 01:46:40,249
What do you mean “please”?

1191
01:46:41,457 --> 01:46:43,832
He left nothing for me. Why must
I leave anything for him?

1192
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:46,124
How can I? Impossible

1193
01:46:47,374 --> 01:46:49,082
A sham. All lies

1194
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:52,707
Liar. He's a fake

1195
01:46:54,291 --> 01:46:55,874
The rascal acts all the time

1196
01:46:57,249 --> 01:46:58,707
An actor after all

1197
01:47:07,457 --> 01:47:09,415
I wanted to give him my trophy

1198
01:47:14,957 --> 01:47:17,040
A belated happy birthday,
Aryan Khanna

1199
01:47:38,749 --> 01:47:39,915
Open the door!

1200
01:47:57,624 --> 01:47:59,915
I sent the children to my parents

1201
01:48:01,082 --> 01:48:04,623
They were terrified. I didn't know
what to tell them

1202
01:48:05,832 --> 01:48:08,790
Isha asked me repeatedly: “Why did
Papa destroy the study?

1203
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:11,249
Don't worry. It's ok

1204
01:48:11,457 --> 01:48:14,873
- Why don't we call the police?
- The police will do nothing

1205
01:48:15,707 --> 01:48:18,040
They'll ask for proof. They believe
I'm the criminal

1206
01:48:19,457 --> 01:48:21,957
I came this far in life
on my own steam

1207
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:25,166
I'll handle it myself

1208
01:48:28,582 --> 01:48:30,707
Play rough like a street hoodlum

1209
01:48:31,499 --> 01:48:33,749
I'll rip him apart. Send him back
to where he belongs

1210
01:48:35,957 --> 01:48:38,582
Gaurav Chandna has seen my star face

1211
01:48:39,916 --> 01:48:41,957
Now he'll see my real face

1212
01:48:43,541 --> 01:48:44,791
I'm a Delhi man too

1213
01:48:46,832 --> 01:48:50,082
The dangerous and evil face
on the news is not me

1214
01:48:50,874 --> 01:48:52,540
That person is not me.
Give me time

1215
01:48:52,957 --> 01:48:54,998
I'll prove I've done nothing wrong

1216
01:48:55,166 --> 01:48:58,791
I'd never do anything to make you
ashamed calling me your star

1217
01:48:59,124 --> 01:49:02,499
Aryan Khanna's press conference
proves that he is innocent

1218
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:06,416
A criminal is impersonating him
and committing crimes

1219
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:10,207
Who is the culprit? His name?
His whereabouts?

1220
01:49:10,457 --> 01:49:13,915
No one knows the motives
behind his terrible actions

1221
01:49:15,624 --> 01:49:20,124
The police have informed us that
they're very hopeful...

1222
01:49:20,707 --> 01:49:23,540
...this criminal will not escape them

1223
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:26,415
When he's arrested, he'll be
severely punished

1224
01:49:50,749 --> 01:49:51,874
Hello, Gauru

1225
01:49:52,957 --> 01:49:53,748
Mummy

1226
01:49:54,374 --> 01:49:57,124
What's wrong with your phone?
Where are you, Gauru?

1227
01:49:57,582 --> 01:49:58,373
Right here

1228
01:49:59,082 --> 01:49:59,998
I'm ok

1229
01:50:01,707 --> 01:50:02,665
And you?

1230
01:50:02,874 --> 01:50:06,124
Son, come home soon.
We're in trouble

1231
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:12,749
You've roamed the world, now return
to your home

1232
01:50:16,916 --> 01:50:17,624
Aryan?

1233
01:50:19,457 --> 01:50:20,790
You barged into my home?

1234
01:50:21,541 --> 01:50:24,749
You can barge into mine, can't I
do the same?

1235
01:50:26,707 --> 01:50:29,290
I came here to grab your
parents by the throat

1236
01:50:29,457 --> 01:50:31,665
To ask why they produced
a nasty son like you

1237
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:35,666
- But I am not a lowlife like you
- Don't drag my parents into this

1238
01:50:36,166 --> 01:50:37,666
They did nothing

1239
01:50:38,582 --> 01:50:39,582
What did my kids do?

1240
01:50:40,124 --> 01:50:43,624
I went alone into your fortress.
Did you bring an army?

1241
01:50:43,916 --> 01:50:45,749
I am here alone, Gaurav Chandna

1242
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:49,874
No security, no secretary.
No star, no hero

1243
01:50:50,249 --> 01:50:52,624
If you have the guts, face me

1244
01:50:52,999 --> 01:50:54,165
Settle the score

1245
01:50:55,832 --> 01:50:58,707
The score will only be settled
when you apologise

1246
01:50:59,791 --> 01:51:02,791
Get on the stage at the Inder Vihar
contest and say sorry

1247
01:51:02,999 --> 01:51:03,957
And listen...

1248
01:51:04,874 --> 01:51:07,374
If you touch my parents with
a feather even...

1249
01:51:07,957 --> 01:51:12,040
I know your mother-in-law's house,
where your children are hiding

1250
01:51:13,249 --> 01:51:14,999
Your daughter is very cute, by God

1251
01:51:18,874 --> 01:51:21,290
- Your son is stubborn like you
- You rascal

1252
01:51:21,874 --> 01:51:25,624
I'll bury you in a gutter here, if you
dream of harming my kids

1253
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:31,041
What will my parents think?

1254
01:51:32,874 --> 01:51:34,165
Such a big star...

1255
01:51:36,332 --> 01:51:37,873
...with such a foul tongue

1256
01:51:40,707 --> 01:51:41,790
Forget it

1257
01:51:43,124 --> 01:51:45,915
See you at the contest

1258
01:51:48,374 --> 01:51:49,957
Your son has lost his mind

1259
01:51:51,082 --> 01:51:54,165
- He's crossed the line
- Our Gaurav was not like that

1260
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:56,999
He was a good boy

1261
01:51:58,166 --> 01:52:00,041
He changed after meeting you

1262
01:52:01,249 --> 01:52:03,749
What would you have lost
if you gave him 5 mins?

1263
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:05,791
Don't blame Aryan

1264
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:07,416
It's our fault

1265
01:52:08,957 --> 01:52:12,165
We let him get obsessed by
your glamorous life

1266
01:52:13,332 --> 01:52:16,290
Not your hard slog. He would've
followed your example

1267
01:52:16,957 --> 01:52:20,123
Worked hard and become someone

1268
01:52:21,499 --> 01:52:25,165
Then the call center girl could've
become his girlfriend or wife

1269
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,624
He has a girlfriend?

1270
01:52:30,541 --> 01:52:33,874
A one-way romance.
Gaurav loves her but...

1271
01:52:34,082 --> 01:52:37,748
Enough. We have to accept things
the way they are

1272
01:52:38,207 --> 01:52:42,040
- Where's the contest held?
- The other end of the colony

1273
01:52:43,291 --> 01:52:46,416
Apologise. End this terrible situation

1274
01:52:46,707 --> 01:52:48,165
You think I'm wrong too?

1275
01:52:48,457 --> 01:52:49,707
And I must apologise?

1276
01:52:50,207 --> 01:52:51,498
Arrest him

1277
01:52:53,707 --> 01:52:55,707
He must be punished

1278
01:52:57,499 --> 01:53:01,290
Imprison him for years, if you must

1279
01:53:05,457 --> 01:53:06,832
But don't beat him

1280
01:53:07,957 --> 01:53:08,915
Please

1281
01:54:14,916 --> 01:54:17,499
Hey Junior. Where were you?

1282
01:54:18,082 --> 01:54:20,207
- Hello Uncle, Aunty
- Hello

1283
01:54:20,541 --> 01:54:23,249
Have you been watching the
news on TV about Aryan?

1284
01:54:24,207 --> 01:54:25,415
Never mind

1285
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:28,166
I have good news for you all

1286
01:54:28,624 --> 01:54:30,040
I've got my American visa

1287
01:54:30,416 --> 01:54:31,832
I knew it

1288
01:54:34,499 --> 01:54:37,290
Why is he standing with his back
to me? It's not like him

1289
01:54:39,124 --> 01:54:41,832
He's going on stage soon,
he's just nervous

1290
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:43,457
Him? And nervous?

1291
01:54:43,707 --> 01:54:46,832
Has he done anything in life
besides copying Aryan?

1292
01:54:47,624 --> 01:54:50,290
Hey Superstar, your make-up...

1293
01:54:59,666 --> 01:55:00,207
Neha

1294
01:55:03,957 --> 01:55:05,748
I have to talk to you

1295
01:55:08,249 --> 01:55:10,624
Super surprise!

1296
01:55:11,666 --> 01:55:14,374
Western Union - moving money
for better

1297
01:55:14,666 --> 01:55:17,874
Now for the last act of the
Super Star competition

1298
01:55:18,666 --> 01:55:20,499
Our favourite winner

1299
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:24,041
Our Junior Aryan Khanna

1300
01:55:28,499 --> 01:55:30,249
He's a criminal!

1301
01:55:30,874 --> 01:55:32,124
Get him off the stage

1302
01:55:42,499 --> 01:55:43,624
Calm down

1303
01:55:43,832 --> 01:55:45,748
It's not the real Aryan Khanna

1304
01:55:45,957 --> 01:55:48,707
It's our very own superstar...

1305
01:55:49,249 --> 01:55:50,290
Gaurav Chandna

1306
01:55:50,499 --> 01:55:51,582
Give him a big hand!

1307
01:56:26,374 --> 01:56:29,749
I do a show for Aryan every year

1308
01:56:30,624 --> 01:56:32,874
I know, Aunty. You cheer the loudest

1309
01:56:34,291 --> 01:56:35,749
But this year's show...

1310
01:56:36,957 --> 01:56:38,290
The show today is for...

1311
01:56:39,874 --> 01:56:40,707
...someone else

1312
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:44,666
The girl over there who is...

1313
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:47,374
...smiling at me. She's my friend

1314
01:56:48,624 --> 01:56:49,582
Neha!

1315
01:56:50,457 --> 01:56:51,748
Come, babes

1316
01:56:58,332 --> 01:57:01,748
There's something I've kept
in my heart for days

1317
01:57:05,416 --> 01:57:06,082
I love you, Neha

1318
01:57:08,791 --> 01:57:10,874
- I love you too, Aryan
- Not Aryan

1319
01:57:11,249 --> 01:57:13,415
Gaurav loves you

1320
01:57:15,916 --> 01:57:18,332
Gaurav loves Neha

1321
01:57:20,416 --> 01:57:21,249
What nonsense!

1322
01:57:21,749 --> 01:57:22,457
Get lost

1323
01:57:22,707 --> 01:57:25,207
- He's nuts
- Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna

1324
01:57:25,457 --> 01:57:26,165
Get him off

1325
01:57:26,374 --> 01:57:29,624
Wait! He is talking to me.
I'll deal with it

1326
01:57:31,957 --> 01:57:34,540
I love you!

1327
01:57:34,999 --> 01:57:37,374
Drop it. You love only Aryan

1328
01:57:37,624 --> 01:57:39,165
He can go to hell

1329
01:57:39,457 --> 01:57:42,332
- Is that you talking?
- It's not just talk

1330
01:57:42,791 --> 01:57:43,916
I've sent him to hell

1331
01:57:44,916 --> 01:57:47,041
I fixed Aryan Khanna for good

1332
01:57:47,457 --> 01:57:49,832
First in London, then in Dubrovnik

1333
01:57:50,582 --> 01:57:53,040
I made my way into his house too

1334
01:57:55,874 --> 01:57:58,540
Smashed everything in sight

1335
01:57:59,791 --> 01:58:02,707
If you don't believe me, read the
papers. Watch TV or the Net

1336
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:06,374
Your Gaurav is famous the world over

1337
01:58:07,457 --> 01:58:08,998
I'm no less than Aryan

1338
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:10,707
Not at all

1339
01:58:11,957 --> 01:58:13,540
I am a star in real life

1340
01:58:14,416 --> 01:58:17,041
Not a star. A monster

1341
01:58:17,624 --> 01:58:18,457
What?

1342
01:58:18,749 --> 01:58:20,957
They all think you're a star

1343
01:58:21,416 --> 01:58:23,499
While you shamed Inder Vihar

1344
01:58:23,832 --> 01:58:24,915
Listen to her

1345
01:58:25,291 --> 01:58:27,374
I became a monster for her

1346
01:58:27,707 --> 01:58:29,290
I don't want to know a monster

1347
01:58:29,541 --> 01:58:31,541
A monster! Forget it

1348
01:58:31,874 --> 01:58:34,499
Take my hand and say:
“I love you too”

1349
01:58:34,832 --> 01:58:36,040
- Let go
- I won't

1350
01:58:58,374 --> 01:58:59,415
I'm very sorry, Neha

1351
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:00,749
Are you ok?

1352
01:59:00,999 --> 01:59:01,957
Thank you

1353
01:59:02,457 --> 01:59:04,873
Aryan. He's a good guy

1354
01:59:10,082 --> 01:59:10,832
Gaurav!

1355
01:59:19,666 --> 01:59:20,624
Get down!

1356
02:03:51,999 --> 02:03:53,040
Enough!

1357
02:03:54,957 --> 02:03:56,873
Enough of this game

1358
02:03:57,957 --> 02:03:58,707
Get up!

1359
02:04:04,041 --> 02:04:05,374
I am happy in my life

1360
02:04:06,582 --> 02:04:08,290
Can't you be happy in yours?

1361
02:04:11,749 --> 02:04:13,290
Be a good son to your parents

1362
02:04:15,082 --> 02:04:16,873
A good friend, a good boyfriend

1363
02:04:18,749 --> 02:04:21,207
Stop being a fan

1364
02:04:28,374 --> 02:04:30,415
What's the difference between us?

1365
02:04:32,332 --> 02:04:34,207
I came from the same streets

1366
02:04:34,957 --> 02:04:36,665
I had normal parents like you

1367
02:04:37,832 --> 02:04:40,207
A regular house, regular school,
regular friends

1368
02:04:57,374 --> 02:04:58,999
I made my way up alone

1369
02:05:01,416 --> 02:05:02,916
Not in anyone's shadow

1370
02:05:06,124 --> 02:05:06,915
I'm human

1371
02:05:08,791 --> 02:05:12,457
I laugh and cry, get mad like you.
I have a family. Responsibilities

1372
02:05:13,624 --> 02:05:16,290
I don't have the time to meet
all my fans

1373
02:05:24,874 --> 02:05:26,082
I'll say it again

1374
02:05:28,249 --> 02:05:29,624
I'll forget all this

1375
02:05:30,874 --> 02:05:31,957
You do the same

1376
02:05:33,124 --> 02:05:33,957
Start over

1377
02:05:35,624 --> 02:05:37,415
Not as Junior Aryan Khanna

1378
02:05:42,082 --> 02:05:44,123
See how it feels like to be
Gaurav Chandna

1379
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:49,124
Come!

1380
02:05:55,249 --> 02:05:57,290
The joy of living as yourself...

1381
02:05:57,874 --> 02:06:00,207
...cannot be matched by living
as another

1382
02:06:01,624 --> 02:06:02,540
Stop now

1383
02:06:04,874 --> 02:06:05,999
Live your life

1384
02:06:07,207 --> 02:06:08,540
Let me live mine

1385
02:06:17,124 --> 02:06:18,415
Where to, Senior?

1386
02:06:20,291 --> 02:06:22,874
You destroyed me and ask me
to let you live your life?

1387
02:06:27,124 --> 02:06:28,124
And my life?

1388
02:06:30,999 --> 02:06:33,290
You took everything from me

1389
02:06:35,457 --> 02:06:37,040
My parents' love

1390
02:06:37,957 --> 02:06:39,498
Neha's friendship

1391
02:06:41,832 --> 02:06:43,707
My neighbours' smiles

1392
02:06:52,499 --> 02:06:54,874
You were my lifeline, Senior

1393
02:06:57,791 --> 02:06:58,999
You cut the connection

1394
02:07:00,874 --> 02:07:03,499
OK. I'll do as you say

1395
02:07:06,166 --> 02:07:07,541
I'll stop this game

1396
02:07:12,499 --> 02:07:14,499
I can separate myself from you

1397
02:07:17,541 --> 02:07:21,166
But you can never separate
my name from yours

1398
02:07:27,916 --> 02:07:29,166
You said everything

1399
02:07:32,749 --> 02:07:34,332
But you never said sorry

1400
02:07:39,499 --> 02:07:40,249
Gaurav!

1401
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:42,249
No, Gaurav

1402
02:07:43,374 --> 02:07:44,415
It's not over

1403
02:07:44,874 --> 02:07:46,374
Think of your parents

1404
02:07:48,791 --> 02:07:49,707
Stop this madness

1405
02:08:07,374 --> 02:08:10,915
Forget it. You won't understand

1406
02:09:57,249 --> 02:10:01,249
Aryan Khanna has cleared
his name completely

1407
02:10:01,832 --> 02:10:05,165
But Inder Vihar's Gaurav Chandna...

1408
02:10:05,624 --> 02:10:08,707
...has tied his name to superstar
Aryan's name forever

1409
02:10:09,124 --> 02:10:12,999
A wave of love greets Aryan's
on his birthday today

1410
02:10:13,249 --> 02:10:17,749
Fans are singing his songs. They're
here in their thousands

1411
02:10:20,041 --> 02:10:20,999
It's time

1412
02:10:24,707 --> 02:10:26,248
Everyone is waiting
