1
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,117
We are gathered here today
to immortalise in song

2
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,516
the life and untimely death
of a great legend.

3
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,870
- Rango.
- So sit back, relax,

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,709
and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn
and assorted confections

5
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,391
while we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero

6
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,796
who has yet to enter his own story.

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,514
Crunchy, creamy, cookie,
candy, cupcake.

8
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,870
Okay, everybody,
let's take it from the top.

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,476
The stage is set,
the night moist with apprehension.

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,388
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,795
"It is far better to nourish worms
than to live without love."

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,751
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,031
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,437
while her ageing father lies gravely ill.

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,996
"Yes, I am gravely ill."

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,196
"Hark, who goes there?"

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,755
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero,

18
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,394
returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden!

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,431
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue,

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,279
or taste the bitter sting
of my vengeance!

21
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,151
The sting of my...

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,914
Dr Marx?

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,554
Dr Marx,
I'm not getting anything from you.

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,389
People, we've talked about this.
Acting is reacting.

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,875
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,718
Mr Timms? You were good.

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,752
Perhaps a little too good.

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,909
What's that, Victor? My character's
undefined? That's absurd.

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,795
I know who I am.
I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,674
Every story needs a hero.
I mean, who else is better qualified

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,270
to bask in the adulation
of his numerous companions?

32
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,317
<i>The stage is waiting.</i>

33
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,320
<i>The audience thirsts for adventure.</i>

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,039
<i>Who am I?</i>

35
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,473
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

36
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,192
I could be the sea cap'n
returning from a mighty voyage

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,390
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

38
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,793
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the Congo!

39
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,558
Down, Chongo, down!

40
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,436
And if you desire romance,

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,877
I will become the greatest lover
the world has ever known!

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,479
I couldn't help but notice you
noticing me noticing you.

43
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,149
You know, the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,589
But you seem remarkably at ease.

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,798
Stop it. No, really.

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,195
Well, if you must. What are you doing?

47
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,197
That tickles. Are those real?

48
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,350
That's it! Conflict.

49
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,869
Victor, you were right.
I have been undefined.

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,872
People, I've had an epiphany.
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,958
What our story needs is an ironic,
unexpected event

52
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,719
that will propel the hero into conflict!

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,035
Mr Timms?

54
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,277
That's right! You!

55
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,517
Don't be shy. Come on.

56
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,632
It's okay.

57
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,637
That's it, a little closer.

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,189
Good.

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,392
I won't bite you.

60
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,357
I need a little help here.

61
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,149
Are you okay?

62
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,155
I must get to the other side.

63
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,919
The other side? You mean, just now,
that was you crossing the road?

64
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,234
That's why the...

65
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,549
Why'd you do that?

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,638
This is my quest. He waits for me.

67
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,034
What? Who?

68
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,550
The Spirit of the West,
<i>amigo.</i> The one.

69
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,832
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

70
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,632
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,957
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

72
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,517
Nothing? Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

73
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,949
I had an incredibly complex
social network going!

74
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,799
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!

75
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,911
Friends? I don't see no friends.

76
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,269
You are a very lonely lizard.

77
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,437
Look, I need water, hydration.
My teeth are chapped.

78
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,596
I need lotion.
I'm down to one layer of skin already.

79
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,358
Pretty soon,
I'm going to start seeing my insides.

80
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,948
Not unlike what you've got going there.

81
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,792
Listen, I can't survive
in the desert, okay?

82
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,717
I... I don't belong here.

83
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,957
That may be true, but here you are.

84
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,278
Now help me up
and I will help you find what you seek.

85
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,755
- You will?
- And perhaps more.

86
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,916
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.

87
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,396
- You mean you've done this before?
- Yes. Many times.

88
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,833
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.

89
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,837
The Spirit is waiting for me.

90
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,593
Okay, okay.

91
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,990
Okay. That's not going to work.

92
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,075
I must get to the other side.

93
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,308
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

94
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,998
It's not so easy as it looks.

95
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,075
What?

96
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,509
Is a metaphor.

97
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,915
There's another one!

98
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,715
I knew it.

99
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,552
You need a little help, <i>amigo?</i>

100
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,558
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.

101
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,114
The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

102
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,913
I'm just looking for the path to water.

103
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,511
If you want to find water,
you must first find Dirt.

104
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,908
Dirt.

105
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,029
Destiny, she is kind to you.

106
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,913
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.

107
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,310
At noon, the townspeople gather
for a mysterious ritual.

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,075
A town? You mean, with real people
and everything? Where?

109
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,873
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.

110
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,916
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

111
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,029
That's the way.

112
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,469
Okay. So you're saying

113
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,956
there's a town, a real town,
not a metaphor town.

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,479
Go on. It's okay.

115
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,075
Okay.

116
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,079
Well, then, I'm going.

117
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,399
I am leaving the road now!

118
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,793
I'm walking into the desert!

119
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,515
Alone!

120
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,074
We all have our journeys to make!

121
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,228
I will see you on the other side.

122
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,798
<i>Welcome,</i> amigo

123
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,753
<i>To the land without end</i>

124
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,919
<i>The desert and death</i>

125
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,749
<i>Are the closest of friends</i>

126
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,633
<i>We sing of his courage</i>

127
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,797
<i>In magnificent song</i>

128
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,593
<i>But pay close attention</i>

129
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,473
<i>He won't be here long</i>

130
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,632
<i>As the birds pluck his eyes</i>
<i>The sun bleaches his bones</i>

131
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,470
<i>See his entrails get scattered</i>
<i>Watch him lose his</i> cojones

132
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,030
Here in the Mojave Desert,

133
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,154
animals have had millions of years
to adapt to the harsh environment.

134
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,352
But the lizard? He is going to die.

135
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,953
"Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers..."

136
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,036
- Don't move.
- What?

137
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,637
- Don't move!
- Not moving.

138
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,749
Not moving.

139
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,950
Try to blend in.

140
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,559
Blend in? What do you mean?

141
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,349
Blend in.

142
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,118
What are you saying?

143
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,359
- Too late.
- No, no. It's not too late!

144
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,596
I'm blending! I'm a blender!

145
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,717
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?

146
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,988
Stop moving!

147
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,232
Try not to look conspicuous.

148
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,834
- What are you doing?
- I'm blending.

149
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,678
- Go blend somewhere else.
- Don't distract me.

150
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,518
- No room at the inn.
- It's an art, not a science.

151
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,471
- Find your own hiding place.
- No, this is good.

152
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,150
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!

153
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,875
- What? I thought you said, "Don't move."
- That was before. Now, you run.

154
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,237
Oh, hey. Proboscis.

155
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,875
Testy.

156
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,035
Please, no, please. I have vertigo!
My glands are swelling!

157
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,589
Please, no.

158
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,070
You! I'll kill you! You stupid lizard!

159
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,997
Get out of there.
I'm going to strangle your <i>huevos!</i>

160
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,792
Big bird! Big bird!

161
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,240
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!

162
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,157
- Come on, we're friends, right?
- I don't know you!

163
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,952
- Lizards, frogs...
- Find your own hiding place!

164
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,638
- We're practically related!
- No room at the inn!

165
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,079
- Come on, move over!
- You're not my friend!

166
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,191
I'll let you kiss my sister!

167
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,398
You son of a...

168
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,992
Where are your friends now, <i>amigo?</i>

169
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,039
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges
off my boots!

170
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,075
Sorry.

171
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,272
I got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow

172
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,753
lessen you want to spend the better part

173
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,632
of the afternoon
putting your face back together!

174
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,320
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Who are you?

175
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,635
- Who am I?
- I'm asking the questions here!

176
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,069
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.

177
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,838
Now someone's dumping water
in the desert!

178
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,951
It's a puzzle of undeterminable size
and dimension,

179
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,753
but I intend to find out
what role you playing in all this.

180
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,348
- Role?
- What are you involved in?

181
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,870
Well, I'm glad you asked.

182
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,958
I've got two one-acts, a mystery
and a musical I've been gestating.

183
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,038
I got the words, I'm just working on
the melody right now. It's like a...

184
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,309
I think it's gonna be a western.

185
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,908
<i>A monkey got a cracker</i>
<i>His mother was a slapper</i>

186
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,476
<i>She'll be coming 'round the mountain</i>
<i>in the rain</i>

187
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,473
You ain't from around here, are you?

188
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,676
I'm still working on it.

189
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,468
So, what's your name?

190
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,997
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

191
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,918
What can I say?
My daddy plumb loved baked beans.

192
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,678
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plumb love asparagus.

193
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,915
What are you saying?

194
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,996
I mean,
I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

195
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,270
but I'm not sure that a child
would appreciate the moniker.

196
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,791
My daddy was a great man, even if
he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.

197
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,309
- Spicy.
- You're eating his ashes!

198
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,749
You carry his remains?

199
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,997
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

200
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,997
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

201
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,997
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.

202
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,997
My daddy was never near
that mine shaft.

203
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,599
He'd been sober for over a month!

204
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,518
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities

205
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,394
at a delicate time in my personal
development is an affront to my sense...

206
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,234
Miss Beans?

207
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,349
Miss Beans? Hello?

208
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,269
Hello?

209
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,672
And until the people of Andromeda Five

210
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,792
return him safe and sound,
I will not sell my ranch!

211
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,355
- What... What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

212
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,232
- What am I doing?
- You're cuddling me.

213
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,679
- You were frozen.
- I was not.

214
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,597
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.

215
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,837
It's a defence mechanism.
Actually, lots of lizards have it.

216
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,075
You're making that up.

217
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,996
So, you gonna die out here,
or you want a ride into town?

218
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,874
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.

219
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,549
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.

220
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,673
So who are you, really?

221
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,438
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

222
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,790
There's my stage name, my pen name,
my avatar.

223
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,309
I had a pseudonym once,
but I had it legally changed.

224
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,228
And so the stranger,
seeking companionship,

225
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,478
finds the woman,
much like the sirens of ancient times

226
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,673
luring him to his certain demise.

227
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,952
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.

228
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,672
I'm actually one of the few men
with a maiden name.

229
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,314
Whoa! Well, here we are.

230
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,475
Right.

231
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,034
Well, I sure do appreciate this,
Miss Beans,

232
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,754
- and if there's ever anything that I...
- Get on up!

233
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,799
Okay, then!

234
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,197
See you, Beans.

235
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,269
You heading out, Jim?

236
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,358
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.

237
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,199
Can't grow no crops without no water.

238
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,158
Bye, now!

239
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,159
What is it?

240
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,309
What was that for?

241
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,028
You're funny looking.

242
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,675
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.

243
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,030
- That's a funny-looking shirt.
- That's a funny-looking dress.

244
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,435
- You got funny-looking eyes!
- You got a funny-looking face!

245
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,268
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

246
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,671
Here's your beans, Beans.

247
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,711
I'm gonna need some more feed, too,
Willie.

248
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,674
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts
already. I can't give you more credit.

249
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,950
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.

250
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,074
You don't understand. It's Mr Merrimack
down at the bank. He cut off all credit.

251
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,270
Hey, Beans! Beans!

252
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,391
You know that there fella?

253
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,953
Hey, Beans! Miss Beans!

254
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,919
Nope.

255
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,155
Hey, Beans!

256
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,355
Hey.

257
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,913
Right. Blend in. Yeah, blend in.

258
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,112
I'd like a glass of water.

259
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,635
He wants a glass of water!

260
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,352
Make it a double!

261
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,754
Give him the spittoon!

262
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,348
Cactus juice. That's what we got.

263
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,838
Hey, there, fruit cup.

264
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,794
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?

265
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,275
Who exactly are you?

266
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,714
<i>Who am I?</i>

267
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,435
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

268
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,193
What's the matter?
You missing your mommy's mangos?

269
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,316
As a matter of fact, I am.

270
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,196
But not as much as
your daddy's cooking!

271
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,432
Exactly where did you say
you were from?

272
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,711
Me? I'm from the West.

273
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,912
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.

274
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,438
The Far West.

275
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,992
Yeah, that's right, <i>hombres.</i>

276
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,714
The place I come from,
we kill a man before breakfast

277
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,876
just to work up an appetite.

278
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,551
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.

279
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,639
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.

280
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,671
- You eat him?
- That's what I said!

281
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,713
Hell, I seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular functions!

282
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,877
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, living off your own juices.

283
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,719
It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.

284
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,397
Had a few extra aces in this deck,
gents. Just the way I like it.

285
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,197
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,
I am not from around these parts.

286
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,515
You might say I'm from everywhere
there's trouble brewing

287
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,790
and hell waiting to be raised.

288
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,151
You might say
I'm what hell's already raised up.

289
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,879
Name's

290
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,153
Rango.

291
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,675
Rango.

292
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,391
Are you the fella
that killed them Jenkins brothers?

293
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,710
Killed them with one bullet.

294
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,512
Don't get no deader.

295
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,551
All seven of them?

296
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,993
That's right.

297
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,232
All seven of them.

298
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,271
Exactly how you do that, Mr Rango?

299
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,478
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.

300
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,354
And I will be happy to tell you how.
But you're all gonna have to listen up!

301
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,716
Because this is where it gets

302
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,038
complicated.

303
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,833
That'll close out your account,
Mrs Oats, two gulps and a swig.

304
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,236
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left
of your college education!

305
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,550
I don't rightly have
no other choice, Beans.

306
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,593
Times being so hard,
we just can't give no more credit.

307
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,800
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.

308
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,998
Beans, you've been like a niece to me
ever since your daddy

309
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,870
did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

310
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,312
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

311
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,317
But that... Well...

312
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,518
- Mr Merrimack?
- Realities are bearing down.

313
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,073
Mr Merrimack!

314
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,035
Are you all right?

315
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,990
Beans, I need to show you something.

316
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,716
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

317
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,398
I don't know if you've noticed,

318
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,830
but folks just ain't making deposits
on a Wednesday no more!

319
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,236
Mr Merrimack, if I don't get some water,
I'm gonna lose my ranch

320
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,590
and you're telling me
that's all that's left in the whole town?

321
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,712
Now that just don't make no sense.
Now, listen.

322
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,628
Someone is dumping water
in the desert.

323
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,914
I seen it with my own eyes.

324
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,477
Water in the desert?

325
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,478
Was this during
one of your special times?

326
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,755
No.

327
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,759
Well, we can all dream,
but this is the reality.

328
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,316
Why do you think so many people
are selling out? They just can't make it.

329
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,749
Well, what am I supposed to do?

330
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
Well, I suppose
we could talk to the Mayor.

331
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,872
I hear he's been helping people out
in this time of crisis.

332
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,035
The Mayor?

333
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,720
He may be our only hope.

334
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,638
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back
towards number three,

335
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,034
and that's when the roof caved in,

336
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,151
igniting the thermos
of pure grain alcohol

337
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,909
instantly vapourising his bodily form,
leaving nothing but a charcoal statue

338
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,031
and a high-pitched squeal.

339
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,354
Hold on, there. That's only six.
What happened to number seven?

340
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,828
Number seven?

341
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,155
Hell, he died of infection.

342
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,231
- Seven men!
- One bullet!

343
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,237
Drinks all around!

344
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,956
Dance for me, Sod Buster!

345
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,674
- Yes, dance like a chicken!
- That's right! Dance!

346
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,156
You got corn in your ears, mate?

347
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,078
You don't pay the mortgage,
you don't own the land!

348
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,112
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Quid pro quo!

349
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,152
If I see your face in this town again,

350
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,478
I'm gonna slice it off and use it
to wipe my unmentionables.

351
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,275
Mind the beak.

352
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,874
And don't come back!

353
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,234
What are you all gawping at?

354
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,036
Hey, Bad Bill,
there's something I got to tell you!

355
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,714
What is this?

356
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,674
You know who that is, Bill?
That there's Rango!

357
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,429
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you!
He ain't afraid of none of you.

358
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,913
Killed them Jenkins brothers.

359
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,793
- Done it with one bullet, Bill.
- All seven of them!

360
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,277
Is that right?

361
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,596
Let me get that before you...

362
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,558
No. Oh, I know. Here.

363
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,669
Just take care of that for you.

364
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,550
There. All better.

365
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,434
T.O. T.O. Just a second.

366
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,999
All right, now listen!

367
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,192
I'm going to give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider!

368
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,632
And if you don't want to reconsider

369
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,672
I might consider reconsidering myself.

370
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,831
Now that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

371
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,473
All right, now listen up!

372
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,478
Things are going to be different
around here now that Rango's in town.

373
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,512
Got some new rules!
I want my shoes shined every morning,

374
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,437
my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

375
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,676
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye.

376
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,109
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

377
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,112
- It's Rango.
- What's he up to?

378
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,232
He ain't afraid of nobody.
He's telling that bird what's for!

379
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,032
And when you see me coming,
stand aside.

380
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,999
I take large steps and I don't want
none of you hayseeds

381
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,680
getting your bodily fluids on my boots!

382
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,152
Of course, there is no need for violence,

383
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,078
as long as we stick together,
work as a team.

384
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,431
So I want you all to come outside now
and line up single file

385
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,913
while I take a brief intermission!

386
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,438
What's he doing now?

387
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,039
I think it's a number two.

388
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,591
Never mind.

389
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,312
Take a look-see over here!

390
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,589
Well, look at him now!

391
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,472
He's chasing after that hawk!

392
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,999
Give him hell, Rango!

393
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,953
- Did you see that?
- He killed that thing!

394
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,593
What do you think, Doc?

395
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,920
This hawk is dead!

396
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,869
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.

397
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,592
He did it with one bullet!

398
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,153
Just like he said!

399
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,918
It's about time
we had a hero around here.

400
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,156
One who ain't in a pine box.

401
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,559
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

402
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,478
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!

403
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,795
Let's hear it for Rango!

404
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,349
And so the stranger basks

405
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,677
in the adulation of his new friends,

406
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,749
sinking deeper into the guacamole
of his own deception.

407
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,438
When is he going to die?

408
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,869
Soon, <i>compadre.</i> Soon.

409
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,677
My land is not for sale!

410
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,229
I came here to save my land, not sell it!

411
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,830
I'm sure there's something reasonable
we can work out if you just talk to him!

412
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,872
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?

413
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,158
The Mayor will see you now.

414
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,557
Water, Mr Rango, water.

415
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,191
Without it,
there's nothing but dust and decay.

416
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,598
But with water there's life.

417
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,311
Look at them, so desperate to live,
they'll follow it anywhere.

418
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,996
That's the immutable law of the desert.

419
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,833
Control the water
and you control everything.

420
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,198
But I don't have to tell you that being
a true man of the West, as you are.

421
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,513
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.

422
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,790
This is from my private stock.

423
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,878
Vintage rainwater
from the Great Deluge.

424
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,315
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, I'm not that old.

425
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,115
I guess power has its privileges.

426
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,079
You make a good point, son.

427
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,038
But with privilege comes responsibility.

428
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,438
Hell, I was mayor here
before there was a Dirt!

429
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,711
And I may be
just a sentimental old turtle

430
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,595
but I think there's a future for this town.
And I hope you'll be part of it.

431
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,035
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt.

432
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,316
You see them, Mr Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

433
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,471
It's a hard life here. Very hard.

434
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,830
Do you know how they make it through
each and every day?

435
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,915
They believe.

436
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,313
They believe it's going to be better.

437
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,637
They believe that the water will come.

438
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,115
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

439
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,310
that tomorrow will be better than today.

440
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,913
People have to believe in something.

441
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,592
Right now, they believe in you.

442
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,799
Pick it up, Mr Rango.
Your destiny awaits.

443
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,436
People have to believe in something.

444
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,750
It's almost noon. Is everything ready?

445
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,519
Yeah. But he might be a problem.

446
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,871
He's not a problem, William.
He's a solution.

447
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,353
It just don't make no sense.

448
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,871
This whole town is drying up,

449
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,468
and the Mayor is the only one
who don't seem to be affected.

450
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,477
Doesn't that make you
just a wee bit suspicious?

451
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,632
And what about that water
I saw out in the desert?

452
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,912
All right! No need to incite anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

453
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,555
But if you really feel
there's some conspiracy occurring,

454
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,558
I suggest you take it up
with the new sheriff.

455
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,758
This is going to be good. Hey!
Watch that needle there.

456
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,233
Not too tight.
I want to leave room for some pucker!

457
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,315
That's good.

458
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,395
Oh, easy there, tiger.

459
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,149
- A little up and back?
- I don't think so.

460
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,349
Have you got French cuffs with that?

461
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,708
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
I want to talk to you.

462
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,239
Hey, Beans,
what do you think of the new duds?

463
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,237
I got a 10-gallon hat
marked down from 15.

464
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,839
- That's nice.
- Have you met Angelique?

465
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,678
- Hello, Beans.
- Hello, Angelique.

466
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,755
- Tart.
- Floozy.

467
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,950
- Trollop.
- Excuse me, Mr Rango.

468
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,593
I will blow that ugly right off your face!

469
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,797
I was just thinking that...

470
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,152
You want the old John Hancock,
do you?

471
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,271
- Well, here. Hold this.
- Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.

472
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,992
There's a bullet in there.

473
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,553
I know about the shindig this afternoon.

474
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,035
- I ordered myself some right fancy duds.
- Sheriff, I'd like to file a...

475
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,798
- Mr Rango!
- Oh, you, too? No problem.

476
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,433
- Here, let me just...
- I need you to investigate...

477
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,279
You know, Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice, you put a little effort into it.

478
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,515
- What?
- Now, remember, son,

479
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,029
stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespeare.

480
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,673
- Who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango,

481
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,798
if that is your real name.

482
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,990
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch,

483
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,076
which is on the verge
of an agricultural meltdown

484
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,953
while you're playing patty-cake
with this here trollop!

485
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,271
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.

486
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,029
Why does she do that?

487
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,232
- It's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.

488
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,713
Well, that's an inconvenience.

489
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,308
It is not a rash! It is a birthmark!

490
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,154
I did it again, didn't I?

491
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,429
Did what?

492
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,319
Let me ask you something.

493
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,319
Did anybody here mention
what happened to our last sheriff?

494
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,232
Pardon, but may I ask you...
Excuse me, may I ask you...

495
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,989
The last sheriff... Pardon me.
Where is everybody going?

496
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,358
What exactly happened to the...

497
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,039
<i>All day</i>

498
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,948
<i>I've faced the barren waste</i>

499
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,155
<i>Without the taste of water</i>

500
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,230
<i>Cool water</i>

501
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,312
<i>Old Dan and I</i>

502
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,317
<i>With throats burned dry</i>

503
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,873
<i>And souls that cry</i>

504
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,434
<i>For water</i>

505
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,634
<i>Cool</i>

506
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,873
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

507
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,309
<i>Clear water</i>

508
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,678
This is a heck of a hoedown
you got going.

509
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,472
Still working out those steps.

510
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,275
So, is this considered
normal civic behaviour?

511
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,755
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.

512
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,518
You kill bird.

513
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,359
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.

514
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,913
Bird dead. Snake come.

515
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,795
Snake?

516
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,875
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

517
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,036
He never comes to town 'cause
he's scared of that hawk.

518
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,354
But he might come now.

519
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,959
Can I have your boots
when you're dead?

520
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,069
No!

521
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,430
And I ain't got no problem
with this Rattlesnake Jake.

522
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,118
That's just what Amos said.

523
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,231
Amos?

524
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,675
You got any gold fillings?

525
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,674
<i>My fellow Dirtonians.</i>

526
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,555
<i>I welcome you to our great day</i>
<i>of deliverance. Hallelujah.</i>

527
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,159
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

528
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,636
<i>Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!</i>

529
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,991
<i>We have a newcomer</i>
<i>amongst us today, my friends.</i>

530
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,714
<i>A man I think needs</i>
<i>little introduction to you</i>

531
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,799
<i>so bold has been his entry</i>
<i>into our fair society.</i>

532
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,992
<i>Mr Rango, would you step forward?</i>

533
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,758
<i>The time has come, my friends.</i>
<i>The time that was foretold!</i>

534
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,438
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

535
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,879
<i>The sacred time!</i>

536
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,672
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

537
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,030
<i>The time of destiny!</i>

538
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,639
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

539
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,115
<i>The time of deliverance!</i>

540
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,195
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

541
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,233
<i>It is the time of hydration!</i>

542
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,435
- It's his fault!
- It's the newcomer!

543
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,152
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!

544
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,315
I get his boots!

545
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,479
<i>My friends, my friends!</i>
<i>Temper your frustrations.</i>

546
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,435
<i>Times will be tough from now on.</i>
<i>Sacrifices will have to be made.</i>

547
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,030
<i>But if I can help in any way,</i>
<i>please know that my door is always...</i>

548
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,673
Hold it, hold it!

549
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,439
Now, this whole thing
stinks three ways to Sunday.

550
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,915
First the bank's run dry
and now this here spigot?

551
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,995
The bank's run dry?

552
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,680
- What's she talking about?
- She said there's no water in the bank!

553
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,752
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!

554
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,950
That was my rehydration account!

555
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,148
None of that civil disobedience
in my town, thank you very much.

556
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,797
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.
Things were getting out of hand.

557
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,672
Come right in.

558
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,634
Let me have a gander at the source
of the societal discontentment here.

559
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,679
Mercy.

560
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,360
All right, listen up! I've been thinking

561
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,119
and I believe I've figured something out.

562
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,549
You folks have a water problem!

563
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,988
Now just pay attention, everybody.
I'm trying to make a point here.

564
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,759
Let's say this fella here
were to take a drink of water.

565
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,519
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?

566
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,669
And you!

567
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,634
You're just as dried up and parched
as a jackrabbit in July.

568
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,672
So you belly on up
and take you a double shot!

569
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,632
Stay with me.

570
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,195
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinking!

571
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,673
And before you know it,
there wouldn't be any more water.

572
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,677
And then where would we be?

573
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,638
We'd be thirsty.

574
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,792
Real thirsty.

575
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,595
We'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

576
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,790
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.

577
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,200
We have got five days...

578
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,109
As long as we've got water,
we've got ourselves a town.

579
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,117
Sheriff Rango is right.

580
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,676
As long as we have this water,
we have some hope.

581
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,472
And you can all take it from me.

582
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,876
My 100% full-time employment
from this moment on

583
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,754
will be to protect
our precious natural resource.

584
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,509
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango.

585
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,069
Evening, ladies.

586
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,872
Evening, Sheriff.

587
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,991
And don't you come back!

588
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,510
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back
in there and you assert yourself,

589
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,712
and I think you'll find the people of this
here town to be surprisingly hospitable.

590
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,034
Thank you, Sheriff.

591
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,912
What? Not you again!

592
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,032
I stand corrected.

593
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,309
- This ain't the bank.
- I told you, Jedidiah!

594
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,634
Hold it right there!

595
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,954
- Who's that?
- It's the Sheriff!

596
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,638
Get them hands up
where I can see them!

597
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,316
Just as I suspected.

598
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,034
Prospecting without the authorised
equipment. Don't move a muscle.

599
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,239
Prospecting?

600
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,794
Now, you got your shovel,
pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah,

601
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,992
assorted snacks, some puzzle books
and you're gonna need a permit.

602
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,712
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!

603
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,956
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?

604
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,470
I've had polyps removed
smarter than the two of you!

605
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,030
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!

606
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,590
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here,
helping us out.

607
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,314
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

608
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,874
That's right, sir. Just doing my duty.

609
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,596
The lonely constable on his rounds,

610
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,915
keeping an eagle eye out
for mayhem and malfeasance.

611
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,357
Does he look like he sounds?

612
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,395
Well, Sheriff,
if we was to hit the mother lode,

613
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,511
being prospectors and such,

614
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,632
where would we deposit said annuity?

615
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,591
Here in the town of Dirt,
we happen to have

616
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,393
the finest financial institution
this side of the Missouri.

617
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,554
Protected morning, noon and night
by yours truly.

618
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,157
Much obliged.

619
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,119
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

620
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,549
Good Lord, the bank's been robbed!

621
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,999
What's going on?

622
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,190
- It's gone! The water's all gone!
- What'd he say?

623
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,514
He said the bank's been robbed!

624
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,113
Dr Marx! I'm on fire! Embrace me!

625
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,151
<i>The bank's been robbed, the town is dry</i>
<i>"We'll die of thirst," the people cry</i>

626
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,592
<i>He promised to protect the vault</i>
<i>The water's gone, it's all his fault</i>

627
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,111
All right, folks, stand back,
clear the area.

628
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,468
This is a crime scene now.

629
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,558
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints,
check for fibres, scan for DNA.

630
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,240
I want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.

631
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,595
And don't mix up the two.

632
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,789
What's this?

633
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,478
"Prospecting Permit."

634
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,272
I'll take that. Material evidence.

635
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,833
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?

636
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,520
- We need that water.
- We're all going to die!

637
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,076
My friends, we all know
what we have to do now.

638
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,795
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.

639
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,831
- And that would be?
- Form a posse.

640
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,712
Form a possum!

641
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,478
A posse.

642
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,632
Now, we're gonna be doing this
in an orderly fashion.

643
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,916
First off, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

644
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,833
All right, then.

645
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,393
What do we do now, Sheriff?

646
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,080
Now we ride!

647
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,835
Where are we going?

648
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,109
What?

649
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,958
Where are we going?

650
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,673
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge
of all tracking and finding of villains,

651
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,473
utilising your well-developed
Injun-uity, no offence taken.

652
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,749
So which way do you think they went?

653
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,314
You want to sniff the air or commune
with a buffalo or something?

654
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,672
Oh, you're good.

655
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,792
I'm depending on you, Spoons.

656
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,434
You got a little tobaccy
in the beard there.

657
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,358
Always good to have a medical man
along, Doc.

658
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,074
Reptiles got to stick together, right,
my brother?

659
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,394
I'm an amphibian.

660
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,953
Ain't no shame in that.

661
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,475
You sure you're
fit for duty there, soldier?

662
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,038
Well, you got a little something
in your eye there.

663
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,395
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir.
It's hereditary.

664
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,153
Well, I'm glad to hear
it's not contagious.

665
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,310
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

666
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,308
Never mind.

667
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,271
Hold on there, little sister.

668
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,960
Someone's gonna have
to look after the town while I'm gone.

669
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,079
Can I gut-shoot someone?

670
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,311
Let's put a pin in that.

671
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,638
Sheriff, you're going to bring
that water back, aren't you?

672
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,919
Count on it, little sister.

673
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,037
- Which way do we go, Sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere.

674
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,639
Whole town's perforated with them.

675
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,116
He got more holes in him
than even a painted lady on a porcupine.

676
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,033
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.

677
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,312
Not what I expected.

678
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,913
How'd them fellers
find the bank, anyway?

679
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,031
Gentlemen, if we can just
stay on task here.

680
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,549
Sheriff! Over here!

681
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,036
- Would you look at that?
- Like seeing the face of God.

682
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,309
Amen, brother.

683
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,874
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

684
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,877
Those were the halcyon days.

685
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,149
Must be a reason she quit on us.

686
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,360
Whatever the reason,
something is controlling this here water.

687
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,469
What do you say, Sheriff?

688
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,513
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

689
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,915
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin

690
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,395
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

691
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,715
- What'd he say?
- I think he said follow the pipe.

692
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,115
- He said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.

693
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,317
Sure is humid down here.

694
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,318
Yeah. It's like the big mud piles.

695
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,078
I had a goitre removed once.

696
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,158
Looked like Tony Bennett
stepping out of the shower.

697
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,998
I put that on a tortilla.

698
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,838
Whatever you do, do not look down.

699
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,238
- What is this place?
- It's an aquifer.

700
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,479
What's an aquifer?

701
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,477
Well, it's for aqua.

702
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,232
Well, it's empty now.

703
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,155
That's a big one.

704
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,348
- It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

705
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,075
Now that there is a path.
It's got to be connected to something.

706
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,668
You talk too much.
Why don't you put a cork in it?

707
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,030
Why don't you put a cork...
Tell you where the sun don't shine.

708
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,559
Your mama did.
I'll cook her right up.

709
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,113
You two just don't get it, do you?

710
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,710
Someone or something
is messing with our hydration

711
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,671
and that pipe
has got something to do with it.

712
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,518
I thought
we was following bank robbers!

713
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,790
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.

714
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,876
I'm gonna shift the features on your face
if you don't shut up!

715
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,989
Go ahead and try!

716
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,119
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling.
You're affecting my cogitation.

717
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,273
Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.

718
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,795
Sure enough.

719
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,038
Smart thinking there, feller.

720
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,720
- Start climbing.
- Get your foot out of my face!

721
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,273
Not bad, huh, Beans?

722
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,675
You keep thinking like that,
your hat's gonna catch on fire.

723
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,109
Well, you know, you get on a roll,
you just...

724
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,188
Hot, hot! Burn.

725
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,357
Poor things.
All they wanted was a little water.

726
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,756
Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.

727
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,472
- Hey, look what I found!
- What you got there?

728
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,353
- I saw that first!
- Hey, that's mine!

729
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,959
Give me that!

730
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,957
It's empty anyway.

731
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,433
I knew that.

732
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,754
Where'd you find that?

733
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,553
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!

734
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,712
It's Mr Merrimack from the bank.

735
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,159
What's he doing here?

736
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,713
- Everybody stand back.
- All right, let me see.

737
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,195
Looks like them varmints shot him
in the back.

738
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,279
No, this man wasn't shot.
He was drowned!

739
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,914
- Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

740
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,678
What a way to go.

741
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,869
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?

742
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,875
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.

743
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,953
I suppose we should bury him.

744
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,274
I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.

745
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,634
Circle of life!

746
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,549
Sherriff.

747
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,113
Will you say a few words?

748
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,637
Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,234
Dearly beloved.

750
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,876
We are gathered here today
to honour this man.

751
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,635
Mr Merrimack,

752
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,559
you have the right to remain silent.

753
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,870
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

754
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,955
Amen.

755
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,235
- Amen.
- Amen.

756
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,153
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?

757
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,520
I see you're consulting with the spirits.

758
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,835
No, I'm moulting.
Means I'm ready to mate.

759
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,633
I'll keep that in mind.

760
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,355
Cactus fruit.

761
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,119
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.

762
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,912
I believe your people use it
as seasoning

763
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,393
when preparing your native dishes.

764
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,238
Also natural laxative.

765
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,869
Pick up trail.

766
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,276
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with

767
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,155
enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.

768
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,397
- What did he say?
- They're riding sidesaddle.

769
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,839
- We're whispering.
- What'd he say?

770
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,995
Someone's got a bad valve.

771
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,918
All right, which one of you fellers
needs a check-up?

772
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,915
Awkward.

773
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,357
What exactly are we going to do now?

774
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,230
Now we ride!

775
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,435
That means we're riding now!
This moment.
