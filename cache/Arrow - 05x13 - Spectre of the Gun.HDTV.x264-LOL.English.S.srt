My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:04,665
After 5 years in Hell,

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,772
I returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:08,505
to save my city.

5
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,908
Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,277
By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor,

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,446
but by night,
I am someone else.

8
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,715
I am...Something else.

9
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,384

19
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:32,896
Reason?

20
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:34,298
Because I screwed up...

21
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,166
Again.

22

45

They don't. My first

with a street gang called
the Pilgrims.

What do
you guys got?

56
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:14,431
Well, I have been working
on a location

57

for Claybourne's mistress.

58

We find her...

59
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,603
We find the name for
this son of a bitch.

60
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,605
Eh, unfortunately, the--
the son of a bitch's father

61
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,707
went dark after he met with
the pointy head of an arrow

62
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,076
4 years ago,
and mommy went off the grid.

63
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:27,277
Why would she do that?

64
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,445
Probably because she knows

65
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:30,147
that he turned into
a serial killing

66

67
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:34,118
Point being
I have been looking for her

68
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,819
for the past 3 months,

69
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,087
but whatever witness protection
program she put herself into,

70
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:38,255
it is damn good.

71
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,823
What changed
in 3 months?

72
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,225
I've had a breakthrough.

73
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,760
I've narrowed her new home
down to Illinois.

74
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,428
I just need a couple more
days to narrow that down

75
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,797
into an address.

76
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,601
That's fantastic work.

Thank you.

the same to you.

and Russia.

82

up those miles.

86

vomit a little.

87

vomit a little?

90
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,204
You don't like Susan because
of how she does her job.

91

want to say to me, Rene?

158
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:43,000
I guess I do.

159
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,568
Using again?

Drop a 5-block net

Let's get ambulances here
immediately!

my sister?!

Just catch this

Yeah. Go on.

<font color="#0CEC0C">[Sirens, police radio chatter]</font>

174
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:38,254
How many casualties?

175
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:40,089
There's 5 dead, 24 injured,

176
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,525
and 8 in critical condition.

177
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,060
The bastard
was wearing Kevlar,

178
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,728
but I think one of my shots
went into his shoulder

179
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,263
with a 9-mil slug.

180
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,665
Might be a good idea to alert
all the emergency rooms?

181
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,300
Do it.

182
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,869
What were you doing
with a gun in here?

183
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,270
Judging by
how I tagged the guy,

184
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,239
I got to go with saving
people's lives.

185
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,907
Your security detail
said

186
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,442
the shooter dropped
his primary weapon.

187
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,411
We need to get it
before the police do.

188
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:03,212
I took care of it.

189
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,916
This is military-grade
hardware.

190
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,751
AR-15 assault weapon.

191
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,820
It fires 5.56 NATO rounds.

192
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:14,457
It's an M16. It's literally
the same gun as an M16.

193
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,725
Seems like some of
Tobias Church's

194
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,627
ordnance got into
the wrong hand--

195
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,395
wronger hands.

196
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,264
Not necessarily.
It's an AR-15.

197
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,032
It's available on
the open market.

198
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:25,468
In fact, it's the most popular gun
in America.

199
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,638
The land of the free, home
of the incredibly stupid.

200
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,106
We are not having
this conversation now

201
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,274
or ever, guys.

202
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,909
<b><font color="#FF8000">Oliver:</font></b> Where are
we with the gun?

203
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,911
Nowhere. It hasn't been
used in any prior crime.

204
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,512
<b><font color="#FF8000">Oliver:</font></b>
Fingerprints?

205
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,081
The shooter wasn't
wearing gloves.

206
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,582
AFIS didn't
kick back anything.

207
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,817
I don't think he's ever
been in the system.

208
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,118
Or he was
smart enough

209
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,619
to have himself
erased from it.

210
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,054
Security cameras.

211
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,789
He knew how to avoid them.

212
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,425
And before he opened fire,
he upgraded to a ski mask.

213
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,828
That looks like
a utility jumpsuit.

214
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,995
Forefather Repair.

215
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:54,197
It went belly up
6 years ago.

216
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,631
I ran through
the employee list,

217
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,200
but I think our shooter
just bought a uniform

218
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,367
off the Internet.

219
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,169
So he could walk
into city hall.

220
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:01,404
This guy's real good at
covering his tracks,

221
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,972
whoever he is.

222
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,273
So who is he?

223
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,142
<b><font color="#FF8000">Quentin:</font></b> Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,111
That--there.
Yeah, that's the guy.

225
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:10,480
Run him through
the system for me, would you?

226
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,348
Hey, this is
where you've been.

227
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,950
I think I got a look
at the shooter

228
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,518
before he put his
ski mask on.

229
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,653
I let that
son of a bitch

230
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:19,155
walk right past me.

231
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:20,723
Hey, you couldn't
have known, Hoss.

232
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,225
Listen, I've been police
most of my adult life.

233
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,526
I should've been able
to spot that guy

234
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:24,827
a thousand yards out.

235
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:26,529
Hey, don't go there,
man, all right?

236
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,731
What happened wasn't
your fault.

237
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,833
I heard you got
a few shots off.

238
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:32,335
Yeah. And I would've
put him down, too,

239
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:33,903
if he wasn't wearing
body armor.

240
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,738
Listen, weren't you
dishonorably discharged?

241
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,406
Not for my aim, Hoss.

242
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:40,376
My point is it's illegal
for someone such as yourself

243
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,044
to carry a firearm.

244
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,446
But it's pretty easy
to buy one, though.

245

<font color="#D900D9">[Scoffs]</font>

249
00:09:57,595 --> 00:10:00,229
How could you even ask
me something like that?

250
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,731
Actually, I've been working
up the nerve to ask you

251
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,399
for a while now!

252
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,005
Ever since I found
this taped

253
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,540
behind your dresser
drawer.

254
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,542
You searched our
bedroom?

255
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:15,711
Yeah, 'cause it looks like
my wife's a freakin' junkie.

256
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:22,051
I just...

257
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,653
I just don't get it.

258
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,388
We got out, Laura.

259
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,390
We got out of
the Glades,

260
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:30,693
and here you are bringing
it back into our home.

261
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,628
You are the last person
who can get

262

on their high horse.

263
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,465
No matter what I've done,
I've never done drugs,

264
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,634
and I've never done it
in our baby girl's home.

265
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:39,802
Screw you, Rene!

266
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,238
We're gonna be
late for the game.

267
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,241
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

268
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,977
I'm sorry. Daddy and mommy
were just talking.

269
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,146
You were fighting.

270
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,415

just talking loudly.

271

Daddy's just disappointed
that mommy's

272
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,751
not coming with us
to the game.

273
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,088
Go get your coat, honey.

274
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,756
It's gonna be cold tonight.

275
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,599
I'm throwing this away.

276
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,500
When I get home,

277
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:13,803
either there's no more
drugs in this house

278

or there's no more you
in this house.

279
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,746
Two of the victims who
were in critical condition

280
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,848
just passed away
on the table.

281
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,450
Who?

282
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:30,486
Kyle in commerce
and Paula in accounting.

283
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:32,021
Ohh.

284
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,459
I need phone numbers
for the next of kin.

285
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:40,096
I already emailed them
to you.

286
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:42,665
Look, you are gonna find
whoever did this.

287
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,001
No. I have to before
he does it again.

288
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,469
What makes you so sure

289
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,970
this isn't just
a one-time thing?

290
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,372
If it were a one-time
thing,

291
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,107
he wouldn't have
concealed his identity

292
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,042
and he wouldn't have
fled the scene. He's...

293
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,680
Uh, Adrian?

294
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:59,148
Oh, what are you
doing?

295
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,483
Can you talk some sense
into him, please?

296
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,485
Mr. Mayor, Thea,
meet my wife--Doris.

297
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,186
<b><font color="#FF8000">Oliver:</font></b> Hi.

00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,023
I'm tougher than I look,

300
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,491

You need to be in bed, Adrian.
You were shot.

Hey, listen, come on,

take a seat

All right.

00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,508
What do we know?

308
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,510
We don't know much.

309
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:30,713
It was a single shooter,
AR-15 assault rifle.

310
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,882
And it--
it doesn't appear that I

311
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,151
was his primary target
because he just...

312
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:37,420
Blasted his way
through city hall.

313
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:38,721
If he wasn't
going after you,

314
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,489
then there's
a larger agenda here.

315
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:43,726
AR-15s are the Bertinelli
family's weapon of choice.

316
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,695
Over 90% of the hits they
were involved in last year

317
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,063
used them.

318
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,931
Why would the Bertinellis
target city hall?

319
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:52,368
Because your office
oversees the Anti-Crime unit.

320
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,337
And it is a softer
target.

321
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,106
All right. We're gonna
look into it

322
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:58,507
under one condition--

323
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,943
you listen to your wife
and you stay here.

324
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,678
Let yourself get better.

325
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:06,215
Fair?

326
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:07,583
Fair.

327
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,720
Just stop this guy.

00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,032
Rifle. And
Oliver took it.

332

Said he was
following up a lead.

333
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,102
There's no gun
ownership database

334
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,737
for me to
go through anyway.

335
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,538
Yeah. Why wouldn't we want
something like that?

336
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,374
So the government doesn't know
our business, Hoss.

337
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:33,209
Guys, can we
please, just not right now?

338
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:34,710
I don't have no problem
with your right to bear arms

339
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:35,945
so long as it
doesn't conflict

340
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,713
with my right to,
you know, live.

341
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,582
Are you kidding me?
Look at what we do, man.

342
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,584
Our whole life is
violence.

343
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,619
I'm not talking about what
we do to protect the city.

344
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,221
I'm talking about the fact
that as a black man

345
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,922
I am 3 times more likely
to be killed by a gun

00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,257

He's got a point, Rene.

348
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,594
Seriously?
You were a cop, man.

349
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,995
And cops would kind of
like it

350
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,330

out there with guns.

Dinah and I tried to get more
information on the shooting out of ESU.

358
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:09,345

again with
our gun control debate.

No pun intended.

Mr. Edlund is clearly

00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,514
on gun control?

470

We're gonna examine
all sides of that.

471
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,755
What is your
personal opinion?

472
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:41,125
That it's complicated.

Excuse me, Mr. Mayor,

474
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:44,229
but 7 of your staffers
are dead

475
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:45,697
and others severely injured.

476
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:46,965
Don't you think you
owe them a response

477
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:48,466
beyond "it's complicated"?

478
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:50,168
I do. I owe it to them.

<font color="#D900D9">[Clears throat]</font>

00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,475

could've gone better.

all of them.

485
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,819
No. I appreciate that,
Quentin, but they're right.

486
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:09,454
I don't know how to deal
with this.

487
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,656
You are dealing with
this.

488
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:13,157
An--and Edlund,
we will find--

489
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,793
Then what? He goes to jail.

490
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:19,797
The 7 people that we
lost are still dead.

491
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,969
My mission has always been
to save this city.

492
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,871
And my first instinct
has almost always been

493
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,573
to use violence.

494
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:31,009
You didn't bring this on.

495
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:34,078
I know. I know.

496
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,680
It's a violent world.

497
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:37,882
And sometimes it
only responds to violence,

498
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,385
but we cannot dismiss
the idea that we are

499
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,921
just feeding
into a vicious cycle.

500
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:44,322
<font color="#D900D9">[Heavy sigh]</font>

501
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,861
If you ask me,
this is a problem

502
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,763
that the Green Arrow
can't solve.

503
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,364
I mean, sure,
you can find him.

504
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,866
You probably will.

505
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,868
But this...

506
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,870
This is bigger than
one nut bar

507
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,905
with a bag full
of guns.

508
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,540
He's right.

509
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:05,910
The solution here is not
with you as the Green Arrow,

510
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,612
it's with you as the mayor.

511
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,514
I just showed
the entire city

512
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,749
that I don't know how to
handle this as the mayor.

513
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,284
So you try again.

514
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:14,452
And if that doesn't
work, damn it,

515
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:15,653
you try again.

516
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,056
Nobody said being
mayor of this city

517
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:20,024
was ever gonna be
easy, Oliver.

518
00:20:22,062 --> 00:20:23,428
<font color="#D900D9">[Sighs]</font>

519
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:26,598
We need a list.

520
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,132
Every alderman, councilman,
and community leader

521
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:29,567
that was involved

522
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,935
in the previous
gun control ordinance,

523
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,203
I want them in here.

524
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,472
I want to meet with them
today.

525
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,443
We're not gonna solve this
right away.

526
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,811
Are you sure

527
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:41,646
that you want to open that
can of worms? I--

528
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:44,949
I--I just mean that
gun control is

529
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,985
a big political
third rail. So...

530
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:48,620
Thea, come on.

531
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,821
Thea, I understand.

532
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,923
This shouldn't
be about politics.

533
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:54,092
This should be about
safety and security--

534
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:56,995
everyone's safety
and security

535
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,163
whether they own a gun
or not.

536
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:01,499
Now, let's get to work.

537
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:02,800
All right.

538
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,790
<b><font color="#FF8000">Oliver:</font></b> Councilwoman,
thank you very much for meeting with me.

539
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,258
Well, from what I hear,

540
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,993
you've been making
the rounds.

541
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,996
But as someone without
a lot of political capital,

542
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,798
you're certainly making
an interesting choice

543
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,900
as to how to spend it.

544
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:33,603
I have 7 dead staffers
who wouldn't find it interesting at all.

545
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:35,638
And it's a terrible thing
that happened here.

546
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,807
It's just terrible.

547
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:39,809
Police make any progress
locating Edlund?

548
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:41,611
No, unfortunately.

549
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:43,813
But they're fairly confident that he
targeted city hall

550
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:46,115
because of our inability
to enact the SCGR.

551
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:49,619
You implying I'm somehow responsible
for what happened?

552
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:52,488
No. But, councilwoman,

553
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,190
you did kill
the ordinance.

554
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:55,825
You really have been
making the rounds.

555
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:58,861
Yes, I'm against
any registry that gives

556
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:00,463
the government
the opportunity to keep tabs

557
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:02,531
on specific sectors of
the population.

558
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,800
The DMV keeps a list of
driver's licenses.

559
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:06,335
It's not
a constitutional right

560
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:07,803
to drive a car, Mr. Mayor.

561
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,505
You know, people such as
yourself oppose

562
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:12,308
limitations on things like
abortion, freedom of speech.

563
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,410
Why is the second amendment
somehow less important

564
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:17,246
in your eyes than the other
9 in the bill of rights?

565
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,048
Because people are
dying, councilwoman,

566
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,250
right here in this
building.

567
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,588
And there are
limitations on abortion

568
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,690
and freedom of speech.

569
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,527
Both my parents
are dead.

570
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:34,897
My friend Tommy was a...

571
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:36,666
He was one of the 503

572
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:38,434
killed
in the Undertaking.

573
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:40,603
Laurel Lance
was my friend.

574
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:44,073
Nobody respects
the rights of someone

575
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,708
to protect themselves

576
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,878
and the people that they
care for more than me,

577
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,447
but everything in life
comes with limitations.

578
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:52,648
Everything.

579
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,016
Why are you telling me this?

580
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:57,119
Because you and I are
gonna sit in this office

581
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:58,688
until we figure out

582
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,256
a reasonable set
of limitations

583
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,525
that respects
everyone's rights.

584
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:08,297
Are you hungry?

585
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,299
Should I order
something in?

586
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,435
We might be here
a while.

587
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:23,045
I don't know anything,
man. I don't know--

588
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,082
I know you've
seen this scumbag.

589
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:27,383
He lives in
this neighborhood!

590
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:28,951
I don't know
everybody, dude.

591
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:30,086
I don't!

592
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:32,488
<font color="#D900D9">[Grunts]</font>

593
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:40,963
<font color="#D900D9">[Breathing heavily]</font>

594
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:43,566
Another dead end?

595
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:46,569
Let's just call it
a long shot.

596
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:47,937
I might be taking
out my frustrations

597
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:49,705
on these lowlifes
at this point.

598
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,407
Yeah. It happens.

599
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:52,942
Let's call it
a night, huh?

600
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:54,944
Get you back to your
not so homey home.

601
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:57,146
Seriously, John, it's fine.

602
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:58,781
Dinah, I just don't know

603
00:23:58,783 --> 00:24:00,483
why you don't want
better for yourself.

604
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:06,689
There was one place
I kind of liked.

605
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:08,791
It's a studio apartment
off Canal.

606
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:13,829
It had this nice little
backyard garden.

607
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:16,165
I--I went to go fill out
a lease application.

608
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,666
I don't know.

609
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,035
But what?

610
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:22,204
Nothing. It's stupid.

611
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,144
It asked questions, ok?

612
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:29,945
It asked questions about
the last 3 years.

613
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:31,347
Uh, jobs and--and
residencies,

614
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:32,681
that sort of thing.

615
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:34,350
Yeah. And I guess there
was no box to check

616
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:36,218
for "vendetta," right?

617
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,687
Ha ha. Not so much, no.

618
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:39,722
Yeah.

619
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:41,223
And it's not even just that.

620
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:43,993
I...

621
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:46,562
You know what? Just forget
it. It's so stupid.

622
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:49,865
Dinah, I work
with Oliver Queen.

623
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:52,134
Please try me.

624
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:59,308
Applying
for an apartment is--

625
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,745
it's something
normal people do.

626
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:06,449
I haven't had normal
in a very long time.

627
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:13,422
I don't know who I'm
supposed to be anymore.

628
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,024
I remember I felt
that way

629
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:16,392
the first time
I was discharged

630
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,594
from Special Forces.

631
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:21,397
But, Dinah,
I realized that

632
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:22,932
I don't have to be
anybody.

633
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm already me.

634
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:27,470
I just had to give
myself permission

635
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,038
to get back to that.

636
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,107
And how do you do that
exactly?

637
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:32,541
It starts with
the little things,

638
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:35,945
like a small
studio apartment

639
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:37,379
with a garden.

640
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,282
Yeah.

641
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:43,285
Let's get out of here.

642
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:49,225
You got something?

643
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:52,094
Nothing but
strikeouts. You?

644
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:53,395
Same.

645
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:54,730
Isn't Rene back yet?

646
00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:56,265
No. Why?

647
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,200
You want to go a couple
more rounds with him?

648
00:25:58,202 --> 00:26:00,069
Why don't you like us
talking about this?

649
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:02,638
I just don't like you guys arguing
while I'm trying to work.

650
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,939
Why not? I mean,
there's nothing wrong

651
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,041
with a little healthy
debate, Felicity.

652
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:07,710
It's not healthy if it
doesn't accomplish anything,

653
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:09,912
and it's not going
to accomplish anything.

654
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:16,418
Actually, I--I disagree

655
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,287
not about the part of it

656
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:19,922
not accomplishing
anything

657
00:26:19,924 --> 00:26:22,091
but this idea that it's
not healthy.

658
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:24,460
We used to talk about
things as a society,

659
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:25,895
you know?

660
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:27,429
We'd debate
and we would argue,

661
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:29,932
and we would still
respect each other after.

662
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,001
Yeah. Somewhere along the
line, that just became...

663
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:33,736
- Rude.
- Rude. Yeah.

664
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:35,938
It became impolitic
to talk politics.

665
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,107
I can't help but
wondering that maybe

666
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,509
that's why our country
is the way it is today.

667
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,178
<font color="#0CEC0C">[Computer beeping]</font>

Maybe.

Name of a support group
Edlund used to be a part of.

671
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,120
Maybe somebody there still knows
how to get in contact with him.

672
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:52,655
Text me the address
and have him meet me there.

673
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:54,256

front of the man and...

00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,200
You didn't do it.

785
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,370
'Cause you need me
to enact

786
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:10,672
the Star City
gun registry.

787
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:12,774
I mean, that's what all
this is about, right?

788
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:16,545
You want to punish
the city,

789
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:18,947
because we failed to
protect your family.

790
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,148
<font color="#D900D9">[Footsteps approaching]</font>

791
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,717
But, hey--hey!

792
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:29,591
Mr. Edlund...

793
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:33,562
I--I checked.

794
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:36,398
The man who killed
your family,

795
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,935
he acquired those
guns illegally.

796
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:43,238
There's nothing that we
could have done.

797
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,375
No--no--no registry

798
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:48,443
would have helped us
protect them.

799
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,579
I know.

800
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:54,416
I was supposed
to protect them.

801
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:57,452
Isn't that a man's
job to protect his family?

802
00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:59,655
Isn't that why we have guns?

803
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:02,424
My wife and daughters
were innocent!

804
00:33:02,426 --> 00:33:05,460
I--I can understand
why you're angry.

805
00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:07,496
We're all angry!

806
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:12,267
We're all so angry
all the time.

807
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,236
So why shouldn't I use this?

808
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:16,004
Why shouldn't
I kill everyone,

809
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:17,839
put us all out of our
damn misery.

810
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,107
Mr. Edlund,

811
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:21,076
that's not your call
to make.

812
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:24,613
Yeah. I'm--I mean,
people are angry,

813
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:26,815
and--and we're
hurting,

814
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:28,483
and we're
lashing out.

815
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:30,252
And I can understand
that it feels like

816
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,920
it's--it's getting
worse every day.

817
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,855
But what you're
doing is

818
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:35,591
not the answer.

819
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,027
The people that
you hurt,

820
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:42,564
the 7 people
that are dead...

821
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:46,969
My friend, they were
innocent, too.

822
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:50,672
<font color="#D900D9">[Sobbing softly]</font>

823
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,674
You're right.

824
00:33:56,046 --> 00:33:58,180
And I deserve to be
punished.

825
00:33:58,182 --> 00:34:01,316
Hey, hey, hey. Look,
James,

826
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:03,051
you got to think

827
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:04,820
about your wife
and your daughters.

828
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:06,622
I am thinking about them.

829
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:08,590
I know that you want
this pain to go away.

830
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:13,061
And I know that you
want to be with your family again,

831
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:15,330
but if you want them
to live on,

832
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:18,200
it has to be
through you.

833
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:21,703
That's the only way.

834
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:26,675
James...

835
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:29,745
Give me the gun.
Please?

836
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:57,337
When you ran out on me
last night,

837
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:59,372
you neglected to mention
that it was to go help

838
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:00,640
people at a hospital.

839
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:01,875
I'm forgetful that way.

840
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:03,643
The shooter in custody?

841
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:05,378
D.A. Chase says that he
is going to plead guilty to everything.

842
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,615
Councilwoman Pollard,
this is Rene Ramirez.

843
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:10,450
He works very closely
with Deputy Mayor Lance.

844
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:13,954
And he's a very, very
vocal proponent

845
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:15,588
of gun ownership rights.

846
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,624
Freedom isn't free,

847
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:19,359
not even the freedom
to bear arms.

848
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,962
So Mr. Ramirez and I
got together and came up

849
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:23,430
with this.

850
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:24,597
What is this?

851
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,199
Citywide gun control
ordinances.

852
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:28,969
Nothing that makes it
harder to buy or own

853
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:30,437
or carry a gun.

854
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:32,005
It also doesn't
prohibit people

855
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,543
from protecting themselves.

856
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,047
From gun violence.

857
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:40,613
Ok. I'm gonna back you on
this if for no other reason

858
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:42,048
than the optics
of fighting this

859
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,583
after what happened
are lousy.

860
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,352
There are other reasons,
too, councilwoman.

861
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:48,388
But I want to be perfectly clear
about something.

862
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,357
Not today, not tomorrow,
but eventually,

863
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,359
I am going to extract
a political price for this.

864
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:53,860
You can count on that.

865
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,496
Sounds like a yes.

866
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:58,565
I can live with what
you got here.

867

00:36:08,443 --> 00:36:11,177

Ma'am? Ma'am,
please don't do that.

the phone on me.

Before Darhk was killed,
the citizens of Star City

889

demonstrated there is strength

In light of, uh,
what's happened,

935
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:16,462
I thought it important
that we gather as a city

936
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:18,198
and remember
those that we've lost.

937

After everything that Star City
has endured

938
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,803
in the past several years,

939
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:29,976
it would be easy to become
immune or--or desensitized

940
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:33,146
to the violence that pervades
our lives.

941
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:36,749
And it would be human to want
to respond to that violence

942
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,384
with violence.

943
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,189
When I think of all the people
that I have lost...

944
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:47,527
I remember the choices
that I was forced to make

945
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:49,596
in light of those tragedies.

946
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,201
Some choices were easy.

947
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:58,371
But the important choices,

948
00:39:58,373 --> 00:40:00,240
the choices that
were worth making,

949
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:01,741
they were hard.

950
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:04,811
And hard choices require
bravery.

951
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:09,816
Fortunately, we live in
the home of the brave.

952
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:12,185
And we don't run from
hard choices.

953
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:16,222
We rise up, and we face
tomorrow together.

954
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:23,229
Uh, this afternoon,
councilwoman Pollard and I met

955
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,331
with the city council to pass

956
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,234
the Star City Firearms
Freedom Act,

957
00:40:28,236 --> 00:40:31,437
a policy that respects our
freedom...

958
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:34,841
And our lives.

959
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,846
It shows that we can do both.

960
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,453
And now we just have to be
brave enough to do it.

961
00:40:56,373 --> 00:41:03,173

Move your head.
