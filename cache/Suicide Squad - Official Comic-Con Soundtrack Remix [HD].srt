1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:04,144
Alright! Lights out!

2
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:20,816
Here's to honor
among thieves.

3
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,400
We almost pulled it off.

4
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:29,088
Despite what
everybody thought.

5
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,024
They're gonna blame us for the whole thing.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
We're the patsies.

7
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:40,656
Don't forget ... we're the bad guys.

8
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,912
We've all heard the stories of Samson leveling a temple with a single push.

9
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,768
Or the Philistine weapon of mass-destruction named Goliath.

10
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,288
The next war will be fought with these meta-humans.

11
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:15,232
Ours ... or theirs.

12
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:20,016
I wanna assemble a task-force of the most dangerous people on the planet.

13
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,784
Y'all jokers must be crazy!

14
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:32,832
This is the deal.

15
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:36,240
You're going somewhere very bad.

16
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,344
Look at the pretty lights!

17
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:41,376
To do something that'll get you killed.

18
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:48,384
You might wanna work on your team-motivation-thing.
You ever heard of Phil Jackson? (Yeah) He's like the gold-standard.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,016
Okay? Triangle, bitch.

20
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:54,208
Joker:
What?

21
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Captain Boomerang:
Aaah, you're the fire-bloke, eh? Well, looky here. Fire. Ooooooh!

22
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:09,648
I can't wait to show you my toys.

23
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:13,792
We're going to the swirling ring of trash in the sky.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,320
A walk in the park. Eezy-peezy.

25
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:17,648
Don't make me shoot you.

26
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:33,200
They're so intense!

27
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:00,448
Hey, guys!

28
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,504
