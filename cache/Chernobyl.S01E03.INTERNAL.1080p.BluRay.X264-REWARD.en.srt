1
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:24,771
Is it possible that the water
has already killed them?

2
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,148
Yes.

3
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:28,775
Then what?

4
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,778
If it doesn't work?

5
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,164
Get them in the truck.

6
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,250
Get the hoses in! Start pumping!

7
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,645
Uh, I'm here to see
my husband, Vasily Ignatenko.

8
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,189
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.
I have permission.

9
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,775
Chernobyl? I'm sorry, no visitors.

10
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,488
Well, but Major...
Major Burov told me,

11
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,906
- he said...
- No exceptions.

12
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,784
Please. I've come all the way
from Kievskaya Oblast.

13
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,603
Excuse me.

14
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,398
Excuse me, excuse me.

15
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,833
Who are you? What are you doing here?

16
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,652
- I have a pass.
- You can't be here. It's not safe.

17
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,612
I am here to see my husband.

18
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:20,697
Vasily Ignatenko.

19
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,281
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.

20
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,826
I know who Ignatenko is,
but you can't.

21
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,911
I have permission. I've...

22
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:36,587
You can see him for 30 minutes,
not a minute more.

23
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,465
And you cannot touch him in any way.
Do you understand?

24
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,801
- Yeah.
- Room 15.

25
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:44,554
Thank you.

26
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,056
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- No.

27
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,649
I won't have to
give that to you.

28
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:57,775
There they are.

29
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,837
No, wait, wait, wait.
I haven't finished yet.

30
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:00,987
No, no, he hasn't.

31
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,114
Yeah, that's good.

32
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,243
Yeah, better.

33
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,873
Look who the cat dragged in.

34
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,169
What did I tell you?

35
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,338
There's no hiding from you,
is there? Eh?

36
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,677
Easy, easy. It's okay.

37
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:28,056
We're all okay. Yeah, we're okay.

38
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:41,546
How, how, how did this happen?
Who gave them the idea?

39
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,506
- Are you suggesting I did?
- Someone did.

40
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,093
Someone decided
that the evacuation zone

41
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,346
should be 30 kilometers,
when we know, here,

42
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,182
cesium-137 in the Gomel district.

43
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,893
- That's 200 kilometers away!
- It was decided.

44
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:57,895
- Based on what?
- I don't know!

45
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:03,276
Forgive me. Maybe I... I've just
spent too much time in my lab.

46
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,027
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

47
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,572
Is this really the way it all works?

48
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:10,575
An uninformed, arbitrary decision

49
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,910
that will cost who knows
how many lives

50
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:16,873
made by some apparatchik?
Some career party man?

51
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,043
I'm a career party man.

52
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,797
You should watch your tone,
Comrade Legasov.

53
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,091
Comrades...

54
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:30,803
We have visual confirmation
that the fire is nearly extinguished.

55
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,889
There has also been
a reduction in iodine-131

56
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,807
and cesium-137 emissions.

57
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,517
Good. Yes?

58
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,146
But the temperature is rising.

59
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,606
And, uh...

60
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,657
There's a spike in zirconium-95.

61
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:56,204
It's from the cladding
on the fuel rods.

62
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,623
Meaning what?

63
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,083
The meltdown has begun.

64
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,249
Get it off me!

65
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,254
Get it off me!

66
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,263
Stop moving!

67
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,099
Get off him! You're hurting him!

68
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,060
- You can't be in here.
- What's happening to him?

69
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,603
Get out!

70
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:04,438
You can't be in here!

71
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:48,399
Yes?

72
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,984
<i>Comrade Shcherbina
is on the phone.</i>

73
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,444
Put him through.

74
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,196
Well?

75
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,948
<i>The fire's nearly out.</i>

76
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,783
The bubbler tanks are being drained.

77
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,828
We have successfully eliminated
the risk of a thermal explosion.

78
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,041
And?

79
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,169
The situation inside the core

80
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,130
is deteriorating
faster than anticipated.

81
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,091
The concrete pad will last
for six to eight weeks,

82
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:17,219
but after that, Legasov estimates
a 50% chance

83
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,013
that the fuel will breach the pad

84
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,807
and melt down
into the groundwater itself.

85
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:25,311
And where does this
groundwater go?

86
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,438
The Pripyat River,

87
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,441
which feeds into the Dnieper.

88
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,903
The primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people,

89
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:38,115
not to mention crops and livestock,
would be unusable.

90
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,910
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

91
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,080
to lower the core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

92
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,208
And in order to do that,
I'm told that we will need

93
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,381
all of the liquid nitrogen
in the Soviet Union.

94
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:56,842
<i>Oh.</i>

95
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,095
<i>All right.</i>

96
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,763
Yeah, and of course,
we'll also need...

97
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,139
<i>Whatever you need, you have it.</i>

98
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,663
<i>- That should be clear by now.</i>
- Yes.

99
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,369
<i>- Anything else?</i>
- Uh, no, no, no. Thank you.

100
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:08,437
Yes. I'd like to address
the 30-kilometer exclusion zone.

101
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:11,273
Wait, what?
Professor Legasov, is that you?

102
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,608
What exclusion zone?

103
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,735
Minor details, General Secretary.

104
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,363
Um, Premier Ryzhkov
has determined that...

105
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,824
<i>If he determined, then he determined.</i>

106
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,325
<i>Look, Professor Legasov,</i>

107
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,327
<i>you are there for one reason only.</i>

108
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,454
<i>Do you understand? To make this stop.</i>

109
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:26,747
I don't want questions.

110
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,457
I want to know when this will be over.

111
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,876
If you mean when will
Chernobyl be completely safe,

112
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,130
the half-life of plutonium-239
is 24,000 years.

113
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,383
So perhaps we should just say,
"Not within our lifetimes."

114
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,522
I think you and I should take a walk.

115
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,732
It's late. I'm tired.

116
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,153
We're taking a walk.

117
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,036
What is it you want? An apology?

118
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,540
Not gonna sit back and...

119
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,544
What will happen to our boys?

120
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,881
Which boys? The divers?

121
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,884
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

122
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:23,971
What does the radiation
do to them, precisely?

123
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,309
At the levels
some of them were exposed?

124
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:31,520
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

125
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,316
The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

126
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,487
This is followed by a latency period.

127
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,573
The immediate effects subside.

128
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,408
The patient appears to be recovering.

129
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,995
Healthy, even. But they aren't.

130
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:52,958
This usually only lasts
for a day or two.

131
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:56,670
Continue.

132
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:01,926
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

133
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:07,389
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

134
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:11,185
the organs and soft tissue
begin to decompose.

135
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:15,314
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

136
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,816
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

137
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,487
for the pain, which is unimaginable.

138
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,533
And then three days
to three weeks, you're dead.

139
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,037
That is what will happen
to those boys.

140
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:33,749
And what about us?

141
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,963
Well, we've...

142
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,007
We've gotten a steady dose,
but not as much of it.

143
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,177
Not strong enough to kill the cells,

144
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,305
but consistent enough
to damage our DNA.

145
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,518
So, in time, cancer.

146
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,313
Or a plastic anemia. Either way, fatal.

147
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,359
Well...

148
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:08,033
In a sense, it would seem we've
gotten off easy then, Valery.

149
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:22,506
I've seen them before.

150
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,849
Now you know why I
wanted to take a walk.

151
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,184
We can presume
the work site is bugged.

152
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:39,231
And our rooms, even our bathrooms.

153
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,483
They've been here the whole time.

154
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,569
Of course, they've been here
the whole time.

155
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,699
But if we're seeing them
out in the open now,

156
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,452
it's because they want us to know.

157
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,495
You've seen that?

158
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,999
The fuel is melting
faster than we expected.

159
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,377
I know. I have a plan.

160
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,713
Heat exchanger, I hope.

161
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,256
Yes.

162
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,428
There's something I've wanted
to ask you, comrade,

163
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,848
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

164
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,854
Why did it explode?

165
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,858
I've worked the numbers over and over,

166
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:08,529
presuming the worst possible
conditions in an RBMK reactor.

167
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,158
And I always get the same answer.

168
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,660
Which is?

169
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,246
It's not possible.

170
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,873
And yet...

171
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,045
You're not going to solve this here.

172
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,215
Not on paper.

173
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,719
Everyone who was in the control room,

174
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,179
Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov,

175
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,766
they're all in Moscow,
Hospital Number 6.

176
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,729
We need to find out exactly
what happened that night,

177
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:45,274
moment by moment,
decision by decision.

178
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,694
Go now while they're still alive.

179
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,988
Talk to them.

180
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,657
Because if we don't find out
how this happened,

181
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:56,034
it will happen again.

182
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,956
And, Khomyuk...

183
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,959
Be careful.

184
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,068
Well, fuck you!

185
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,990
Hey, here's one, here's one.

186
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,992
What's as big as a house,

187
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,120
burns 20 liters of fuel every hour,

188
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,039
puts out a shit-load of smoke
and noise,

189
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,501
and cuts an apple into three pieces?

190
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,507
A Soviet machine made to cut
apples into four pieces!

191
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,298
- Who's in charge here?
- I'm the crew chief.

192
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,178
I am Shadov,
Minister of Coal Industries.

193
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,555
We know who you are.

194
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,433
How many men do you have?

195
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,521
On this shift, 45 here,
a hundred in total.

196
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,400
I need all 100 men to gather
their equipment and get in the trucks.

197
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,070
Do you? To where?

198
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,031
That's classified.

199
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,914
Come on, then.

200
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,749
Start shooting.

201
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,919
You haven't got enough
bullets for all of us.

202
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,171
Kill as many as you can,
whoever's left,

203
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,191
they'll beat the living piss
out of each of you.

204
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,467
- You can't talk to us like that!
- Shut the fuck up!

205
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,138
This is Tula. This is our mine.

206
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,974
We don't leave unless we know why.

207
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,102
Mmm.

208
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,275
You're going to Chernobyl.

209
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,987
Do you know what's happened there?

210
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,115
We dig up coal, not bodies.

211
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,577
The reactor fuel is going
to sink into the ground

212
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,580
and poison the water
from Kiev to the Black Sea.

213
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,998
All of it.

214
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,626
Forever, they say.

215
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,297
They want you
to stop that from happening.

216
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,842
And how are we supposed to do that?

217
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,304
They didn't tell me,
because I don't need to know.

218
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,767
Do you need to know,
or have you heard enough?

219
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,811
Now you look like
the Minister of Coal.

220
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,792
Vasya?

221
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,503
Vasya?

222
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,885
No, no, no.

223
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,722
They told you no touching.

224
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,474
It's not safe.

225
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,810
They touch you.

226
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,813
If it's safe for them,
it's safe for me.

227
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,742
Where are the others?

228
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,660
They took them to a special room.

229
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,955
They won't tell me where.

230
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,377
Will you open the curtains?

231
00:22:58,879 --> 00:22:59,880
Hmm?

232
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,548
Open the curtains.

233
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,636
Ah.

234
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,364
Please, tell me what you see outside.

235
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:28,950
Tell me everything.

236
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,459
Um.

237
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,213
I can see the Red Square.

238
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,425
And

239
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,095
the Kremlin.

240
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:52,557
Spasskaya Tower, the mausoleum.

241
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,686
You see St. Basil's?

242
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,815
Yeah.

243
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,608
Ah.

244
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,610
Yes, it's beautiful.

245
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,114
I told you.

246
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,950
I told you I'd show you Moscow,
didn't I?

247
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,243
Huh?

248
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,328
Yeah. Yes.

249
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,086
Thank you.

250
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,052
I'm not eating that. It's shit.

251
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,096
Get me something else.

252
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,933
I'm not a nurse, Comrade Dyatlov.

253
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,852
I'm a nuclear physicist.

254
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,230
Well, then, Comrade Nuclear Physicist,

255
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:28,278
unless you happen to have
a butter and caviar sandwich on you,

256
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,697
you can get the fuck out of my room.

257
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:50,860
What?

258
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,530
I'm not good at this, Boris.

259
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,408
The lying.

260
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,331
Have you ever spent time with miners?

261
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,584
No.

262
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,379
My advice, tell the truth.

263
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:12,841
These men work in the dark.
They see everything.

264
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,678
Andrei Glukhov, crew chief.

265
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,445
Do these work?

266
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:36,781
To an extent.

267
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,077
Of course.

268
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,716
So what's the job?

269
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:00,430
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

270
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,725
underneath this concrete pad.

271
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:07,479
There's no way to approach
from the interior of the building,

272
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,898
so you have to get at it
from underground.

273
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:13,443
- And what's above the pad?
- The core of the nuclear reactor,

274
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,862
which is melting down.

275
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,032
What? Like...

276
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:21,868
Essentially.

277
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,205
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

278
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,082
Not if you're done within six weeks.

279
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,002
Dimensions?

280
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,007
Break ground here,

281
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,468
dig a tunnel 150 meters to here,

282
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,513
excavate a space 30 by 30 meters

283
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,390
for the heat exchanger.

284
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,559
And because we need to keep disruption
of the ground above to a minimum,

285
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,436
you can't use any heavy machinery.

286
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,938
It has to be done by hand.

287
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,690
Gonna need more men.

288
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,151
Four hundred at least.

289
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,779
We'll have to work around the clock.

290
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,622
How deep do you want this tunnel?
Six meters?

291
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:02,742
- Twelve.
- Twelve? Why?

292
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,412
For your protection.

293
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:09,374
At that depth, you'll be shielded
from much of the radiation.

294
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:13,503
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

295
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,673
No.

296
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,634
And we're not 12 meters
below ground now.

297
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:27,225
No. We're not.

298
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,188
We have some equipment
here on site.

299
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,275
More will arrive by midnight.

300
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,194
You can start in the morning.

301
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,155
No. We start now.

302
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:44,742
I don't want my men here
one more second than they need to be.

303
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:49,456
If these worked,
you'd be wearing them.

304
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,176
Are they all like that?

305
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,720
They're all like that.

306
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,471
<i>Yes?</i>

307
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,306
What's it up to?

308
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,683
<i>Uh, 50 degrees.</i>

309
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:36,646
Fuck!

310
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,277
Hey!

311
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:44,571
Hey, you!

312
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,540
We need fans.

313
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,208
For what purpose?

314
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,043
What do you mean, "For what purpose?"

315
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,920
To dig your fucking tunnel,
that's why.

316
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,844
- Who's talking to you?
- Whoa, whoa. Comrades.

317
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,550
It's 50 degrees down there.

318
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,554
We can't breathe without the masks,
we can't breathe with the masks.

319
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,515
It's like a fucking oven.
We need ventilation.

320
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,518
Fans will put dust in the air,
the dust will go in your lungs.

321
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,104
I've been breathing dust
in my lungs for 20 years.

322
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,982
Not this dust. I'm sorry.

323
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,443
For your own good, no fans.

324
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,724
My name is Ulana Khomyuk.

325
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,644
I'm a nuclear physicist
with the Chernobyl Commission.

326
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,398
I want you to tell me
everything that happened

327
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,691
on the night of the accident.

328
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,569
Is that all right?

329
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:10,615
Yes.

330
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,160
I want to tell.

331
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,412
All right.

332
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,095
Your official title was?

333
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:40,269
My name is Leonid Fedorovych Toptunov.

334
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:46,442
I am the Senior Reactor Control
Chief Engineer

335
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,528
at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

336
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,534
Senior engineer?

337
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:57,954
How old are you?

338
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,044
I'm 25.

339
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,553
Lyusya? Lyusya?

340
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,889
Yes, I'm here, I'm here. I'm...

341
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,238
Have you been here this whole time?

342
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:16,365
No one said I should leave.

343
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,326
I did.

344
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,286
Thirty minutes, I said!

345
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,331
Well, where have you been?
When he's in pain?

346
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,458
When his sores stick to his gown?

347
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,019
When he soils himself
five times a night?

348
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,937
I've been looking after him.
Where have you been?

349
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,671
I've been in the north and west wing,

350
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:33,633
where there are dozens of patients
from Chernobyl exactly like him.

351
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,028
- It isn't safe for you here.
- He's my husband.

352
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,094
Not anymore.

353
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,138
He's something else now.
Do you understand?

354
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,515
He's dangerous to you.

355
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,851
He's burned.

356
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,895
Go home.

357
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:47,939
Please.

358
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:53,736
It won't take much longer. I, uh.

359
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,492
I don't want him to die alone.

360
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,914
Stay on the other side of the plastic,

361
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,521
or I'll have you removed by security.

362
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,645
- Lyusya?
- Yes, my love.

363
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:14,650
Is it day?

364
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,112
No, it's nighttime now.

365
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,576
I think I had a dream,

366
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,578
it's just gone.

367
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:28,956
Vasya.

368
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,839
We're going to have a baby.

369
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,044
The fire's out.

370
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:18,965
It's out, Valera.

371
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,885
The miners are making
incredible progress.

372
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:27,223
They say the whole job
will be finished in four weeks.

373
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:29,976
Four weeks.

374
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,395
Can you believe that?

375
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,695
I know the job isn't over.

376
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,365
But it's the beginning of the end.

377
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,790
I'm sorry to bother you,
Deputy Minister,

378
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:56,419
but it is the miners.

379
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:45,801
What?

380
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,554
You wouldn't give us fans,
it's too hot for clothes.

381
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,449
So we're digging the old way.
This is the way our fathers mined.

382
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,498
We're still wearing the fucking hats.

383
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,521
What do you want?

384
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,818
You're not as protected now.

385
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,329
Are you telling me
it will make a difference?

386
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,369
When this is over,

387
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,622
will they be looked after?

388
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:19,960
I don't know.

389
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,598
You don't know.

390
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:56,330
So the power level jumped
from 200 to 400 megawatts?

391
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:58,999
Yes.

392
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:01,210
Very fast.

393
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:06,006
Why didn't you initiate
an emergency shutdown?

394
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,843
Why didn't you press the AZ-5 button?

395
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:11,679
We did.

396
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,766
I reported the increase to Akimov,

397
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,309
and he pressed the button.

398
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,355
Leonid, that's... That's not possible.

399
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,650
He did.

400
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:26,944
I swear.

401
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,405
I saw him do it.

402
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,411
And that's when it exploded.

403
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:39,248
What?

404
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:54,930
Um...

405
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:57,683
Which room is Akimov?

406
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:58,767
Twenty-seven.

407
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:17,453
I pressed it,
before the explosion.

408
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,121
Before.

409
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,417
But why?

410
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:25,920
Why would that happen?

411
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,008
I shut it down. I pressed AZ-5.

412
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:38,724
Thank you, Comrade Akimov.

413
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:45,564
I did everything right.

414
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:49,026
I did everything right.

415
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,600
Get out.

416
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,727
Get out. Get out of here.

417
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:26,146
Let me go! Let me go!

418
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,524
Stop it! Stop it!

419
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:34,405
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic, touching him?

420
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:35,864
Did you know she's pregnant?

421
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:37,116
It's not true!

422
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,409
What have you done?

423
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:40,744
What kind of a place is this?
Where is her protection?

424
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,955
Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

425
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,832
- Of course, I do. Please, I do not...
- No.

426
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,508
- People are going to hear about this.
- Wait.

427
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,461
People are going to hear.
Do you understand?

428
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:50,587
Everyone is going to hear.

429
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:52,923
What is everyone gonna hear?

430
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:01,724
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission.

431
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:04,018
I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

432
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,227
You can check this.

433
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:07,031
- My name is Ulana...
- We know who you are.

434
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:11,942
What is everyone gonna hear?

435
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:34,465
You have your notes?

436
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:36,300
Yes.

437
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,971
Khomyuk was arrested last night.

438
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:43,307
What? Why?

439
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,558
I don't know.

440
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,394
Was it...

441
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:49,480
Of course it was.

442
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:52,441
I'm working on it.

443
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:55,152
- Boris...
- I'm working on it.

444
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,770
What more do you want from me?

445
00:44:58,739 --> 00:44:59,782
Fix your tie.

446
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,873
They'll see you now.

447
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:21,720
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

448
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,014
successfully extinguished the fire.

449
00:45:24,098 --> 00:45:25,933
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

450
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:28,477
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

451
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,272
And furthermore, there's no longer
a threat of additional explosion.

452
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:36,777
The Soviet people have faced
the challenge and risen to the task,

453
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:39,696
and they and everyone in this room
are to be commended.

454
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,454
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

455
00:45:47,538 --> 00:45:49,873
to protect the security
interests of the State.

456
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,626
And since the unfortunate
release of information

457
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,461
directly following the accident,

458
00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:56,588
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

459
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:58,382
Comrade Charkov,

460
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:03,178
we hope we have lived up to
the highest standards of the KGB.

461
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,680
You have.

462
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,515
Thank you.

463
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:12,438
Professor Legasov will now speak
about the work that remains.

464
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,566
Thank you.

465
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:22,656
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

466
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,032
and it is good.

467
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:26,952
The immediate danger is over.

468
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:29,830
Now, I'm afraid,
a long war must begin.

469
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,002
There is an enormous amount
of radioactive debris

470
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,795
and contamination spread out
across a zone

471
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:39,214
of approximately
2,600-square kilometers.

472
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:43,635
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

473
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:48,307
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

474
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,563
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

475
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:57,399
whether domesticated or wild,

476
00:46:57,483 --> 00:47:01,904
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

477
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:04,656
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

478
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,660
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

479
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:14,208
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

480
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:17,920
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

481
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:21,381
which will be carried by the wind
and the rain if left exposed.

482
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:23,634
So we will have to raze
entire forests.

483
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:25,928
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

484
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,387
and bury it under itself,

485
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:30,474
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

486
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:36,355
Um, and finally,
we will need to construct

487
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:40,776
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

488
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,779
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

489
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,951
There will be deaths.

490
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,373
What amount of time,

491
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,083
and how many men do you require?

492
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:59,670
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

493
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:02,339
and approximately 750,000 men,

494
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:06,260
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

495
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,304
How many deaths?

496
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:11,723
Thousands.

497
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:13,934
Perhaps tens of thousands.

498
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,318
Begin at once.

499
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,660
- Comrade Charkov.
- Valery!

500
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:34,871
Yes, Professor?

501
00:48:36,123 --> 00:48:39,001
My associate was arrested last night.

502
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:40,544
Oh?

503
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,671
I mean no disrespect,

504
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,715
but I was wondering
if you could tell me why.

505
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,842
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

506
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:48,844
She was arrested by the KGB.

507
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:52,889
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

508
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:54,349
I am.

509
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:57,311
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

510
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:59,771
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

511
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:04,026
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

512
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:06,069
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

513
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:09,072
Comrade, I know you've heard
the stories about us.

514
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,451
When I hear them, even I am shocked.

515
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,494
But we are not what people say.

516
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:16,788
Yes, people are following you.

517
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,082
People are following those people.

518
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,043
You see them?

519
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:24,838
They follow me.

520
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:29,009
The KGB is a circle of accountability.

521
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,844
Nothing more.

522
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:32,512
You know the work we're doing here.

523
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,974
You really don't trust us?

524
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:37,434
Of course, I do.

525
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,811
But you know the old Russian proverb.

526
00:49:40,646 --> 00:49:42,105
"Trust but verify."

527
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:48,278
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

528
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:49,404
Can you imagine?

529
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,240
It was very nice speaking with you.

530
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,743
I need her.

531
00:49:57,454 --> 00:49:59,915
So you will be accountable for her?

532
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:05,629
Then it's done.

533
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,049
- Her name is...
- I know who she is.

534
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,468
Good day, Professor.

535
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,815
Well, that went surprisingly well.

536
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,317
You came off like a naive idiot.

537
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,279
And naive idiots are not a threat.

538
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,256
I'll come back when
the paperwork's complete.

539
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:58,765
Are you all right?

540
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:00,058
They didn't hurt me.

541
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,730
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

542
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,857
It doesn't matter.

543
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,901
They were stupid. I was stupid.

544
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:13,572
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

545
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:17,701
Akimov, yes, Toptunov, yes, but...

546
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,079
Valery,

547
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,789
Akimov...

548
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,500
His face was gone.

549
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:30,088
You want to stop?

550
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,134
Is that a choice I even have?

551
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:46,146
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

552
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:49,441
I don't know. A 40% chance, maybe.

553
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,529
I said 50.

554
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,657
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing.

555
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,825
"Maybe."

556
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,623
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

557
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:07,834
Maybe the miners who I've told
to dig under the reactor

558
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:09,586
will save millions of lives.

559
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:13,173
Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.

560
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:19,095
I don't want to do this anymore.

561
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:22,224
I want to stop.

562
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,352
But I can't.

563
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:29,648
I don't think you have
a choice any more than I do.

564
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,444
I think, despite the stupidity,

565
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,905
the lies, even this,

566
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:39,157
you are compelled.

567
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,536
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

568
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:43,912
until you find an answer.

569
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,623
Because that is who you are.

570
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,168
A lunatic, then.

571
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:53,755
A scientist.

572
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,280
Did you know that they were
running a safety test?

573
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:21,157
Yeah.

574
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:22,367
There's something else.

575
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:27,414
Akimov says
they shut the reactor down,

576
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:29,416
and Toptunov confirms it.

577
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,251
They pressed AZ-5.

578
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:33,253
Apparently not soon enough.

579
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:34,838
No.

580
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:39,259
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

581
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:42,095
and then the reactor exploded.

582
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,183
If it had been just one of them,
I would have put it under

583
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:50,145
faulty memory or delusion even,

584
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,939
but they both agreed.
They were adamant.

585
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:58,653
Comrade?

586
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:02,782
Do you think it's possible?

587
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:04,451
I think it makes no sense. I.

588
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:08,413
I think it's what I would say if
I was trying to cover my own mistakes.

589
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:10,040
But?

590
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,459
I believe them.

591
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,713
Then you should pursue it.

592
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:19,966
We have to pursue every possibility,

593
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,677
no matter how unlikely,

594
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,847
no matter what or who's to blame.

595
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:31,394
I'll go back to the hospital
and re-interview Akimov and Toptunov.

596
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:35,982
If they're still awake.

597
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:38,818
They're not.

598
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:42,155
Khomyuk.
