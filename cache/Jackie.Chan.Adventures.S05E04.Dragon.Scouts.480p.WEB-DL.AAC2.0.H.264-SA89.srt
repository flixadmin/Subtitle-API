1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,838
Jackie chan: Thank you for
allowing me to ride with you.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,740
The museum asked
that I help ensure

3
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:11,310
that the golden squid
is unloaded safely.

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,878
Driver: Hey, I
appreciate the company.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,747
You wouldn't believe
how dull this job is.

6
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,416
(Helicopter approaching)

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,052
Driver: Wh-what do I do?!

8
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,520
Do--do I pull over?!

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,590
Jackie: No! Keep driving!
Radio the police!

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,827
Jackie: Oof!

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,630
Jackie: Waa!

12
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,265
Mu-ahh! Hah!

13
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,100
Unh! Whoa!

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,850
(Weapon sputtering)

15
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,321
Jackie: High heat
and rubber soles

16
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,857
make for a sticky situation.

17
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,193
Thieves: Huh?
(Crunching)

18
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,395
Jackie: When we arrive
at the police station,

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,597
you will be--wha?!

20
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,874
Capt. Black: Just got word
about the attempted
hijacking, Jackie.

21
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,009
Jackie: Captain black?
But how--

22
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,679
capt. Black: You know
section 13 monitors
all police transmissions.

23
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,214
Can you I.D. The perps?

24
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,883
Jackie: Well, at first
I suspected the enforcers,

25
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,551
but they were sent
to prison last month.

26
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,753
Capt. Black:
And released 3 days ago.

27
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,889
Court ordered them to serve
out the rest of their
sentences

28
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,691
doing community service.

29
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,659
Jackie: If they are back
to their old ways,

30
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,696
the community does not
need that kind of service.

31
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,698
Capt. Black: Enforcers
can't be reincarcerated

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,867
without proof
of criminal activity,

33
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,635
but you catch 'em red-handed

34
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,372
and I'll see to it
that they're put away
for a long, long time.

35
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,578
Jackie: Jade,
what are you doing?

36
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,348
Those clothes are
being donated to charity,

37
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,851
and that is your
buttercup scout uniform.

38
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,586
Jade chan: I know.
I quit the buttercups.

39
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,388
Jackie: Wha? Why?

40
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,958
Jade: Quilt-making,
cookie-selling, hello?

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,793
If I wanted to be bored
out of my gourd,

42
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,729
I could just hang here
with you and uncle.

43
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,330
Uncle chan:
You want excitement,

44
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,166
sweep up shop.

45
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,436
Jackie: Ohh!
But scouting provides
a valuable experience, Jade.

46
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,005
You mustn't quit.

47
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,607
Jade: So who said anything
about quitting scouting?

48
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,010
I joined the dragon scouts.

49
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,246
Jackie: But the dragon scouts
are all boys.

50
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,414
Jade: <i> Were.</i>

51
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,949
Welcome
to the new millennium

52
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,451
where girls are hot
and boys are not.

53
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,087
I am dragon. Hear me roar!

54
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,024
The dragons are meeting
tonight at my school,
uncle Jackie.

55
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,359
Jackie: Jade,
what did you do?

56
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,005
Jackie: Uh,
friends of yours?

57
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,641
Jade: Nope. Something
about them seems...

58
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,710
Familiar, though.

59
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,912
You gotta turn that in
at the principal's office.

60
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,881
Jackie: Fine. I will see you
in the hallway

61
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,182
after your meeting.

62
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,652
(Banging)

63
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,090
Finn: Come on, come on.

64
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,197
Ratso: Not you.

65
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,433
Jackie: You failed
to hijack the antiquities,

66
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,735
so now you're robbing
school lockers?

67
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,503
Chow:
What's he talkin' about?

68
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,942
Jackie: May I have a look?

69
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,945
Finn: Last time I checked,
you ain't the hall monitor,

70
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,747
so take a hike, chan.

71
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,650
Jackie: Perhaps
you have something to hide.

72
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,486
Chow: Perhaps
you don't hear so good.

73
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,237
Jackie: I do not
want to fight you...

74
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,772
At school.

75
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,074
Finn: Too bad, 'cause
here comes today's lesson.

76
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,169
Jackie: Ow!

77
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,004
Dragon leader:
What in Sam hill

78
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,506
is going on here?!

79
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,807
Finn: Uh...

80
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,208
Bucket turned over.

81
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,910
Dragon leader:
Looks more like horseplay,

82
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,012
and horseplay
undermines discipline.

83
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,315
A fine example
you're setting

84
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,650
for your boy, Mr. Finn.

85
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,253
Jackie: Boy?
You have a boy?

86
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,923
Finn: My nephew.

87
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,124
Chow: Mine, too.

88
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,327
Ratso: My sister's kid,
visitin' for the Summer.

89
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,528
Frank: Frank.

90
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,729
Charley: Charley.

91
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,997
Rocko: Uh, rocko.

92
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,398
Dragon leader:
All right, dragons,

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,334
store your gear,
on the double.

94
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,005
Jackie: Why were you
breaking in to that locker?

95
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,007
Finn: We weren't, Mr. nosy.

96
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,809
We're doin'
community service here.

97
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,511
Part of the deal
for gettin' out
of the joint early.

98
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,948
Jackie: Oh!
Oh, you are janitors.

99
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,819
Chow: Hey!
Custodial engineers.

100
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,621
Finn: Ot-nay in front
of the ephews-nay.

101
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,693
Finn: Look, chan,
whole reason we want
the kids to be scouts

102
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,895
is to learn good values.

103
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,164
Ratso: So they don't
end up bums, like us.

104
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,900
Rocko: Ha ha ha!
You're funny, uncle ratso.

105
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,769
Charley: Yeah,
seein' how you guys own,

106
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,771
like, the biggest
import-export business

107
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,473
on the west coast.

108
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,441
Chow: Heh. Yeah,
well, you know,

109
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,143
we ain't ones to brag.

110
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,947
Jackie: Who would've guessed
that the enforcers

111
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,249
would have
such nice nephews?

112
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,151
Jade: Nice? Jackie!

113
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,653
Those three have "crooked"
written all over 'em!

114
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,189
But don't worry.
I'm all over it.

115
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,891
I'll be your eyes and ears,

116
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,992
find out what
they're cookin' up.

117
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,062
Jackie: Jade,
we must not prejudge.

118
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,899
Sometimes the apple
falls far from the tree.

119
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,134
Jade: And hits the ground
and turns rotten.

120
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,973
Jade: Gotta go
with my gut on this one.

121
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,975
Something about those nephews
isn't right,

122
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,076
and I'll prove it.

123
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,412
Just need a little backup.

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,881
Capt. Black: Jade?

125
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,823
Jade: Hello, old friend!

126
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,092
Cock-a-doodle
how-do-you do?

127
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,630
(Jackie yawns)

128
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,699
Jackie: Jade?
Where are you heading?

129
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,535
Jade: Dragon scouts meeting,
Jackie.

130
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,370
Going for my first
merit badge.

131
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,238
Jackie: Oh. So,
what will you be doing?

132
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,108
Some sort of
arts and crafts project?

133
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,210
Jade: Crafts?
Get real, Jackie.

134
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,779
Dragon leader promised
it'd be something in the wild.

135
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,849
Probably an intense
survival program
in the jungle

136
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,619
surrounded by bloodthirsty
creatures!

137
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,254
Gotta be kidding me.

138
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,491
<i>This</i> is what he calls
being "in the wild"?

139
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,661
Dragon leader:
All right, dragon scouts,

140
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,664
your first merit badge
will be in nature studies,

141
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,799
and today
we'll be bird-watching.

142
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,334
Jade: Bird-watching?

143
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,869
Dragon leader:
Present dragon scopes,

144
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,137
front and center.

145
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,408
Dragon leader: Outstanding.

146
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,076
You have 60 minutes.

147
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,046
Notate all sightings
in your logbooks.

148
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,281
I will be spot-checking,

149
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,718
and the zoo area
is off limits! Fall out!

150
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,298
Jade: Ice cream heist
at 10 o'clock.

151
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,038
Frank: You got a problem?

152
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,807
We're tryin'
to bird-watch here.

153
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,609
Charley: Yeah. We been
scopin' out a pigeon.

154
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,410
Rocko: Pretty pigeon.

155
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,446
Jade: Not on my watch.

156
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,181
Frank: Oh, I get it.

157
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,782
She can't cut it solo,

158
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,851
so she's tryin'
to tag along.

159
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,319
Jade: As if!

160
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:45,323
Charley: She's a wannabe,
same as her uncle.

161
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,095
Jade: Uh, reality check?

162
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,563
<i>My</i> uncle's a wannabe?

163
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,831
Charley: Uh, yeah.

164
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,034
We got the 411
how your unc is bunk.

165
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,837
Rocko: Ha ha ha!
Unc is bunk. Ha ha ha!

166
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,039
Charley: He can't
even hold down a job.

167
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,275
Frank: Heh heh heh.
Wishes he was big-time

168
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,043
like our uncles.

169
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,313
Charley: Which is why
he's always followin'
them around.

170
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,814
Nephews: Loser!

171
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,817
Jade: Hey, the only reason
Jackie's always tailing
your uncles

172
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,320
is because
they're low-life crooks.

173
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,922
Rocko: Take it back!

174
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,356
Jade: Bring it on, tiny.

175
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,659
Rocko: Whoa--unh!

176
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,161
Jade: Who's the l-word now?

177
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,696
Frank: Uh, Jade,

178
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,097
a little advice...

179
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,700
Jade: What's that supposed
to--hey!

180
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:32,137
Nephews: 3-way keep-away!
Ha ha ha!

181
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,372
Jade: You just bought
yourselves a world of hurt!

182
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,540
Give that back!

183
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,880
(Jade sniffs)

184
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,882
Jade: Ohh! Yuck.

185
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,684
Serious stank.

186
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,789
(Bear growls)

187
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,224
Jade: Got it.
Your pad, my bad.

188
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,730
Jade: Ohh!

189
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,432
(Bear roars)

190
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,435
Jade: Bad day,
bad day, bad day!

191
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,480
Frank: Oh, man,
we gotta help her!

192
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,648
Charley: How?

193
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,850
Rocko: Uh, I got nothin'.

194
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,395
Frank: That jump was freaky.

195
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,130
Charley: Freaky on a stick.

196
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,232
How do you get
that kind of hang time?

197
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,234
Jade: Um, aerobics?

198
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,304
Rocko: Ha ha. She was
pretty gutsy with that Bear.

199
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,306
Not like before,
when she's all,

200
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,241
(high-pitched voice)
"I want my cap back."

201
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,810
Charley, high-pitched voice:
I want my cap back!
Give me my cap back!

202
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,178
Frank: Please, oh, please!

203
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,215
Nephews: Ha ha ha!

204
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,550
Jade: You are so asking
to get your butts kicked.

205
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,185
Dragon leader:
Dragon scout Jade!

206
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,121
You disobeyed
a direct dragon order

207
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,722
to stay clear of the zoo,

208
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,425
and now I see you displaying
aggressive behavior

209
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,193
towards your fellow scouts.

210
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,062
Frank:
Yeah. Dragon scout Jade

211
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,197
definitely needs
an attitude adjustment.

212
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,732
Charley:
Oh, she's a bad egg.

213
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,968
Rocko: I like eggs...
Over easy.

214
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,136
Jade: But they--

215
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,604
dragon leader:
No merit badge.

216
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,239
Jade: Ohh!

217
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,545
Finn:
Well, what do you know?

218
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,415
don't you ever get tired
of tailing us, chan?

219
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,417
Jackie: Uh, actually, yes,

220
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,619
but that is not
why I am here.

221
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,155
I guess the dragon leader
called you in, too.

222
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,158
My niece and your nephews,
fighting.

223
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,226
Ratso: We came
to pick up our uniforms.

224
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,661
Jackie: Uniform?

225
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,797
Dragon leader: Volunteering
to be dragon daddies.

226
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,165
Outstanding.

227
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,168
No wonder your nephews
are such fine young men.

228
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,235
On the other hand...

229
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,637
Fall in behind me, Mr. chan.

230
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,240
We need to discuss
Jade's behavior.

231
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,577
Chow: Heh. If you need
some parenting tips, chan,

232
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,479
I'm here for ya.

233
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,047
Enforcers: Ha ha ha!

234
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,682
Jackie: And the dragon leader
warned me,

235
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,617
any more of this type
of behavior,

236
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,286
you will be kicked out.

237
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,054
So, please,

238
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,424
behave yourself
on this weekend's
dragon adventure.

239
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,393
Jade: We're having
a dragon adventure?

240
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,261
It's gonna
be something cool!

241
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,529
Extreme go-kart racing?

242
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,731
Mountain climbing?

243
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,632
Jackie: The museum.

244
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,335
Jade: I quit the buttercups
for this?

245
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,438
Jackie: The museum
has just opened
its far east exhibit.

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,474
I do not like this one bit.

247
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,009
Jade: You and me both.
Bor-ing!

248
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,311
Jackie: I suspect
the golden squid

249
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,645
is the reason the enforcers

250
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,548
volunteered
to be dragon daddies.

251
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,117
Jade: I get it.

252
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,485
A dragon adventure,

253
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,354
the perfect cover
for a heist.

254
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,324
Jackie: Perhaps, which
is why I am coming along.

255
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,792
Jade: Good thinking.

256
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,260
I'll keep an eye
- on frank, Rocco, and Charley

257
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,329
while you--
you're a dragon daddy?!

258
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,930
Jackie: Yes--ohh!

259
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,866
And you are levitating!

260
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,335
You have
the rooster talisman!

261
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,837
Jade: Well--heh heh. I--

262
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,173
please, uncle Jackie,
let me take it to the museum.

263
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,175
If the enforcers
try to pull anything--

264
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,545
uncle: Eye-yah! Magic
is not to be trifled with!

265
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,314
Jackie: Hand over
the talisman, ja--ow!

266
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,517
Uncle: As long
as you are up there,

267
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,253
clean cobwebs from ceiling.

268
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,125
Curator:
Welcome, dragon scouts.

269
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,328
You are about to see
the finest collection
of far east antiquities

270
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,265
ever assembled
in the northern hemisphere,

271
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,267
and the centerpiece
of our collection

272
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:26,504
is the exquisite
- 3,000-year-old golden squid.

273
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,605
Priceless.

274
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,375
Finn: Priceless
is my favorite number.

275
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,149
Frank: Sweet.

276
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,551
Charley: Boo-bama.

277
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,486
Rocko: Pretty.

278
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,024
Jade: don't even
think about it.

279
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,670
Jackie: Why are you
leaving your group?

280
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,805
Finn: Potty break, ok?

281
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,913
Jackie: All three
at the same time?

282
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,350
Dragon scouts, gasping:
Hey! What's going on?!

283
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,852
Dragon leader:
As you were, dragons.

284
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,119
Remain calm.

285
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,288
Curator:
- Just a power outage.

286
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,857
(Generator hums)

287
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,124
Dragon scouts, gasping:
Huh? What happened? What?

288
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,192
Jackie: What has happened?!

289
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,194
Curator: The golden squid...

290
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,996
It's been stolen!

291
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,265
The culprits may
still be on the premises.

292
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,499
Evacuate the children!

293
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,802
Jackie: I agree.

294
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,036
Dragon leader:
All right, dragons,

295
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,772
single file in double time.
Move out!

296
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,549
Jackie: Stop!

297
00:14:55,694 --> 00:15:00,031
Jackie: I have caught you
red-handed with...

298
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,399
Toilet paper?

299
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,134
Ratso: We're runnin' low
at home.

300
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,402
Chow: Whatcha gonna do,

301
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,337
call the potty patrol?

302
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,707
Jackie: But if you didn't
steal the golden squid,

303
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,509
then who?

304
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,127
Jade: Yes!

305
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,762
I am <i> good.</i>

306
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,864
Frank: Oh, that's my locker!

307
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,266
Charley: Back away,
or you're gonna pay!

308
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,936
Jade:
You three are so busted.

309
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,104
Frank: Heh heh heh.
Pretty lame, Jade.

310
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,207
You swiped that thing
and planted it in my locker.

311
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,310
Jade: Ooh, good cover story.

312
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,812
Not! What kind
of criminals are you?

313
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,615
Man: Oh,
they're not criminals...

314
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,750
But we are.

315
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,063
Jade:
It's the museum curator!

316
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,699
Charley: Ohh,
didn't see that coming.

317
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,067
Frank: Inside job.

318
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,401
Rocko: Yeah!

319
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,037
Inside where?

320
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,439
Curator: Heh heh heh.

321
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,506
I'll take that.

322
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,475
Jade: Guess again.

323
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,710
Jade to frank!

324
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,483
Frank: Frank to rocko!

325
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,538
Finn: Uhh! Hey,
watch the hair!

326
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,507
Community service stinks.

327
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,411
Chow: No kidding.
- I make holes. He fills holes.

328
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,216
Finn: Boys, I think
our ship just came in.

329
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,755
Chow: Hey, he's got
the golden squid!

330
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,193
Finn: I stand corrected.

331
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,230
Community service
does have its rewards.

332
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,235
Curator: Ohh!

333
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,471
Finn: Mm-wah.

334
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,874
Gentlemen, the only street
we're gonna be working

335
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,843
from now on is easy street.

336
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,415
Ratso: Ohh!
Why can't <i> we</i> ever win?

337
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,917
Jackie: Heh heh heh.
I came to apologize

338
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,587
for falsely accusing you
of stealing the...

339
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,958
Jackie: The golden squid!

340
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,693
You <i> did</i> steal it!

341
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,396
Finn: Not exactly,
but it's ours now.

342
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,032
Ratso: Got it off the real
thief fair and square.

343
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,435
Jackie:
It is museum property.

344
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,549
Jackie: Whoa!

345
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,517
Oof! Bad day!

346
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,520
Bad day! Bad day!

347
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,334
Jackie: Think of it
this way.

348
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,636
You have not lost a statue,

349
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,538
you have become a statue.

350
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,073
Finn: Um, chan, please,

351
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,576
uh, don't tell the kids
about this.

352
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,744
Chow: Yeah.
- It'd break their hearts.

353
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,880
Ratso: They think
we're, you know...

354
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,749
Jackie: Successful
import-exporters?

355
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,551
I will spare them the truth.

356
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,487
Finn: Thanks. Who knows?

357
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,989
Maybe someday
we can redeem ourselves,

358
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,658
become the upstanding,
law-abiding citizens

359
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,093
they think we are.

360
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,996
Finn: Nah.

361
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,297
Chow and ratso:
No way. I don't think so.

362
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,465
Finn: Scary thought.

363
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,068
Ratso: Be laughin'
if I could breathe.

364
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,302
Capt. Black: The curator
and his lackeys

365
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,904
are in custody, Jackie.

366
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,573
Turns out he's a con artist
named Michael Diaz.

367
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,876
Has a rap sheet
long as my arm.

368
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:08,012
Finn: Yeah, so, we're gonna
take a ride with,

369
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,849

370
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,918
Ratso: Gonna be goin' away

371
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,020
Chow: To the far east.

That's

business for ya.

375
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,629
Frank: We'll come
visit again next Summer.

376
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,097
Finn: Terrific.

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,103
Charley: Ciao, uncle chow.

Rocko: Later, uncle ratso.

381
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,541
Nephews: Bye, now!
See ya soon!

382
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,310
Jackie: I do not encourage
lying, Jade,

383
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,945
but there is no need
to tell the young men

384
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,514
that their uncles
are going to prison.

385
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,918
Jade: Hey, uncle Jackie,

386
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,352
better not let
the dragon leader

387
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,288
catch you out of uniform.

388
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,356
Nephews and Jade:
4-way keep-away! Ha ha ha!

389
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,659
Jackie: Give me that back.

390
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,360
This is not funny!

391
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,296
It is very disrespectful!

392
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,903
Jane: Hey Jackie, do you have
any bad jobs before you
became an actor?

393
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,072
Jackie: After the 10 years
in a martial arts school,

394
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,674
I went to Australia.

395
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,543

396
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,446

Um, I don't think

403
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,092
If I'm continue

404
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,727
I'm becoming
like a professional.

405
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,861
There's no bad job.
