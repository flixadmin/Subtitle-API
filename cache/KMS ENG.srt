1
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,244
You know what happens
at that height?

2
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:24,586
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen...

3
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,243
cell by cell.

4
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:29,221
It just shuts down...

5
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,713
and the body goes with it.

6
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,194
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

7
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:17,203
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

8
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,110
It's always the easiest.

9
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:23,588
OK, I'll start
at the beginning.

10
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:53,454
I grew up on the plains
in lndiana.

11
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,938
I was a flatlander,
through and through.

12
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:57,961
To be honest...

13
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,103
I really didn't have
much to leave behind.

14
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:03,929
Virtually no family
and very few friends.

15
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,776
Anyway, it was January.

16
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:11,355
I'd already been in London
a year and a half.

17
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,583
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

18
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,011
Then I met Jake.

19
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,361
What I loved the most...

20
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:24,140
was how comfortable
we were with each other.

21
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:26,858
I felt safe.

22
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,179
OK, let's go.

23
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:47,507
I design CD-roms
and websites...

24
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:48,661
for corporate clients.

25
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,099
That must pay well.

26
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,336
It sounds fancier
than it is.

27
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:53,999
Jake was an engineer.

28
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,355
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

29
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:58,698
He kept his tube tickets...

30
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,872
in a wallet he got
when he was twelve.

31
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:03,907
Same wallet,
same inside pocket.

32
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:06,458
Alice? Alice?

33
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,477
See you later.

34
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,524
Hey, Alice.

35
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:22,483
You going in?

36
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:23,430
Yeah.

37
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,406
I'll see you in a minute.

38
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:26,383
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

39
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:29,131
to make it look like
a game on the website.

40
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,755
We tried that with
the appliance kings.

41
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,558
Yes, but this isn't
about washing machines.

42
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:38,718
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

43
00:06:42,878 --> 00:06:45,179
You're the new media pioneers.

44
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:46,746
Think of something.

45
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:49,295
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

46
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:52,149
Are you with us, Alice?

47
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,229
I'm going out
to get my hair trimmed.

48
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,372
I'll be back after lunch.

49
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:32,802
Oh, shoot!

50
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,483
And you got in?

51
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,828
Yeah...

52
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:58,028
I got in.

53
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,991
What's your name?

54
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,199
Alice.

55
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,166
Alice.

56
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,794
Don't turn away.

57
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:14,999
Come here tomorrow.

58
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,276
I have to work.

59
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:24,404
Then come back tonight.

60
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:26,642
I can't.

61
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:33,231
Whenever you want, Alice.

62
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:37,285
You decide, and I'll be here.

63
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,313
I couldn't believe
what had happened that day.

64
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,471
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

65
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:00,010
I wanted everything
back the way it was.

66
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,773
What do you want me to do?

67
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,742
Nothing, just keep doing
what you're doing.

68
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,701
That was when
I found out his name...

69
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,874
Adam Tallis...

70
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,628
and that he climbed mountains.

71
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:20,703
He caused quite a stir
here yesterday.

72
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,037
He saved
six people up there...

73
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:25,336
with no oxygen.

74
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:17,956
You stop me
whenever you want.

75
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:19,580
Please don't stop.

76
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:31,050
I bought your book today.

77
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,768
It isn't my book.

78
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:36,392
I'm just in it.

79
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,683
It looks good.

80
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:45,154
People died, Alice.

81
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,720
Something went very wrong.

82
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,414
There was a woman
named Francoise Collette.

83
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:16,260
I lost the whole group.

84
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:22,847
I still don't understand
what happened.

85
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,894
There was no room for error.

86
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:26,201
Everything had been checked.

87
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,626
I was in love with her.

88
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,822
Do you know what it's like
over 20,000 feet?

89
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:48,956
It's like this.

90
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:52,887
Without air,
the brain cells die.

91
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,826
It shuts down.

92
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,749
and then the rest
of the body follows.

93
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:11,021
It's been two years...

94
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:13,256
and it doesn't go away.

95
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:24,498
I live with someone.

96
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,035
But you're here.

97
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,065
I have to go.

98
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:42,922
Don't put them on.

99
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,339
Hi. Where are you?

100
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm running some errands.

101
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,046
Do you think you could
pick up my watch...

102
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:13,004
on the way home?

103
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:13,964
I'm running behind schedule.

104
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:14,921
I'm never going to make it.

105
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:15,869
Of course I can.

106
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:19,524
I missed you today, Alice.

107
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:21,507
Miss you.

108
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,465
I love you.

109
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:23,479
Love you.

110
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:42,788
Knock it! Not nice.

111
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,274
And give it!

112
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:49,181
Go in!

113
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,749
A card? Ref,
that's a bit harsh.

114
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,657
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...

115
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:18,207
There's nobody there!

116
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,580
I have to leave you.

117
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,499
You what?

118
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,253
I can't go on like this.
I'm sorry.

119
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:26,840
I have to leave.

120
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:32,530
You have to leave me?

121
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,162
We're together.

122
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,394
We're perfect together.

123
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:55,961
I want to marry you.

124
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:01,461
I met somebody.

125
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:14,445
Who did you meet?

126
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,653
You don't know him.

127
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,441
I'm sorry.

128
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:20,551
When did you meet him?

129
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:21,766
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

130
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,587
It's not the point--

131
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,218
It's very much the point!

132
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,487
We go to the market
together every Sunday!

133
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:31,163
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

134
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,537
Jesus!

135
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,216
Where you going?

136
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,044
You were looking for Adam.

137
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:11,218
He's not here
at the moment...

138
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:14,030
but it's cold out there.
Come in.

139
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:17,387
Please, come in.

140
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:26,812
I've been climbing in Chile.

141
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,964
Adam always takes
his pictures down...

142
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,548
or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

143
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,282
Oh, please, sit down.

144
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,377
For me, pictures
tell me who I am...

145
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:46,635
but for Adam,
they steal his soul.

146
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,592
Want some?

147
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:52,582
No, thank you.

148
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:53,563
No, it's quite good.

149
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:57,824
I'm his sister.

150
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,263
You're his sister?

151
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,372
Yep. I'm Deborah.

152
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:04,825
We climb together a lot.

153
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,679
He was having some work
done on his place...

154
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,427
so he stayed here
while I was gone.

155
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:11,827
This...

156
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,857
is Mr. Know-it-all.

157
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,099
It's his name.

158
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,106
This is Francoise, right?

159
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,512
That's the real reason...

160
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:30,909
my brother takes
the pictures down...

161
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,119
because it's...

162
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,999
too hard for him to see her.

163
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:39,699
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

164
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,439
he's afraid of remembering.

165
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:49,706
What he forgets...

166
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:52,135
is that he's not
the only one responsible.

167
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:53,890
I was up there, too.

168
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:58,424
She was
my best friend, Alice.

169
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:10,574
Yes, I know your name.

170
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:15,469
You're very beautiful.

171
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:19,906
I can see why he'd
fall so hard for you.

172
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:29,087
The thing about my brother...

173
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,703
is you're either
with him or you're not.

174
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:36,634
And once you've made
the jump and you're with him...

175
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:37,880
that's it...

176
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,308
there's no discussion.

177
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:46,863
Can I have his address?

178
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:49,762
Yes, of course.

179
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,260
Thank you.

180
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,132
I left him.

181
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:14,958
You're hurting me.

182
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,218
Morning.

183
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,411
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

184
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,969
Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

185
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:18,992
I'm interviewing Adam

186
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:20,686
about his Himalayan
clean-up project.

187
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,789
Nice to meet you.

188
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,982
Where can I find a shirt?

189
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,065
Your phone?

190
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:05,143
Would you get that for me?

191
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:14,353
No one there.

192
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,482
In some respects,
it's just become...

193
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:21,229
a playground for
the rich and inexperienced.

194
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:25,758
Thank you.

195
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,148
I have to go to work.

196
00:26:30,148 --> 00:26:31,523
Will you think
about me today?

197
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,665
Yes.
What are you doing today?

198
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:34,613
Thinking about you.

199
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:38,206
Do you want to learn
how to climb?

200
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:39,804
Sure.

201
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:41,396
Come and see me after work.

202
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:30,983
That's good.

203
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,890
He's not as strong
as he was last week.

204
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:43,701
It's lovely to see you.

205
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:48,787
I see you've got a harness.

206
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:50,226
Do you want to put it on?

207
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:53,071
Just put your feet
in there...

208
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,977
and pull it up
like a pair of trousers.

209
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,354
That's great.

210
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:07,967
That's right, double-back in.

211
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,055
There we go.

212
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,014
It suits you.

213
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:10,962
Thank you.

214
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,050
It's OK. I'm helping her.

215
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,265
How are you?

216
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:22,416
OK, fine.

217
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,589
I'm sorry.

218
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:25,670
Let me check your harness.

219
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,684
Seems to be good.

220
00:28:35,204 --> 00:28:37,344
She's my sister,
but she drives me mad.

221
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:38,521
I swear it's chemical.

222
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:40,925
You ready?

223
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:42,331
I don't know. Maybe.

224
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,475
Come on.

225
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:50,003
Well, finally, Alice.

226
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:52,849
The flatlander captured
the mountain boy.

227
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:55,981
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

228
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,257
I liked your book.

229
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:00,577
Well, thank you.

230
00:29:02,855 --> 00:29:04,228
Well, nice to meet you.

231
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:10,814
This looks hard.

232
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,153
It's all in the mind.

233
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,935
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

234
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:34,085
Really?

235
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:37,116
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

236
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,191
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

237
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:42,908
No. Probably best not
to mention the lingerie.

238
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:45,562
I'm still in the big
white cotton panties.

239
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:46,988
I'm sorry.
I'm a little manic.

240
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,010
Have you seen Jake?

241
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:54,385
Of course I have.

242
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:56,139
He's been my friend
for 15 years.

243
00:29:57,614 --> 00:29:58,573
How is he?

244
00:29:58,573 --> 00:29:59,531
What can I say?

245
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,747
He's smoking like a fiend...

246
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:01,791
and he's completely fucked up.

247
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:04,769
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

248
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:08,701
Sorry.

249
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:16,503
I think that you're
destroying both of your lives.

250
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:19,221
I'm sorry.

251
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:25,360
You had somebody
who loved you.

252
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,725
You loved each other...

253
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,570
and you let him go
for good sex.

254
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,280
Love isn't just
a good fuck, you know?

255
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,238
This is more.

256
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:36,612
More what?

257
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:37,571
More everything.

258
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:39,744
When I'm with him,
everything is more.

259
00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:40,703
Oh, God, Alice.

260
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:41,853
You could write
greetings cards.

261
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:43,227
You really bloody could.

262
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:49,672
Sorry.

263
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,342
Right.

264
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:58,726
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

265
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,899
I could do with some retail
therapy myself, I think.

266
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,017
I can't,
but come with me.

267
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,423
I'm gonna
see Adam at 3:00.

268
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:04,370
You can meet him.

269
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:12,115
And there's this
really amazing store...

270
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:14,479
and I haven't bought it
yet, but I will...

271
00:31:25,186 --> 00:31:26,676
It's OK. She's fine.

272
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,462
Call the police.

273
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:03,940
Adam! Stop!

274
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,168
When I saw him...

275
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:20,373
oh, Jesus.

276
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,004
That'll never happen again.

277
00:32:22,004 --> 00:32:23,048
I won't let it.

278
00:32:26,317 --> 00:32:27,628
Are you OK?

279
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:28,873
Yeah.

280
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:30,439
I'll always be here, Alice.

281
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:31,876
Yeah.

282
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,220
I'll protect you.

283
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,179
Say you believe me.

284
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:35,290
I believe you.

285
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:42,830
Marry me.

286
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:50,539
The sooner the better.

287
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:52,649
Tomorrow.

288
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:54,437
The day after,
as soon as possible.

289
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,442
-Marry me!
-Yes!

290
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,235
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

291
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,154
"Use your head, Alice.

292
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:40,192
"What do you really know
about him?"

293
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,092
Hey, you ready?

294
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,268
Look at this.

295
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:54,642
Someone's trying to scare you.

296
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:55,601
There's been
a call this morning.

297
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:56,561
There was someone there...

298
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:57,672
but they didn't say anything.

299
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:00,300
Makes me sick.

300
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,431
If anything else
happens like this again...

301
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,916
make sure you tell me, OK?

302
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:09,018
You'll be fine.

303
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:39,253
Do you, Alice...

304
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:40,883
promise to love
and cherish Adam...

305
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:42,832
for as long
as you both shall live?

306
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,494
I do.

307
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:48,137
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

308
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:50,375
for as long
as you both shall live?

309
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,781
I do.

310
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:53,890
May the Lord
bless this union...

311
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,438
and secure it from all harm.

312
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:19,838
How do you know the priest?

313
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:22,458
This is my family church.

314
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,727
You have a family church?

315
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,454
Wow, I have a mother
who doesn't talk to me...

316
00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:27,728
and a dad I've never met.

317
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:30,001
It doesn't matter.

318
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,646
My life began
when we first saw each other.

319
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,605
Come on.
I need you to see something.

320
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:38,552
What?

321
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:55,692
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

322
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:57,034
Now, I want you
to see this...

323
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:59,006
through my eyes
when I was six.

324
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:01,792
Look. Like this.

325
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:11,412
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces?

326
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,610
And we spend our lives

327
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,331
searching for
our other half.

328
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,031
You're it.

329
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:30,353
OK, here we are.

330
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,364
We're getting dressed here?

331
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,422
Yep. Here.

332
00:36:57,558 --> 00:36:59,987
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

333
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:01,643
I need to remember you
like this.

334
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:18,585
Come on. I don't want you
to freeze to death.

335
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:20,241
Come on.

336
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:53,385
This is the only
way station...

337
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:54,661
for hikers
in the whole area.

338
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:58,552
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

339
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,428
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

340
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:11,334
That's his idea of romance.

341
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,854
I thought a honeymoon
was lying in bed...

342
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:19,940
with room service.

343
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,040
Oh, I'll give you
a honeymoon you won't forget.

344
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,958
I promise.

345
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:25,904
No, no, sit down.

346
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:31,407
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

347
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:33,840
Count if you have to.

348
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:42,242
I'm gonna make you strong!

349
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:53,206
I wanted him to be
proud of me...

350
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,343
so I followed the trail
for hours.

351
00:39:44,368 --> 00:39:45,544
You made it.

352
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:56,736
What's that?

353
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:57,886
It's an anchor...

354
00:39:57,886 --> 00:39:59,923
to catch a falling body.

355
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:03,945
Catch.

356
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:09,932
Do you trust me?

357
00:40:09,932 --> 00:40:10,913
Yes.

358
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:20,541
Don't move.

359
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:56,557
I gave up all control.

360
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:59,113
I let him decide
when I could breathe...

361
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:01,796
and when I couldn't.

362
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:03,617
I loved it.

363
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:57,102
God, I love you!

364
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,735
We returned to London...

365
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,642
and Joanna Noble's
article came out.

366
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,815
I was happier
than I'd ever been.

367
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:18,928
Excuse me.

368
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:21,905
-There you go.
-Thanks.

369
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:07,984
Hello, Jake?

370
00:43:08,948 --> 00:43:12,080
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

371
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,296
Sylvie?

372
00:43:13,296 --> 00:43:14,254
I must have dialed wrong.

373
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:15,212
I thought I was
calling Jake.

374
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:16,460
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

375
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,983
I just happened to be
over, actually.

376
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:21,892
Jake's going to be
back soon, I think.

377
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,703
Look, Alice, this is
gonna sound a bit weird...

378
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,301
but I was definitely
going to tell you...

379
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:29,498
but Jake and l
have actually been...

380
00:43:29,498 --> 00:43:30,968
seeing each other.

381
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:32,242
You and Jake?

382
00:43:33,683 --> 00:43:36,430
Well, it...
just sort of happened.

383
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:39,776
Did you move in?

384
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:44,995
Yeah. Yeah, I did,
uh, sort of.

385
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:46,815
Oh, Lord.

386
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,885
How cliche is this?

387
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:51,578
Old friend moves in...

388
00:43:51,578 --> 00:43:53,144
to console jilted boyfriend...

389
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,345
and then these two find
themselves together.

390
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,696
You gonna be OK with this?

391
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:01,549
Yeah, I'm OK.

392
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,028
We're gonna be late!
Hurry up!

393
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:08,994
Yeah, I gotta go.

394
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,170
We'll talk
about it later, OK?

395
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,098
Here we go.

396
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,438
How you doing?!

397
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,218
Hey, Alice, Alice,
I'm sorry.

398
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,427
Sorry.

399
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:56,471
Excuse me.

400
00:45:01,562 --> 00:45:03,980
How you doing?
It's really nice to see you.

401
00:45:56,334 --> 00:45:58,242
It's Alice Tallis.

402
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:01,989
My rhyming sister-in-law.

403
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,282
Are you OK?

404
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,040
I have a headache and was
looking for some aspirin.

405
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,532
Oh, no, give me your hand.

406
00:46:16,244 --> 00:46:17,362
Can you feel that?

407
00:46:17,362 --> 00:46:18,789
Yeah, it really hurts.

408
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:20,962
Close your eyes.

409
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:24,127
Breathe.

410
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:26,493
Slowly.

411
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,973
That's good.

412
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:45,643
It's the meridian
that controls the kidney

413
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:48,006
or the brain
or the left big toe.

414
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:50,720
I forget which.

415
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:55,700
But...it's whatever
works, right?

416
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,809
Thank you.

417
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:00,846
Close your eyes.

418
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:09,578
OK, you can open them.

419
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:11,714
Oh, my God.

420
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,106
I want to drink to that
beautiful lady in blue.

421
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:16,119
Where is she?

422
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:25,131
I don't think she's ever
climbed past the third floor...

423
00:47:26,674 --> 00:47:28,580
but she has conquered
our Adam.

424
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:32,905
But what she doesn't know
is that to get Adam...

425
00:47:32,905 --> 00:47:34,693
she also gets us.

426
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:36,515
Hear, hear!

427
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:48,882
Most of the people
using the program are women...

428
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:50,098
and we try
to sell them a game...

429
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:52,014
but women don't like games.

430
00:47:52,014 --> 00:47:52,973
Women like stories.

431
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,092
Men like games.

432
00:47:54,092 --> 00:47:55,753
Men like to slay the dragon...

433
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:56,807
and get the princess...

434
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:57,958
but women like to know...

435
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,333
how did the dragon
and the princess...

436
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,054
all get there
in the first place.

437
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:05,982
A game is
the wrong approach.

438
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:13,000
Sorry.

439
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:17,193
Excuse me.

440
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:18,468
Alice Tallis.

441
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:19,874
This is Joanna Noble.

442
00:48:19,874 --> 00:48:20,833
Do you remember me?

443
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,556
Yes, I remember you.

444
00:48:22,556 --> 00:48:26,804
I got a weird note
about the article.

445
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,720
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.

446
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,955
I mean, I'm certainly not
going to follow it up.

447
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:32,967
It's probably
stupid of me...

448
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:34,725
but I somehow felt obliged...

449
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:36,030
to tell you about it.

450
00:48:37,439 --> 00:48:39,099
Shall I send it to you?

451
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:41,877
Yeah, you can send it.

452
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,953
Is it private?

453
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:46,189
I don't want this sitting
in a public "in" basket.

454
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,201
I understand.
You can fax it.

455
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:49,605
OK, I'll do that.

456
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:50,564
You have the number?

457
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:51,521
Yeah, I got it
from your secretary.

458
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:53,053
OK, thanks for calling.

459
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:54,360
Sorry.
I had to take that.

460
00:48:56,472 --> 00:48:58,004
No problem.

461
00:48:58,004 --> 00:48:59,443
Gave me a chance to think.

462
00:48:59,443 --> 00:49:01,486
We shouldn't be playing games.

463
00:49:01,486 --> 00:49:04,033
It's obvious
women don't like games.

464
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,076
I think this project
needs a new face.

465
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:12,884
"Dear Joanna Noble,
what you wrote made me sick.

466
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:15,568
"Your big hero Adam Tallis
raped me.

467
00:49:15,568 --> 00:49:17,930
"Why don't you try
reporting the truth?"

468
00:49:20,644 --> 00:49:22,680
It's out of paper.

469
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:28,661
I've decided
that from now on...

470
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:31,153
this is Alice's project.

471
00:49:31,153 --> 00:49:33,068
You're the new point man...

472
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:34,888
I mean, point girl...

473
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:35,912
woman.

474
00:49:35,912 --> 00:49:36,857
Excellent.

475
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:44,564
Congratulations, Alice.

476
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,740
Thank you.

477
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:51,462
Open or closed?

478
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:52,889
Closed.

479
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:04,646
Fuck!

480
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:14,679
Alice Tallis' office.

481
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,849
Hello, Claudia,
it's Adam.

482
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,190
Oh, hi, Adam.

483
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,180
Hi. Is Alice there?

484
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,905
No, she's just left,
actually.

485
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:22,055
Left? Where'd she go?

486
00:50:22,055 --> 00:50:24,091
I think she went
to the doctor's.

487
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:38,341
So, you thought this woman
was sending the notes?

488
00:50:38,341 --> 00:50:39,322
Yes.

489
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,163
Yeah?

490
00:50:59,163 --> 00:51:01,942
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

491
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:03,060
I called you before.

492
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,177
Yeah.

493
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:05,962
-Are you Michelle Stowe?
-Yeah, I am. Come in.

494
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:09,345
It was at a birthday party.

495
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:13,469
I asked him to dance...

496
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:15,921
and then, I don't know...

497
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:19,625
we start kissin'.

498
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:23,008
I mean, I was shit-faced.

499
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:26,616
I came and put my hand
in his shirt...

500
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,404
then we went outside.

501
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,762
Guess at the end, I was just
straightening up a bit...

502
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:40,539
'cause I remember wondering...

503
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:44,924
what the hell I was doing.

504
00:51:55,464 --> 00:51:57,629
Then he pulled me
into the bushes...

505
00:51:58,689 --> 00:51:59,930
undid my dress.

506
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:03,187
It was a zip...

507
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:05,223
in the back.

508
00:52:11,686 --> 00:52:13,406
I was so young.

509
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,188
I started to cry.

510
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,536
He put his hand
over my mouth and kept going.

511
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,272
He's strong.

512
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,177
There was nothing
I could do.

513
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,726
I tried to fight him.

514
00:52:41,514 --> 00:52:43,431
When he was done,
he shook me...

515
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:45,085
and said something like...

516
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:48,699
"It's only sex.

517
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,604
"Just sex."

518
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:52,850
Then he got up...

519
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,876
and left the party
with his sister.

520
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:08,847
So, you want to write
an article about this, then?

521
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:12,489
I mean, he's not royal
or anything...

522
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,012
but it's close enough.

523
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:17,435
We can make some money
out of this, Joanna.

524
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:25,550
It doesn't work that way.

525
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,531
Yeah, it does.
Everybody's always blabbin'...

526
00:53:27,531 --> 00:53:29,095
about who's stickin' it
into who.

527
00:53:29,095 --> 00:53:30,717
They make plenty.

528
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,503
You have no proof.

529
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:36,694
This is a question of
"he said, she said."

530
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,974
Jesus, Alice, I can't
believe you did this.

531
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:43,337
What if she calls
my editor?

532
00:53:43,337 --> 00:53:44,393
I could be fired.

533
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:45,925
Do you think
that nosy wives...

534
00:53:45,925 --> 00:53:47,714
have immunity
from normal behavior?

535
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:49,118
I knew the minute
that I called...

536
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:51,364
that it was a mistake.

537
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:52,800
Sorry, Alice.

538
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,715
It's OK. I just--

539
00:53:54,715 --> 00:53:55,865
I thought you should know
what I did.

540
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,557
It was really
just innocent curiosity.

541
00:53:57,557 --> 00:53:59,440
It's never innocent.

542
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,920
Curiosity gets people killed.

543
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,451
What would you do
if it was your husband?

544
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:06,430
I don't have one.

545
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,930
You not only have one...

546
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,203
but one who's wild
about you.

547
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:14,337
You're right.
I have to trust him.

548
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:42,050
People have stories.

549
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,604
You and l, everyone.

550
00:54:44,604 --> 00:54:47,349
But I couldn't tell you
one complete story...

551
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:49,072
about my husband.

552
00:54:49,072 --> 00:54:51,306
Practically everything
I knew about him...

553
00:54:51,306 --> 00:54:54,306
came from a book
or a newspaper...

554
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:57,851
or shreds of information
dropped by other people.

555
00:54:57,851 --> 00:55:00,021
I couldn't help myself.

556
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:02,284
I needed to know more.

557
00:55:30,311 --> 00:55:31,932
"Adele Blanchard."

558
00:55:37,747 --> 00:55:38,895
"It's crazy...

559
00:55:38,895 --> 00:55:41,159
"but I want to show
the world my bruises."

560
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,502
"What we're doing
is dangerous...

561
00:55:45,502 --> 00:55:48,016
"but I still can't help
wanting more."

562
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:58,175
"The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

563
00:55:58,175 --> 00:56:01,335
"We have to stop
what we're doing.

564
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:04,653
"I've decided to go back
to my husband.

565
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:08,261
"I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you anymore.

566
00:56:08,261 --> 00:56:10,463
"l know you won't fall,
but I will.

567
00:56:10,463 --> 00:56:12,570
"I'm sure of it.

568
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,804
"This tears me apart...

569
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,452
"But I have to go back
to Michael.

570
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:19,497
"l love you.

571
00:56:19,497 --> 00:56:20,542
"Adele."

572
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,657
I've been thinking about you.

573
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:33,822
Me, too.

574
00:57:53,494 --> 00:57:56,335
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

575
00:57:56,335 --> 00:57:57,803
Oh, yeah?

576
00:57:57,803 --> 00:57:59,142
Claudia said
you weren't feeling well.

577
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,927
She thought you might be
at the doctor's.

578
00:58:03,037 --> 00:58:04,314
I, um...

579
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,421
I had an appointment,
but, um...

580
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:07,727
I never got out
of my meeting.

581
00:58:21,389 --> 00:58:23,305
Where was the meeting?

582
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:25,308
At the, um, client's hotel.

583
00:58:32,402 --> 00:58:33,391
Which hotel?

584
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:34,633
The Hilton.

585
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,951
I'm sorry for being nosy.

586
00:58:42,074 --> 00:58:45,481
I just like to picture
what you do during the day.

587
00:59:11,024 --> 00:59:12,961
Where'd you get this?

588
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,423
Deborah gave it to me.

589
00:59:21,715 --> 00:59:23,139
She has good taste.

590
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,291
I got a call about, um...

591
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:36,424
a weird call
about the article.

592
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,355
There was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

593
00:59:40,355 --> 00:59:41,846
She sent a fax.

594
00:59:44,695 --> 00:59:45,941
Didn't happen, Alice.

595
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:46,920
I never raped her.

596
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,929
I shouldn't have...

597
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,825
I've known her
since we were kids.

598
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:56,786
I think she saw me
as a way out.

599
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:00,847
If you met her,
you'd understand.

600
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,882
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

601
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:08,369
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

602
01:00:19,613 --> 01:00:20,571
Good morning.

603
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:21,528
Hi there.
Are you ready?

604
01:00:21,528 --> 01:00:23,346
I'll just get my jacket.

605
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:30,850
I'm sorry to barge in
like that...

606
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,574
but your husband refuses
to understand the fact...

607
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,328
that sponsors need talk shows...

608
01:00:34,328 --> 01:00:37,321
and he would only show up
if I drove.

609
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:43,617
Why didn't you tell me...

610
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:45,211
you were gonna be
on a talk show?

611
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:46,930
It's just
a stupid jazz show.

612
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,597
Directory inquiries.

613
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:49,022
Yes. Adele Blanchard.

614
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:50,236
Which city, please?

615
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:51,257
It's London.

616
01:02:51,257 --> 01:02:52,917
Do you have a listing
for Adele Blanchard...

617
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:54,415
on Marchmont Road?

618
01:02:54,415 --> 01:02:55,362
One moment.

619
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,088
This train is about to depart.

620
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:11,840
Please mind the doors.

621
01:03:38,144 --> 01:03:39,864
I'm looking
for Adele Blanchard.

622
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:42,582
I'm her mother.

623
01:03:42,582 --> 01:03:43,888
Is she home?

624
01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:48,899
You must be one
of her American friends.

625
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:51,283
We tried to contact everyone.

626
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:57,860
She's been missing
for eight months.

627
01:03:59,305 --> 01:04:00,678
Missing?

628
01:04:00,678 --> 01:04:02,105
What did you say
your name was?

629
01:04:04,285 --> 01:04:05,753
Joanna.

630
01:04:05,753 --> 01:04:08,657
She never tried
to contact her husband?

631
01:04:08,657 --> 01:04:09,999
Not even a letter
to an old boyfriend...

632
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:11,340
or something?

633
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:14,084
Eight months
and not a word.

634
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:16,733
And this is from a daughter...

635
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:19,758
who manages to e-mail
her mother from Nepal.

636
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:29,405
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

637
01:04:29,405 --> 01:04:31,830
It helps a little...

638
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,061
if one tries to be positive.

639
01:04:42,523 --> 01:04:46,192
She was so happy that day.

640
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:48,010
No jitters, nothing.

641
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:53,084
Do you know him?

642
01:04:54,844 --> 01:04:56,534
Adam Tallis.

643
01:04:56,534 --> 01:04:59,695
She climbed all over
the world with him.

644
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,928
My son-in-law Michael...

645
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:03,811
is a trader in Milan.

646
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:07,642
At first, he never
stood in her way...

647
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:08,817
when it came to climbing.

648
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,844
Then after two years,
he got fed up.

649
01:05:12,844 --> 01:05:16,260
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

650
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,817
She chose the marriage.

651
01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:23,081
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

652
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:26,634
she went out...

653
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:28,603
and never came back.

654
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:34,007
I found that
in her bags.

655
01:05:34,007 --> 01:05:36,751
It's probably the last
picture taken of her.

656
01:05:39,623 --> 01:05:44,188
Today I've had two signs
that Adele is close by.

657
01:05:44,188 --> 01:05:46,158
You arrived,
and Adam called.

658
01:05:53,445 --> 01:05:56,125
He wanted to know
if there was anything new...

659
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:57,715
in the investigation.

660
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:01,168
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

661
01:06:01,168 --> 01:06:03,275
No, thank you.
I just--I have to get home.

662
01:06:03,275 --> 01:06:04,798
It's really late.

663
01:06:07,073 --> 01:06:08,223
I'm disappointed.

664
01:06:08,223 --> 01:06:10,965
He should be here around 5:00.

665
01:06:14,128 --> 01:06:16,064
You and Adam
would love each other.

666
01:06:18,244 --> 01:06:19,905
Sit, sit.

667
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:21,559
I'll get it.

668
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,065
Is it all right if
I set it up for next week?

669
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:36,563
I haven't managed
to get to the bank yet.

670
01:06:36,563 --> 01:06:38,864
Yes, of course.

671
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:41,130
Mrs. Blanchard.

672
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,076
I'm sorry, I just--
I have to get back.

673
01:06:43,076 --> 01:06:44,385
I don't want
to be late.

674
01:06:44,385 --> 01:06:45,501
I was hoping
you would stay a little.

675
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,960
I'm sorry.

676
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:08,914
This train is about to depart.

677
01:07:08,914 --> 01:07:10,816
Please mind the doors.

678
01:10:31,636 --> 01:10:33,293
What are you doing?!

679
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:35,521
What am I doing?
I'm making you mine.

680
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:45,722
Sometimes I feel
like I don't know you.

681
01:10:45,722 --> 01:10:47,243
Oh, you know me.

682
01:10:49,356 --> 01:10:51,322
You know everything
you need to know.

683
01:10:53,978 --> 01:10:54,922
Look at me.

684
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,028
Open your eyes.

685
01:11:01,435 --> 01:11:02,933
Please.

686
01:11:02,933 --> 01:11:05,289
Open your eyes!

687
01:11:17,177 --> 01:11:18,763
You've been with another man.

688
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:23,170
No.

689
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:25,687
What are you doing, then?

690
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:27,403
What's going on in there?

691
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:31,296
Why do you keep sneaking around?

692
01:11:31,296 --> 01:11:33,207
Is the suspicion exciting?

693
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:35,022
Do you need it go get off?
What is it?

694
01:11:37,255 --> 01:11:38,842
I found Adele's letters.

695
01:11:42,227 --> 01:11:44,203
You...

696
01:11:44,203 --> 01:11:46,051
found...

697
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,571
her letters?

698
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,623
Is that how
you tell the story?

699
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:54,083
What, they were just...

700
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,677
sitting with my keys
on the table...

701
01:11:55,677 --> 01:11:57,164
and you just happened
to notice them?

702
01:12:11,736 --> 01:12:13,553
Look what I just
happened to find!

703
01:12:13,553 --> 01:12:16,072
These and these!

704
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:17,379
And I found these!
Here, read them!

705
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:19,639
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

706
01:12:38,189 --> 01:12:40,732
Did you sneak around
behind my back because you...

707
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,404
need it to get
rougher and rougher?

708
01:12:44,404 --> 01:12:46,153
I mean, is that it?

709
01:12:47,178 --> 01:12:48,772
I'm trying
to understand you, Alice.

710
01:12:48,772 --> 01:12:51,281
If you do this,
will I punish you?

711
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:54,534
Is that what your goal...

712
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:06,425
Please untie me.

713
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:08,458
If you trusted me...

714
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:12,511
you wouldn't be
in this position, Alice.

715
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:19,046
I just...

716
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:21,022
I wanted to know more...

717
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,647
about you.

718
01:13:22,647 --> 01:13:24,847
And I wanted
to know your past...

719
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:27,172
and I wanted to know
your stories.

720
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:30,965
I just thought
if I knew more...

721
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:33,637
that I could love you more.

722
01:13:36,893 --> 01:13:39,699
I know the only thing
that matters is us together.

723
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:41,197
I know that.

724
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:43,363
Because when
you're not around...

725
01:13:43,363 --> 01:13:45,371
I get lost.

726
01:13:45,371 --> 01:13:48,229
It drives me crazy
to think about losing you.

727
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,061
I'm yours, Alice.

728
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,491
What more do you need to know?

729
01:14:10,133 --> 01:14:13,469
I could break your neck,
I love you so much.

730
01:14:18,483 --> 01:14:20,586
Do you want to stay here?

731
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:21,792
I mean...

732
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:25,455
do you like this?

733
01:14:28,554 --> 01:14:31,194
Adam, I have to pee.

734
01:15:15,816 --> 01:15:16,956
My God.

735
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,727
Alice, please,
don't do this! Alice!

736
01:15:31,368 --> 01:15:32,792
Please!

737
01:15:33,886 --> 01:15:36,114
Where are you going?!

738
01:15:37,584 --> 01:15:39,050
Alice, please!

739
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:40,983
What are you doing?!

740
01:17:04,682 --> 01:17:07,354
And that's when
I came to you.

741
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,226
I want to be clear
with you.

742
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:28,424
In my experience,
charges of domestic violence...

743
01:17:28,424 --> 01:17:29,890
are usually too little
too late.

744
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:32,248
I want you to reopen
the Adele Blanchard case.

745
01:17:34,351 --> 01:17:36,455
It's not easy
to reopen a case like this.

746
01:17:36,455 --> 01:17:38,208
Britain is swimming
in missing persons.

747
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:39,290
He killed her.

748
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,204
Mrs. Tallis, any case...

749
01:17:41,204 --> 01:17:44,998
missing person or murder,
needs evidence.

750
01:17:44,998 --> 01:17:46,590
I have to ask you
what you have.

751
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:48,850
Adele's letters?

752
01:17:49,937 --> 01:17:50,894
No.

753
01:17:50,894 --> 01:17:52,455
Warning notes?

754
01:17:52,455 --> 01:17:54,780
No.

755
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,565
You have...

756
01:17:56,565 --> 01:17:57,901
two photos.

757
01:17:58,955 --> 01:18:02,366
Proof of nothing.

758
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:03,927
He raped Michelle.

759
01:18:03,927 --> 01:18:05,447
She never reported it.

760
01:18:18,014 --> 01:18:19,916
Start without me.
I'll be there in a bit.

761
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,441
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Tallis.

762
01:18:28,848 --> 01:18:31,554
What everyone else
does to be like him.

763
01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:34,426
He can't see you.

764
01:18:34,426 --> 01:18:36,720
She's pretty shaken up.

765
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,793
Is she? I mean,
is she hurt?

766
01:18:38,793 --> 01:18:40,673
She--Jesus, she was
running into traffic.

767
01:18:40,673 --> 01:18:42,108
Let's get a doctor.

768
01:18:42,108 --> 01:18:44,367
She'll be fine.

769
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:49,496
I would never hurt her.

770
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:55,434
I love her.

771
01:18:55,434 --> 01:18:57,150
You brought him in?

772
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:00,550
He walked in,
looking for you.

773
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:01,728
He brought in
a pair of shoes.

774
01:19:01,728 --> 01:19:03,624
He was worried
about your feet.

775
01:19:09,102 --> 01:19:10,595
I believe your husband...

776
01:19:10,595 --> 01:19:13,328
has the potential
for violence.

777
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:16,060
I believe he's unpredictable.

778
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:18,251
But is he a murderer?

779
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,729
I don't know.

780
01:19:22,385 --> 01:19:24,387
The truth is, what you two
have been doing together...

781
01:19:24,387 --> 01:19:25,903
was consensual.

782
01:19:26,866 --> 01:19:28,416
You said it yourself.

783
01:19:30,044 --> 01:19:31,021
You liked it.

784
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,382
Can you close the blinds?

785
01:20:05,038 --> 01:20:08,212
I won't be able to keep him
for much more than a few hours.

786
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,316
That's as much of a window
as I can give you.

787
01:20:12,316 --> 01:20:14,985
You're accusing a hero,
Mrs. Tallis...

788
01:20:14,985 --> 01:20:17,487
and you have
absolutely no evidence.

789
01:20:31,099 --> 01:20:32,561
Alice, what's happened to you?

790
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,563
Oh, Deborah, I'm sorry.

791
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:36,184
I'm not crazy,
I just--I just--

792
01:20:36,184 --> 01:20:37,359
I went to
the police station...

793
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:39,616
but no one believed me,
and I just--I just--

794
01:20:39,616 --> 01:20:40,823
He came in and he
brought my shoes...

795
01:20:40,823 --> 01:20:42,064
and they thought
I was nuts...

796
01:20:42,064 --> 01:20:43,271
but, I mean, I know
he's your brother...

797
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:44,733
but, I mean,
you were her friend, too.

798
01:20:44,733 --> 01:20:46,513
Maybe you could, um--

799
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:47,721
Look, you remember when
you said that you were...

800
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:50,072
either with him or not,
no discussion?

801
01:20:50,072 --> 01:20:52,106
Well, I'm--I'm not--
I'm trying to understand.

802
01:20:52,106 --> 01:20:56,137
I--I just, I want to ask,
I mean, um--uh...

803
01:20:58,146 --> 01:21:00,270
Was Francoise
with someone else?

804
01:21:07,108 --> 01:21:08,050
Yes.

805
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:13,399
It wasn't an accident.

806
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:14,570
She left him...

807
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:17,339
so he killed her.

808
01:21:25,605 --> 01:21:26,547
Maybe.

809
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:38,668
This is the anchor
that we used.

810
01:21:38,668 --> 01:21:41,464
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

811
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:44,324
it can hold
2,000 falling pounds.

812
01:21:44,324 --> 01:21:45,596
I've got a friend
in Kathmandu...

813
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:48,265
who sent me an anchor
that they're making locally...

814
01:21:48,265 --> 01:21:49,855
with the wrong material.

815
01:21:49,855 --> 01:21:53,541
This is what happened
with just seventy-five pounds.

816
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,704
Maybe you're right.

817
01:21:55,704 --> 01:21:57,611
Adam could have
switched the anchors...

818
01:21:57,611 --> 01:21:58,780
for Francoise's group.

819
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,720
He killed them.

820
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:43,503
Leave him, Alice.

821
01:22:43,503 --> 01:22:44,903
I know him.

822
01:22:44,903 --> 01:22:46,518
You have to leave him,
for your own good.

823
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:52,339
Deborah...Deborah,
it's not the only time.

824
01:22:52,339 --> 01:22:53,420
What?

825
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,946
I think that, um,
he was with a woman...

826
01:22:54,946 --> 01:22:56,185
Adele Blanchard,
and I think...

827
01:22:56,185 --> 01:22:58,156
that she was gonna leave him
to go back to her husband...

828
01:22:58,156 --> 01:23:00,852
and--and I think that--
that he killed her.

829
01:23:01,968 --> 01:23:04,192
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

830
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:06,511
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

831
01:23:08,165 --> 01:23:09,433
I read her letters.

832
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:13,187
She ended it with Adam.

833
01:23:14,619 --> 01:23:16,969
And, uh, Ijust, um...

834
01:23:16,969 --> 01:23:19,767
I think that, uh,
that she's there.

835
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:20,708
What?

836
01:23:23,549 --> 01:23:24,660
I went to the police.

837
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:25,614
The police,
they won't do anything.

838
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:26,556
They need evidence.

839
01:23:28,474 --> 01:23:30,477
I think he buried her here...

840
01:23:30,477 --> 01:23:31,485
at Saint Edmund's.

841
01:23:32,447 --> 01:23:34,408
I need you
to help me find her.

842
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:37,309
Do you want to go with me?

843
01:23:50,214 --> 01:23:52,586
I have a confession to make.

844
01:23:54,789 --> 01:23:55,797
I sent you those notes.

845
01:23:57,077 --> 01:24:00,286
I know about
my brother's violence.

846
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,739
I've seen it.

847
01:24:04,548 --> 01:24:06,455
I should have done more, but--

848
01:24:06,455 --> 01:24:07,971
it's no excuse--

849
01:24:09,822 --> 01:24:11,501
but he scares me.

850
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:18,143
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

851
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,309
You'll be OK now.

852
01:25:55,658 --> 01:25:56,802
Can I take that?

853
01:25:56,802 --> 01:25:58,037
Yeah, sure.

854
01:26:00,584 --> 01:26:01,916
I think it's here.

855
01:26:03,349 --> 01:26:06,362
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

856
01:26:46,763 --> 01:26:48,128
Oh, my God.

857
01:27:28,271 --> 01:27:30,016
She didn't have to die.

858
01:27:33,705 --> 01:27:34,722
If only she'd told me...

859
01:27:34,722 --> 01:27:36,498
she was going back
to Michael.

860
01:27:39,522 --> 01:27:40,529
Yeah.

861
01:27:42,794 --> 01:27:44,637
I gave her one, too.

862
01:27:46,451 --> 01:27:48,420
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

863
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,349
Why did you do this?!

864
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,272
Who do you think gave him
his first piece of silk?

865
01:27:58,272 --> 01:27:59,830
He was just 15!

866
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:02,333
I'm talking
about fucking, Alice!

867
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,436
That's right!
We fucked right here!

868
01:28:12,861 --> 01:28:14,928
Adam is mine!

869
01:28:14,928 --> 01:28:16,228
He's mine!

870
01:28:32,025 --> 01:28:33,868
Why?!

871
01:28:33,868 --> 01:28:36,474
I was never yours!

872
01:28:36,474 --> 01:28:38,979
We were kids. Kids!

873
01:28:40,893 --> 01:28:42,450
It's over.

874
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:43,652
It's all over.

875
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:52,906
Oh, God.

876
01:29:53,483 --> 01:29:54,815
She and l...

877
01:29:59,585 --> 01:30:01,677
We used to come
here together.

878
01:30:07,627 --> 01:30:10,194
I just thought
you had to trust me.

879
01:30:55,427 --> 01:30:56,824
And that's how it ended.

880
01:30:57,905 --> 01:31:00,036
Yet not a day goes by...

881
01:31:00,036 --> 01:31:03,245
without at least one thought
about the passion.

882
01:31:03,245 --> 01:31:05,533
Maybe I was so blinded by it...

883
01:31:05,533 --> 01:31:09,466
that I missed all the clues
to his past.

884
01:31:18,818 --> 01:31:20,946
I often wonder...

885
01:31:20,946 --> 01:31:22,220
what would have happened...

886
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,819
if I hadn't looked up
that morning.

887
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:36,341
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

888
01:32:13,247 --> 01:32:14,463
I don't know.

889
01:32:15,624 --> 01:32:17,681
Maybe a flatlander like me...

890
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:19,991
can't live at that altitude.

891
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:22,851
Maybe it never would
have been possible...

892
01:32:22,851 --> 01:32:25,097
to sustain what we had.

893
01:32:26,513 --> 01:32:27,465
Maybe.

894
01:32:29,565 --> 01:32:32,127
Well, that's what
I tell myself.

895
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:37,428
