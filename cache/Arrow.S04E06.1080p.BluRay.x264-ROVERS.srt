1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,361
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,241
This city needs someone to stand up
who isn't hiding behind a mask.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,760
It needs a leader.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,888
<i>So, I've decided to run for mayor.</i>

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,605
<i>Ollie, this is Alex Davis,</i>

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,446
the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,407
<i>At the hospital, I looked Sara
in the eyes. She wasn't there.</i>

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,126
And I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,521
<i>That's why she's after me, you know.</i>

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,927
<i>This bloodlust she's consumed by,</i>

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,283
<i>it's the same pain I feel
when I think about Ra's.</i>

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,091
She kills me, she'll be okay.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,521
<i>There's more to the recording.
Something overlapping with it.</i>

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,129
<i>What I need you to know is
I'm alive and I'm in trouble.</i>

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,721
Open new file. ATOM project, update gamma.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,567
This will be
miniaturization test number one.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,291
Execute.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,645
Why can't anything ever work
at the first try? Hmm?

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,404
All right, guys, I know it's been
a long haul figuring out your platform,

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,568
but the good news is, we're almost done.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,926
Just two more things here on the docket.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,849
Mmm, actually, only one.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,606
I figured out where we're going to
hold Ollie's, uh, fundraiser.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,086
It's going to be at Gerard's.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,681
From what I remember,
that place is a little pricey,

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,922
leading us to
our last talking point, the budget.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,167
- You have it, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,322
If by "you," you mean Felicity, then, yes.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,648
She was supposed to be here,
but she's just

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,524
been slammed at Palmer Tech
for the past few days.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,682
She's really taking
this whole CEO thing seriously.

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,491
Well, one of us has to have a job
that actually makes money.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,530
I'll speak with her,
I'll get those numbers for you.

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,047
Alex, thank you so much
for all your hard work.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,124
I'll see you later.

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,522
I was thinking, maybe we should
check out Gerard's tomorrow night.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,685
You know, just to make sure
it's the right type of venue

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,610
for introducing our candidate.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
Are you asking me out on a date?

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,722
To be honest,
it's been so long, I don't even know.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,570
I just am...
My life is really complicated right now,

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,167
and I don't think going on a date
with my brother's campaign manager

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,561
is going to make it any easier.

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,883
No, you're right.
That was, uh, totally unprofessional,

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,963
something I would normally never do.

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,562
I just thought there was something there.

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,847
Probably just consumed

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
a little too much MSG.

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,409
How about we just erase
these last five minutes?

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,050
Absolutely not.

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,730
It was nice.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,526
I'll see you later.

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,925
<i>I'm alive</i>

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,889
and I'm in trouble.

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,924
<i>I'm alive</i>

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,411
<i>and I'm in trouble.</i>

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,047
I'm alive...

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,767
I thought I said you could use my lab
if you clean up after yourself.

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,843
The keyword being "after,"
which assumes finished,

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,407
which clearly, I am not.

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,926
Well, how's it going?

62
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,567
<i>And I'm in trouble.</i>

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,364
That well?

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,607
I'm alive...

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,921
Do you have that playing on a loop?

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,441
I've been trying to trace to Ray's message
back to its point of origin,

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,568
but he must have ping-ponged it
off of like a thousand servers,

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,125
and the back-trace algorithm
won't compile,

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,964
which means
there's no way of finding him, and...

70
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,964
Okay! You need to stop right now.

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,201
- I can't.
- You have to.

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,091
You are no good to Mr. Palmer
in your current state.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,964
Now, how long has it been
since you took a break?

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,441
I dozed off for about two minutes
about an hour ago, does that count?

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,647
You're married, he's straight,
you're married, he's straight.

76
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,961
Hi.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,804
Ah, perfect! Oliver Queen,
Curtis Holt. Curtis, Oliver.

78
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,644
Curtis! Felicity's told me
a lot about you.

79
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,564
She's told me virtually nothing about you.

80
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,966
Okay.

81
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,646
Curtis?

82
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,881
What you doing?

83
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,445
The Green Arrow showed up

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,166
right about the time
that you came back into town.

85
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,887
Nah, it's not you, though.
Jaw's not right.

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,290
That's what I keep telling people.

87
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,481
Would you give us a minute?

88
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,085
Sure thing. Uh, nice meeting you.

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,486
Nice meeting you, too.

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,483
Hi.

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,005
I thought that you were going to come by

92
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,764
the campaign offices
to go over the finances.

93
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,007
I thought that meeting was on Wednesday.

94
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
It is Wednesday.

95
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,284
- Oh.
- What's going on?

96
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,651
<i>I'm alive</i>

97
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,326
<i>and I'm in trouble.</i>

98
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,081
- That sounds like...
- Ray. Because it is Ray,

99
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,850
- because Ray isn't dead.
- What?

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,081
That's impossible. Ray was...

101
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,844
Killed. In an explosion
that blew off the top

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,081
of this building six months ago.

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,770
But that's obviously not what happened,

104
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,485
because he sent this message six days ago,

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,364
and dead people don't generally do that.

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,524
Ray's alive. He's out there somewhere.
I have to help him.

107
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,522
Why didn't you ever tell us
about this place before?

108
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,205
I didn't know it was here.

109
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,044
But it sort of seems like you did.

110
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,601
I know this island
isn't all that it seems.

111
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,481
You've done well, Mr. Queen.

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,290
He let the British guy get away.

113
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,209
Whoa, wait. Reiter.

114
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,563
Constantine said
that there was some sort of

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,851
barrier, like magic.

116
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,562
I have no interest in the chamber.

117
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,326
What is that?

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,007
A message from the ancients,

119
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,891
leading to a very special gift.

120
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,927
"A heart of water."

121
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,690
Have you seen a cove on the island?
Surrounded by mountains?

122
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,921
Yeah, I know of one.

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,242
I want you to go to that point
and lead an excavation.

124
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,925
Take a dozen of the laborers and work them
until you find my gift.

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,890
Can I talk to you for a sec?

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,446
All right, first,

127
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,081
what aren't you telling me
about what we're doing here?

128
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,447
I mean, apart from everything.

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,767
And second?

130
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,082
Queen is a mole.

131
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,760
Don't start trusting him just 'cause
he gave you a piece of bling.

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,602
Accompany Mr. Queen to the cove.

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
I know.

134
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,966
I know.

135
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,049
I love you, too, Mom.

136
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,611
I love you so much.

137
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,880
<i>Okay, bye, Mom.</i>

138
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,082
How did that go?

139
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,482
Easier than the last time
Mom found out

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,324
that I wasn't dead.

141
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,963
Hey.

142
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,127
You okay, honey?

143
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,401
<i>"SARA". Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

144
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,608
It was just something Mom said

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,327
about how I got lost when I was
walking home from school once, and...

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,485
And how I promised
that I'd always come back.

147
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,970
But I can't remember.

148
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,650
You're probably better off not remembering

149
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,320
all the messed up things
our parents did to us, anyway.

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,404
Hey, you two turned out perfectly,
all right?

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,250
<i>And more importantly, you're both home.</i>

152
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,408
I couldn't ask for anything more.

153
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,525
I tell you Ray's in trouble,
and your first response is,

154
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,966
"You need a shower."

155
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,526
And a nap.

156
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,603
- You're not going to be able to help...
- Oh, stop!

157
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,847
You're starting to sound like Curtis.

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,968
Well, Curtis is a smart guy.

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,082
Did Ray's message indicate
what kind of trouble he's in?

160
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,482
If it did, it would have been
the first thing I told you.

161
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,524
Okay. ls there anything
that I can do to help?

162
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,851
Well, have you magically learned to code
in the last 72 hours?

163
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,644
- No.
- That was a rhetorical question.

164
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,126
I know.

165
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,884
I will, however,
accept your undying support and backrub.

166
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,441
You can have both as soon as you...

167
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,365
- Shower.
- And take a nap.

168
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,846
Come on.

169
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,530
Come on, come on.

170
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,207
What?

171
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,890
I set an alertjust in case
the back-trace program

172
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,565
ever finished compiling.

173
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,051
- Felicity...
- Two seconds!

174
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,322
It's been taking forever.

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,526
<i>What are you doing?</i>

176
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,245
Absolutely nothing.

177
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,721
<i>Felicity, Felicity, is that you?</i>

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,729
- Oh, my God, Ray!
- Ray, where are you?

179
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,921
<i>I don't know.</i>

180
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,401
<i>And if that wasn't enough,
I think I'm being held against my will.</i>

181
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,641
What?

182
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,046
<i>They want my suit, or at least the tech.</i>

183
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,925
<i>The only good news is, the tech is
useless to them in my current condition.</i>

184
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,208
Ray, if you have your suit,
then why don't you just, uh...

185
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,767
<i>Bust my way out?
Yeah, that's not really happening.</i>

186
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,921
What, the suit doesn't work?

187
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,401
<i>Actually, it worked a little too well.</i>

188
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,201
<i>They want my suit, or at least the tech.</i>

189
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,210
<i>The only good news is, the tech is
useless to them in my current condition.</i>

190
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,768
- John is never going to believe this.
- Neither is Thea.

191
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,201
And, well, Ray is...

192
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,289
The size of a tater tot.

193
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,807
Ray modified his suit with
the same nanites I injected into him

194
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,961
after Bad Arrow shot him.

195
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,441
It's a long story
involving a lot of molecular physics.

196
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,968
The bottom line is that Ray
jury-rigged a short-range message burst

197
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,282
that was intercepted
by whoever's holding him captive.

198
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,442
Ray thinks they want the suit
for its technology,

199
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,766
but they can't use it while it's small.

200
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,291
And while he's small, it's like

201
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,608
looking for a needle
in a city of haystacks.

202
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,564
Ray has something he thinks could help.

203
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,130
<i>Back at Palmer Tech,
I've got schematics for a machine</i>

204
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,640
<i>that should be able to resize me.</i>

205
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,721
Well, now that you're both filled in...

206
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,967
Where are you going?

207
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,969
To Palmer Tech, to pull up
the schematics for Ray's device.

208
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,480
I'll come with you.

209
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,291
Why? Are you going to build the thing?

210
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,240
There must be some other way I can help.

212
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,646
There isn't.

213
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,571
This isn't over, you know.

214
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,165
You and me.

215
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,845
I'm so glad.

216
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,807
We need to get
a couple people in the water.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,128
Dive down, see what you can find.

218
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,011
Everyone is tired.
We've been here for hours.

219
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
If you want them to work,
they have to be able to.

220
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,806
You their leader?

221
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,686
I'm the guy telling you to let them rest.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,684
Okay.

223
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,171
You brought food.

224
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,682
Take 15 minutes and eat.

225
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,122
Well, ain't you employer of the month.

226
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,687
I'm going to need you
to keep an eye on them,

227
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,361
and I'm going to go
enjoy my lunch in peace.

228
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,211
Hey, Ukraine.

229
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,280
My name is Vlad.

230
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,041
Well, Vlad,

231
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,528
how'd you like
your life to get a little better?

232
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,522
Dr. Palmer got miniaturization to work.

233
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,484
He made the space between atoms shrink.

234
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,729
I mean, this is like solving cold fusion
and ultimate theory.

235
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,803
- Do you have any idea how amazing this is?
- Yes.

236
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,690
But the fact
that Ray is being held hostage

237
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,087
and could be killed at any moment
because he is the size of a Cheeto

238
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,402
has dampened my enthusiasm somewhat.

239
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,050
- Can you build this?
- Yes.

240
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,005
Uh, all the materials are here
at Palmer Tech, uh,

241
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,406
<i>except for that.</i>

242
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,765
That is a quantum manifold.

243
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,251
Never heard of it. Where do we get one?

244
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,050
Only one place. The manufacturer.

245
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,607
They hold the patent on it...
Well, actually, 16 patents.

246
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,250
- Curtis. Where?
- Kord Industries.

247
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,443
I'd ask them to do us a solid
and loan it to us, but...

248
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,841
They're our biggest competitor.

249
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,441
The good news is,
things can't get any worse.

250
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,206
You just had to go and say that.

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,445
There you are!

252
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,843
Mom. on.

253
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,365
Oh. What are you doing here?

254
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,609
Well, I went to your office,
Miss CEO,

255
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,967
and your assistant told me you'd be here.

256
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,441
So... Here I am.

257
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,524
Not here-here, Star City here.

258
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,250
Well, Oliver told me

259
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,249
that you've been working nonstop
this past month,

260
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,442
- so I suggested a visit from your mom...
- Uh-huh.

261
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,449
Is exactly what you needed,
and guess what?

262
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,051
- What?
- He agreed.

263
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,086
Oh.

264
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,209
Hi. And who are you?

265
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,448
- Oh.
- Hi. I'm Curtis Holt.

266
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,483
- It is an absolute pleasure to meet you.
- Oh.

267
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,042
I can see where Felicity got her, uh...

268
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,120
Blonde hair.

269
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,723
Well, she dyes it, actually.

270
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,482
So, what do you want to do first?

271
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,484
A trip to the mall, mani-pedi...

272
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,643
You know what, you must be
exhausted from your flight.

273
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,484
Why don't I get a car
to take you back to my place?

274
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,166
A car? No, baby, I...
I came here to see you.

275
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,004
I know! And you will.
It's just that, right now,

276
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,844
Curtis and I are trying
to figure out how to build

277
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,923
a very important piece of equipment,
or someone could die.

278
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,128
- Die?
- Metaphorically speaking!

279
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,002
You start constructing the machine,
and I will get you the manifold.

280
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,526
But it's proprietary.
How are you going to do that?

281
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,681
I'm not!

282
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,921
Awesome.

283
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,684
The Green Arrow's going to
be kicking some ass tonight.

284
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,684
If I don't kick his first.

285
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,127
- I thought it would be a good thing.
<i>- A good</i> thing?

286
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,850
What on Earth made you agree to this?

287
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,162
Well, you know, your morn doesn't really
take no for an answer.

288
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,806
You've faced down Mirakuru soldiers
and the League of Assassins.

289
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,446
Are you honestly telling me that
you couldn't say no to my mom?

290
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,005
She said she missed you,
and then she texted me

291
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,487
one of those emojis with the single tear.

292
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,284
You have been texting with my mother?

293
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,527
<i>How long has that been going on?</i>

294
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,967
You guys think we can find
a better time to fight about this?

295
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,891
John? I thought only
Oliver's line was open.

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,451
Nope. Mine is open.

297
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,727
- And mine.
- And mine.

298
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,202
I don't remember there being
so much chatter on these missions.

299
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,130
Are you okay?

300
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,721
Yeah.

301
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,564
I need a little normal.

302
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,850
And for me, this is
the kind of thing that passes.

303
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,166
<i>I hacked the security panel,</i>

304
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,890
but it needs
to be accessed from the inside.

305
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,724
Only problem is,
is that the building's interior

306
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,166
is protected
by pressure sensitive flooring,

307
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,249
which means Chatty Cathy, you're up.

308
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,323
- Chatty Cathy?
- Your new code name.

309
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,090
The only one appropriate
enough I could think of

310
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,526
to use in polite company.

311
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,881
<i>Once the loading dock's doors are open,</i>

312
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,411
<i>you'll have 90 seconds
to find the manifold</i>

313
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,369
and amscray before men with guns show up.

314
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,567
Chatty Cathy?

315
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,008
You know, when I get back,

316
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,089
you and I are going to have a talk.

317
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,889
- I'm at the panel.
- Stand by.

318
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,570
Punch in 4-5-8-7.

319
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,249
<i>The clock's running.</i>

320
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,091
You sure it was a good idea
to bring Sara along?

321
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,600
She'll be fine.

322
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,127
Something's wrong.

323
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,770
The security cameras
are coming back online.

324
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,280
I've got it.

325
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,121
No, don't you understand?

326
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,441
If Kord upgraded their security,

327
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,284
they probably improved
their response time.

328
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,880
Wait, I think this is it.

329
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,967
Sara, stop!

330
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,480
Sara!

331
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,291
Sara!

332
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,770
We have to go.

333
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,005
We're clear.

334
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,482
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

335
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,682
- Ray...
<i>- Any luck with the schematics?</i>

336
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,288
<i>I realize the quantum manifold
could present a challenge.</i>

337
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,331
Nothing a little late night shopping
at Kord Industries couldn't solve.

338
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,005
Oh, that's great. Thank you, Felicity.

339
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,442
Now we just have to figure out how...

340
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Ray, you still there?

341
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,680
Oh, no.

342
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,888
What happened out there?

343
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,043
Sara, she, um,

344
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,725
had a moment with the security guard.

345
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,370
Laurel and Thea took her home.

346
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,041
Are you sure it was Darhk
that you saw on Ray's camera?

347
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,362
Just as sure as I am
that Ray is not getting out of this!

348
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,846
It's actually good that Darhk has Ray.

349
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,041
This would be the same level of delusion

350
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,806
that made you think my mother coming
to town would make me feel better?

351
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,411
Because it's Darhk,

352
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,891
that means that we have an asset.

353
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,849
- Lance.
- I'll ask him to get us a location.

354
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,121
And what if between then and now,

355
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,567
Darhk decides to squish Ray
underneath his shoe?

356
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,484
If Darhk wanted to hurt Ray,
he would have done it by now.

357
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,727
Dig's right. We stay focused.

358
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,691
We get Curtis the manifold,
keep him working,

359
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,850
and we unfortunately just have to
wait and see what Lance finds out.

360
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,003
I hate waiting and seeing.

361
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,247
I have to do something.

362
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,244
Your mother's in town,
spend some time with her.

363
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,641
We could do dinner. I'll cook.

364
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,688
You already made dinner plans
with my mother, didn't you?

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,365
What? No.

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,240
- Yes.
- Oh!

367
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,323
Oh, my God!
It is like a sickness with you!

368
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,409
It wasn't intentional.
We were having a nice conversation,

369
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,045
the subject turned to cooking,

370
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,050
I mentioned that I make
a spectacular chicken cordon bleu.

371
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,605
<i>She said she'd never had one.</i>

372
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,205
It's just dinner.

373
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
He's right, Felicity.
Besides, you look like you haven't

374
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,764
eaten or slept.

375
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,089
A man's life, a friend's life
is in danger.

376
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,602
Doesn't seem like
the right time for cordon bleu.

377
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,441
I promise you that
there is nothing that we can do

378
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,604
until we get what we need
from Lance and Curtis.

379
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,371
So, dinner.

380
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,046
7:00 p.m. I'll be there
as soon as I'm done with Lance.

381
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,960
Nice instincts.

382
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,809
I wasn't sure you were coming back.

383
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,803
Well...

384
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,803
I said that I would.

385
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,291
I guess it's no surprise to you,

386
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,848
but I have lost faith in people doing
what they said they're going to do.

387
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,244
Do you notice Reiter interested
in anything other than the camp or drugs?

388
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,601
Yeah.

389
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,491
He also enjoys
stealing people away from their families.

390
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,609
Have you seen him do anything, uh,

391
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,802
mystical, or even...

392
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,605
Magical?

393
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,641
He always has been a little odd.

394
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,080
And very religious.

395
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,967
He's even blessed some of the prisoners.

396
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,686
Claims he's healed their souls
or some craziness.

397
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,526
I'm beginning to think
that drugs are just a front

398
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,966
for what he's really doing here.

399
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,680
What could be more tempting
to a man like him than money?

400
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,360
Power.

401
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,205
I can't stay long.

402
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,886
I can't have Conklin
being any more suspicious of me

403
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,201
than he already is,

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,010
but you still need to stay here.

405
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,804
I'll come back as much as I can.

406
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,282
This time, I believe you.

407
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,650
<i>I thought it was
past time that we met.</i>

408
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,845
My engineers have had no success
in restoring you to your proper size,

409
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,361
so I thought I'd appeal
to your cooperation.

410
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,483
And what do I get if I help you out?

411
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,886
Apart from, probably, death?

412
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,406
No.

413
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,007
I don't think it's your life
you should be worried about.

414
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,082
<i>I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.</i>

415
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,402
And who is this Felicity, I wonder.

416
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,849
Certainly not your former vice president,
current CEO, girlfriend.

417
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,207
<i>Don't you touch her.</i>

418
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,926
Don't make empty threats.

419
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,491
It's

420
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,241
small.

421
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,606
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>

422
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,081
we weren't listening for a distress call
from a dead man.

423
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,687
It was pure luck, really,
that we intercepted your message.

424
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,568
But isn't luck
just another word for destiny?

425
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,760
Sorry I'm <i>late.</i>

426
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,761
I tried following the recipe...

427
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,763
You know, I think
your oven might be broken,

428
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,763
because I was supposed
to put in for, like, 20 minutes,

429
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,121
<i>and all of a sudden it just...</i>

430
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,964
I don't know,
smoke just started billowing out,

431
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,568
and I think the chicken's just a little,
slightly undercooked.

432
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,609
I think the technical term is raw.

433
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,291
It's... It's fine, it's fine.

434
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,284
I'm home now. I'll whip something up.

435
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,882
'Cause you just always fix everything.

436
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,640
<i>"DONNA". A man who cooks.</i>

437
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,641
Put a ring on that.

438
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,882
How'd that very important
doctor's appointment go, hon?

439
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,202
Uh... Good, yes.

440
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,568
Dr. Lance is just going to

441
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,809
find out where the pain is coming from.

442
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,451
Pain? Are you okay, hon?

443
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,042
Fine. I'm just trying to figure out
what I've done wrong.

444
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,810
L...

445
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,401
I'm going to go get some takeout.

446
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,649
The best part about arguing
is the make-up sex.

447
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,161
Okay.

448
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,529
Inviting your mother for a surprise visit
wasn't the best idea.

449
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,007
- Mmm.
- I totally accept that.

450
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,686
What I'm not accepting, or understanding,

451
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,171
is just you shutting me out.

452
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,602
I am not shutting you out.

453
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,171
I'm trying to focus on finding Ray,

454
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,204
but I can't do that
with all of these distractions.

455
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,363
Distractions? What is going on with you?

456
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,329
You're acting like
it's my fault that Ray...

457
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,010
It's my fault!

458
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,851
What's happening with Ray,

459
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,602
to Ray, is my fault.

460
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,768
Felicity, it really isn't.

461
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,047
Ray was sending distress calls
for weeks after the accident.

462
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,121
I wasn't here to receive them

463
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,806
because I was too busy
traveling the world with you.

464
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,886
I took the police's word for it
that no body could be recovered

465
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,362
because I was so swept up
in being with you.

466
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,486
I'm sorry.

467
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,361
It was my choice to uproot my entire life,

468
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,042
leave my home and my job,
which turns out I am very good at.

469
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,890
I lost myself in you,

470
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,804
and I was never that girl.

471
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,640
That girl who just loses herself in a guy.

472
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,161
That is not who I am.

473
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,800
This isn't about Ray.

474
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,331
It's about us.

475
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,846
No.

476
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,686
Yes.

477
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,565
I don't know.

478
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,600
Okay.

479
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,165
I'm going to give you some space
until you figure it out.

480
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,966
It says the traffic cameras are online.

481
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,044
Yeah, you got to give it
a minute to upload.

482
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,770
What are you doing here, anyway?

483
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,961
I thought I was waiting for Lance,

484
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,646
and you were having dinner
with the Smoak ladies.

485
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,961
Went that well, did it?

486
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,123
Do you know what I miss
about our old space?

487
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,443
That trunk, with the bottle
of Russian vodka in it.

488
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,245
Vodka

489
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,121
is for wimps, anyway.

490
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,640
Vodka is for wimps?

491
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,246
Tennessee whiskey.

492
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,646
Put some hair on your chest.

493
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,161
It is hard to imagine

494
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,561
dinner with Felicity and her mother
not going well.

495
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,765
<i>Donna's not the problem.</i>

496
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,007
Lam.

497
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,970
Felicity says that she's lost herself
in our relationship,

498
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,969
which means
that she doesn't know who she is,

499
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,085
and that if we hadn't left
Star City when we did,

500
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,602
she would have been around to help Ray.

501
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,168
Meta-humans, magic, resurrections...

502
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,005
I thought I'd seen it all,
but Oliver Queen jealous?

503
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,768
I'm not jealous. I just got to know
if Ivy Town was as good as it gets for us.

504
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,446
Because we've come back here,

505
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,086
everything has
just gotten super complicated,

506
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,210
and it just makes me wonder,

507
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,805
why did she choose me?

508
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,048
Oliver, I've heard you say
a lot of crazy things over the years,

509
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,282
- but that has to be the prize.
- You know what I mean.

510
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,687
It takes me ten minutes
to log into this thing.

511
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,367
Felicity does it in two seconds,
and Ray probably invented it.

512
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,885
Yeah, you're probably right.

513
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,849
Except, Felicity didn't choose Ray.

514
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,486
She chose you.

515
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,370
Sure, she has a lot in common with Ray,

516
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,281
but sometimes what looks good on paper
isn't what works in real life.

517
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,367
What if something happens to him?

518
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
We don't get him back?

519
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,529
Felicity Smoak

520
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,564
is one of the smartest,
most badass women on the planet.

521
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,646
She comes through this,
she'll get Ray back.

522
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,887
You seem pretty sure.

523
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,043
I married a woman just like that.

524
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,242
Twice, Oliver. Twice.

525
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,811
You did.

526
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,004
Look, man, relationships
have their ups and downs.

527
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,531
Sometimes, you just give her some time,

528
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,571
a little bit of space.

529
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,921
It's Lance.

530
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,162
Meeting with Darhk in 20.

531
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,240
You good?

532
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,567
Better.

533
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,080
<i>Thank you.</i>

534
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,920
What the hell?

535
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,681
Appreciate you meeting me.

536
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,769
I know you're a busy man. lam.

537
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,441
But I may have found a way
to make this city

538
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,886
useful for once.

539
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,764
- I don't understand.
- Oh, you will.

540
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,689
Everyone in this city will.

541
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,684
Well, maybe I could find out
sooner than others.

542
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,963
My daughter, Sara, she's, uh...

543
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,122
She's back, but, you know,
not all the way, you know?

544
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,362
Something about her is...
ls still a little off.

545
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,967
I assure you, the relevance escapes me.

546
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,090
Well, I was thinking maybe
if I could help you a little more,

547
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,287
then maybe you could help me.

548
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,482
You know your way around
this magic mumbo jumbo.

549
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,120
Mumbojumbo?

550
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,926
I'll consider it, Captain,

551
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,405
but this will be the last time
you summon me.

552
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,846
John, he just left.
He's headed south down Victoria Street.

553
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,560
Copy that. I've got eyes on.

554
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,166
FELICITYI Yeah?

555
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,000
I brought you some hot milk.

556
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,287
I'm not 10, Mom.

557
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,010
I'll bring it back downstairs.

558
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,526
No, wait, wait, wait.

559
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,609
Since you went to all the trouble.

560
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,164
Do you remember
when you were a little girl

561
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,806
and I told you
you couldn't go to Space Camp?

562
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,207
You locked yourself
in your room for two days.

563
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,204
To be fair, it was Space Camp.

564
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,650
But I told you I couldn't bear the thought
of sending you away for eight weeks.

565
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,520
The truth was, hon, I...

566
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,851
I couldn't afford it.

567
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,371
Then why didn't you just tell me that?

568
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,565
Because I was embarrassed,
you know, that I had no money,

569
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,290
that I had no idea where your father was,

570
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,888
and even if I did, he never paid a dime
in child support, anyway.

571
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,885
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

572
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,724
I put everything into your father.

573
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,122
My love, my trust, my twenties.

574
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,850
My point is, you are not me.

575
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,327
You are the CEO
of a bajillion dollar company.

576
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,843
And Oliver,
he's not like your father, hon.

577
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,320
He loves you.

578
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,321
No one has ever looked at me
the way he looks at you.

579
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,362
He's wonderful.

580
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,324
In a million different ways.

581
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,405
But that's the problem.

582
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,327
It's too easy to lose myself in him.

583
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,250
Baby-

584
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,161
That's how it's supposed to feel
when you love someone.

585
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,086
Believe it or not,
he's lost himself in you.

586
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,771
And you'll find yourself

587
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,286
in each other.

588
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,762
Just don't get in your own way.

589
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,128
And don't ruin something

590
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,283
that most people never get.

591
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,680
'Cause if you do,

592
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,202
trust me, you'll never find another
guy that hot again who cooks.

593
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,451
Thanks.

594
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,124
He is definitely hiding
something in there.

595
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,203
Latin Building.
Before the city went to crap,

596
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,125
it was touted as the most secure building
on the west coast.

597
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,483
Every access point is protected
by a retinal scanner and a voice print.

598
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,131
There is no way we're getting in there.

599
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,731
Not from the outside, at least.

600
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,649
How's Curtis doing on the resizing device?

601
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,404
He said he could have
something functional in an hour.

602
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,607
I don't think we have that kind of time.

603
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,330
He's going to have to
assemble it in the field.

604
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,811
Wait, with us?

605
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,808
Are we sure we want
to have your assistant in on this?

606
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,320
He's my employee, actually.

607
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,245
And I'm not sure our company health plan
covers supernatural dismemberment.

608
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,171
We need him. And if Curtis
can resize Ray on the inside,

609
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,164
then we have another hand
getting us all outside.

610
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,000
Then how about one more?

611
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,411
I don't think that's a good idea.

612
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,166
Laurel, I don't know
what's going on with me,

613
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,687
but I need to know
that I can control this.

614
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,680
Suit up.

615
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,560
Hmm.

616
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,086
These are very nice.

617
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,886
Oops.

618
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,800
Leave us.

619
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,611
Package is delivered.

620
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,887
Ready.

621
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,208
- Felicity?
- Ready.

622
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,851
Or as ready as I'll ever be.

623
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,281
When I told HR I wanted
a little bit more excitement from my job,

624
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,885
this really isn't what I had in mind.

625
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,525
Look, you were the one who said
you wanted to help Ray

626
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,006
and that you were
an accomplished BASE jumper.

627
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,129
Oh, God, I really do
have too many hobbies.

628
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,601
Well, all right, Spartan.
Let's do this.

629
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,921
Spartan?

630
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,361
We have a guest tonight.

631
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,281
All right, disengaging security systems...

632
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,408
Now.

633
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,281
Whoo!

634
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,290
You two okay?

635
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,971
We're not dead.

636
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,440
Good.

637
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,880
Let's go.

638
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,523
You mind if I take a little peek-see?

639
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,001
I mean, I have my suspicions, of course,

640
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,011
but I just want to see
if I'm right, as usual.

641
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,362
Didn't you learn anything
from our last go-round?

642
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,840
I guess not.

643
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,326
Hey.

644
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,721
How do you open this?

645
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,042
<i>Yeah, my best guess is
it needs an asymmetric cipher.</i>

646
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,402
<i>You can open it with five years
and an NSA-grade computer.</i>

647
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,040
What if we enlarged him now,
and then use his size to break the cube?

648
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,328
The quantum field won't be able
to penetrate this polymer.

649
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,565
You know, it is a shame
that you won't live

650
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,927
to see the new life
that I breathe into the city.

651
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,927
The new life
that I breathe into this world.

652
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,844
You won't get the chance.

653
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,730
<i>They put these mini-cams in here with me,</i>

654
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,082
- and <i>those</i> cameras...
- Need to draw power from somewhere.

655
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,924
Ray, you are a genius.

656
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,446
<i>"RAY". Well, I don't know about that,</i>

657
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,683
<i>but I have siphoned off enough juice
to power up my exo-suit.</i>

658
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,603
Dr. Palmer's doohickey's ready.

659
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,605
If you don't mind
my use of the technical term.

660
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,091
DO it!

661
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,125
I'm not dead.

662
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,121
<i>We've got Ray, let's go.</i>

663
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,566
Copy that.

664
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,966
Sara!

665
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,246
No!

666
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,802
Come on. We have to go!

667
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,291
Come on!

668
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,646
We have to move.

669
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,926
Good to see you, Ray.

670
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,640
Nice suit.

671
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,485
The worst part wasn't being small.

672
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,130
It was that everything else was so big.

673
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,164
The explosion at Palmer Tech tossed me
into an abandoned construction site.

674
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,163
The cockroaches
were the size of golden retrievers.

675
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,447
I'm not exaggerating.

676
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,330
Uh, I think we don't
need to know that, really.

677
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,161
The entomologist in me
was actually really fascinated.

678
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,005
I mean, you can't appreciate the size
of the mandibles until the...

679
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,322
Mmm! Mmm-mmm. No. I've heard enough.

680
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,522
I got a thing against cockroaches,
and snakes and spiders,

681
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,160
but especially... cockroaches.

682
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,286
Sorry, Ray, not everyone shares
your enthusiasm for bugs.

683
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,528
But it is good to see
the experience didn't change you.

684
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,205
Indeed. I got your medical tests back,

685
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,205
and aside from
a very noticeable iron deficiency,

686
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,681
all your results are positive.

687
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,367
There don't seem to be any side effects
from the, um, micro-sizing.

688
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,363
- Relieved to hear it.
- So are we.

689
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,126
So, this guy who wanted
to make me his lab rat?

690
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,367
Damien Darhk.

691
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,127
He's the leader of an organization
we believe to be known as HIVE.

692
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,368
Oh, like SPECTRE? That's so cool!

693
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,327
And terrible.

694
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,561
<i>Be assured, Palmer,</i>

695
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,563
that if they wanted your tech,
it wasn't for any good reason.

696
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,484
One other thing.

697
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,170
They overheard my message to you.

698
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,731
I'm a possible target. I figured.

699
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,051
I wouldn't be doing this
if I couldn't handle

700
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,044
being threatened by a super villain
every now and then.

701
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,285
Come on. I'll take you home.

702
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,050
I can catch you up on all the latest
at your company.

703
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,770
Uh, actually,

704
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,082
until I decide to come back from the dead,

705
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,287
it's your company.

706
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,720
Great.

707
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,970
What in the hell?

708
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,361
You better have a story
to go along with that body.

709
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,362
Look, Thea told me
that this was a side effect of the Pit.

710
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,609
And I thought that I could fight it.
I just...

711
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,689
I couldn't stop myself.

712
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,164
And the worst part of it was,
I felt better.

713
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,328
Look, Sara, controlling this,

714
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,091
it's not going to come easy, okay?

715
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,441
<i>It's going to take you some time.</i>

716
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,966
And how many bodies?

717
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,808
Look, I respect the way that
you could deal with this, Thea,

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,923
but I need to handle this
in a different way.

719
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,360
Different how?

720
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,011
Laurel, I owe you everything.

721
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,530
And you gave me the greatest gift
that anyone ever could.

722
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,723
You gave me a second chance,

723
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,488
and the ability to start over.

724
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,842
I think it's time that I really do that.

725
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,565
But, Sara,

726
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,801
we just got you back.

727
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,690
Sara, you don't have to leave.

728
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,000
I know it doesn't seem possible right now,

729
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,850
but you can have a normal life.

730
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,009
It's been a long time

731
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,362
since my normal has ever been normal.

732
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,011
Look, I'll go visit Mom in Central City,

733
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,328
and then, somewhere...

734
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,324
Maybe a few somewheres,

735
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,369
just until I figure things out.

736
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,648
If you're sure that
that's what you want to do.

737
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,964
It's your life,

738
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,929
and you have to do what makes you happy.

739
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,890
I'm just really going to miss you.

740
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,528
I love you, sis.

741
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,564
Always and forever.

742
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,244
I love you, too.

743
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,406
Hey-

744
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,880
Hi.

745
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,127
How did it go with Ray?

746
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,327
Fine.

747
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,330
Until <i>I</i> told him <i>I</i> sold his condo.

748
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,525
- I wanted...
- Before we...

749
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,960
Uh, hmm.

750
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,600
You go first.

751
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,007
No.

752
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,480
You.

753
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,286
I think we should...

754
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,166
Clear the air.

755
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,360
Um...

756
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,400
I wanted to thank you.

757
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,521
For helping save Ray,
and for being so understanding

758
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,240
in the midst of my mini...

759
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,851
Gargantuan freak-out.

760
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,203
Well, I'm sorry
that I'm not the best listener.

761
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,366
But all Of this is just...

762
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,931
It's kind of new to me.

763
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,406
And to me.

764
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,244
I didn't exactly grow up

765
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,529
with the best example
of a normal, healthy relationship.

766
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,768
Line forms behind me.

767
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,326
It's kind of amazing
that we've made it this far.

768
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,450
We're going to be fine.

769
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,529
How can you be so sure?

770
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,482
Because we found ourselves in each other.

771
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,011
<i>Feeling lonely?</i>

772
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,364
You don't even know the half of it.

773
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,400
<i>I might.</i>

774
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,086
I, um...

775
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,202
I came to town to visit my daughter,
but she kicked me out of her apartment

776
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,281
to finish a fight with the man I hope

777
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,084
will become my future son-in-law.

778
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,563
Okay, it's your turn.

779
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,363
Well, one of my daughters is leaving town
after being back a whole five minutes.

780
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,760
Sounds like a reason to drink.

781
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,724
I always got a reason.

782
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,251
But this is club soda.

783
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,120
Quentin.

784
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,800
Donna.

785
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,049
Hey, Thea, when your brother comes in,

786
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,446
could you have him sign these
for me, please?

787
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,681
Yeah.

788
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,001
You Okay?

789
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,531
Just a little stressed out.

790
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,568
Maybe, um...

791
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,046
Maybe I need to get a drink.

792
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,568
It's a little early for a cocktail, but...

793
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,762
Not now. Later?

794
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,651
With you, at Gerard's?

795
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,847
But I thought you...

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,729
I just want to have a normal life.

797
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,441
Meet me there at 8:00?

798
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,290
Yeah, absolutely. Uh...

799
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,009
I'll leave these here.

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,880
Dr. Palmer's molecular realignment

801
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,242
was premised on a power draw
from our system, which resulted...

802
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,125
Just because I understand science
doesn't mean I'm not bored by it.

803
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,606
Bottom-line it for me.

804
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,485
We were able to recover some residue
from Dr. Palmer's dwarf star alloy,

805
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,802
and use it to fashion into a power source.

806
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,240
Good.

807
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,680
Test it out.

808
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,491
On this.

809
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,681
