1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,200
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,800
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,560
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,240
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,080
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed</i>

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>by the body I'd sworn my allegiance
to the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,160
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,080
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,880
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,120
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,480
The Time Masters discourage marriage,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,040
but I fell in love
and we had a child, Jonas.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,480
- Maybe we could get a drink?
- Are you asking me out?

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,080
Yes. Is that okay?

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
I think my life's complicated enough

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,720
without throwing
whatever this is into the mix.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,960
- This is Star City.
- Yes, Star City, 2046.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
It's everything we've ever wanted.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,160
We could live like kings here.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,600
You son of a bitch.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,400
You lay a hand on me again,
you'll burn too.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,320
<i>Go ahead, Jonas.</i>

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,520
<i>He's listening.</i>

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
<i>Hi, Daddy. We miss you.</i>

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
<i>- And love you.
- And love you.</i>

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,600
<i>Anything else you want to say?</i>

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,840
<i>Come home soon, Daddy.</i>

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
<i>Hi, Rip.</i>

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,040
<i>Not sure if you got our last message.</i>

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,800
<i>I told Jonas that you got
caught up with work,</i>

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,400
<i>but I really thought
you'd be home by now.</i>

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,280
<i>London is...</i>

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,440
<i>Things have changed.</i>

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,120
<i>It's hard to tell what's going on</i>

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,360
<i>with so many soldiers and rumors.</i>

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,600
<i>I just want to know you're all right.</i>

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,880
<i>Wherever you are,</i>

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>whenever you are,</i>

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,640
<i>I love you, Rip.</i>

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>Go ahead, Jonas. He's listening.</i>

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,920
<i>Hi, Daddy. We miss you.</i>

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,360
<i>- And love you.
- And love you.</i>

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,840
I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain.

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,760
No, not at all.
Just catching up on work.

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
What is all this?

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Just trying to connect the dots,

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,320
find the optimal time
to strike at Savage.

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
And?

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,000
And the trail's gone cold.

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,840
In order to preserve
the element of surprise,

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,240
I wager the best course of action

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,120
is to travel further back in time,

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,760
but nothing here indicates
where to find him.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
Perhaps I can help you look.

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,880
I've been looking!

56
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
I apologize.

57
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,160
It's just the stakes are so high.

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,200
I vowed to save my family,
but I'm failing them.

59
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,280
Perhaps I'm not the Time Master
they need.

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,520
You must be.

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,240
You're the only one they have.

62
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,360
- Can't Gideon help us?
- No.

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
When a timeship returns
to the Vanishing Point

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,880
after a mission, its CPU is updated

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,200
from the temporal database,

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,160
which... given my rogue status,

67
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,320
we are unable to do.

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
So, what you're saying is

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,080
Gideon requires a software update.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
Which explains
why you've been holed up in here

71
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
for the past week.

72
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,920
Has it really been a week?

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,680
And some of our teammates
are getting just a tad antsy.

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
I'm done.

75
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't mind him.

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,680
He's still sore
about having to leave 2046.

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm sore because I was recruited

78
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,640
for my unique ability
to light things on fire.

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,360
And now, I'm locked in the one place

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
where I can't light things on fire

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
a spaceship.

82
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,240
Where do you think you're going?

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,400
Why?

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,800
You gonna clock me in the head
if I don't listen again?

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Everything okay with you two?

86
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,840
Yeah, peachy.

87
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,640
<i>Captain, I've just intercepted
a deep space transmission.</i>

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,360
<i>It's a distress signal
from the Acheron.</i>

89
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,880
<i>- She's the...</i>
- Flagship of the Time Fleet.

90
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
Yes, I know that. Thank you, Gideon.

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,880
<i>Systemic malfunction.</i>

92
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,680
<i>I'm stranded, unable to jump.</i>

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,480
<i>Controls unresponsive.</i>

94
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,520
<i>This is Captain Eve Baxter
of the timeship Acheron,</i>

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,120
<i>requesting critical rescue.</i>

96
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,560
And we care about this chick why?

97
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,480
We don't, but the Acheron's computer

98
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,560
will contain the current Intel
on Savage's whereabouts.

99
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,480
Gideon, set a course

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,200
for the Acheron's position
in deep space.

101
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,920
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>
- Deep space?

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
I had no idea we had the ability

103
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,480
to explore the unknown realms
of the galaxy.

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,760
- Astonishing.
- No.

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,360
What's astonishing
is that we're acting

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
as roadside assistance
for the people who's chasing us.

107
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,240
Doesn't it seem suspicious,

108
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,960
this distress call just
happened to reach us?

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
How do we know it's not a trap?

110
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
We don't, but what we do know

111
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
is that Savage's trail has run cold.

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
And unless Gideon can upload the data

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,480
- from the Acheron's computer...
- I'm in.

114
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,160
You are?

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,680
The sooner we end Savage, the sooner

116
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,160
- I get back to where I belong.
- Prison?

117
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,960
Any prison on Earth's
better than this one, Professor.

118
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
- Gideon.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
Engines to full throttle.

120
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
<i>Of course, Captain.</i>

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,520
Professor Stein, Mr. Jackson,

122
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,120
would you care to join
the boarding party?

123
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,040
A chance for an extra-vehicular

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
docking maneuver?

125
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
What could be more exciting?

126
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,440
I could think of a few things.

127
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's get this thing started.

128
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,640
Hey, you think there's something

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,440
worth stealing on that ship?

130
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,400
{\an5}I'm just looking
for a change of scenery.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
If that's okay with you, boss.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
Dr. Palmer.

133
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,400
I leave the ship
in your hands while we're gone.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,760
And I leave him in yours.

135
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm having the strangest sensation.

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,160
It's like I'm ten years old again.

137
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,560
{\an5}You do a lot of space travel
as a kid, Professor?

138
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,680
Only in my dreams, after I read

139
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,960
{\an5}my first issue of
<i>Rick Starr: Space Ranger.</i>

140
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,720
{\an5}Space Ranger Stein?
Yeah, I don't see it.

141
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
I wanted to travel through space,

142
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,360
{\an5}surviving only
by my wits and laser guns.

143
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,480
I even built a rocket
out of cardboard boxes.

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
What stopped you?

145
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
{\an5}NASA has rather strict
guidelines regarding

146
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
nearsightedness.

147
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,200
And smoking weed.

148
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,480
Gideon, have you been able to link up

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
to the Acheron's computer?

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,560
<i>It appears a self-destruct code</i>

151
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,120
<i>has disabled the ship's
temporal navigation system.</i>

152
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Well, what does that mean?

153
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,000
{\an5}It's possibly the result
of a malfunction.

154
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,080
Just in case, Martin,
I'm going to ask you

155
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,800
to remain behind here
on the jump ship.

156
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,600
You're telling us if something goes
wrong, egghead's in charge?

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Break out the emergency gear.

158
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Space Ranger has a job to do.

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,280
<i>Rip? Rip, I need an update.</i>

160
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,200
How about this update?

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,960
They've boarded the ship!

162
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,040
- We've been overrun!
- Excellent.

163
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,440
Perhaps you're not
taking this seriously, Miranda.

164
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,560
- Gary?
<i>- Yes, Captain?</i>

165
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,520
Be a dear and open the
portside bulkhead, would you?

166
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
Look, I enjoy a suicide mission

167
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,600
- as much as the next person...
- You heard me, Gary.

168
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

169
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,920
What's the plan here?

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Rip, you might want to grab
hold of something.

171
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,560
Yes, I am! It's called a gun!

172
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,880
Something else. Do it, please.

173
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Now, Gary.

174
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
<i>Gamma-delta hatch opened.</i>

175
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,920
<i>Explosive decompression
has evacuated the time pirates.</i>

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,120
Seal hatch, engage time drive,
and punch it.

177
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,840
Well done, Lieutenant Coburn.

178
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,000
Well done?

179
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,520
She nearly got us killed.

180
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,280
The simulation equivalent, at least.

181
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,560
{\an5}She demonstrated
unconventional thinking

182
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,360
against overwhelming numbers.

183
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,120
{\an5}You could learn
a thing or two from her,

184
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Lieutenant Hunter.

185
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,440
Declan was right.

186
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,160
Teach me more.

187
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,400
Sir, I can explain.

188
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
Don't bother, Lieutenant.

189
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,840
{\an5}Save it
for your disciplinary hearing.

190
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
{\an5}Hey, hey, hey.
We can figure this out.

191
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,880
{\an5}- We'll get through this together.
- That's just it.

192
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,880
{\an5}We can't be together.
We knew from the start.

193
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,320
Relationships are strictly forbidden.

194
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,000
There has to be a way to fix this.

195
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
I need some time to think.

197
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,360
Stay close and stay alert.

198
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,920
To quote every
<i>Star Wars</i> ever made,

199
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,120
"I've got a bad feeling about this."

200
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Valiant effort.

201
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Let the man go.

202
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,680
Or else what?

203
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
Do as the man says.

204
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,680
Who the hell are these guys?

205
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,480
These, Mr. Jackson,

206
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
are time pirates.

207
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
Captain John Valor.

208
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,960
What happened to Captain Baxter?

209
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
She was on her way
back to the Vanishing Point

210
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,280
to imprison us
when we made our escape.

211
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
But before we could
take control of the Acheron...

212
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,840
She destroyed her time drive
in accordance with protocol.

213
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,360
The same protocol that said

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
another Time Master
would come to her rescue.

215
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,520
Do I look like a Time Master to you?

216
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,760
You look like the kind of man who'd

217
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,040
throw his grandmother
out of an airlock.

218
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,440
Nor am I a Time Master,

219
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,760
so you might as well just let us go.

220
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,880
Correct me if I'm wrong.

221
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,680
You're Rip frigging Hunter.

222
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,680
I thought you'd be taller.

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
You never said you were famous.

224
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Infamous.

225
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,320
There was a time
when he had men like me

226
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,080
running scared
all along the timeline.

227
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
Unless you let us return to our ship,

228
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,000
a man named Vandal Savage
will destroy the entire world.

229
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,640
Time Masters and pirates alike.

230
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,360
For once, we're fighting
on the same side.

231
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,080
That little slogan
should come with its own shovel.

232
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,240
- Prepare a boarding party!
- Yes, sir.

233
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,200
If I were you, I'd reconsider
your plan, Mr. Valor.

234
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,360
Really?

235
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,080
I gave my crew instructions
to shoot any boarding vessel,

236
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,480
along with the ship launching it.

237
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,200
With the great Rip Hunter on board?

238
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,840
I highly doubt it.

239
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,120
You don't know my crew.

240
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
They're iron-willed
and battle-hardened.

241
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,600
The most formidable warriors
to navigate time and space.

242
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,440
Captain's log. Star date 837.9.

243
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,200
We're awaiting word
from the away team

244
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
aboard the Acheron.

245
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,720
I hate to break it to you,
but you're no Captain Kirk.

246
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
You're Picard.

247
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,520
But Picard was cautious,

248
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,280
pontificating, sort of sexless.

249
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,960
Well, tell that to Vash.

250
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,720
And for the record,
Picard was way hotter than Kirk.

251
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,640
Oh, Mick had it wrong.

252
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
This ship isn't a prison.
It's a torture chamber.

253
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, I don't think
Mick's problem is with the ship.

254
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
You think it's with me.

255
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
You did knock him out
and force him to leave

256
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,560
2046 Star City,
which is like Disneyland for felons.

257
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,120
He'll get over it.

258
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,040
Mick runs hot. He always has.

259
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,440
Once he calms down,
everything will be back to normal.

260
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,080
Yeah, I bet that one sounded
more convincing in your head.

261
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,640
<i>I'd like to speak to
Acting Captain Raymond Palmer.</i>

262
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,040
Acting Captain.
I like the sound of that.

263
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm Captain Palmer. Who are you?

264
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
<i>I'm the man holding
your crew hostage.</i>

265
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,960
<i>Captain Palmer,
I've informed Mr. Valor</i>

266
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,680
of the fiery retribution
you'll rain down upon him

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,040
if we are not released immediately.

268
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm gonna make this real simple.

269
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,160
You surrender your ship,
and I'll drop you off unharmed

270
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,280
at a place and time of your choosing.

271
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,520
<i>- You've got 10 seconds to decide.</i>
- Or else what?

272
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,000
<i>If you want the Waverider
for yourself,</i>

273
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,600
<i>there's no way you'll fire on us.</i>

274
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
Perhaps, but right now,

275
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,960
I've got my sights set
on your captain's head.

276
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay.

277
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,960
Just give me a chance to negotiate.

278
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,400
<i>Ten... nine...</i>

279
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,640
- Maybe he's bluffing.
<i>- Eight...</i>

280
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,960
- Doesn't feel like it.
- Seven...

281
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,520
You don't know Palmer,

282
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,360
and how he survived
the "Imperiex" onslaught.

283
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,880
Oh, Gideon?

284
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,360
<i>Captain Hunter programmed me</i>

285
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,880
<i>to execute certain protocols</i>

286
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,600
<i>in response to specific keywords.</i>

287
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,960
What does that mean in English?

288
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,200
<i>Strap yourselves in.</i>

289
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,560
<i>We are on the move
and preparing to fire.</i>

290
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,120
Great Scott! We're under attack!

291
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
- Gideon, who's firing at us?
<i>- Captain's orders.</i>

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,320
- Palmer, you idiot!
<i>- No, Captain Hunter's.</i>

293
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,560
<i>Attacking the pirates who've taken</i>

294
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,080
<i>the rest of the boarding party
hostage.</i>

295
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,440
- Pirates?
- What are you doing, Gideon?

296
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,400
<i>Just a warning shot to let
them know we mean business.</i>

297
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,160
My partner's on that ship.

298
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Dr. Palmer?

299
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,080
Captain Hunter? Is anyone there?

300
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
It's up to you now, Martin.

301
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,280
- Gilbert!
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

302
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,760
Set a pursuit course
and prepare to return fire.

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
If you destroy the Waverider,

304
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,480
none of us are getting back home.

305
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,680
Don't worry. I'm only targeting

306
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,280
your ship's life support systems.

307
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,480
Now, if I were the weapons
targeting system

308
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,640
on the Acheron...

309
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,760
where would I be?

310
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,760
<i>There's a hull breach
in the aft portion of the ship,</i>

311
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,200
<i>and the pirates have taken out
the telemetry controls.</i>

312
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,720
Gideon, switch to manual.

313
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
What are you doing?

314
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,160
If this is anything
like a video game,

315
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,360
flying a space ship.

316
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,960
Where are you guys going?

317
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,120
To deal with the hole in the ship.

318
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,120
Make sure Picard here
doesn't get us all killed.

319
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,880
Actually,
I'm more like Sulu right now.

320
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,720
Or Han Solo!

321
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Target their thrusters and fire.

322
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,520
I said fire!

323
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,960
Sir, the weapons systems
have been taken offline.

324
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,000
Manually.

325
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,200
Who else is on my ship?

326
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
Oh, a good captain
keeps his best weapons hidden

327
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,520
from his enemies, Mr. Valor.

328
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,840
Find the saboteur!
Bring him to me, dead or alive.

329
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,960
I guess we'll just have
to follow your friends

330
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,360
till they're out of air.

331
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,920
Shouldn't take too long,
given the size

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
of the hole in the hull.

333
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Here.

334
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,320
Hail the crew of the Waverider.

335
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,680
Rip, tell your crew to let us board,

336
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,640
and I will happily save them.

337
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,880
But either way,
we are taking the Waverider.

338
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,160
Take the damn deal, Rip.

339
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,040
A captain never surrenders his ship.

340
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,160
Besides, you'll never
catch Captain Palmer.

341
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,560
<i>He once outran Kanjar Ro himself.</i>

342
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Who's Kanjar Ro?

343
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,880
<i>Engaging protocol now, Captain.</i>

344
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,760
- Awesome.
<i>- I wasn't talking to you.</i>

345
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,840
What the hell happened to them?

346
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,080
We were following
a holographic projection

347
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,800
which allowed the Waverider
to slip away.

348
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,920
Giving secret commands to your crew.

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,560
Very clever, Captain.

350
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Throw them in the brig!

351
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,440
We'll find your friends' bodies.

352
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Eventually.

353
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,760
How long can you keep that up for?

354
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,080
Not long.

355
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm gonna run out of charge.

356
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,680
<i>Be advised, the breach
is only partially contained.</i>

357
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,160
Guess we know
the bulkhead doors are working.

358
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
Too bad we're on the wrong side
of them.

359
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,880
Thanks for stopping by.

360
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,880
We're gonna get you out of here.
Just hang tight.

361
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,160
Is there another option?

362
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,480
Don't mean to rush you, Raymond,
but it's getting cold in here.

363
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,320
Normally I wouldn't complain, but...

364
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,760
Can't you just open the doors,
Gideon?

365
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,760
<i>The bulkhead is designed
to remain shut</i>

366
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
<i>until the breach is sealed.</i>

367
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,480
Well, that's not happening
from in here.

368
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,920
How much time do we have until...

369
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We're dead?

370
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
Captain Baxter. I'm Rip Hunter.

371
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,280
I'm here to rescue you.

372
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,160
I doubt it.
You walked straight into a trap.

373
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,880
I will admit
that we've encountered some...

374
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,240
unforeseen obstacles.

375
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Right.

376
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,760
But, we're gonna get you
out of here in a second.

377
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,440
Mr. Jackson, will you please see
what we can do

378
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,840
about disabling this force field?

379
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,200
You don't think I've tried that?

380
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,920
But by all means,
if you think this kid

381
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,120
will have better luck.

382
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,520
- Whoa, who you calling kid?
- I'm sorry.

383
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
- I meant, criminal.
- Actually, that's me.

384
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,960
All of you.

385
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,160
If we ever do get out of here,
the first thing I'll do is take you

386
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,760
to the Vanishing Point to await trial
before the Time Council.

387
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,440
The great Rip Hunter,

388
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,800
but look at you now.

389
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes, look at me now.

390
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,920
Helping you break out
of a pirate's brig

391
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,240
aboard your own timeship.

392
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,920
I don't want help from a man
who broke his oath,

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,520
stole a timeship,
and decided to change history

394
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
for his own selfish reasons.

395
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,840
Doesn't make any sense to me.

396
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,680
No, I don't expect it would.

397
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Rip Hunter.

398
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,160
Miranda Coburn.

399
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,440
Those aren't
your real names, are they?

400
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
No, sir.

401
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,800
And why is that?

402
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,040
Because if our enemies knew
our true identities,

403
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,280
our ancestors and descendants
across the timeline

404
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,720
could be potential targets.

405
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,160
As well as anyone else
you might love.

406
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,480
Which is why...

407
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,400
Personal attachments
are expressly forbidden

408
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,680
by the Council of Time Masters.

409
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
And grounds for immediate
discharge from service.

410
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,520
Do either of you deny
that you were conducting

411
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,360
an illicit affair in violation
of this council's rules?

412
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,000
In that case,

413
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,320
I motion that we adjourn
this disciplinary hearing

414
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,440
for one hour to afford you

415
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
the opportunity
to consider your response.

416
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,120
Though I sincerely doubt
there's any answer

417
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,520
you can provide that will
prevent this tribunal

418
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,920
from discharging you
both from the Time Masters.

419
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,960
I suppose this feels like
a day at the beach for you?

420
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,000
If I had to pick a way to die,
freezing wouldn't be the worst.

421
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,040
What's it like?

422
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Dying?

423
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,840
I imagine you've got
a unique perspective.

424
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
You know, it's funny.

425
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
I mean, you'd expect it
to be terrifying,

426
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,400
just panic and fear.

427
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
What'd you feel?

428
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,200
I guess lonely.

429
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Yeah.

430
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,160
Like everybody I loved
was a million miles away.

431
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,240
I mean, I don't like you,
but at least I'm not dying alone.

432
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,280
Closest I ever came to dying was...

433
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
the day I met Mick.

434
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
- Why does that not surprise me?
- It wasn't like that.

435
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,800
It was my first day in juvie.

436
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
I was 14, and the smallest kid
in there by far.

437
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,760
Some of the older kids
wanted to make sure I knew it.

438
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
So they jumped me.

439
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,240
I fought back,
but one of them had a shiv...

440
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
and I figured that was it

441
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,240
until Mick stepped in.

442
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
And they didn't mess
with me after that.

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He's been standing up
for me ever since.

444
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
Let's just hope he's standing up
for Rip and Jax now.

445
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,600
Who else is gonna
take on those pirates?

446
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Hey!

447
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,920
That'll teach you to mess
with a nuclear physicist.

448
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Are you ready?

449
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,840
Given I never designed
the Atom suit for outer space,

450
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,520
I'm not exactly sure
how to answer that question.

451
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,560
While I'm gone, you're captain.

452
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,920
Thank you.

453
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,320
But I think we both know
I'm in charge either way.

454
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Good luck.

455
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,520
Gideon, open the hatch.

456
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,960
Sorry, Captain.

457
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,560
I can't Jerry-rig the door open.

458
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,280
Don't worry, kid.

459
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
It's not your fault. It's his.

460
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,600
In case you've forgotten, Mr. Rory,

461
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,560
you volunteered to be
part of this boarding party.

462
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,240
I volunteered to get
away from my partner,

463
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,160
who hasn't been
acting like my partner

464
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,360
ever since you fed his head
with fairy tales

465
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
about saving the world.

466
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,000
Your partner has a mind of his own,

467
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
Mr. Rory, which is more
than I can say of you.

468
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
Are you saying
that I'm dumb, Captain?

469
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,800
Let's pretend, just for a moment,
that you're the captain,

470
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,600
stuck in the brig
while the rest of your crew

471
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,760
slowly perish on their damaged ship.

472
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,520
Now, what would you do
to get yourself

473
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
out of that predicament?

474
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,960
Oh, no brilliant ideas? Really?

475
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
Why am I not in
the least bit surprised?

476
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,160
Shut your mouth, now!

477
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,280
Okay, let's all just
take a deep breath.

478
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,880
- Or what?
- You'll punch me in the face,

479
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
or burn me alive, or employ

480
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,800
some other barbaric form of violence?

481
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,440
That's why you recruited me,
isn't it?

482
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,720
To hit, hurt, and burn?

483
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,280
No, I recruited you
because you and your partner

484
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
were a package deal.

485
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,920
- What?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rory.

486
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,680
But a serial arsonist
was never part of my plan

487
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,920
to stop Savage, much less one
with the IQ of meat.

488
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,120
I didn't mean to be so blunt.

489
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,280
If I could just have a moment
of quiet,

490
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,200
then perhaps I can think of a way
of getting us off this pirate ship.

491
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,960
I think I just beat you to it.

492
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Can anyone hear me?

493
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,720
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

494
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,840
Me and the pirates
are gonna have a little parlay.

495
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,120
- Do not do this, Rory.
- Too late.

496
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,360
What do you want?

497
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,040
I want to speak to Captain Valor.

498
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,920
- About what?
- About a timeship.

499
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
I am warning you.

500
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,600
Shut up!

501
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,040
I may have the IQ of meat,

502
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,160
but I know how to cut a deal.

503
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm listening.

504
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,560
You want the Waverider.
I want to go home.

505
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,120
Where is home for a man like you?

506
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,640
2016, Central City.

507
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,640
Of all the places in time,
you want to go there?

508
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
That's right.

509
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,880
To the exact moment Hunter
recruited me and my partner

510
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,800
on this suicidal mission of his,

511
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
but, this time,

512
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,480
I'm gonna tell him where to shove it.

513
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,760
Let me get this straight.

514
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,880
I let you go,

515
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,240
you'll deliver the Waverider.

516
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Yes.

517
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,520
Do we have an accord?

518
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,120
You think your friends will believe

519
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,240
you were able to escape?

520
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,480
Not unless I do this.

521
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
<i>How's it going out there?</i>

522
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,440
<i>Good.</i>

523
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,560
<i>By which I mean utterly terrifying.</i>

524
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,320
<i>I'll have the breach sealed
in two more minutes.</i>

525
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,920
Okay. How's your oxygen level?

526
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,640
I think the technical term is lousy.

527
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Just two more minutes.

528
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,520
You got this.

529
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,040
Nothing quite
like dying to make you think

530
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,560
about all the mistakes,

531
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,400
all the wrong choices.

532
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,880
Is this Leonard Snart coming
to God in his final moments?

533
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Hardly.

534
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,600
Just wishing I could take
a few things back.

535
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,400
I should've left Mick
in future Star City.

536
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,600
Why didn't you?

537
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,280
Without me to keep him in check,

538
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,160
Mick can be a scary guy.

539
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,760
Agreed.

540
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,280
Hate to break it to you, but

541
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,080
even if we make it out of here alive,

542
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,880
you're still gonna have
a problem on your hands.

543
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,160
And I've seen enough to know
that Mick's in a dark place.

544
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,280
He's not coming back.

545
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,840
Man, I can't believe
Rory sold us out.

546
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
No, actually I can.

547
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,960
But still, man.

548
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,080
What choice did he have?

549
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,280
The crew left on the Waverider
are most probably dead by now,

550
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
and God knows what happened
to Professor Stein.

551
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,720
It's no wonder that Mr. Rory

552
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,360
chose to save his own skin.

553
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
And what I can I do about it?

554
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm stick in a pirate's brig
and I've lost both my ship

555
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,520
and the loyalty of my crew.

556
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,160
You're one to talk about loyalty.

557
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,880
Oh, but I am, Captain Baxter,

558
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,560
and not because I pledged an oath

559
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,880
to serve as a Time Master,

560
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,520
but a long time ago, I made

561
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,320
a far more important oath.

562
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,440
When you call me a failure,
Captain Baxter, you're right.

563
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,720
'Cause I failed
both my wife and my son.

564
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,560
For betraying the Time Council

565
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,160
I have absolutely no regrets.

566
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,840
But failing to save my family?

567
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,120
That is something for which
I will never forgive myself.

568
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Time Master Declan?

569
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,880
I thought the tribunal
was re-convening.

570
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,720
It's been canceled.

571
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,600
Lieutenant Coburn assumed full
responsibility for the affair.

572
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,480
The other Time Masters
were moved by her argument.

573
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,520
They've dismissed the charges?

574
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,400
Once Lieutenant Coburn resigned.

575
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,480
- Why would she do that?
- It seems she believes in you.

576
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,120
Now you must prove
to yourself and all of us

577
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,760
that you are indeed the man
she believes you to be.

578
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,320
I thought we were done for.

579
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,280
Take heart, dear Captain.

580
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,920
This battle is far from over.

581
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,840
Now, who would care to join me
in a daring escape?

582
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,360
- Space Ranger.
- Indeed.

583
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,160
<i>- Ray, don't go nodding off on me.</i>
- No, I wasn't.

584
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,880
I was just resting my eyes
for a second.

585
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,360
<i>You've got to stay with me, Ray.</i>

586
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,000
Just stay focused on my voice,
and keep talking.

587
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
<i>- About what?</i>
- Anything.

588
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,480
Like...

589
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,240
what was your first pet's name?

590
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,480
- Slinky.
- Is that a cat?

591
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Burmese python.

592
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,080
Yeah, I'm allergic to cats and dogs.

593
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,080
<i>Pretty much anything without scales.</i>

594
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,200
Okay, then, enough about pets.

595
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,360
What's your favorite color?

596
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
<i>Don't have one.</i>

597
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,520
Who doesn't have a favorite color?

598
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,080
It's kind of like
having a favorite Beatle.

599
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,600
No, everyone has a favorite Beatle.

600
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,600
Not me.

601
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,920
Wouldn't be fair to the other three.

602
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,960
Okay, fine, enough about pets,

603
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,640
and colors, and Beatles.

604
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,440
It's a good thing
we never went for that drink.

605
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,960
This space date is going terribly.

606
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Ray?

607
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,520
Are you still with me, Ray?

608
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,240
<i>Ray? Are you there?</i>

609
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,880
<i>- Ray?</i>
- I'm sorry.

610
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,360
It's all I have left.

611
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Ray, are you there?

612
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,120
<i>It seems that Mr. Palmer
patched the hole in the hull,</i>

613
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,040
<i>allowing Mr. Snart and Ms. Lance
to escape the engine room.</i>

614
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,240
Okay, as soon as he's on
board, I need you

615
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,480
to close the cargo bay
and seal the airlock, Gideon.

616
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,680
Ray.

617
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,360
Ray! Hey, stay with me.

618
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,960
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Palmer
has gone into cardiac arrest.</i>

619
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,520
Please, I can't lose you too!
Ray, I need you! Please!

620
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,040
<i>His chances of survival
are less than 3,720 to 1.</i>

621
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Ray!

622
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,240
Ray, come on. You're strong.

623
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,920
Please, Ray. Come back to me.

624
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Ray!

625
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Ray!

626
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,320
Could you please stop
punching me in the chest?

627
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,040
Why do they always make it seem
like it's a good thing

628
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,160
to do in the movies?

629
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,480
I thought you were dead.

630
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,880
I think I was, there, for a second.

631
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Thank you.

632
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,080
You kids need a moment?

633
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,000
You okay?

634
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,960
<i>Mr. Palmer nearly died.</i>

635
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,320
Welcome to the club.

636
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,160
Gideon, what's happening
on the Acheron?

637
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,320
<i>Funny you should ask.</i>

638
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,200
<i>I just received a message
from Mr. Rory.</i>

639
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,840
<i>It seems he escaped capture</i>

640
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,360
<i>and is now returning
to the Waverider.</i>

641
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,800
Told you.

642
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,600
Those pirates picked
the wrong guy to mess with.

643
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,160
Since when does Rory even know
how to fly the jump ship?

644
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,640
How did he even find us?

645
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,480
<i>Actually, I did the flying.</i>

646
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,960
<i>He received quite a beating
at the hands of the pirates.</i>

647
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
<i>That's him now.</i>

648
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
You okay, Mick?

649
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Boys!

650
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,080
Ship's all yours!

651
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,640
You son of a bitch.

652
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,240
What are you doing, Mick?

653
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,400
I'm getting us home.

654
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Are you in?

655
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Yeah.

656
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,520
Time to choose a side, I guess.

657
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Chosen.

658
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Bastard!

659
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Get them!

660
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,880
I'll get the time drive.

661
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,480
Is the Acheron's jump ship
still operational?

662
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
- Yes.
- All right, go to it

663
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
and get off the Acheron.

664
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
I some unfinished business
with Mr. Valor.

665
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,040
I'm not leaving my ship.

666
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,400
And we're not leaving you behind.

667
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,160
So what's the plan, Captain?

668
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,040
Valor and his men
substantially outnumber us.

669
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,000
We're not going to be
able to defeat them

670
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,240
by conventional means.

671
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,040
<i>Mr. Rory is making his way
to the engine room</i>

672
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,200
<i>to access the time drive.</i>

673
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
I'll handle it.

674
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,280
What's going on?

675
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
You're losing.

676
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,800
- Gilbert?
<i>- The time pirates are indeed</i>

677
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
<i>ten seconds behind you, and closing.</i>

678
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
That doesn't give us much time.

679
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,200
You think Rip's plan will work?

680
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,040
Yeah, that's what I thought.

681
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,360
Step away from it, Mick.

682
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,960
I'll tell you what, Blondie.

683
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,640
Walk away and I won't kill you.

684
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,880
You know I can't do that.

685
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,040
I like you, Sara.

686
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,160
You got a lot of guts.

687
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,760
That's why I'm only
gonna kill you a little bit!

688
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Mick!

689
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,840
<i>Captain Hunter? We're in position.</i>

690
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,240
<i>- Captain?</i>
- Yes, yes!

691
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,160
I'm a little bit busy right now!

692
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
Be that as it may,
we've run out of time.

693
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,040
<i>Captain, the plan.</i>

694
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,960
<i>We're waiting for your signal.</i>

695
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,840
- Gilbert?
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

696
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,760
I need you to listen to me very,
very carefully.

697
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,280
Rip! We're good!

698
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,240
<i>Bulkhead door closed.</i>

699
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,400
<i>Explosive decompression
has evacuated the time pirates.</i>

700
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,000
Thank you, Gilbert.

701
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,680
Please hail the Waverider.

702
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,080
<i>Waverider, this is Captain Hunter.</i>

703
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
<i>We've regained control
of the Acheron.</i>

704
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
<i>What's your status?</i>

705
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,280
What are you gonna do, Snart?

706
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
I suppose it wouldn't be very fair

707
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,000
if I arrested you
after you reclaimed my ship

708
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,880
and apprehended John Valor for me.

709
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,280
Happy to help out
a fellow Time Master.

710
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,040
Even though
I don't deserve that title.

711
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,880
I was wrong.
You've proven that today.

712
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,560
You're still one hell
of a Time Master.

713
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Which is why I'm giving you this.

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,960
- What's that?
- Gilbert?

715
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,760
<i>Using the Vanishing Point's
most current timeline data,</i>

716
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,720
<i>I calculate a 99.8 percent
probability</i>

717
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
<i>that you will find Vandal Savage</i>

718
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,720
<i>in Harmony Falls, Oregon,
in March of 1958.</i>

719
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,160
Thank you, Captain Baxter.

720
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,720
I still don't understand
why you're doing all this.

721
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,960
Before all this started,

722
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,440
I don't think I would've, either.

723
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,440
We protect history,
safeguard time itself.

724
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,800
There is no higher calling.

725
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,080
It's called love.

726
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,240
<i>Rip. Rip.</i>

727
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
<i>Rip!</i>

728
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,040
Look at me, Rip.

729
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,400
Please don't be mad at me.

730
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,720
Oh, no, I'm not mad at you!

731
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
I was going to resign.

732
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,840
I know and I couldn't let you.

733
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,080
This has always been your dream.

734
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,200
Yes, but you are so much
better at this than me.

735
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
I... I can't understand
why you would...

736
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
why you'd give all that up.

737
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,320
It's funny, because you're
the one who made me realize

738
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,720
that I could never be a Time Master.

739
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,680
I found something with you,

740
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,440
something wonderful.

741
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,120
I found love.

742
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,760
That thing that the Time Masters

743
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,120
always taught us to hide from,

744
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,200
but they were wrong, Rip.

745
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,880
Love's no threat.

746
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,120
It's beautiful, and powerful,

747
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,880
and once you know it,

748
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,440
love changes everything.

749
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
Like it changed me

750
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,600
and that's why I have to resign,

751
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,880
because I could never
belong to something

752
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,320
that turns its back on the truth.

753
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,200
Suddenly my chosen
profession seems

754
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,520
- so terribly unimportant.
- No.

755
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,760
The world needs the Time Masters

756
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,320
and the Time Masters, most assuredly,

757
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,080
need Rip Hunter.

758
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,560
My only wish is that one day,

759
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,560
when you're off traveling
space and time,

760
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,040
you'll realize what I have,
and understand

761
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,360
why I'm doing what I'm doing.

762
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,440
I hope you think of me
when that day comes.

763
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
I will...

764
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,120
because I'll be with you.

765
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Hey.

766
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,520
I was just looking for you.

767
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,400
- How are you feeling?
- Good. Yeah.

768
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,320
Turns out I bounce back
pretty quickly from hypothermia.

769
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,600
In fact, I managed to remember
some of the things

770
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,040
you said to me
when I was almost dead.

771
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,720
You were wrong, B-T-W.

772
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,600
You don't need me.
You don't need anybody.

773
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,200
I mean, you're pretty amazing

774
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,000
and I'm lucky to be your friend,

775
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,440
be on this mission together with...

776
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,560
That's... surprising.

777
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Okay.

778
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
I'll say it.

779
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,480
Why don't we just
drop him off back in 2016?

780
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,960
Because my sister lives in 2016.

781
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,480
And your sister, and your wife.

782
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,840
So what exactly
are we talking about here?

783
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,160
Leaving Rory in the brig
until we take down Savage?

784
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,640
No, no, no, no,
the brig is unsuitable

785
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,160
for long-term incarceration.

786
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,600
Leaving him free run
of the ship is not an option.

787
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,840
I'll handle it.

788
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,840
By handling it, you mean murder?

789
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,200
I said I'll handle it.

790
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,320
I told you that'll be
the last time you hit me.

791
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,760
You were right.

792
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,840
That the plan?

793
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,800
Take me out in the middle of nowhere,

794
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,360
where no one can find the body?

795
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,320
I wish there were some
other way, Mick,

796
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,640
but you're dangerous.

797
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,200
- A liability to the team.
- Team?

798
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,440
You and I were a team!

799
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,120
What happened to you?

800
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,160
People change.

801
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,680
You think you're some kind of hero,

802
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
but deep down you're still the same

803
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,000
punk kid I saved in juvie.

804
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,280
You haven't got the guts.

805
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,000
You want to kill me?

806
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Kill me.

807
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,480
Only one of us is walking
out of here alive.

808
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You're right.
