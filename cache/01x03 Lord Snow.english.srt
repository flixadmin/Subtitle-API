1
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,880
Welcome, Lord Stark.

2
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,050
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

3
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,140
The honor of your presence is requested.

4
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,810
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,520
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,150
If you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

7
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,690
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

8
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,900
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

9
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,820
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

10
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,900
Sturdy old thing.

11
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,360
How many kings' arses
have polished it, I wonder?

12
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,240
Um, what's the line?

13
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,620
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

14
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,950
Very handsome armor.

15
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,460
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

16
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,130
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

17
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,920
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

18
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,180
I have a knack for it.

19
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,430
It must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

20
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,690
I was standing right here
when it happened.

21
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,770
He was very brave, your brother.

22
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,650
Your father, too.

23
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,820
They didn't deserve to die like that.

24
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,740
Nobody deserves to die like that.

25
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,660
But you just stood there and watched.

26
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,740
500 men just stood there and watched.

27
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,500
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

28
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,960
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

29
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,590
No, Lord Stark.

30
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,800
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

31
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,050
Except for the screams, of course,

32
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,140
and the Mad King laughing.

33
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,850
And later...

34
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,520
when I watched the Mad King die,

35
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,940
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

36
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,940
It felt like justice.

37
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,570
Is that what you tell yourself at night?

38
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,490
You're a servant of justice?

39
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,080
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

40
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,960
Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,

41
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,800
would you admire me more?

42
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,010
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

43
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,190
Lord Stark.

44
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,110
Lord Varys.

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,910
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

46
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,700
We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

47
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,040
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

48
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,460
Renly! You're looking well.

49
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,250
And you look tired from the road.

50
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,590
I told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,380
But we have a kingdom
to look after.

52
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,600
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

53
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,180
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

54
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,310
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

55
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,610
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem...

56
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,610
from navel to collarbone.

57
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,780
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

58
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,700
It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord.

59
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,110
It was Catelyn Tully.

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,450
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

61
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,120
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

62
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,790
Grand Maester.

63
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,130
How many years has it been?

64
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,750
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

65
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,300
Oh, how forgetful of me.

66
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,100
This belongs to you now.

67
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,600
Should we begin?

68
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,640
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

69
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,020
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

70
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,150
His Grace has many cares.

71
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,950
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

72
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,870
We are the lords of small matters here.

73
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,830
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

74
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,340
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

75
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,010
- Mm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

76
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,670
20,000 to the runner-up,

77
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,840
20,000 to the winning archer.

78
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,220
Can the treasury bear such expense?

79
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,180
I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, I expect.

80
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,520
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?

81
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,400
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

82
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,320
- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

83
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,610
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

84
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,200
I will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

85
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,160
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

86
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,000
but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

87
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,580
"Counting coppers," he calls it.

88
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,500
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

89
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,840
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

90
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,340
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

91
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,340
There will be no plans...
until I speak to Robert.

92
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,390
Forgive me, my lords. I'm...

93
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,940
- I had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

94
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,530
We serve at your pleasure.

95
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,620
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

96
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,540
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

97
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,380
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

98
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,210
I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.

99
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,970
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

100
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,100
That's not true. You killed the beast.

101
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,350
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

102
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,850
I didn't, I...

103
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,610
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

104
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,320
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

105
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,910
Do I have to marry her?

106
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,830
Yes.

107
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,120
She's very beautiful and young.

108
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,410
If you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

109
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,920
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

110
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,970
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

111
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,590
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,890
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

113
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,810
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

114
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,690
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

115
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,650
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

116
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,320
We allow the northerners too much power.

117
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,820
They consider themselves our equals.

118
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,490
How would you handle them?

119
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,250
I'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.

120
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,540
A royal army?

121
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,500
Why should every lord
command his own men?

122
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,750
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

123
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,970
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

124
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,720
trained by experienced soldiers,

125
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,470
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

126
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,930
And if the northerners rebel?

127
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,600
I'd crush them.

128
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,850
Seize Winterfell and install someone
loyal to the realm as warden of the North.

129
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,360
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

130
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,150
And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

131
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,440
- For me. I'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

132
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,530
But you've just invaded their homeland,

133
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,370
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

134
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,410
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

135
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
It's too big and too wild.

136
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,210
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

137
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,460
couldn't save you and your royal army.

138
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,420
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

139
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,420
and when to destroy his enemies.

140
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,140
So you agree...

141
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,510
the Starks are enemies?

142
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,350
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

143
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,110
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

144
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,190
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

145
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,240
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

146
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,490
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

147
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,870
The Hound killed your friend.

148
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,450
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

149
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,870
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,210
Mycah would be alive.

151
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,710
Enough!

152
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,960
What's happening here?

153
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,340
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

154
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,380
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

155
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,890
That's for you, love.

156
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,070
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

157
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,580
Don't you like it?

158
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,210
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.

159
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,790
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

160
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,010
It's all right. Go on.

161
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,350
War was easier than daughters.

162
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,480
Go away!

163
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,030
Arya, open the door.

164
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,250
May I come in?

165
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,510
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

166
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,260
Give it to me.

167
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,850
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

168
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,810
Where did you get this?

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,990
This is no toy.

170
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,820
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

171
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,870
And I don't want to be a lady.

172
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,160
Come here.

173
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,750
Now what do you want with this?

174
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,170
It's called Needle.

175
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,340
Oh, a blade with a name.

176
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,050
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

177
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,100
Your sister?

178
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,470
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

179
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,350
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

180
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,270
That's the essence of it.

181
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,280
I was trying to learn.

182
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,820
I asked Mycah to practice with me.

183
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,370
I asked him. It was my fault.

184
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,710
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

185
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,210
I hate them. I hate all of them.

186
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,590
The Hound, the queen and the king

187
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,260
and Joffrey and Sansa.

188
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,050
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

189
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,640
and asked to call the prince a liar.

190
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,270
So was I! He is a liar.

191
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,390
Shh, darling, listen to me.

192
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,520
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

193
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,280
She cannot betray him.

194
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,070
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

195
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,030
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

196
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,830
Well...

197
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,960
Look at me.

198
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,210
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

199
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,800
Winter is coming.

200
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,010
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

201
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,430
But now winter is truly coming.

202
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,520
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

203
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,020
look after one another.

204
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,400
Sansa is your sister.

205
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,860
I don't hate her.

206
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,940
Not really.

207
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,120
I don't want to frighten you,
but I won't lie to you either.

208
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,620
We've come to a dangerous place.

209
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,120
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

210
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
All right?

211
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,420
Go on. It's yours.

212
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,590
I can keep it?

213
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,640
Try not to stab your sister with it.

214
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,520
If you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

215
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

216
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,210
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

217
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,420
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.

218
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,090
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

219
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,090
Those were always your favorites.

220
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,510
Those weren't my favorites.

221
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,100
My favorites were the scary ones.

222
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,690
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

223
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Fear is for the winter,

224
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,400
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

225
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,910
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

226
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,990
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

227
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,750
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

228
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,040
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

229
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,760
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

230
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,720
Kings froze to death in their castles,

231
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,970
same as the shepherds in their huts.

232
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,810
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

233
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,230
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

234
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,860
So is this the sort of story that you like?

235
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,660
In that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.

236
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,740
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

237
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,960
riding their dead horses,

238
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,880
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

239
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,260
What are you telling him now?

240
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,720
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

241
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,390
Get your supper. I want some time with him.

242
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,320
One time she told me

243
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,650
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

244
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,530
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

245
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,740
Maybe we do.

246
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
How do you feel?

247
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
You still don't remember anything?

248
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,090
Bran, I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

249
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,010
In the wind, in the rain...

250
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,180
A thousand times.

251
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,510
- You never fall.
- I did though.

252
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,810
It's true, isn't it,

253
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,150
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

254
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,620
I'd rather be dead.

255
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,120
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

256
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,380
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

257
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,550
But still too many.

258
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,220
It's nine years since I've set foot
in the capital.

259
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,560
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came, either.

260
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,650
My lady.

261
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,940
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

262
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,860
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

263
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,110
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

264
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,990
Instructed?

265
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,700
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

266
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,450
Follow me, Lady Stark.

267
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,590
Cat!

268
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,010
Go on. Go upstairs.

269
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,930
You little worm!

270
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,190
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

271
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,690
Pssst!

272
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,200
I meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

273
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,280
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

274
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,870
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,500
I'm truly sorry... about the locale.

276
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,920
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

277
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,960
A dear friend told me.

278
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,510
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

279
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,600
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

280
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,100
Your poor hands.

281
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,180
How did you know I was coming?

282
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,650
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

283
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,940
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

284
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,900
My little birds are everywhere...

285
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,200
even in the North.

286
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,740
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

287
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,210
Valyrian steel.

288
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,050
Do you know whose dagger this is?

289
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,720
I must admit I do not.

290
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,300
Well, well, this is an historic day.

291
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,640
Something you don't know that I do.

292
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,850
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

293
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,940
- It's mine.
- Yours?

294
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,320
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

295
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,320
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

296
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,200
as any sane man would.

297
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,290
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
I lost this dagger.

298
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,500
To whom?

299
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,500
Tyrion Lannister.

300
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,840
The Imp.

301
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,550
Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

302
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,810
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

303
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,560
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

304
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,610
Pyp.

305
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,690
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

306
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,660
Next!

307
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,880
Next!

308
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,190
Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

309
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,490
Go clean yourselves up!

310
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,320
There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.

311
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,820
A charming man.

312
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,450
I don't need him to be charming.

313
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

314
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,120
into men of the Night's Watch.

315
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,590
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

316
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,210
Slowly.

317
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,760
A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.

318
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,140
Good news or bad?

319
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,850
Both.

320
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,440
Lord Stark.

321
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,360
I meant...
to give you this earlier.

322
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,650
So forgetful these days.

323
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,280
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

324
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,210
Good news?

325
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,180
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

326
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,310
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

327
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,690
Yes, I'm looking at you.

328
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,990
I thought that she'd be safest in here.

329
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,870
One of several such
establishments I own.

330
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,700
You're a funny man.

331
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,210
Huh? A very funny man.

332
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,710
Ned!

333
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,220
Ah, the Starks...

334
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,180
Quick tempers, slow minds.

335
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,900
You broke my nose, bastard!

336
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,280
It's an improvement.

337
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,370
If we threw you over the Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

338
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,750
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

339
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,550
What are you looking at, halfman?

340
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,220
I'm looking at you.

341
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,470
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

342
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,640
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

343
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,350
All of you.

344
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,600
And what do you care about our faces?

345
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,480
It's just...

346
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,570
I think they would look marvelous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

347
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,610
Perhaps I'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

348
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,200
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

349
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,460
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

350
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,920
No one but you.

351
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,590
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

352
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,800
Grenn's father left him too...

353
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,060
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

354
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,140
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

355
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,520
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

356
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,320
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

357
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,320
I've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

358
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,320
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

359
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,830
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

360
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,410
I don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

361
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,540
before they came here.

362
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,800
Oh...

363
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,970
Your brother Bran.

364
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,130
He's woken up.

365
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,510
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

366
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,850
would be considered treason.

367
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,180
We have proof. We have the blade.

368
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,310
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

369
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,900
The only man who could say otherwise
has no throat,

370
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,270
thanks to your boy's wolf.

371
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,150
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

372
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,620
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

373
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,200
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

374
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,040
A fool's task, admittedly,

375
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,710
but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

376
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,880
I won't forget this.

377
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,040
You're a true friend.

378
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,300
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

379
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,970
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

380
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,850
He's a child. Ten years old.

381
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,310
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

382
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,890
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

383
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,820
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

384
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,980
Then what are you raving about?

385
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,530
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

386
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,910
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

387
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,870
We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

388
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,080
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

389
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,830
They can write a ballad about us -

390
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,630
"The War For Cersei's Cunt. "

391
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,180
- Let me go.
- Never.

392
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,060
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

393
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,140
And if he does, I'll kill him.

394
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,600
Him, Ned Stark, the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,

395
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:18,190
until you and I are the only people
left in this world.

396
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,160
I wish I could see the girls.

397
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,460
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

398
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,750
Until we know who our enemies are.

399
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,960
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

400
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,960
In my bones, I know it.

401
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,970
Littlefinger's right.

402
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,890
I can't do anything without proof.

403
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,510
And if you find the proof?

404
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,680
Then I bring it to Robert...

405
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,480
and hope he's still the man I once knew.

406
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,400
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

407
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,820
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

408
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,440
My temper?

409
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,450
Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

410
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,080
He still loves you.

411
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,000
Does he?

412
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,230
Off with you.

413
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,600
Yes, it's been a long time.

414
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,220
But I still remember every face.

415
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
You remember your first?

416
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,480
Of course, Your Grace.

417
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,570
Who was it?

418
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,280
A Tyroshi.

419
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,110
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

420
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,450
How did you do it?

421
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,490
Lance through the heart.

422
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,330
Quick one.

423
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,080
Lucky for you.

424
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,960
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

425
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,050
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot,
slogging through the mud.

426
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,640
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

427
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,440
thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.

428
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,820
I knocked him down with the hammer.

429
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,280
Gods, I was strong then.

430
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,110
Caved in his breastplate.

431
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,530
Probably shattered every rib he had.

432
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,250
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

433
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,420
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait! Wait. "

434
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,720
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

435
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,140
They don't put that part in the songs.

436
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,100
Stupid boy.

437
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,440
Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

438
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,160
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

439
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,870
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

440
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,870
his sons would be ingrates,

441
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,460
and he'd be waking three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.

442
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,340
Wine!

443
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,470
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

444
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,100
Lancel Lannister.

445
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,350
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

446
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
What are you doing?

447
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,530
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?

448
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,450
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?!

449
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,740
So get more.

450
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,000
Tell your cousin to get in here.

451
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,170
Kingslayer! Get in here.

452
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,890
Surrounded by Lannisters.

453
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,730
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

454
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,190
and their smug, satisfied faces.

455
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,230
It must wound your pride, huh?

456
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,190
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.

457
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,530
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

458
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:24,210
forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

459
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,750
So come on.

460
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,840
We're telling war stories.

461
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,720
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

462
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,590
One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.

463
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,220
I was there that day.

464
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,390
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

465
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,350
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

466
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,610
Best move I ever saw.

467
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,980
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

468
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,240
Your outlaw...

469
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,780
any last words?

470
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,620
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.

471
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,620
What about Aerys Targaryen?

472
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,500
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

473
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,750
I never asked.

474
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,710
Did he call you a traitor?

475
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Did he plead for a reprieve?

476
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,350
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

477
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,220
"Burn them all. "

478
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,940
If that's all, Your Grace...

479
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,680
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

480
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,850
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

481
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,190
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

482
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,690
From whom?

483
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,400
If you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

484
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,320
pay tribute or fight.

485
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,150
An easy choice for most.

486
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,620
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

487
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,160
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

488
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,660
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

489
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,540
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months

490
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,630
and need the practice.

491
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,680
Tell them all to stop.

492
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,930
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

493
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,810
Until I command them otherwise.

494
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,690
You're learning to talk like a queen.

495
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,730
Not a queen.

496
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,690
A khaleesi.

497
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,730
You dare!

498
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,150
You give commands to me? To me?

499
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,740
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

500
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,620
I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?

501
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,670
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

502
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,290
No.

503
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,380
Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.

504
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,050
Please. Please, don't hurt him.

505
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,980
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.

506
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,110
Huh?

507
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,290
Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!

508
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,290
I am your king!

509
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,460
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?

510
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,780
Uh uh uh uh uh.

511
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,780
You... walk.

512
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,390
I wanted to be here
when you saw it for the first time.

513
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,860
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

514
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,160
I'm the First Ranger.

515
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,620
My job is out there.

516
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,870
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

517
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,830
The kind I don't want to believe.

518
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm ready. I won't let you down.

519
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,510
You're not going.

520
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,760
You're no ranger, Jon.

521
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,510
- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no one!

522
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,560
Here...

523
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,900
a man gets what he earns,

524
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,110
when he earns it.

525
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,240
We'll speak when I return.

526
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,920
- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?

527
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,470
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart,

528
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,100
all fried in his own fat.

529
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,770
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

530
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,400
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

531
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,570
And how do a bear's balls taste?

532
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,900
A bit chewy.

533
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,240
And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

534
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,950
Do Dornish girls count?

535
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,290
So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves

536
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
and bring them here as eager recruits?

537
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,210
Aye.

538
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,300
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.

539
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,300
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

540
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,260
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

541
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,520
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

542
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,270
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?

543
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,650
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army of jesters in black?

544
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,820
You don't have enough men
to be an army

545
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:02,570
and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

546
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,330
I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

547
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,200
when you're back in King's Landing.

548
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,920
It's something to think about
while you're drinking your wine down there,

549
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
enjoying your brothels.

550
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,460
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

551
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,760
Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,

552
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,510
might be sickness,

553
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,310
might just be the cold.

554
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,180
They die in pain.

555
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,850
And they do it...

556
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:36,110
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

557
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,740
Do you think I'm plump?

558
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,660
- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.

559
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,040
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.

560
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,210
I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.

561
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,790
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

562
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,880
You know, my brother once told me...

563
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,510
that nothing someone says
before the word "but" really counts.

564
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,260
But...

565
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,310
I don't believe that giants and ghouls
and white walkers

566
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,220
are lurking beyond the Wall.

567
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,400
I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings

568
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,230
is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened

569
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,440
to live on the right side of it.

570
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,360
You're right.

571
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,200
The wildlings are no different from us.

572
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,080
A little rougher maybe.

573
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,870
But they're made of meat and bone.

574
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,540
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

575
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,380
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

576
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,090
You've never been north of the Wall,
so don't tell me what's out there.

577
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,640
Are you going below?

578
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,520
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

579
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,350
Oh, I always do.

580
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,740
I think he's starting to like me.

581
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,910
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

582
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,790
Into the tunnel and out the other side.

583
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,500
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

584
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,800
So... you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

585
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,470
Aye, day after tomorrow.

586
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,310
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

587
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:34,560
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

588
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,810
I, er...

589
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,650
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.

590
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,650
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.

591
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,150
No one turns away a Lannister.

592
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,010
Yes, Khaleesi.

593
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,010
Oh, what are you doing?

594
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,640
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

595
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,100
You change, Khaleesi.

596
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,900
It's a blessing from the Great Stallion

597
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,320
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade is a good thing,

598
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,160
easier to handle.

599
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,160
It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.

600
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,460
But a man in full plate...

601
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,670
...the arakh won't get through the steel.

602
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,000
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

603
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,010
Designed for piercing plate.

604
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,430
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

605
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,470
Armor.
Armor.

606
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,230
Armor make a man, erm...

607
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,310
Slow.

608
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,020
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

609
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,190
My father taught me how to fight.

610
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,700
He taught me that speed defeats size.

611
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,580
I've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.

612
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,040
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

613
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,500
And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?

614
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,050
He still is.

615
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,550
A man of great honor

616
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,510
and I betrayed him.

617
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,720
The Khaleesi wants
to eat something different tonight.

618
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,850
Kill some rabbits.

619
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,020
There are no rabbits.

620
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,860
Find some ducks, she likes ducks.

621
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,440
Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.

622
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,900
Do you have eyes in your head?
Do you?

623
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,110
Dog then.
I have seen many dogs.

624
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,580
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

625
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,620
The khaleesi have baby inside her.

626
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,500
It is true. She does not bleed
for two moons.

627
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,960
Her belly start to swell.

628
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,130
A blessing from the Great Stallion.

629
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,260
She does not want to eat horse.

630
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,100
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

631
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,940
I need to ride to Qohor.

632
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,910
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

633
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,240
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

634
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,740
The horde's easy to find.

635
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,630
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.

636
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,730
Except for you. You move too much.

637
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,390
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

638
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,990
How many winters
have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

639
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,320
Eight. No, nine.

640
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,870
All of them brief?

641
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,040
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

642
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,210
This summer has lasted nine.

643
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,540
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

644
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,000
The Starks are always right eventually -

645
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,550
winter is coming.

646
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,510
This one will be long...

647
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,550
and dark things will come with it.

648
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,270
We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.

649
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,730
They're fleeing south.

650
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,940
The ones who flee...
say they've seen the white walkers.

651
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,320
Yes, and the fishermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

652
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,910
One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.

653
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:01,030
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

654
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,580
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

655
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,080
and what lies beyond.

656
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:13,800
And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

657
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,510
There are less than a thousand of us now.

658
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,350
We can't man the other castles on the Wall.

659
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,430
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.

660
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,940
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

661
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,980
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

662
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,320
Tell her... we need help.

663
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:41,240
When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.

664
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,600
It's a boy.

665
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,360
How do you know?

666
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,740
I know.

667
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,440
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

668
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,270
It's either me or this cold,

669
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,650
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

670
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,530
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

671
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,860
I expect I will.

672
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,120
Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.

673
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
If you see my brother Bran,

674
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,000
tell him I miss him.

675
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,250
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

676
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,630
Of course.

677
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,170
He'll never walk again.

678
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,090
If you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

679
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,590
You take care, Snow.

680
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,550
Farewell, my lord.

681
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,860
You are late, boy.

682
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,240
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

683
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,620
Who are you?

684
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,540
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

685
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,290
Tomorrow you will catch it.

686
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,210
Now pick it up.

687
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,970
That is not the way, boy.

688
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,180
It is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

689
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,270
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

690
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,140
to make you strong.

691
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,640
Just so.

692
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,060
One hand is all that is needed.

693
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,440
Now you are standing all wrong.

694
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,900
Turn your body sideface.

695
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,280
Yes.

696
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,620
So.

697
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,030
You are skinny. That is good.

698
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,950
The target is smaller.

699
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,160
Now the grip - let me see.

700
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,920
Yes.

701
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,670
The grip must be delicate.

702
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,590
What if I drop it?

703
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,050
The steel must be part of your arm.

704
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,800
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

705
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,970
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

706
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,810
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

707
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,650
I'm a girl.

708
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:03,150
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

709
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,610
That is the grip.

710
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,700
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

711
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,160
A needle.

712
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,910
Ahhh.

713
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,460
Just so.

714
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,330
Now we will begin the dance.

715
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,880
Remember, child,

716
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,840
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...

717
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,760
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

718
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,550
This is the Braavos dance...

719
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,020
the water dance.

720
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,310
It is swift...

721
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,600
and sudden.

722
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,320
All men are made of water.

723
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,150
Do you know this?

724
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,530
If you pierce them,

725
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,280
the water leaks out and they die.

726
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,790
Now you will try to strike me.

727
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,670
Ha!

728
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,850
Up!

729
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,350
Ha!

730
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,950
Ah.

731
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,030
Dead.

732
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,120
Oh!

733
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,870
Dead.

734
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,790
Hup!

735
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,420
Very dead.

736
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,340
Come.

737
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,090
Ah ah ah!

738
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,970
Hup!

739
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,550
Again, faster.

740
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,940
Ah.
