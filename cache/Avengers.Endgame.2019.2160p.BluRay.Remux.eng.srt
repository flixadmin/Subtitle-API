I can tell you where Thanos is.

209
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,113
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

210
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,785
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

211
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,038
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

212

I'd ask...

00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,834
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

214
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,337
And his answer
was always the same.

215

"To the Garden."

216

Thanos has a retirement plan.

So, where is he?

218
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,058
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

219
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,227
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

What if there was a way...

490
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,563
that we could enter

about a time machine?

497
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,618
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

498
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:33,828
This is more like a...

499
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,790
Yeah. Like a time machine.

500
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,750
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

501
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,961
(STAMMERS) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

502
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,295
There's gotta be...

503
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,422
some way... (SIGHS)

504
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,299
- It's crazy.
- NATASHA: Scott.

505
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,759
I get emails from a raccoon...

506
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,928
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

507
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,764
So, who do we talk to
about this?

508
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,117
Chow time!

509
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:16,620
Maguna.

510
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,293
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

511
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,336
Define "lunch"

512
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,671
- or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

513
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,549
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

514
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,050
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

515
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,218
I'm making for Mom.

516
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,558
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

517
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,643
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

518
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,520
- No.
- That's what you want.

519
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,814
How did you find this?

520
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,816
- Garage.
- Really?

521
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,985
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

522
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,738
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

523
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,656
You like
going in the garage, huh?

524
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,742
So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)

525
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,661
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

526
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,624
So, I'm gonna...

527
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,685
(STAMMERS) No.
We know what it sounds like.

528
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,811
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

529
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:23,896
is anything really impossible?

530
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,190
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

531
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:28,025
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

532
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,151
Can we agree on that?

533
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,402
Thank you.

534
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,696
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

535
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,281
- I did.
- No.

536
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,325
You accidentally survived.
(SIGHS)

537
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,577
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

538
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,830
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

539
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,209
A time heist?

540
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,503
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

541
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,796
Why didn't we think
of this before?

542
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,423
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

543
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,676
The stones are in the past.

544
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,094
We could go back,
we could get them.

545
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,554
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

546
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,640
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

547
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:00,808
I don't believe we would.

548
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,936
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

549
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,522
However, high hopes
won't help...

550
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,649
if there's no logical,
tangible way

551
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:12,194
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

552
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,238
I believe
the most likely outcome

553
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,322
will be our collective demise.

554
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:18,242
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

555
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:21,078
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

556
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,705
no betting on sporting events.

557
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,623
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

558
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,917
Are you seriously telling me

559
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,794
that your plan
to save the universe...

560
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,629
is based on Back to the Future?

561
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,507
- Is it?
- No.

562
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,717
Good. You had me
worried there.

563
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,843
'Cause that would be horseshit.

564
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,304
That's not how
quantum physics works.

565
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,638
Tony.

566
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,058
We have to take a stand.

567
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,602
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

568
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,231
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

569
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,276
You got a wife, a daughter.

570
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,945
But I lost someone
very important to me.

571
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,697
A lotta people did.

572
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,867
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

573
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:01,201
to bring everyone back,

574
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,786
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

575
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,663
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

576
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,708
- I can't.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

577
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,126
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

578
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,212
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

579
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,715
Good job. I'm saved.

580
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,509
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

581
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,719
Anything else.

582
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,596
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

583
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,056
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

584
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,640
Tony. I get it.

585
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,101
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

586
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,395
But this is a second chance.

587
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,523
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

588
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,233
Can't roll the dice on it.

589
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,237
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

590
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:41,700
Well, he's scared.

591
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,494
STEVE: He's not wrong.

592
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,662
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

593
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,039
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

594
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,958
No, I wanna do it right.

595
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,838
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

596
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,091
Bigger than his?

597
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,385
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

598
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,511
Try some of that.

599
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:01,595
Have some eggs.

600
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,430
I'm so confused.

601
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,265
These are confusing times.
(CHUCKLES)

602
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,267
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

603
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,937
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

604
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,314
I know, it's crazy.

605
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,690
I'm wearing shirts now.

606
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,693
Yeah. What? How? Why?

607
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,488
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

608
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:21,740
Except it was worse for me...

609
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,117
'cause I lost twice.

610
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,077
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

611
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,287
and then, we all lost.

612
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,622
No one blamed you, Bruce.

613
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,165
I did.

614
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,168
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

615
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,378
like he's
some kind of disease...

616
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,921
something to get rid of.

617
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,341
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

618
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,052
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

619
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,805
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

620
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,223
and now, look at me.

621
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,600
Best of both worlds.

622
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,686
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

623
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,187
Can we get a photo?

624
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,606
100%, little person.

625
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,817
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

626
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,278
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- SMART HULK: Thanks.

627
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,946
Say "green."

628
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,365
- FANS: Green.
- Green.

629
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,450
Did you get that?

630
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,868
That's a good one.

631
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,912
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

632
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,501
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

633
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:15,752
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

634
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,546
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

635
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,714
BOY 1: Stranger danger.

636
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,340
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

637
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,425
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

638
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,634
But come on. The kid...

639
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,136
I don't want a picture
with them.

640
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,304
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

641
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,722
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

642
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,348
SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
BOY 2: We can do it.

643
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,476
- SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

644
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,768
SMART HULK: Okay.

645
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:32,853
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

646
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,605
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

647
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,440
ALL: Hulk out!

648
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,649
STEVE: Bruce.

649
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,067
Dab.

650
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,028
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

651
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,404
She knows better.

652
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,239
About what we were saying.

653
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,616
Right.

654
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,245

00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:08,903
No, you're being very Hulky.

982
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:09,987
I'm being careful.

983
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,530
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

984
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,948
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

985
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,283
out of existence, this is it.

986
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:16,118
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

987
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,204
- Scott, calm down.
- SCOTT: Sorry.

988
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:21,499
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

989
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:22,708
No do-overs.

990
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,086
Plus two test runs.

991
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,588
- (SUIT FASTENING)
- (YELLS)

992
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,091
One test run.

993
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,342
(SIGHS)

994
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,010
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

995
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,470
BARTON: I'm game.

996
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:38,432
I'll do it.

997
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,226
SMART HULK:
Clint, now you're gonna feel

998
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,811
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

999
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:42,895
Don't worry about that.

1000
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,105
RHODES: Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

1001
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,898
If we can do this, you know...

1002
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,401
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

1003
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,735
You know, and...

1004
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:54,824
First of all, that's horrible.

1005
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:55,908
It's Thanos.

1006
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,077
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

1007
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,413
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

1008
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,956
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

1009
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,290
before Thanos gets them...

1010
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,210
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

1011
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,212
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

1012
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,296
Well, that's what I heard.

1013
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,506
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

1014
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,466
Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...

1015
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,218
- Time After Time.
- Quantum Leap.

1016
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:15,428
Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.

1017
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:16,512
Hot Tub Time Machine.

1018
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,638
Hot Tub Time Machine.

1019
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:18,973
Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.

1020
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,225
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

1021
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,227
Die Hard.
No, that's not one.

1022
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:24,437
This is known.

1023
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:25,813
I don't know
why everyone believes that,

1024
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:26,939
but that isn't true.

1025
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,024
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

1026
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,527
that past becomes your future...

1027
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:34,655
and your former present
becomes the past...

1028
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,450
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

1029
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,826
Exactly.

1030
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,288
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

1031
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,169
- All right, Clint.
- (BEEPING)

1032
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:51,338
We're going in three, two...

1033
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,506
one.

1034
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:57,470
(GRUNTS)

1035
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,519
(YELLING)

1036
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,106
(PANTING)

1037
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:10,900
(GASPS)

1038
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:33,756
(CONTINUES PANTING)

1039
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,205
LILA: Cooper?

1040
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,915
Where are my headphones?

1041
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:08,999
Lila?

1042
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,210
- COOPER: I never had them.
- Lila?

1043
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,294
(BEEPING)

1044
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:14,004
LILA: Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

1045
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:15,881
Lila! Lila!

1046
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:22,388
Yeah, Dad?

1047
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,309
Dad?

1048
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,063
Lila!

1049
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,690
(GRUNTING)

1050
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,363
Hey. Hey, look at me.

1051
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,656
You okay?

1052
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,409
Yeah. Yeah. (PANTING)

1053
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,495
It worked.

1054
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,623
It worked.

1055
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,587
STEVE: Okay, so the how works.

1056
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:58,299
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

1057
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,926
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

1058
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,761
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1059
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,430
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

1060
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:05,681
for "damn near been killed"

1061
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,182
by one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1062
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,517
Well, I haven't...

1063
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:09,602
but I don't even know

1064
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:11,020
what the hell
you're all talking about.

1065
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,064
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

1066
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,941
for one round-trip each.

1067
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,318
And these stones have been

1068
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,320
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1069
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,779
Our history.

1070
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,949
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1071
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,910
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1072
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:27,620
Correct.

1073
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:30,581
So, let's start with the Aether.

1074
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:31,957
Thor, what do you know?

1075
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:38,756
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

1076
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,467
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1077
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,221
Uh, where to start? Um...

1078
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:50,434
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1079
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:52,728
Someone called it
a stone before.

1080
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:58,108
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1081
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,902
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1082
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,153
and stop saying that.

1083
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:04,156
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1084
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,200
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1085
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:09,870
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1086
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:12,748
Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Scary beings.

1087
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,625
So, Jane, actually...

1088
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:16,752
Oh, there she is.

1089
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,589
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1090
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:24,802
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1091
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:27,805
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1092
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,015
and she became very, very sick.

1093
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,059
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1094
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,310
which is where I'm from...

1095
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,437
and we had to try and fix her.

1096
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:37,231
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1097
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:40,776
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1098
01:03:42,111 --> 01:03:44,154
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

1099
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,074
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1100
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,076
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1101
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,160
(MOUTHING)

1102
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:51,412
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1103
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:52,871
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1104
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:54,790
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1105
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,500
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1106
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,002
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

1107
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,046
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1108
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,257
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1109
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:05,551
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1110
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,346
- SMART HULK: Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1111
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,432
Quill was a person.

1112
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,518
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1113
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,103
Oh, look.

1114
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,897
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1115
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,234
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1116
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:23,527
I'll take you to space.

1117
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,822
NEBULA: Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1118
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,949
What is Vormir?

1119
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:30,284
NEBULA: A dominion of death...

1120
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:32,870
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1121
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,792
It's where
Thanos murdered my sister.

1122
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,048
(STEVE SIGHS)

1123
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,258
Not it.

1124
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,636
NATASHA: That Time Stone guy.
SMART HULK: Doctor Strange.

1125
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,597
NATASHA: Yeah,
what kind of doctor was he?

1126
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,724
TONY: Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1127
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:55,267
SMART HULK: Nice place
in the Village, though.

1128
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,935
TONY: Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1129
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:58,145
SMART HULK:
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1130
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,354
Wait, he lived in New York?

1131
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:00,981
TONY: No, he lived in Toronto.

1132
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,107
Uh, yeah,
on Bleecker and Sullivan.

1133
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:03,192
Have you been listening
to anything?

1134
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,276
Guys.

1135
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,028
If you pick the right year,

1136
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,738
there are three stones
in New York.

1137
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:11,909
Shut the front door.

1138
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,789
STEVE: All right.

No...

1513

Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1938
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:44,394
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1939
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,895
RED SKULL: Welcome.

1940
01:48:49,065 --> 01:48:50,400
Natasha.

1941
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:51,567
Daughter of Ivan.

1942
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:54,028
Clint.

1943
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:56,489
Son of Edith.

1944
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,329
Who are you?

1945
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:06,416
Consider me a guide...

1946
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:08,251
to you...

1947
01:49:08,418 --> 01:49:10,253
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1948
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,462
Oh, good.

1949
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,756
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1950
01:49:14,549 --> 01:49:16,175
(SPEAKS GERMAN)

1951
01:49:17,677 --> 01:49:19,929
If only it were that easy.

1952
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:35,737
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1953
01:49:36,988 --> 01:49:39,407
As does what you fear.

1954
01:49:44,328 --> 01:49:46,205
The stone's down there.

1955
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:48,750
RED SKULL: For one of you.

1956
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:50,752
For the other...

1957
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:55,339
In order to take the stone...

1958
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:58,509
you must lose
that which you love.

1959
01:49:59,886 --> 01:50:03,055
An everlasting exchange.

1960
01:50:04,056 --> 01:50:08,144
A soul for a soul.

1961
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:13,316
BARTON: How's it going?
(CHUCKLES)

1962
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:16,944
Jesus.

1963
01:50:17,278 --> 01:50:18,988
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1964
01:50:19,864 --> 01:50:21,199
No.

1965
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:23,034
I don't think so.

1966
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:25,912
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1967
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:28,456
I didn't.

1968
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:32,335
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1969
01:50:33,002 --> 01:50:34,545
without his daughter.

1970
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:36,798
That's not a coincidence.

1971
01:50:37,882 --> 01:50:39,509
Yeah.

1972
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:43,095
Whatever it takes.

1973
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,101
Whatever it takes.

1974
01:50:53,481 --> 01:50:55,441
If we don't get that stone...

1975
01:50:55,608 --> 01:50:57,276
billions of people stay dead.

1976
01:50:58,152 --> 01:50:59,320
Yeah.

1977
01:51:01,197 --> 01:51:03,324
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1978
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:05,243
I guess we do.

1979
01:51:13,668 --> 01:51:15,795
I'm starting to think we mean

1980
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:18,381
different people here, Natasha.

1981
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:20,716
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1982
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,134
Get to right here.

1983
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,303
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1984
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:26,681
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1985
01:51:26,848 --> 01:51:28,850
What, you think I wanna do it?

1986
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:31,185
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1987
01:51:31,352 --> 01:51:33,688
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1988
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:36,816
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1989
01:51:38,484 --> 01:51:40,278
You know what I've become.

1990
01:51:42,405 --> 01:51:44,991
Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1991
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:50,413
Maybe you should.

1992
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:52,832
You didn't.

1993
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:01,215
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1994
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:13,519
Okay.

1995
01:52:15,271 --> 01:52:16,772
You win.

1996
01:52:20,401 --> 01:52:21,903
(GRUNTING)

1997
01:52:23,237 --> 01:52:24,405
Tell my family I love 'em.

1998
01:52:25,573 --> 01:52:26,699
(GRUNTING)

1999
01:52:28,117 --> 01:52:29,327
You tell 'em yourself.

2000
01:52:29,577 --> 01:52:30,578
(GROANS)

2001
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:38,920
(GRUNTS)

2002
01:52:55,937 --> 01:52:57,313
(BOTH GRUNTING)

2003
01:53:02,193 --> 01:53:03,194
Damn you.

2004
01:53:09,033 --> 01:53:10,034
(GRUNTS)

2005
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:11,702
Wait.

2006
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:21,587
Let me go.

2007
01:53:22,838 --> 01:53:23,839
No.

2008
01:53:25,591 --> 01:53:26,592
No. Please, no.

2009
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:31,806
It's okay.

2010
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:34,850
Please.

2011
01:53:36,936 --> 01:53:37,937
No!

2012
01:54:38,247 --> 01:54:40,332
(PANTING)

2013
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:55,139
(SOBBING)

2014
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:20,414
Did we get 'em all?

2015
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,626
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

2016
01:55:28,464 --> 01:55:29,673
Clint, where's Nat?

2017
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,807
(GASPS SOFTLY)

2018
01:55:58,911 --> 01:55:59,912
Do we know if she had family?

2019
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,248
Yeah.

2020
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:03,415
Us.

2021
01:56:04,834 --> 01:56:05,876
What?

2022
01:56:06,752 --> 01:56:07,753
Huh?

2023
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:09,088
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

2024
01:56:09,171 --> 01:56:10,422
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

2025
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:11,715
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

2026
01:56:11,799 --> 01:56:13,050
We have the stones, right?

2027
01:56:13,217 --> 01:56:14,218
As long as we have the stones...

2028
01:56:14,385 --> 01:56:16,137
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

2029
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:18,305
So, stop this shit. We're the
Avengers. Get it together.

2030
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:19,682
Can't get her back.

2031
01:56:22,685 --> 01:56:23,936
What's he...?
What?

2032
01:56:24,103 --> 01:56:25,312
It can't be undone.

2033
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:27,606
It can't.

2034
01:56:28,274 --> 01:56:29,608
(LAUGHS)

2035
01:56:30,109 --> 01:56:31,485
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

2036
01:56:31,569 --> 01:56:33,237
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

2037
01:56:33,404 --> 01:56:34,697
And we're talking
about space magic.

2038
01:56:34,864 --> 01:56:36,866
And "can't" seems very
definitive. Don't you think?

2039
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:38,409
Yeah, look,
I know that I'm way outside

2040
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:39,869
my pay grade here.

2041
01:56:40,035 --> 01:56:41,495
But she still
isn't here, is she?

2042
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:42,663
THOR: No, that's my point.

2043
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:45,791
It can't be undone.

2044
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:47,376
Or that's at least

2045
01:56:47,459 --> 01:56:49,295
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

2046
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,921
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

2047
01:56:51,088 --> 01:56:54,133
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

2048
01:57:02,683 --> 01:57:04,727
It was supposed to be me.

2049
01:57:06,979 --> 01:57:09,273
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

2050
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,900
She bet her life on it.

2051
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:12,484
(GRUNTS)

2052
01:57:15,821 --> 01:57:18,157
She's not coming back.

2053
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,410
We have to make it worth it.

2054
01:57:21,994 --> 01:57:23,454
We have to.

2055
01:57:24,872 --> 01:57:26,540
We will.

2056
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,358
Boom!

2057
01:57:53,067 --> 01:57:55,027
(CHUCKLES MISCHIEVOUSLY)

2058
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:59,490
All right, the glove's ready.

2059
01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:02,868
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

2060
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:05,120
- I'll do it.
- TONY: Excuse me?

2061
01:58:05,246 --> 01:58:06,288
THOR: It's okay.

2062
01:58:06,372 --> 01:58:07,373
TONY: Stop, stop. Slow down.

2063
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:08,958
Thor. Just wait.

2064
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,960
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

2065
01:58:11,335 --> 01:58:12,920
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

2066
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:14,255
waiting for
the right opportunity?

2067
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,547
We should at least discuss it.

2068
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:17,675
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

2069
01:58:17,758 --> 01:58:19,551
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

2070
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:22,096
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?

2071
01:58:22,179 --> 01:58:23,514
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

2072
01:58:23,681 --> 01:58:24,890
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

2073
01:58:25,057 --> 01:58:26,850
- It's not about that.
- It's not that. (SHUSHES)

2074
01:58:27,017 --> 01:58:28,811
- TONY: Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

2075
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:33,315
Just let me do it.

2076
01:58:33,482 --> 01:58:35,985
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

2077
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,152
Look, it's not just the fact...

2078
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:38,445
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

2079
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:39,446
to light up a continent.

2080
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:41,615
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

2081
01:58:41,782 --> 01:58:44,827
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

2082
01:58:44,994 --> 01:58:46,036
Cheez Whiz?

2083
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,581
Lightning.

2084
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:50,874
- Yeah.
- Lightning.

2085
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:52,418
SMART HULK:
Lightning won't help you, pal.

2086
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:54,420
It's gotta be me.

2087
01:58:55,754 --> 01:58:57,923
You saw what those stones
did to Thanos.

2088
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,633
They almost killed him.

2089
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:02,928
None of you could survive.

2090
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:05,264
STEVE: How do we know
you will?

2091
01:59:05,431 --> 01:59:06,473
SMART HULK: We don't.

2092
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:09,310
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

2093
01:59:12,813 --> 01:59:14,398
It's like...

2094
01:59:16,275 --> 01:59:18,193
I was made for this.

2095
01:59:37,129 --> 01:59:38,630
Good to go, yeah?

2096
01:59:40,758 --> 01:59:41,759
Let's do it.

2097
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:43,302
Okay, remember,

2098
01:59:43,385 --> 01:59:44,970
everyone Thanos snapped away

four...

2595
02:44:40,538 --> 02:44:42,373
three, two...

2596
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:43,875
one.

2597
02:44:51,132 --> 02:44:52,133
Where is he?

2598
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:54,052
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2599
02:44:54,218 --> 02:44:55,678
He should be here.

2600
02:45:01,184 --> 02:45:02,101
SAM: Get him back.

2601
02:45:02,268 --> 02:45:03,394
SMART HULK: I'm trying.
SAM: Get him the hell back.

2602
02:45:03,561 --> 02:45:05,438
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

2603
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:31,005
Go ahead.

2604
02:45:48,981 --> 02:45:49,732
Cap?

2605
02:45:52,068 --> 02:45:53,820
Hi, Sam.

2606
02:45:56,823 --> 02:45:59,867
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2607
02:46:01,994 --> 02:46:05,832
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2608
02:46:06,958 --> 02:46:08,292
maybe...

2609
02:46:08,793 --> 02:46:13,589
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2610
02:46:15,591 --> 02:46:17,718
How'd that work out for ya?

2611
02:46:20,221 --> 02:46:21,639
It was beautiful.

2612
02:46:22,974 --> 02:46:24,684
Good. I'm happy for you.

2613
02:46:24,851 --> 02:46:25,893
Truly.

2614
02:46:26,644 --> 02:46:27,937
Thank you.

2615
02:46:29,272 --> 02:46:30,523
Only thing bumming me out...

2616
02:46:30,690 --> 02:46:32,275
is the fact
I have to live in a world

2617
02:46:32,358 --> 02:46:34,277
without Captain America.

2618
02:46:34,861 --> 02:46:36,028
STEVE: Oh.

2619
02:46:38,072 --> 02:46:40,867
That reminds me.

2620
02:46:49,375 --> 02:46:50,585
Try it on.

2621
02:47:16,110 --> 02:47:17,612
How does it feel?

2622
02:47:20,198 --> 02:47:21,908
Like it's someone else's.

2623
02:47:24,952 --> 02:47:26,120
It isn't.

Thank you.

2626
02:47:42,762 --> 02:47:44,055
I'll do my best.

2627
02:47:49,435 --> 02:47:51,354
That's why it's yours.

2628
02:47:53,064 --> 02:47:54,440
You wanna tell me about her?

2629
02:48:01,030 --> 02:48:02,531
No.

2630
02:48:02,949 --> 02:48:05,076
No, I don't think I will.
