1
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,249
(Gasps) Ah!

2
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,817
Is it Halloween
already?

3
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,053
You forgot, didn't you?

4
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,856
Tonight's the school play.
I'm Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,424
It's my big debut!

6
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,659
Oh, I am sorry, Jade,

7
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,262
bu the university
asked uncle and me

8
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,065
to explore
the subterranean city
underneath the streets.

9
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,233
Uh-huh.

10
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,601
No, it's true.

11
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:38,003
A recent tremor
has opened a passageway

12
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,472
to parts of San Francisco
which have been buried

13
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,608
since the 1906 earthquake.

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,577
Another tremor may
collapse the passageway
at any moment,

15
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,279
so there's not much time.

16
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,415
But...My play.

17
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,284
Oh, I am sorry.
I would rather
see your play,

18
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,086
but I have to
do this now.

19
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,855
And I cannot be
in 2 places
at the same time.

20
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,693
Uh, that's ok.
I understand.

21
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,163
Your work
is pretty important.

22
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,572
Huh?

23
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,908
Why do I need
the tiger talisman?

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,288
2 jackies can be
in 2 places at once.

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,656
(Stretching) Ahh!

26
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,658
All right!
The tiger is free.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,326
Free to be me!

28
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,527
Ahh!

29
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,129
You know how lame it is

30
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,498
being trapped
in the same body with him?

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,934
Oh, no!
This is a big mistake!

32
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,136
We should not be
2 jackies.

33
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,704
See what I mean?

34
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,606
Outta my way--pussycat!

35
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,144
I am very disappointed
in you, Jade.

36
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:55,147
You know that playing
with magic is a no-no.

37
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,682
Ha! A no-no?

38
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,350
Oh, no!

39
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,285
Say it ain't so!

40
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,322
We should turn ourselves
back into one Jackie
right away.

41
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,656
Not gonna happen.

42
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,092
Uncle: Jackie,
open the door!

43
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,128
This bag is heavy!

44
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,763
Uncle! He will
agree with me.

45
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,700
No! He'll see you guys!

46
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:17,569
Open up!
Uncle is not
in a mood for games!

47
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,659
(Doorknob rattles)

48
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,394
Uncle: Jackie!

49
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,802
Where is Jackie?

50
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,337
I thought I heard him.

51
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,473
Um...He's packing.

52
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,643
So, uncle, did you
pick up my cape
from the klean-o-Max?

53
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,045
Cape? What cape?

54
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,247
Tch! The school play!

55
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:38,083
If I don't have a cape,
my big debut
will be ruined!

56
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,819
I'll be ruined!
Everything
will be ruined!

57
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,555
Ok, ok! You are
making my brain hurt.

58
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,226
Tell Jackie to be ready
for our journey
when I return.

59
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,994
Deal.

60
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,566
Nice save, jadester.

61
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,236
Our journey?
Uncle's going
underground, too?

62
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,706
Isn't anyone
gonna come see me be
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

63
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,708
I would love to!

64
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,978
Oh, the theater,
the theater!

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,847
Uh-oh. No way I'm
showing up at school
with him.

66
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,849
I know exactly
how you feel.

67
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,251
Good! Come on!

68
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,022
Huh? But what about me?

69
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,523
Uncle: Jackie!

70
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,125
You are still
not ready?

71
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,927
We are going
to go now!

72
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,198
And why did you
not tell me

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,600
that you already
picked up Jade's
cape?

74
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,803
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

75
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,943
(Gasp)

76
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,846
A city
suspended in time.

77
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,423
"The bizzaritorium"?

78
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,559
I have read about
this place.

79
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,403
It is a museum
of strange things
from around the world.

80
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,107
Oof. Excuse me--

81
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,962
I'm free...

82
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,864
To be me!

83
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,071
Amazing.
Simply amazing!

84
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,372
Uncle!

85
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,907
What was that?!

86
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,677
"Spring-heel Jack."

87
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,481
Throughout history,
there have been many tales
of a ravenous troll

88
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,817
who could leap
great distances.

89
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,753
The founder of this museum,
Simon magus,

90
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:59,057
must have used magic
to capture the creature.

91
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,692
And now he is loose!

92
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,494
I'm so sorry, uncle!

93
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,030
I will put
the Jack back,
right away!

94
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,434
Wha-ha!

95
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,875
Yoo-hoo!
Mr. spring-heel Jack!

96
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,510
Excuse me!

97
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,546
I must ask you
to return to the museum.

98
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,317
Simon magus
tried to stop me.

99
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,319
He gave me quite a run.

100
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,721
But I shall dine
on his descendants

101
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,759
one by one by...One.

102
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,229
Aah!

103
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,730
(Sniffing)

104
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,633
Are you helping magus?
A relative, perhaps?

105
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,934
(Sniff sniff)

106
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,938
No. I guess the two of you
are just a pair of saps.

107
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,346
Uncle,
are you all right?

108
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,047
Do not worry
about me.

109
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,983
Worry about
the magus family.

110
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,585
They are
in grave danger.

111
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,722
And so...

112
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,624
Dr. Jekyll believed

113
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,928
that he could separate
the good from the evil
in man.

114
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,897
(Softly)
Nice read, Simone.

115
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,065
With this potion,

116
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,568
I will prove
my scientific theories
to the world!

117
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,737
But what if I'm wrong?

118
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,173
Heavens! The results
could be disastrous!

119
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,908
Come on, doc!

120
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,376
Pick up the pace!

121
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:27,913
Turn into Mr. Hyde
and terrorize
the town already!

122
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,414
(Softly)
You think you could
do better?

123
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,882
Don't mind if I do.

124
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,056
(Coughs and gags)

125
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,558
This tastes terrible.

126
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,659
(Gagging)

127
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,227
I shouldn't have
brought the tiger.

128
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,464
Spring-heel Jack:
Ha ha ha ha ha!

129
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,408
(Sniffing)

130
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,410
Magus, magus,
wherever you are,

131
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,612
spring-heel Jack
will not be far.

132
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,681
Ah hah hah hah hah!

133
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,816
Do not worry!

134
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,586
He's just, uh...
My dog!

135
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,554
Well, that's
one ugly dog.

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
(Sniff sniff sniff)

137
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,863
Jackie,
do something!

138
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,638
Foolish mortals.
You won't capture me...

139
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,076
Which is more than can
be said for either of thee!

140
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,148
Spring-heel Jack
needs a time-out.

141
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,062
(Audience laughing)

142
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,265
Simone: Um, uh...Dr. Jekyll
wanted to be good,

143
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,034
but he soon lost
control of himself

144
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,104
to his evil side,
uh, Mr. Hyde!

145
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,473
This potion is wonderful!

146
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:06,411
Evil Hyde is much cooler
than old goody-goody
Jekyll! Ha ha ha!

147
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,146
(Audience laughs)

148
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,615
Uh, Jade, isn't that
your uncle?

149
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,750
Uh...Maybe.

150
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,486
(Cell phone rings)

151
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:18,790
Jade, I accidentally
released an evil troll
named spring-heel Jack.

152
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:19,858
Cool!

153
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,893
And he attacked
uncle and me

154
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,929
and trapped us
in a phone booth!

155
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,430
Not cool.

156
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,366
Spring-heel Jack
is planning to destroy
innocent people.

157
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,768
We must stop him!

158
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,836
Don't worry.
I'll get the tiger.

159
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,172
Psst! Tiger!

160
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,175
Uncle and the, uh,
pussycat need your help.

161
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,478
Sorry. I'm busy
with my big debut.

162
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,582
(Singsong) Ok...
But you're gonna miss out

163
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,384
on some butt-kicking action
all over an evil troll.

164
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,186
Hmm. Evil troll?

165
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,322
Big debut...
Evil troll...

166
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,190
(Muttering in audience)

167
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,192
I'm on my way,
brother.

168
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,794
Stay here.

169
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,731
Simone...
(Whispering)

170
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,602
Due to some, uh,
technical difficulties,

171
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,770
we'll be taking
a short intermission.

172
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,214
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

173
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,682
Yuck!

174
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,352
2 jackies?
How long did you plan
to keep this secret?

175
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,554
I was not born
yesterday!

176
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,423
Listen, unc.
We don't have time
for long-winded lectures.

177
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,958
Where's the evil troll?

178
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,627
Crowd: Oh! Aah! Oh, look!

179
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,328
He went that way.

180
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,599
2 jackies equals
one big headache!

181
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,268
Aah!
Oh, no!

182
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,640
(Whimpering)

183
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,442
(Sniffing)
Stop your whining.
No need to bawl.

184
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,378
You're not a magus
after all.

185
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,984
Hee-uhh!

186
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,124
Your head,
it must be very thick

187
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,726
if you think I'll fall
from just one kick.

188
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:02,861
Catchy.

189
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,262
(Crack, crack)

190
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,674
Excuse me,
Mr. spring-heel
Jack?

191
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,043
Why don't we
sit down and talk
about this

192
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,377
like gentlemen?

193
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,680
Back so soon?
How can it be?

194
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,748
Your clothes
aren't even watery.

195
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,551
Oh!
Aah!

196
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,757
Do you enjoy
being a meanie?

197
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,026
I'll confess...Yes!

198
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,371
Miss me?

199
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,915
There are 2 of you?

200
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,484
This could be trouble.

201
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,054
Perhaps I'm only
seeing double!

202
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,893
(Groans)
Sorry!

203
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,994
Jade: Need a hand?

204
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,264
I thought you were
at the play.

205
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,266
Emergency intermission.

206
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,670
I couldn't miss a chance
to see <i> the tiger</i>
àin action!

207
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:19,738
Ok.

208
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,473
Not ok!

209
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,574
Jade!

210
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,109
Oh! Uncle!

211
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,510
It's all my fault!

212
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,913
I snuck into section 13!
I took the tiger talisman.

213
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,282
I hid the halves
in a potted plant. I--

214
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,017
save the acting
for your play.

215
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,054
Deal. So what's the plan?

216
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,956
Help me find a net.

217
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,529
Spring-heel Jack
will be the winner

218
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,731
when I have the maguses
for dinner!

219
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,733
(Sniffs) Almost there.
No--wait!

220
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,502
Correction--(Sniff sniff)

221
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:54,005
A pure-blooded magus
in this direction!

222
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,908
Wait. Wait...

223
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,976
Now!

224
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,548
No nets or chains
or heavy locks

225
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,350
will put this Jack
back in its box!

226
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,751
Imprisoned for a century,

227
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,921
but now I'm free,
free to be me!

228
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,124
Buddy,
I know exactly
how you feel.

229
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,161
You do, do you?
Can this be true?

230
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,330
Magus sounds like
a real party pooper

231
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,933
just like
some people I know.

232
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,936
I was trapped, too,
but now that I'm free,

233
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,939
I want to stay free
to be <i> me!</i>

234
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,575
Hmm...You're just
like me.

235
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:34,045
And it would seem
that you and I
should be a team!

236
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,446
What's in it for me?

237
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,248
Fame, fortune, fun!

238
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,616
Done!

239
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,953
This is terrible!

240
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:46,758
My dark side
has gone over to...
The dark side!

241
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,733
Spring-heel:
I smell a magus
to the east.

242
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,069
It won't be long
before we feast!

243
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,372
Enough is enough!
We need to reunite
the jackies.

244
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,042
I will return
with the tiger talisman.

245
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,178
(Panting)

246
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,414
Brother!
This is not right!

247
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,417
You should not
be helping
spring-heel Jack!

248
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,153
Dude just wants
to be free--like me!

249
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,122
But he's a really bad,
um, Jack-thing,
and you're--

250
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,224
cool?

251
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,358
Not anymore.

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,960
Me, not cool?

253
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,561
Cool people
don't help creeps.

254
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,830
At least that's what
all the cool people
think.

255
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,199
Then that's what
I think, too!

256
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,769
Hel-lo!

257
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,172
(Sniff sniff)

258
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,007
The magus soon
will be in sight,

259
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,043
and we'll consume them
bite by bite.

260
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,247
Forget the <i> we,</i> Jack.
You're on your own!

261
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,050
Now, now.
What's this
you're telling me?

262
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,052
You'd rather
be my enemy?

263
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,254
Whatever.

264
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,658
That was cool!

265
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,127
Unsuccessful,
but cool.

266
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:01,132
Ok, bro.
Let's show this troll
what 2 jackies can do.

267
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,876
Follow those jackies!

268
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,915
Stay calm.
Just makin' a movie.

269
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,585
Oh!

270
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,686
Driver: Oof!

271
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,732
Aah!

272
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,342
Number one
and number 2,

273
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,377
I've had enough
of both of you.

274
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,020
There's only one
direction to go

275
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,522
to catch
this jumping Jack.

276
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,590
Which way is that?
Up.

277
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,338
Go, jackies!
Roll the troll!

278
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,410
Oopsie.
End of the line.

279
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,151
Aah!
Aah!

280
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,454
(Commotion, screams)

281
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:32,256
(Sniffing)

282
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,459
At last,
- a magus is in sight,

283
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,761
and I shall quench
my appetite.

284
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,065
Aah!

285
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,367
Spring-heel Jack?

286
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,135
My mama told me about you,

287
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,637
but I thought
it was just a story.

288
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,973
A story, yes,
but it's all true.

289
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:52,377
I'm real,
and I've come
for you!

290
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,380
Aah!

291
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,782
Spring-heel Jack
is after Simone?

292
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,784
(Gasps)
Simone magus!

293
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,419
Big giant duh!

294
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,055
Fiddle-Dee-Dee.
The girl belongs
to me!

295
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,457
Finders keepers.
Losers weepers.

296
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,192
You're the ones
who will be weeping.

297
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,995
I'm the one who'll
do the keeping!

298
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,397
Uncle!

299
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,066
Fee, fi, fo, fum.

300
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,236
Can you two
really be this dumb?

301
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,608
Jackies! Catch!

302
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,149
All is fine.
The magus is mine.

303
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,950
That's not all
that's yours.

304
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,018
Huh?

305
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,661
Uh-oh.

306
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,630
I hope we didn't
frighten you

307
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,031
by acting so ferocious.

308
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,033
Please forgive
my other self.

309
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,035
His manners
are atrocious!

310
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,037
This child must be
made to pay

311
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,039
for what magus did
that fateful day.

312
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,642
Your sweet revenge
has just been soured.

313
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,178
I will not let her
be devoured.

314
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,114
No, no, no!
You cannot go!

315
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,224
(Clunk)

316
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,130
Jackies, help!

317
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,473
You! The nice one.

318
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,274
Tell us how to stop
your darker side.

319
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,376
Bind his legs
so he will halt.

320
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,679
Then hit him
with a pinch of salt.

321
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,681
Ah! Salt I have.

322
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,483
Boy, talk about
convenient.

323
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,764
Simone, hide in here!

324
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,403
Brother, help!

325
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,972
It's up to you!

326
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,708
No, we must be one,
not 2.

327
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,476
I can assist with that.

328
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,317
A curse upon
my lighter side.

329
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,354
He told the secret
I would hide!

330
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,125
Without him,
you'd have never known

331
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,428
that salt will turn me
back to--

332
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,863
stone.

333
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,234
Tiger, we must
reunite.

334
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,171
For once,
I think you may be right.

335
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,145
I am me again!
I am back!

336
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:45,183
And, ohh...
My aching back.

337
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,721
Jade: Jack is back!

338
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,760
Don't forget, Jackie.
You promised
to come see me

339
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,929
in the final performance
of <i> Jekyll and Hyde</i>
àtomorrow.

340
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,731
Oh, Jade! I'm so sorry.

341
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,900
But I will be very busy
writing up my research

342
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,769
on the underground city,

343
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,205
and I cannot be
in 2 places at--

344
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,575
I will be there.

345
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,280
Hey, Jackie,

346
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,616
what kind of movies
do you like to see?

347
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:22,186
When I'm young,
I like only
one kind of movie--action.

348
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,989
But now I become familiar.
I like drama.

349
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,292
I like American film,
Indian film,
Iran, Iraq film,

350
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,395
uh, Germany film.
I have to look every film.

351
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,198
What is the bad things,
what is the good things--
I have to know.

352
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,702
There's so many...
Good director around
the world

353
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,204
we just not introduced.

354
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:43,207
If you like movie,
you should watch
every film--

355
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,811
cheap film,
expensive film,
any kind of film.
