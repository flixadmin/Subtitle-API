<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,760
Astra, this place, it's twisted you.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,280
It's made me more like you.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,760
When you took on the wand's power,
you also took on its charge.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,280
Oh, Fairy Godmother.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Go find John
and help him rescue Ray from hell.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,680
Gary, you dick.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
I have created a simple app.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,360
You will be able to share
monster sightings.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,480
"In exchange for this service,

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,680
the user agrees to forfeit
their eternal soul

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,800
to the demon Neron."

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,520
He may be planning a monster attack.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,840
Get every single one
of those monsters

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
out of the Time Bureau.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
It's a bloody jailbreak.

17
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
No.

18
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,800
What kind of egg is that?

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,920
<i>It's a dragon egg.</i>

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,400
My name is Zari.

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,000
Whoopsie. Hey.

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,320
You haven't happened to see
an ogre wandering around

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,440
about high, likes to grunt,
drink beer?

24
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,240
Ask Rory.

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,960
Ogre wins again.

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Cheating bastard.
No one outdrinks Mick Rory.

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,800
Hey, fellas.

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,360
Sorry to break up all the fun,
but technically,

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,320
I wasn't supposed to allow
any magical creatures

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
out of the lab, so...

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,520
On second thought,
why don't you two finish up here?

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,960
And I'll go, track down the Minotaur.

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,120
You're not a horrible mother.
You just have a lot on your mind.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,360
I left our dragon egg
in the care of 9-year-old me.

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,040
Has anybody seen Gary?

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,600
- Wait, what did you just say?
- I was distracted.

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,960
I just found out the Eyes app
is stealing peoples' souls,

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,920
and then baby me comes home,
and I...

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
You two need to grab that egg
before it hatches.

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,160
We can't risk Ne-ray getting
his hands on a baby dragon.

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,800
It's already bad enough
that he has Charlie.

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,200
- Okay.
- Fair.

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,680
Get up. Time's a wasting.

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,560
There are souls just waiting
to be sold.

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,440
You're off your rocker, you old nag.

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,120
This here shape-shifter
don't take requests.

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,360
Shape-shifter?

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,800
Is that all you think you are?

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,320
You may have
your human friends fooled, dearie,

50
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,240
but you and I both know
what you're truly capable of.

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,240
- You don't know me.
- Don't I?

52
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,120
The shape your wearing,
though lovely, is a costume.

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,880
It's not who you really are.

54
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,160
You aren't meant to hide, my pet.

55
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,640
You are meant to show humans
their greatest fears.

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
And lucky for you,

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,880
helping monsters
fulfill their potential...

58
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,560
is what I do.

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Yes.

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
Damn it, Gary.

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,440
{\an5}Oh, excuse me, hey. Hi.
Excuse me, sir.

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,320
Hi, pardon me,
I just, I don't belong here.

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
No? And I'm a...

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,040
{\an5}I'm a Fairy Godmother sent
to find John Constantine.

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Really?

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,720
{\an5}What, are the King and Queen
of hell

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
making their grand debut?

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
Not our debut, dearie.

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,720
No, no, no. Stop.

70
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
What are you doing?

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,800
As much as I'd like to pontificate
about my grander plan...

72
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,760
I've taught him better than that.

73
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,600
- Who the hell are you?
- Really? The dress doesn't sell it?

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,200
{\an5}You didn't tell me you had
a Fairy Godmother, John.

75
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,480
Not his, Gary's.

76
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,360
And I thought I was the one
being tortured.

77
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,000
Look, Princess,
we got rules here in hell.

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,320
All right? You can't just...

79
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Let's go.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
What are you doing?

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,080
Going to find Ray,
same way I found you.

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
{\an5}The only difference
is Ray doesn't have a body.

83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,240
So let's go find his soul.

84
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,120
{\an5}His soul token,
that's the currency in hell.

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
While a soul is being tortured,

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,920
{\an5}then its token is traded
around town like money.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
{\an5}As long as you have it,

88
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,680
{\an5}then you'll always
have access to the soul.

89
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,800
{\an5}But since Neron is still topside,

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,240
{\an5}then his token's likely
locked in his vault.

91
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,280
Then let's go find it.

92
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
{\an5}- Why isn't this working?
- I'm sorry, love.

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,600
{\an5}You can't just go poofing yourself
into the vaults of hell.

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
{\an5}We'll have to find someone
to help us break in.

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,560
And I think I know just the person.

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
I don't see her.

97
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,080
{\an5}How do you know
what 9 year old me looks like?

98
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,080
{\an5}I'm just looking for
the coolest kid in school.

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
{\an5}Yeah, there's a lot
I haven't told you

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,680
about my childhood.

101
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
{\an5}There, that's the spot
where kids used to gang up on me

102
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,400
{\an5}and say, "Zari, Zari,
why your clothes so sorry?"

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,640
{\an5}I would have said, "Zari, Zari,
you smell like calamari."

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,720
Bullying is bad.

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
{\an5}All right, let's break this up
and find out where I stashed the egg.

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,640
- He's so cool.
- Oh, look how cute he is.

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
- I want a dragon.
- He's so adorable.

108
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,240
Come here.
I want to take him home with me.

109
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,400
Oh, my God, he hatched.

110
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,680
And I brought him to school.

111
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, so we got to get him

112
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,400
- before...
- Whoa, wait. Look.

113
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
Mithra, dance.

114
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,480
So cool.

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
- Awesome, Zari.
- Thank you.

116
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Come on.

117
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,600
What's going on, children?

118
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,240
It's okay. He's my pet, Mithra.

119
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,400
{\an5}- I named him after the...
- Run, children.

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
It's a monster.

121
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
Wait, Zari. Zari, wait. Wait.

122
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,160
Don't hurt him.

123
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
Oh, my God, I lost him again.

124
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,920
<i>Captain, I've located Neron.</i>

125
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,920
{\an5}<i>Now live to Capitol Hill,
where the Palmer X CEO is testifying</i>

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,040
<i>before the Senate subcommittee.</i>

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,080
Look, I know Senator Wellington

128
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,200
{\an5}doesn't believe that
it's up to the private sector

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,960
{\an5}to intervene in such
a unprecedented crisis.

130
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,880
{\an5}But I should mention,
not a single one

131
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,840
{\an5}of my subscribers has been harmed
in a monster attack.

132
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,160
Senator, do you care to respond?

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,480
This bloke is just trying
to scare folks

134
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,760
{\an5}into downloading his evil,
soul-sucking app.

135
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,160
There ain't no such thing
as monst...

136
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,120
This isn't me.

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm not doing this.

138
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,440
{\an5}Like I said, they could be
hiding anywhere...

139
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,360
{\an5}and only you can stop them.

140
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,120
Wait, it might be Charlie.

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
Well, who am I supposed to shoot?

142
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
There.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Damn pigs.
I'm trying to help you out.

144
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Stay there.

145
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,800
We got to go.

146
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Come on.

147
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,320
Let her go.
She served her purpose.

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,280
Astra Logue. Name's Neron.

149
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,040
I hear good things about you.

150
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
Now that I'm taking over
for your former employers, I...

151
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,480
Give it a rest, John.

152
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,360
You think I can't see through
your cheap little parlor trick?

153
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,080
How'd you get out
of the torture pits anyway?

154
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,080
- Nice sparkles.
- Nice shoulder pads.

155
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
What do you want, John?

156
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
And please tell me
you're not here to make

157
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,080
some sad, sappy plea for me
to remember who I really am.

158
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,440
I know exactly who you are.

159
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,680
You're someone I can work with.

160
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,000
Now, the Triumvirate,
they were too short-sighted

161
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
to take my deal, and now they
are roasting rats for supper.

162
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,080
But you're smarter than that, Astra.

163
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,840
All I need is access
to one measly soul,

164
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,440
and in exchange, I'll go kill Neron,
and your boys will be back on top.

165
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,840
This soul you're after...

166
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,240
must be pretty special.

167
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,880
He is.

168
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,520
I was special to you, too, John once.

169
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,120
And yet, you left me down here
to rot all those years.

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,920
- Astra, you can't...
- I'm over it.

171
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,440
I made the best of a bad situation,
and guess what.

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,320
I flourished.
Down here, I had prospects

173
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,080
until Neron wiped his ass with them.

174
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
So...

175
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,960
do we have a deal?

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,560
Let's go rob the King.

177
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,200
<i>Today's attack at the U.S. Capitol</i>

178
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,920
{\an5}<i>has sparked worldwide panic
and paranoia</i>

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,840
{\an5}<i>over the threat of magical creatures.</i>

180
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,520
Enough, Gideon.

181
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,160
Where is Neron in all of this?

182
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,280
Why isn't he responding
to his magical-creature alerts?

183
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,960
What alerts? All the creatures
are here on the ship.

184
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,360
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

185
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Neron's shown the world
that anyone can be a monster.

186
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,480
People are turning on each other.
Everyone's terrified.

187
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,880
I thought Neron wanted
to collect souls.

188
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,840
How does hacking the app
only to let it fail

189
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,080
get him what he wants?

190
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,640
It's not about souls anymore.

191
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,080
It's something worse.

192
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,800
Well, they didn't share
their endgame,

193
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,080
but from what I could figure out,

194
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,680
they don't give a "fa"
about ruling hell.

195
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,200
It's actually fear
that they're after.

196
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,480
- Why?
- Fear is power. It's energy.

197
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
And thanks to me, they have
a wallop of it to muck about with.

198
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,040
<i>That might explain the strange
meteorological event</i>

199
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,960
<i>forming over Washington, D.C.</i>

200
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,880
Right above the Time Bureau.

201
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,440
Gideon, do you have a visual?

202
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,480
You're welcome, world.

203
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,240
The air is thick with human fear.

204
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,520
The hour of our coronation
draws near, my pet.

205
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,320
It's time to send your message
to your legions below.

206
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,200
The bank's right around the corner.

207
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,440
What's happening?

208
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,360
<i>Denizens of hell,</i>

209
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,920
<i>for far too long, we have been forced
to live like insects</i>

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,640
<i>underneath the Earth.</i>

211
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,120
<i>Soon, a door will open.</i>

212
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,920
<i>Look to the sky and await my signal.</i>

213
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,880
<i>With me as your king,
we will make Earth hell again.</i>

214
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,000
So that's been his play all along.

215
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,600
We best keep moving, loves,

216
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,080
before all hell literally
breaks loose.

217
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,320
Stay calm, they smell fear.

218
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
What if fear is my natural scent?

219
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,720
Good afternoon, everyone.
We have your favorites.

220
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,240
I know it's a bit crowded in here,
but we're making the best of it.

221
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,480
Anybody want a sammy whammy?

222
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
Put that in your whammy, you dick.

223
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Okay.

224
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,000
Bon appétit.

225
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,200
- They are savages.
- Oh, calm down, Gary.

226
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,680
The longer we keep
the magical creatures locked up,

227
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,200
the more they're gonna act like
actual monsters.

228
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,960
They are monsters, you twit,
and so are you.

229
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,760
We all are.

230
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,880
How are we supposed
to defeat fear itself?

231
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,040
I mean, people afraid of Metas,

232
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,240
magical creatures afraid
of people, and...

233
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,280
Monsters hated by everyone.

234
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,880
Not everyone. Gideon, play the...

235
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,160
<i>- The "dancing dragon sneeze" video.</i>
- Yep, that.

236
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
<i>Mithra, dance.</i>

237
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,080
- What is this?
- Wicksty.

238
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,200
Yeah, this innocent moment
where kids aren't afraid,

239
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,720
it's resonating with people.

240
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
They don't see a monster,

241
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,760
- they see something amazing.
- So do I.

242
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
Me on that playground
surrounded by people

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
who want to be my friend...

244
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,720
Even if it was just for a day, that

245
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,720
little baby dragon changed my world.

246
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
You sound like my dad's pitch for...

247
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
HeyWorld.

248
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,800
Oh, my God, guys, that's it.

249
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,520
What? What's... what?

250
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
My dad had a dream
to build a theme park

251
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,160
that people would come to see
because of magic.

252
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
That's what the world needs
right now,

253
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
a place for people to come
and see the wonder

254
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
of these creatures in person.

255
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
What, so they can just shoot us all
in one place?

256
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,480
That's bloody brilliant, that.

257
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,080
No, so they can see creatures

258
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,920
the way that you helped us
see creatures, Charlie.

259
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,200
Not as monsters, but as misfits
just trying to find their place.

260
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,000
Look, if we can learn that lesson,
then so can the rest of the world.

261
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,960
We just need to bring people
and creatures together.

262
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,600
Think of it like
a magical version of Woodstock.

263
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,680
- "If we build it"...
- "They will come."

264
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
How long until we can get it up
and running?

265
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,440
If Mikey T and the boys
work weekends.

266
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,880
Quick math in my head.
Two, maybe three years.

267
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,280
He's not a coin.

268
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,760
- Observant.
- No flesh bags, just souls.

269
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,040
That's why they call it
the Soul Exchange.

270
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
Oh, right, then.
I'll be on me way, then.

271
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
This is John Constantine.

272
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
Oh, and me without
my autograph book.

273
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,440
No worries, love. Next time, yeah?

274
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,960
Look, if you would like to convert
his soul into cash, you need...

275
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,720
Maybe you don't get it.

276
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
Neron owns the marker on his soul,

277
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,520
and Neron wants to torture him
as soon as he gets here.

278
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,080
But, hey, if you want to tell
the new boss why

279
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
his prized victim isn't waiting
in his vault.

280
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
This way.

281
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Not so rough.

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,320
FYI, there's no bathroom in here,
and I'm not feeding him.

283
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,040
I'm a bank teller, not a zoo...

284
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,960
Pretty cool for a grown woman
wearing taffeta and a tiara.

285
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
How does this work?

286
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,840
We find a coin? There are 1,000.

287
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,160
Some of history's worst.

288
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,840
Yeah, I'd wager he's keeping
it somewhere special.

289
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,800
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What?

290
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
Revolution's in the air,
I've got to look out for number one.

291
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,800
You were a golden opportunity
to bankroll my future.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I took it.

293
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,800
What about Bridget's diary?

294
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,680
If we put it in Nate's hands,

295
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,720
he could just dream us up
a theme park.

296
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,360
Z, you are a genius. The...

297
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,760
It's in the Time Bureau.

298
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,880
It's okay, so we just break in,
but it's not gonna be easy.

299
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,640
Even if it isn't demon central,

300
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,880
the vault that it's being held in
is practically impenetrable.

301
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,680
Oh, it's penetrable.

302
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,400
Oh, my God.

303
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,640
I love you, Rory.

304
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Give it back when you're done.

305
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,120
Buck and Garima's sexual odyssey
is far from over.

306
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,560
All right, team.

307
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,760
Nate, you have a theme park
to dream up.

308
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,480
Gary, help Mona "Pretty Woman"
our creatures into something

309
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
a little more kid friendly.

310
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,160
And the rest of us,

311
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,480
it's time to come up
with a marketing plan

312
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,200
for the happiest place on the planet.

313
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,760
<i>Ms. Tomaz, your simulation program
has detected a change</i>

314
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,600
<i>in your presently predicted future.</i>

315
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,080
Good change or bad change?

316
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,920
<i>In one potential 2042,
building HeyWorld</i>

317
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,640
<i>leads to an era of understanding
and tolerance.</i>

318
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,960
<i>The Anti-Meta-Human Act
of 2029 never passes,</i>

319
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,760
<i>your parents live out
their lives peacefully in Seattle.</i>

320
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,040
<i>The future as you know it
would be completely changed.</i>

321
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,120
My parents.

322
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
They're...

323
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,440
That means a piece
of this crazy plan actually works.

324
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,880
This is great news, right?

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,520
God, I've been running
that stupid program for so long,

326
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,720
I'd given up hope of it
actually working.

327
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,720
If this works, my brother survives...

328
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,080
I never steal his totem back
from A.R.G.U.S.,

329
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,680
I never join the Legends.

330
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
Last two years
wouldn't have happened.

331
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,720
Who knows where I'll be
or who I'll be?

332
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,240
You'll be you.

333
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,960
Because while we're at HeyWorld,

334
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,560
you'll be here on the ship
in the temporal zone,

335
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,880
and you'll be safe.

336
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,360
Sara, I can't...
I can't sit this one out.

337
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Look, I'm not gonna lose
another Legend.

338
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,080
And who said we're not
putting you to work?

339
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,200
Look, we need to make sure
what happens at HeyWorld

340
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,800
is seen globally.

341
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,840
I can use the Eyes app as a backdoor
into the phones that downloaded it.

342
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Thank you.

343
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
I found it, I found it. Ray's coin.

344
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,680
- So long, then, John boy, for now.
- Whoa, hold on a minute.

345
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,920
Our deal was for his soul,
not a bleeding coin.

346
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,920
Fine, a promise is a promise.

347
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,600
What are they doing to him in there?

348
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,080
Prepare yourself, love.

349
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,480
What's behind this door,
it won't be pretty.

350
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Down there, they twist a man's soul
until he's no longer human.

351
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
And what they've done to the big man,
he might not even be...

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No!

353
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,960
Ray. Ray?

354
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,840
Nora, John, we're just about to start
another game of Giant Jenga.

355
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,600
You got to meet my old friend
well, technically, my new friend.

356
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,800
We used to be mortal enemies.

357
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,120
Oh, hi, guys.

358
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Well, you're just in time
for the next round.

359
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,160
<i>When the world needs heroes,
they answer the call.</i>

360
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,040
We'll be at HeyWorld,

361
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,520
the new adventure capital
of eastern Maryland...

362
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,320
Where we will hit fun
in the bull's-eye.

363
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,040
And we'll give your children
a flash of excitement.

364
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,880
And cut.

365
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,840
- That was good, guys.
- That was a good take.

366
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,640
- It felt good.
- That was a great take.

367
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,560
Guys, I feel like that
would have worked

368
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
a little bit better
with the real Trinity.

369
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,280
Yeah, well, I asked,
and they said hard pass.

370
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,000
- We should have done a crossover.
- Yeah.

371
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,200
Well, who needs
the Trinity anyway, right?

372
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,400
I mean, the Legends are super enough.

373
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,840
But HeyWorld isn't a superhero park.

374
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,480
Promising them something
and giving them something else feels,

375
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,680
I don't know, wrong, doesn't it?

376
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,640
People aren't going to go to a park

377
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,640
filled with things
they're terrified of.

378
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,600
People need franchise
superheroes to feel safe,

379
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,160
so that's how we're gonna
get them in the door.

380
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,400
Okay, everyone,
let's just go around the room

381
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,480
one by one and say what talent
you can contribute

382
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,240
to the HeyWorld revue.

383
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Oh, Minotaur, let's start with you.
I hear you like guitar.

384
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Don't tell her nothing, bull face.

385
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,240
- Let us out of here.
- We can't do that, Mr. Ogre.

386
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,720
It's not safe out there.

387
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,360
Well, we ain't helping you,

388
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,720
what, with you moving us around
from one prison to another.

389
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,080
So why should we trust you?

390
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,000
Listen up, if you lot
don't want to go back

391
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,520
to a real prison,
then this is your chance.

392
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,520
This is your chance to change
the way that humans see you.

393
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,800
Show them that just because
you look scary.

394
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,560
Doesn't mean you are scary.

395
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
That's right, Wolfie.

396
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,280
Look, I know how infuriating
humans can be.

397
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,000
They have a hard time seeing past
their own noses, don't they?

398
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,160
But they can change
if you help them to look deeper.

399
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,920
And if they see the amount of good
that you lot are capable of,

400
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,480
then maybe,
maybe they'll believe in you

401
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,120
even when you doubt yourself.

402
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,360
Now, I know that there's more
to all of you than meets the eye.

403
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,320
Like you, Ogre.

404
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,280
My name is Frederic.
But what's the point?

405
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,400
Every time I try to show
a human who I really am,

406
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,760
they run away or try to kill me.

407
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,400
And that must really hurt
your feelings.

408
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,160
Yeah, it does.

409
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
All I ever wanted to do was sing.

410
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,560
Well, it looks like we found
ourselves a double act.

411
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,400
Now, who else has a hidden talent?

412
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,320
Brilliant. Beautiful.

413
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,320
I think we've got ourselves a show.

414
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,720
Wait, what are you doing here?

415
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,840
Are you dead?
Oh, please tell me you're not dead.

416
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,120
What are you doing in that dress?
Not that I don't like it, but.

417
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,680
Idiot. What were you thinking
selling your soul to a demon?

418
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,200
- You, Ray?
- I.

419
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
- You doomed the whole planet.
- Look, I didn't have a choice.

420
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,840
He was gonna kill Nate.
It was the only way I could make sure

421
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
my best friend would be safe.

422
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,320
So that was the deal you made...

423
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,480
his life for your body.

424
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,400
Oh, Raymondo, you sweet,
dumb son of a softie.

425
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,800
Yeah, right? What a guy.

426
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,600
I was sent here to torture him,
but then we got to talking.

427
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,320
- Oh, it got really deep, man.
- It really did.

428
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,600
What were we even fighting
about all those years ago?

429
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,920
Your compulsion for world domination
and inability to accept rejection.

430
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,240
Translation, it was about a girl.

431
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,560
A girl? What girl?

432
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,680
- It doesn't matter. We should go.
- Wait.

433
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,440
Something's happening.

434
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,360
I think I fulfilled Gary's wish.
Ray, take my hand. John.

435
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,800
Oh, all right. Ciao for now.

436
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
Say hi to the Legends for me,
will you?

437
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,920
Oh, I love those groovy guys.

438
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,640
Jenga time.

439
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,360
Oh, almost forgot,
extra hot sauce for the chupacabra.

440
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,760
What in the hell?

441
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,240
More like "out of it," mate.

442
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,680
It worked. It worked.

443
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,240
- You got Constantine.
- All right, okay.

444
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
- Be cool, just be cool.
- Okay.

445
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,480
- Simmer down, simmer down, sunshine.
- Where's Ray?

446
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,960
He was just here. He.

447
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,800
Yeah, that's the only way
he can travel

448
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,520
as long as Neron's
using his body.

449
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,760
Fairy Godmother,
I wish for Ray to get his body back.

450
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
All magic has its limitations
you know,

451
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,400
stroke of midnight and all that.
But don't worry...

452
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm sure the Legends have
something up their sleeves.

453
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,320
This isn't playtime, you twits.

454
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Neron is using fear
to open up the gates of hell.

455
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,960
Well, that's why we have
to fight fear

456
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
with something wonderful.

457
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,240
We have to show the world
that these magical creatures

458
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,120
are just that, they're magical.

459
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,080
And everyone else
is on board with this?

460
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah, pretty much.

461
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
- Bloody hell.
- All right, great.

462
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,880
Well, now that you're all on board,
we have work to do.

463
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
There is another way.

464
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,920
Whilst in hell, we learned that
Neron's possession of Ray's body

465
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,400
is contingent on Nate
not being killed.

466
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,360
Is that why Ner-Ray
didn't strangle me

467
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
- when he had the chance?
- Yeah.

468
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,880
A demon is only as good as his word.

469
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,560
If Neron breaks that deal,
he'll be ejected from Ray's body.

470
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
I could kill him.

471
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,920
And once I do, all the souls
he's nabbed will be released.

472
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
And all Neron has to do is...

473
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Me?

474
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,200
No, absolutely not.

475
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,480
Look, there is no Plan B,
only Plan A, got it?

476
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,520
Yeah, got it.

477
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,560
Look, I meant what I said earlier.
I am not losing another Legend.

478
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,840
So forget what you heard back there,
because we are all-in on HeyWorld.

479
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,760
Now, I believe in you,
and if I'm not mistaken,

480
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,360
- someone has a theme park to build.
- Yeah.

481
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,960
I can't believe it all
comes down to this.

482
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,760
After years of anxiety
of whether or not

483
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,760
I could live up
to my dad's expectations,

484
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,640
I'm about to bring
his crazy dream to life...

485
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,520
knowing what it could cost me.

486
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,520
Nate, I'm not going anywhere.

487
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
You got this.

488
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Okay.

489
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Let's do this.

490
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,360
I'm standing in front of HeyWorld,
a new superhero inspired theme park

491
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,360
that seems to have sprung up
overnight like magic.

492
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,080
Welcome to HeyWorld,
the happiest place on the globe.

493
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,360
Hey, kid, welcome to HeyWorld.

494
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,200
Try the churros and not just
because the real money

495
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,920
is in the concessions,
they're also delicious.

496
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,120
Z, you and your mom are here.

497
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,000
I see them, I mean us.

498
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,360
All right, stream's up.
You look great, by the way.

499
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,240
Oh, thank you for noticing.
I showered.

500
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,320
How's the clickety-clackety-hackety
coming along?

501
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,280
Once Ava hits "record,"
this will stream out to about,

502
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,280
you know, 3 billion people or so.

503
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
No pressure.

504
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,040
Come one, come all
to our thrilling stage spectacular

505
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,440
"Superheroes versus Monsters."

506
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,640
Okay, you got
the choreography down?

507
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,400
Everyone, follow her lead.

508
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,760
Baba Yaga, remember,
those kids are audience members,

509
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,080
not appetizers.

510
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,560
Mike, watch your language
out there, right?

511
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,440
We don't want those gormyus wankers
from standards

512
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,440
and practices up our you-know-whats.

513
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,720
Everyone,
they're gonna love you guys.

514
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
All right, gang, it's showtime.

515
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't call them heroes,

516
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,040
call them Legends.

517
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Now, let's see what daring do

518
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,680
the Legends of Tomorrow get into...

519
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,360
today.

520
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,800
And that'll teach those bad guys
that crime doesn't pay.

521
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,120
Thanks for the assist, Green Arrow.
See you later, Supergirl.

522
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,080
Whoa. Do you see that?

523
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,000
That's the Flash,
and he wants to hang out.

524
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,960
Should we got hang out?

525
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
Break a leg, guys.

526
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,960
Wait a second.

527
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,400
I think that I hear something.

528
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
Monsters.

529
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,520
What do you think, White Canary?
Should we show them what we got?

530
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,080
Wait, hold on.

531
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,920
What if, instead of showing them
what we got,

532
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,760
we ask them what they have?

533
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,560
You mean get to know them?

534
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,320
What if, getting to know them,
we realize

535
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,840
that we have nothing to fear.

536
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,440
Minotaur, your passion is music.
Why don't you show us what you got?

537
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,280
They said this was a superhero show.

538
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,240
These brats don't respect art.

539
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,160
Hey, hey. I think we're losing them.

540
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
What was that?

541
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,320
Bloody hell, I know that sound.

542
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,480
Finally, a real-life dragon.

543
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,240
- Oh, no, is that.
- Wicksty?

544
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
Now, this is a show.

545
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,320
You really thought you could stop us?

546
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,680
These fools you brought here
will only serve our hellish end.

547
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,280
Everyone remain calm.

548
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,240
This is all just, a part of the show.

549
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,600
Damn it, Gary. Now I'm powerless.

550
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,600
Enough, filling your heads
with this silly,

551
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,400
little morality play.

552
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,160
Now all of you will bear witness
to the birth of a new era.

553
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,400
She wants these people scared.

554
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,440
They'll open up
the portal right here.

555
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,560
This way. Go, go.

556
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,360
We got to get that staff.

557
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,600
We got to get these kids
out of here, go.

558
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,480
Follow them.

559
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,200
Everybody, go back inside.
Back inside.

560
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,920
It's all right. It's all right.

561
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,800
Burn her. Burn them all.

562
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Stop.

563
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Stop.

564
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,040
Burn the child. Do it now.

565
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,520
Kid, you got to run.

566
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,400
Mithra, dance.

567
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
No.

568
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Tabitha.

569
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Mithra, wait.

570
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,560
Rise, my demon brethren.
The door is open.

571
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,680
Rise.

572
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,680
Oh, it's gonna take more
than a musical number to stop this.

573
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Neron.

574
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,920
This fight is between me and you,

575
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,760
so let's settle it once and for all.

576
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Gladly.

577
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,000
I've already won.
Killing you is just a bonus.

578
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,880
You may take me, Neron,
but the Legends will always win.

579
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,320
- What's happening?
- Looks like the deal's off, mate.

580
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
No.

581
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Nate? No.

582
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,880
Gideon, take us to HeyWorld.

583
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,240
<i>I must advise against
that course of action.</i>

584
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,600
<i>The change to your future
is still in progress.</i>

585
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,560
<i>If you leave the temporal zone,
your current memories won't be safe.</i>

586
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,960
You didn't.

587
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,200
I'm sorry, love. It was his choice.

588
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,720
- Finish it off, John.
- Gladly.

589
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,360
(Foreign language)

590
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,040
Come on, Ray.

591
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,120
Raymond Palmer,
I return your soul to your body.

592
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,880
What happened to me?
Where am I?

593
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,240
I'm in HeyWorld?

594
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,280
Everybody's here.

595
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
No, Nate. No.

596
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
- No.
- Ray, Ray.

597
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
- No, no, no.
- Ray, I'm so sorry.

598
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
- Nate, hey.
- But, but.

599
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,160
- You can't be here.
- Come on.

600
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,640
Hey. Nate, you can't be dead.

601
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,720
Come on. Hey, come on, come on.
Come on, you can't be.

602
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,520
Bring him back to life, weasel.

603
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,040
Oh, I wish I could, Rory,

604
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,720
but that requires magic
beyond my means, mate.

605
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,680
Not a bad show if you ask me.

606
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,520
- Dad.
- Hello, Nate.

607
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
I missed you so much, Dad.

608
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,800
I haven't been far.

609
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,720
Oh, I guess.

610
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,080
I guess it sucks.

611
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Dying before you're ready, huh?

612
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,200
- Sure does.
- Yeah.

613
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,960
Believe me, I went through
all the emotions

614
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,240
I mean, anger, worry...

615
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
I had so many regrets,

616
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,280
I almost missed my ticket
to the happy place.

617
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,840
- What changed?
- I had faith.

618
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,840
- You're saying there's actually a...
- In you, Nate.

619
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,280
And I was right
to believe that my boy

620
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,560
and all his freaky buddies
would see this thing through.

621
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,840
But you know the only thing missing
from that big show of yours?

622
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Music.

623
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,600
<i>There is a young cowboy</i>

624
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,520
<i>Who lives on the range</i>

625
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,800
<i>His horse and his cattle
Are his only companions</i>

626
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,400
Do I have something on my face?

627
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,680
Did you just sing?

628
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,040
James Taylor?

629
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,720
I don't sing.

630
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,320
I think someone from beyond
is trying to help us out.

631
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,760
You got to be kidding me.

632
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,120
<i>He works in the saddle
And sleeps in the canyons</i>

633
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,240
<i>Waiting for summer
His pastures to change</i>

634
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,760
<i>And as the moon rises</i>

635
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,320
<i>He sits by his fire</i>

636
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,960
<i>Thinking about women</i>

637
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Look.

638
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,920
<i>- Closing his eyes</i>
- Keep singing.

639
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
<i>As the dogies retire</i>

640
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,800
<i>- He sings out a song...</i>
- Of course.

641
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,880
If fear can be energy,
it only stands to reason

642
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,480
that love can be energy, too.

643
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Everyone, if you want to see
Nate up and kicking,

644
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,360
he needs to hear your voices
right now.

645
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,120
We need everyone to hold hands.

646
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,720
And we mean everyone.

647
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,560
- Are we really doing this?
- Couldn't hurt.

648
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,440
Didn't they do this last year?

649
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,240
We're part of the circle this time.

650
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,720
Dad, do you hear that?

651
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
It's for you, son.

652
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,240
<i>Won't you let me go down
In my dreams?</i>

653
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,960
<i>- And rock-a-bye, sweet baby</i>
- Oh, come on, people.

654
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,400
Do you want him to stay dead?
Come on, sing.

655
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,400
<i>Good night, you moonlight ladies</i>

656
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,760
<i>- Rock-a-bye, sweet baby James</i>
- It's working.

657
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,840
<i>Deep greens and blues
Are the colors I choose</i>

658
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,080
- I love you, Nate.
<i>- Down in my dreams</i>

659
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,800
<i>And rock-a-bye, sweet baby James</i>

660
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
Yes.

661
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,480
No, no, no.

662
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,560
You're not in the temporal zone.

663
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,480
We changed history.
We changed everything.

664
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,200
I couldn't let you die.

665
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
No.

666
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,080
Dude, you just came back to life.

667
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,560
Something's wrong.

668
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,600
There was more pelvis
in that hug than usual.

669
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,040
It's all good, Nate dog.

670
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,760
Love you, too, bro.

671
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,120
Yeah, my bad, bro.
It just feels like...

672
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,000
feels like something's missing.

673
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,840
Ray. Buddy.

674
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,920
I can't believe you went
all the to hell

675
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,560
to stop Neron from killing me.

676
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,920
You would have done the same thing.

677
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,080
- I kind of just did.
- Yeah, you did.

678
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,240
All right, Time Bros.

679
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,600
- Oh, and Time Ladies.
- And Time Monsters.

680
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,280
And Gary?

681
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,720
As I was saying, Legends...

682
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,360
our work here is done.

683
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,960
Gideon, fire up the ship.
It's time to hit it.

684
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,720
I'm here to make a withdrawal.

685
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,400
These are some truly serious sinners.

686
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,040
Cut down too soon, all of them.

687
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,240
It's a real shame
when someone doesn't get to...

688
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,360
fulfill their destiny.

689
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
Don't you think?

690
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,000
Everyone deserves a second act.
