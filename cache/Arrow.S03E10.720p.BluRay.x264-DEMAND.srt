1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,730
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,049
- Where's your mother?
- The white-haired woman, she took her.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,681
Deliver Sara's killer or citizens of Starling
will see what the League is capable of.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,640
I will tell Ra's this was you,
that Thea was under your control.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,285
And he Will still kill her.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,641
She fired the arrows.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,128
- There's nothing I won't do to protect you.
- What does that mean?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,083
I killed Sara. By League law, I have the
right to challenge you to a trial by combat.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,851
You covet death that much?

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,609
Shots fired. Units in pursuit
of a van across the causeway.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,804
I want air support.
These bastards, they shot one of our own.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,570
That cop was just asking for my license,
man. You didn't have to shoot him.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,805
Shots fired.

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,121
Get me closer.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,131
Come on. Damn it.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,486
Nice.

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,571
It's him.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,966
I thought he was green.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,841
This bike is sick.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,162
Not supposed to be having fun right now.

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,840
- Sorry.
- No, sorry is what you'll be...

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,731
...when Oliver finds out
you took out his motorcycle.

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,005
I've got him headed your way.
Aim for the engine block.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,681
There's the green one.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,281
Suit's too tight.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,442
They make it to the tunnel, we lose them.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,880
You're not helping.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,801
I thought he was supposed to be good.

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,171
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,049
I'm more of a Glock kind of guy.

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,481
I didn't say anything.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,247
One caught, one got away,
but even Oliver bats .500 sometimes.

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,642
- Any luck finding Oliver?
- Not yet.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,128
But I have every reconnaissance satellite
I could hack looking for him.

35
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,682
So the second he steps outside, we'll know.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,689
If he steps outside.

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,169
- It's what we were all thinking.
- I'm not. It's only been three days.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,567
I have to head to my
other office for a bit.

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,484
Okay, I know it's only been three days...

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,729
...but how much longer
before we actually have to start worrying?

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,931
I expected this kind of blunder
from Mr. Queen, but not from you.

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,090
You should have checked with me
before abducting that scientist.

43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,363
We were just following the trail for Omega,
like you ordered us to.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,931
I ordered you to be cautious.

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,329
That's how you protect yourself
and your loved ones.

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,688
We need an extraction team to free my wife.

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,486
From where? We don't know
where Chien Na Wei is located.

48
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,041
- We have more pressing concerns.
- She has the Omega.

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,602
We find her, we find Tatsu.
We get them both out of wherever they are.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,325
If only it were that simple.

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,761
We've learned that the bioweapon
is actually comprised of two components.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,402
The Omega she has is harmless
without its counterpart, Alpha.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,681
And where's that?

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,690
Currently in the possession
of the Hong Kong military.

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,809
- So it's safe.
- Far from it.

56
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,850
The only way to secure
the counterpart Alpha is to destroy it.

57
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,520
And by the time we do,
my wife will be dead.

58
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,448
Alpha is being kept here
in a PLA military laboratory.

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,685
The two of you with backup will break
into the facility and recover the vial.

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,601
It's tagged with a GPS tracker, which
you'll need to disable before extraction.

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,768
And what about Tats-u?

62
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,443
- Stop ignoring me.
- I'm not ignoring you, Mr. Yamashiro.

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,688
I'm merely focusing on the task at hand...

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,488
...which, at the moment,
is not recovering your wife.

65
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,328
Ah. All right.

66
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,320
This will be gauntlet pulse test 37 Alpha.

67
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,769
Two-second burst at 800 volts.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,203
In five, four...

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,684
...three, two, one.

70
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,090
Damn it.

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,962
- Clowns?
- Practice targets.

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,727
- Clowns freaked me out as a kid.
- Well, you're showing them who's boss now.

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,720
I would be, if I could figure out how
to modulate the stress energy tenser.

74
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,291
Ray, I've been thinking.

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,689
- About overclocking the magnetic coils?
- No.

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,163
About what you're doing
and about me helping you do it.

77
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,283
Save the city, you mean?

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,170
Risk your life.

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,043
I know you think you're going to be safe
inside that suit of armor.

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,961
I know there's, like, a gajillion movies
that make it look easy.

81
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,604
Well, the Arrow and his partner go out
there every night, without armor.

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,167
And one night...

83
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,325
...hopefully very far off in the future,
they're not gonna come back.

84
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,008
I don't want that to happen to you.

85
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,084
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Start small.

86
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,647
Just see if you can get the nanite chip
to function.

87
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,690
Dad, I will do what I can.

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,485
Here he comes.

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,650
The cop he shot, doc says he may never
walk again, and that's if he makes it...

90
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,446
...because right now, he's 50-50.

91
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,928
All right, Miss Lance, you're up.

92
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,171
The People v. Jermaine Fisher.

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,842
Mr. Fisher is charged with 41 counts
of attempted murder...

94
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,324
...including 16 counts of attempted murder
of a police officer.

95
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,682
So no bail is what you're saying?

96
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,129
Vigorously, Your Honor.

97
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,881
Just as the defendant vigorously moves
to dismiss all charges.

98
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,085
Mr. Fisher's apprehension was not affected
by the police, but rather by vigilantes.

99
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,170
The circumstances of Mr. Fisher's arrest
are irrelevant.

100
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,569
Produce the Arrow as an eyewitness,
and we'll find out.

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,808
That won't be necessary.

102
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,044
We have the weapon with Mr. Fisher's
fingerprints all over it, Your Honor.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,284
Motion to dismiss, denied. Bail, denied.

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,488
Please remand Mr. Fisher into custody.

105
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,449
How'd it go at A.R.G.U.S.?

106
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,883
Lyla tapped all of her worldwide contacts.
No sign of Oliver.

107
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,884
- No idea where he could be.
- He'll tell us when he gets back.

108
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,441
Until then, we should focus
on keeping the lights on.

109
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,531
The shooters we took on last night, I've
been trying to find the one that got away.

110
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,684
Jose Anton. Anton is attached
to a new crew working the Glades...

111
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,611
...the head of which is this gentleman.

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,804
I know that guy. That's Danny Brickwell.
His street name's Brick.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,641
- But I thought he was in Iron Heights.
- He was until a week ago.

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,763
And then the case against him imploded...

115
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,567
...by which I mean every single witness
suffered some sort of fatal accident.

116
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,001
Three guesses as to who the police suspect.

117
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,250
Jermaine Fisher
and the guy who got away last night.

118
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,521
Jose Anton.

119
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,129
So they kill witnesses in order to get Brick
out of prison, then shoot a cop to do what?

120
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,211
- That's what we have to find out.
- I'll hit the streets.

121
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,361
You have that look you always get right
before you tell Oliver something sagely.

122
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,324
Yes, and this is about Oliver.

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,682
You think I'm in denial?

124
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,566
I think Oliver challenged
the world's greatest assassin to a duel.

125
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,408
He survived Lian Yu...

126
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,080
...and Hong Kong,
and God knows what else.

127
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,487
He defeated Malcolm Merlyn...

128
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,808
...and Slade Wilson.

129
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,329
- You have to believe in him.
- Oh, I do believe in him, Felicity.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
It's just I'm preparing myself
for the possibility...

131
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,047
...that things didn't go Oliver's way.

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,208
Not this time.

133
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,727
You need to prepare yourself too.

134
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,846
Please, Oliver, where are you?

135
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,888
Y'all best step off.

136
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,369
Brick is a friend of mine.

137
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,887
You're more than a friend, Anton.

138
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,649
You're like a brother.

139
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,768
Always had my back, always loyal.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,889
Stand up.

141
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,369
So when they told me
someone ignored my orders to lay low...

142
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,360
...when they told me
one of my crew shot a cop...

143
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,801
...I beat the man who said it was you.

144
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,526
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,451
Danny, that cop...

146
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,571
...it was a mistake.

147
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,683
What we're planning here
requires two things.

148
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,764
No mistakes
and the cops not knowing anything.

149
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,725
They still don't.
Fisher's not gonna say anything.

150
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,241
Was this side job his idea or yours?

151
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,003
It doesn't have to be like this.

152
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,884
Bro.

153
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,211
I dropped my first body with that piece.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,083
You know the deal.
You take me down first, you walk out alive.

155
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,290
He actually tagged me. Ha, ha.

156
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,568
All yours, boys.

157
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,011
Your attorney doesn't
have your best interests at heart.

158
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,127
- Otherwise you'd be walking out a free man.
- Yeah, more like a dead man.

159
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,689
You think you scare me
more than Brick does? Think again.

160
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,531
You have a real nice day now.

161
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,446
No, he didn't flip.
He likes breathing too much.

162
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,451
When your opponent is the mountain,
you must be the sea.

163
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,768
When he's the sea,
you must be the mountain.

164
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,246
- Poetic.
- Switch your attacks.

165
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,402
Never do the same move
more than twice.

166
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,921
Otherwise, your opponent will learn
to read you.

167
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,961
Something like that?

168
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,930
Well, I wouldn't recommend texting
during a real fight.

169
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,609
Sorry, I thought it might be Ollie.

170
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,168
He hasn't been home, he hasn't
returned any of my calls or texts.

171
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,567
Didn't realize his absence
was weighing on you.

172
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,449
Not weighing, it's worrying.

173
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,446
If you like, I could have some
of my old associates...

174
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,120
...look into Oliver's whereabouts.
Would you?

175
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,931
Of course.

176
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,971
He's family.

177
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,169
According to Laurel, Fisher's lawyer called
Brick. With the time and place of the call...

178
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,163
Can you trace that call back
to where Brick is?

179
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,084
At least where his phone is.

180
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,369
His burner phone, to be exact.
It's at a warehouse in the Glades.

181
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,681
We'll check it out.

182
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,969
I'm gonna have to talk you in
from Palmer Tech. I'm crazy late.

183
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,847
- This is the only vulnerable entrance.
- Because it's not actually an entrance.

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,968
Not until we make it one.

185
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,409
I'll shoot out the glass.
You get in and find the Alpha.

186
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,209
You won't have much time
once we breach.

187
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,091
Two minutes max
before alarms draw the police.

188
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,891
Head directly for the lab.

189
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,281
We'll be right behind you.

190
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,445
You Okay?

191
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,004
Waller said when we get this done,
she'll get Tatsu back.

192
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,804
She's lying.

193
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,842
- On the move. Thirty seconds.
- Copy that.

194
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,846
I've got eyes on the target warehouse.
No signs of life.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,163
- Felicity, you seeing something?
- The warehouse doesn't have cameras.

196
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,567
Someone disabled the traffic cams
on that block.

197
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,683
Which means you're in the right place.

198
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,002
Sure ditching the Arrow suit
was a good idea?

199
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,407
Only if I need to move or shoot.

200
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,209
In position.

201
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,249
Clear.

202
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,968
Hey, I got something.

203
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,970
- It's not big enough to be Brick.
- Yeah, I know.

204
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,010
What's this?

205
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,801
- They burned their burners.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,970
Torching evidence. Tying up loose ends.

207
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,202
Evidence of what?

208
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,651
I don't know. These just look like numbers.

209
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,650
I found this.
Looks like some industrial blueprints.

210
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,724
Hmm.
These numbers look completely random.

211
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,645
I can run a pattern recognition algorithm.

212
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,771
Oliver?

213
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,970
Oliver?

214
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,929
Could you put the gun away?
They don't scare so much as annoy me.

215
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,769
I've only come here to talk.

216
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,282
Would it be possible to do that?

217
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,602
- Talk about what?
- Oliver.

218
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,370
- I need to know, is he still alive?
- He's alive.

219
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,003
Have you heard from him
since he went off to face Ra's al Ghul?

220
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,770
He's alive.

221
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,167
If he were,
you would have heard from him by now.

222
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,964
Unless Ra's took him prisoner.

223
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,050
The Demon's Head
does not take prisoners.

224
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,121
What are you doing?

225
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,762
I'm running the pattern analysis
on that list of numbers you guys found.

226
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,962
No, I mean, what's the point?

227
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,324
Malcolm Merlyn didn't tell us anything
we don't already know. Nothing has changed.

228
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,083
You're right, Felicity.
He didn't tell us anything new.

229
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,610
But he may have been right.

230
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,327
I know you think I'm in denial, but if
there's one thing Oliver taught me...

231
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,206
...taught us, is that sometimes
all you can do is keep pushing forward.

232
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,531
All right?

233
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,287
- I've got the ME's report.
- Did they ID the body?

234
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,891
Jose Anton.

235
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,560
Career criminal
with ties to Danny Brickwell.

236
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,331
I think Brick severed those ties
pretty thoroughly.

237
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,085
Is everything okay?

238
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,200
Where's Oliver?

239
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,801
He went to fight the head
of the League of Assassins.

240
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,411
What?

241
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,331
- Haven't heard from him since he left.
- And something else.

242
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,931
Malcolm Merlyn stopped
by for a little chat.

243
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,530
He says Oliver's dead.

244
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,491
- And you guys believe him?
- Look, Laurel, Merlyn said...

245
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,167
There isn't one thing Malcolm Merlyn
can say that any of us should believe.

246
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,123
This isn't the first time that I've heard
that Oliver was dead.

247
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,004
He's been back before.

248
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,251
He'll be back again.

249
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,205
I'm in.

250
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,131
Foundit

251
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,731
Hong Kong military?

252
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,803
The Triad. Chien Na Wei's men.

253
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,721
Any luck?

254
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,565
The number pattern is consistent
with cataloging numerics.

255
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,048
- What kind of catalog?
- If I knew, I would be telling you.

256
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,129
I'm sorry to interrupt.

257
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,444
- We really need to change the locks.
- What do you want?

258
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,490
The League conducts
matter of significance such as duels...

259
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,251
...on grounds sacred to its beliefs.

260
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,004
I went there...

261
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,761
...and found this.

262
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,761
It's Ra's' custom...

263
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,651
...to leave behind the
instrument of death...

264
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
...as a memorial to honor the fallen.

265
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,646
Merlyn, did you see Oliver's body?

266
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,569
He fell into a ravine.

267
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,646
His remains are unrecoverable, I'm afraid.

268
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,842
Then how do we know
that's Oliver's blood?

269
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,888
Because after I leave, you'll test it.

270
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,845
And after you confirm
that it is his blood...

271
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,249
...you'll exhaust yourself
with conspiracy theories...

272
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,603
...as to how I planted it
or how it's all a lie.

273
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,326
And after enough time passes...

274
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,124
...you'll be left with one inescapable
truth that Oliver Queen is dead.

275
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,169
This is your fault.

276
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,729
Oliver went there because of you,
because of what you did to Thea.

277
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,969
You made her a target for the League
so he would have to challenge Ra's...

278
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,043
...just to save her.

279
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,286
You killed him.

280
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,450
You are right.

281
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,327
And I will live with that guilt
for the rest of my days.

282
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,365
I'm truly sorry.

283
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,251
- I can see how much you loved him.
- Save it, Merlyn.

284
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,168
You're enjoying this.

285
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,448
Miss Smoak is correct.

286
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,682
I orchestrated the matter...

287
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,930
...to eliminate the death
warrant Ra's placed on my head.

288
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,605
Oliver was that weight.

289
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,610
His death means my own.

290
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,450
Good.

291
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,284
What's that?

292
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,447
The blood analysis on the scimitar.
It's Oliver's.

293
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,762
99.997 percent match.

294
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,122
If Merlyn's lying,
he's being thorough about it.

295
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,604
Felicity.

296
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,488
Thanks for not saying "I told you so."

297
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,722
- I gotta go to work.
- You really don't.

298
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,524
It's fine.

299
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,849
Glad we know now.

300
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,050
Run for the exit. I'll cover you.

301
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,806
- What about you?
- You need to get the Alpha out of here.

302
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,611
- But...
- Away from them. Go.

303
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,371
No.

304
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,481
You had him. Why didn't you take the shot?

305
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,763
We need to get out of here now.

306
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,369
You know, it's weird. I don't think
I've ever actually seen you drink alone.

307
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,724
Are you okay?

308
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,449
Yeah. I just got some bad news
about a friend.

309
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,449
Anyone I know?

310
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,689
How are you doing?

311
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,726
Still freaking out, actually.
Worried about Ollie.

312
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,887
I was gonna ask you a favor,
but it doesn't seem like the right time.

313
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,242
Well, it depends. What's the favor?

314
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,642
You and the Arrow, you're close, right?

315
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,844
I mean, that's you I've been seeing
on the news in the red hood.

316
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,611
- Thea...
- Look, I haven't seen him.

317
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,203
I haven't heard from him.
He's not answering any of my phone calls.

318
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,967
I'm actually starting to
get really worried...

319
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,528
...so I thought maybe the Arrow
could look for Oliver.

320
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,361
I just thought maybe if you saw him,
you could ask.

321
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,450
Thank you. You're the best.

322
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,211
I better go check the stockroom.

323
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,286
Thea just asked me to talk to the Arrow...

324
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,209
...about finding Oliver.

325
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,210
- What'd you tell her?
- What else? I lied.

326
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,123
- Oliver didn't want Thea to know.
- That was then.

327
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,924
But now, what's the point?

328
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,805
I keep asking myself
the same question, Roy.

329
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,406
Then why do you keep combing over
the case evidence?

330
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,126
Because it helps me
keep my mind off of Oliver.

331
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,524
Doing this without him, while we're waiting
for him to come back, is one thing.

332
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,247
But doing all this without him, without
him, that's a whole other situation.

333
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,762
What do you want me to tell you?
I can only see one inch in front of me.

334
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,731
And this is the only thing
in front of me right now.

335
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,603
I keep looking at this file and...

336
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,403
- Something about it feels familiar.
- Yeah.

337
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,371
Felicity did say Fisher and Anton
were connected with Brick.

338
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,090
No, it's more than that.

339
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,731
I've seen this file somewhere...

340
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,401
...else.

341
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,088
- What are the chances that's a coincidence?
- Only one way to find out.

342
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,651
What are you doing?

343
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,723
Bringing up the case numbers
on all the guys...

344
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,281
...who were put away
over the past eight months.

345
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,525
- Some of these are guys that we caught.
- Yeah.

346
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,644
And others were apprehended
by the authorities.

347
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,928
There's a pattern here.

348
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,841
All these guys are awaiting trial
for assault...

349
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,361
...assault with intent to murder,
attempted murder.

350
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,126
Street enforcers. Muscle.

351
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,324
Why would Brick have a list
of these case numbers?

352
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,362
I'm sure you're wondering
if I ever go home.

353
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,166
Unfortunately for my assistant,
the answer is no.

354
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,727
Any luck with our nanite problems?

355
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,770
- No.
- Yeah, it's the transplex interface, isn't it?

356
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,604
I knew my designs were off.

357
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,167
It won't work.

358
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,409
- Yeah, you've only been at it for a day, so...
- Not the chip.

359
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,523
Not your suit.

360
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,730
Your plan.

361
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,806
It won't work.

362
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,083
You make it sound like
using an enhanced exoskeleton...

363
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,602
...to fight crime and save the city
is a Looney Tune idea.

364
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,289
It won't bring her back.

365
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,205
Anna.

366
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,601
Your fiancée.

367
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,043
- I know who she is.
- She's not coming back.

368
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,528
When we lose someone...

369
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,245
...when someone dies...

370
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,604
...they're gone...

371
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,170
...forever, and there is nothing...

372
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,330
There is nothing...

373
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,565
...nothing that we can do
that is going to bring them back.

374
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,161
So you have to stop.

375
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,369
You have to stop because
it's not what Anna would have wanted.

376
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,523
- It's...
- You're upset, I can see that.

377
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,927
And if you want, we can talk about it.

378
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,523
But never tell me again
what Anna would have wanted.

379
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,488
You don't get to do that.

380
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,723
I am sorry.

381
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,563
I shouldn't be here right now.

382
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,163
- What?
- We got something on Brick.

383
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,840
The blueprints we found,
they're schematics...

384
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,328
...for the warehouse where the police store
all physical evidence.

385
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,608
And Brick has a list of case numbers.

386
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,566
He might be looking to steal or destroy
evidence to get those cases thrown out.

387
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,240
Yeah. I'll call Lance, tell him.

388
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,802
A lot of these cases are guys
we've put away over the past eight months.

389
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,482
This is everything we've been doing
since we took Slade down.

390
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,168
This is everything Oliver was working for.

391
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,450
I'll be right there.

392
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,084
Three minutes.

393
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,130
Seal off every exit.
Give me a two-block perimeter.

394
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,046
John, shooter at your 5.

395
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,284
I'm out.

396
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,125
Here.

397
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,010
Use mine.

398
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,969
So here's the deal.

399
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,090
You take me down, you walk out alive.

400
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,931
I don't fancy your chances, though.

401
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,610
Smart man.

402
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,525
Nobody thinks about going for a head shot.

403
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,641
Shots fired.
I need an ESU and backup here now.

404
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,929
Felicity, where's Diggle? I'm pinned down.

405
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,083
Felicity.

406
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,811
Felicity.

407
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,201
Any last words?

408
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,962
Or are my hands too tight
around your neck?

409
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,728
I guess arrows work a little better
on this guy than bullets.

410
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,001
You Okay?

411
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,731
Yeah, I will be
after we find the son of a bitch.

412
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,765
Damn it.

413
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,004
Oh, my God, John.

414
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,089
It's okay. It's all right, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

415
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,570
- Brick?
- Got away.

416
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,883
They put one guard in the hospital,
but he's gonna pull through.

417
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,162
If that door hadn't shut,
we would've had him.

418
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,169
It's just our bad luck.

419
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,564
Unless it wasn't.

420
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,610
You were pinned down. You both were.
They were gonna kill you.

421
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,246
- Felicity.
- You did that?

422
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,643
They had machine guns.
You had a bow and arrow.

423
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,563
You let him get away?

424
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,603
I saved your lives.

425
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,644
Felicity, it wasn't your call to make.

426
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,687
It wasn't my call to let Oliver go challenge
Ra's al Ghul to a fight to the death either.

427
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,486
Brick has who knows how much evidence,
Felicity.

428
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,969
And it was either that or the two of you, my
friends being killed, so I made my choice.

429
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,210
I chose not to let anyone else
I care about die.

430
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,290
We've been in tough spots.
We've always managed to come out.

431
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,890
No.

432
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,810
Oliver did.

433
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,607
But he's not here anymore...

434
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,006
...because he's dead.

435
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,725
Okay.

436
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,171
The point is,
if we're gonna do this without Oliver...

437
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,528
...Felicity, we have to trust each other.

438
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,846
You don't get it.

439
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,570
There is no "this" without him.

440
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,005
It's done. I'm done.

441
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,850
I'm sorry...

442
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,367
...but I had no one else to turn to...

443
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,722
...and he needs your help.

444
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,282
I was out of line.

445
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,686
And I'm sorry.

446
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,924
You wanna tell me what had you so upset?

447
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,768
I lost a friend of mine.

448
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,765
He was more than a friend, actually.
He was...

449
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,484
I'm not sure what we were...

450
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,845
...but he's gone.

451
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,361
I'm sorry.

452
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,724
And three months ago,
another friend of mine died.

453
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,962
I'm 25 years old.

454
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,886
I'm over my quota
where losing friends are concerned.

455
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,530
And you're a friend.

456
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,847
So if you wanna go out there...

457
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,161
If you want to commit suicide,
I can't stop you.

458
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,122
But I don't have to help you.

459
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,211
Eight months to put them away...

460
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,370
...eight minutes to set them loose.

461
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,290
I'm sorry.

462
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,211
I tried.

463
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,367
Without the evidence,
the judge had to let them go.

464
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,767
He's not coming back.

465
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,205
Oliver.

466
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,882
I know you don't wanna believe it, Laurel.
God knows I don't, but...

467
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,724
He's not coming back.

468
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,441
Are you?

469
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,921
Are you coming back?

470
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,210
I don't know.

471
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,690
For the first time since
I met Oliver Queen...

472
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,448
...I don't know what happens next.

473
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,363
I know it's silly, but I...

474
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,648
...still like to think of myself
as Oliver's bodyguard.

475
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,042
I just couldn't protect him.

476
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,169
It's funny. He was worried
something would happen to me.

477
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,570
I could have killed you.

478
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,530
Heh. It's cute that you think so.

479
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,001
Did you hear anything about Ollie?

480
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,725
I'm afraid not.

481
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,125
Then what are you doing here?

482
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,969
We're in danger, Thea.

483
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,131
We need to leave Starling City
and never return.

484
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,522
Thank you all for coming.

485
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,805
But seeing as I'm the reason none of you
are sitting in a prison cell right now...

486
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,651
...I figure it's the least you could do.

487
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,646
And I'm the guy that made
all the evidence against you go away.

488
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,243
But as you can see...

489
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,647
...it didn't go too far.

490
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,211
You are all part of my crew now.

491
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,562
And if any of you
have a problem with that...

492
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,282
...I can send a gift-wrapped package
to the DA.

493
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,608
Together,
not only will we make a lot of money...

494
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,882
...we will make history.

495
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,528
Together,
we are gonna take over the Glades.

496
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,920
You think Brick's crazy?

497
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,090
Take over a whole section of town?
I know he's crazy.

498
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,643
I don't know what he's got planned,
but whatever it is, I'm in.

499
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,331
Who the hell are you?

500
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,364
I'm the justice you can't run from.

501
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,446
Well done, Mr. Queen.

502
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,327
I'm glad to know my investment in you
hasn't entirely been for naught.

503
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,802
Although I was disappointed to read
Agent Pearson's after action report.

504
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,241
You let one of Chien Na Wei's men
get away.

505
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,485
- I hesitated. It was a mistake.
- It really was.

506
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,769
Now we have no one to interrogate.

507
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,171
You mean, torture. Right?

508
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,968
I saw you with that man.

509
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,969
You didn't hesitate.

510
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,488
You chose not to shoot him.

511
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,887
I put the GPS from the file in his pocket,
and now he is gonna lead us right to Tatsu.

512
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,802
We are gonna get her back, Maseo,
I promise.

513
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,404
Oliver...

514
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,403
...what you've done...

515
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,367
...I will be forever in your debt.

516
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,121
Don't move. You'll pull out the sutures...

517
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,325
...Oliver.

518
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,410
Tatsu.

519
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,171
- How?
- I asked her to come here...

520
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,482
...so she could bring you back to life.
