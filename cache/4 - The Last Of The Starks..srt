00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Episode 4 - The Last Of The Starks.

2
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,470
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

3
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,556
To our fathers and mothers.

4
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,517
To our friends.

5
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:32,648
Our fellow men and women
who set aside their differences...

6
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,443
to fight together...

7
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,863
and die together

8
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,783
so that others might live.

9
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,078
Everyone in this world

10
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,499
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

11
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,836
It is our duty and our honour

12
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,506
to keep them alive in memory...

13
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,051
for those who come after us

14
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,179
and those who come after them,

15
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,558
for as long as men draw breath.

16
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:13,356
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

17
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,527
And we shall never see
their like again.

18
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,499
Have you seen Arya?

19
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,087
You can still smell
the burning bodies,

20
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,439
and that's where your head is at?

21
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,133
- I just want to thank her for...
- I'm sure you do.

22
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,553
- Look, it's not about that.
- Of course it's about that, you twat.

23
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,721
Why shouldn't it be?

24
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,432
The dead are dead. You're not.

25
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,238
Gendry.

26
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,576
That's right, isn't it?

27
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,208
Yes, Your Grace.

28
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,502
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

29
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,844
You are aware
he took my family's throne

30
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,637
and tried to have me murdered?

31
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,433
I didn't even know he was my father
until after he was dead.

32
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,519
Yes, he's dead.

33
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,563
His brothers are, too.

34
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,859
So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

35
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,904
I don't know, Your Grace.

36
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,822
Does anyone?

37
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,627
I think you should be
Lord of Storm's End.

38
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,592
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

39
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,679
No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End,

40
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,641
the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

41
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,852
Because that is what I have made you.

42
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:14,532
To Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End.

43
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,409
To Gendry!

44
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,869
Lord Gendry!

45
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,706
Gendry!

46
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,792
- Gendry!
- Gendry!

47
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,211
Lord Gendry!

48
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,214
Gendry!

49
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,844
That's easy, isn't it?

50
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,766
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Uh, hold on.

51
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,061
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

52
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,938
- Come, my lord.
- See?

53
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,357
You're not the only one who's clever.

54
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,786
I have to go down
and get another barrel.

55
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,793
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

56
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:11,005
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

57
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:26,312
The last time I saw her, I told her
I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

58
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,981
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

59
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,609
- I do.
- So did you?

60
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:34,820
Never got the chance.

61
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,239
She did it to herself.

62
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,535
Or her god did it to her.

63
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,331
The Lord of Light.

64
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,752
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

65
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,878
and then

66
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,546
he off.

67
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,842
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

68
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,012
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

69
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,139
will leave you
any happier than before.

70
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,743
And what if
I'm not trying to be happy?

71
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,728
Then you're in luck.

72
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,941
We may have defeated them,

73
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,277
but we still have us to contend with.

74
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,743
Thank you. I feel much better.

75
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,341
More ale!

76
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,803
This is clever.

77
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,182
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

78
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,769
It's the same as the one
Daeron Targaryen built

79
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,772
for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

80
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,774
I liked that one.

81
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,860
You know our history
better than anyone.

82
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,489
That will be useful
as Lord of Winterfell.

83
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,033
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

84
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,995
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of Ned Stark.

85
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,084
You don't want it.

86
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,296
I don't really want anymore.

87
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,382
I envy you.

88
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,095
You shouldn't envy me.

89
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,598
Mostly I live in the past.

90
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:33,731
- All of it.
- Go on.

91
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,734
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

92
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,336
We have to
celebrate our victory.

93
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,321
Vomiting is not celebrating.

94
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,655
Yes, it is.

95
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,866
Ah!

96
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,451
To the Dragon Queen!

97
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,789
To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

98
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,712
Drink!

99
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,060
I'm fine!

100
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,783
Your turn.

101
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,451
Um...

102
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,372
- You are an only child.
- Oh.

103
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,166
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

104
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,418
- I did.
- I surmised it.

105
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,462
Mm-hm. Drink.

106
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,339
Go again.

107
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,424
Why does he get to go again?

108
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,426
Because it's my game.

109
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,055
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

110
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,059
- Uh...
- Drink.

111
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,396
The other way around!

112
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,523
I saw him riding that thing.

113
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,401
- We all did.
- No. No.

114
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,821
I saw him riding that thing.

115
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,906
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

116
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,326
That's why we all agreed
to follow him.

117
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,829
That's the kind of man he is.

118
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:14,581
He's little...

119
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,459
...but he's strong.

120
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,671
Strong enough to befriend an enemy

121
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,047
and get murdered for it!

122
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:26,552
Most people get bloody murdered,
they stay that way.

123
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,387
Not this one.

124
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,420
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

125
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,561
He comes back and keeps fighting.

126
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:39,022
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

127
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,401
He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.

128
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,028
He climbed on a dragon
and fought.

129
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,073
What kind of person
climbs on a dragon?

130
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:51,368
A madman or a king!

131
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,719
- Drink.
- Drink.

132
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,679
Drink.

133
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,543
Wrong!

134
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,712
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

135
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,090
Mmm!

136
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,344
You were married. Before Sansa.

137
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,930
Drink.

138
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,728
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

139
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,688
No!

140
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,702
You're a virgin.

141
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,168
That's a statement about the present.

142
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,046
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

143
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,923
have you slept with a man.

144
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:30,717
Or a woman.

145
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,267
I have to piss.

146
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,021
We did it! We faced those icy

147
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,942
Looked right into their blue eyes,
and here we are.

148
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,613
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

149
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,120
Please pardon me for a moment.

150
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,349
Drink it!

151
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,747
And after all that,

152
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,542
this comes north
and takes her from me.

153
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,128
Just takes her, like that.

154
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,673
I mean it, Clegane.

155
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,425
My heart is broken.

156
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,843
Don't touch me.

157
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,428
You can touch me.

158
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,514
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

159
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,308
Maybe you should be.

160
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,147
Well, Clegane...

161
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,567
it's time to drown our sorrows.

162
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,444
I'm not done with my drink.

163
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,364
You saved the day.

164
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,008
You owe me one.

165
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,369
- Don't forget that.
- For the rest of my days.

166
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,954
Are you ready now?

167
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,332
This is my drink.

168
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:43,266
She could have made you happy,
for a little while.

169
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,772
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

170
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,026
- And what's that?
- That's my business.

171
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,825
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

172
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,285
That was a long time ago.

173
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,497
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

174
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,207
Yes, I've heard.

175
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,668
Heard you were broken in.

176
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,254
Heard you were broken in rough.

177
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:17,175
And he got what he deserved.
I gave it to him.

178
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,553
How?

179
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:21,930
Hounds.

180
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,686
You've changed, little bird.

181
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,237
None of it would have happened
if you'd left King's Landing with me.

182
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,282
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

183
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,201
none of it.

184
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,254
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

185
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,757
I would have stayed
a little bird all my life.

186
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,905
- Hey!
- Pour another one.

187
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,410
Hey!

188
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,336
Don't shoot.

189
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,884
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

190
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,511
You should be celebrating with them.

191
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,846
I am celebrating.

192
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,225
Yeah, I am, too.

193
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,146
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

194
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,316
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

195
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,360
By order of the queen.

196
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:01,655
Congratulations.

197
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,035
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

198
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,662
I hardly know how to use a fork.

199
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,873
All I know is that you're beautiful,
and I love you,

200
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,960
and none of it will be worth anything
if you're not with me.

201
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,420
So be with me.

202
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,345
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

203
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,202
You'll be a wonderful lord,

204
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,164
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

205
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,001
But I'm not a lady.

206
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,795
I never have been.

207
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,257
That's not me.

208
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,659
You didn't drink.

209
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,289
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

210
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,835
- I drank.
- In the game. This is Dornish.

211
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:45,216
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

212
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,344
Suit yourself.

213
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,273
Well, you keep it warm enough in here.

214
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,446
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

215
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,448
Keep your fire going.

216
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,079
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

217
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,745
Well, that's very diligent.
Very responsible.

218
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,622
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

219
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:16,831
I learned in the North?

220
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,668
I hate the North.

221
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,170
It grows on you.

222
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,341
I don't want things growing on me.

223
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,928
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

224
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,555
Has he grown on you?

225
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,017
He was very sad when you left.

226
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,562
You sound quite jealous.

227
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,233
I do, don't I?

228
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,573
It's bloody hot in here.

229
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,960
Oh, move aside.

230
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,675
What are you doing?

231
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,885
I'm taking your shirt off.

232
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,268
I've never slept with a knight before.

233
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:04,105
I've never slept with anyone before.

234
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,860
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

235
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:10,987
I told you...

236
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,712
Are you drunk?

237
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:33,968
No.

238
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,682
Only a little.

239
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,112
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

240
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,697
but I know this.

241
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:59,911
If he could have chosen a way to die,
it would have been protecting you.

242
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,664
He loved me.

243
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,127
And I couldn't love him back.

244
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,172
Not the way he wanted.

245
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:16,594
Not the way I love you.

246
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,890
Is that all right?

247
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,765
I wish you'd never told me.

248
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,810
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

249
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,397
I try to forget.

250
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,358
Tonight I did for a while,

251
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:15,153
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

252
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,406
I saw the way they looked at you.

253
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,451
I know that look.

254
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,080
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

255
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,583
Never on this side of the sea.

256
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,044
I told you I don't want it.

257
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,921
It doesn't matter what you want.

258
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,216
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

259
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,110
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

260
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,802
and take what is mine?

261
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,515
I'll refuse.

262
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,727
You are my queen.
I don't know what else I can say.

263
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,896
You can say nothing.

264
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,606
To anyone, ever.

265
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,358
Never tell them who you really are.

266
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,027
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

267
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,612
and tell no one else.

268
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,740
Or it will take on a life of its own
and you won't be able to control it

269
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,242
or what it does to people.

270
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:04,786
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

271
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,829
no matter what you swear.

272
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,963
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

273
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,641
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

274
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:32,897
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

275
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,065
She won't.

276
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,985
She's not the girl you grew up with.

277
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,696
Not after what she's seen,

278
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,240
not after what they've done to her.

279
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,537
I owe them the truth.

280
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,040
Even if the truth destroys us?

281
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,875
- It won't.
- It will.

282
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,213
I've never begged for anything...

283
00:29:58,423 --> 00:29:59,799
but I'm begging you.

284
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,720
Don't do this. Please.

285
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,936
You are my queen.

286
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,106
Nothing will change that.

287
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,777
And they are my family.

288
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,364
We can live together.

289
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,496
We can.

290
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,208
I've just told you how.

291
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,621
Half are gone.

292
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:16,959
The Northmen as well.

293
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:27,428
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

294
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,305
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

295
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,517
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

296
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,436
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

297
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,397
that we saved them...

298
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,482
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

299
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:42,819
We will hit her hard.

300
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,488
We will rip her out root and stem.

301
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,617
The objective here is to remove Cersei

302
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,702
without destroying King's Landing.

303
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,876
Thankfully,
she is losing allies by the day.

304
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,631
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands in her queen's name.

305
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,467
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

306
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,761
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

307
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,388
as long as she sits
on the Iron Throne,

308
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,224
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

309
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,519
We need the capital.

310
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,355
I watched the people
of King's Landing

311
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,399
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

312
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,484
and that was before winter began.

313
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:27,280
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

314
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,783
We'll surround the city.

315
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,786
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

316
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,496
the dragons will destroy them.

317
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,541
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

318
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,209
we'll defeat them in the field.

319
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:43,129
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

320
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,423
her reign is over.

321
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,221
All right.

322
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:54,974
The men we have left
are exhausted.

323
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,435
Many of them are wounded.

324
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,605
They'll fight better if they have
time to rest and recuperate.

325
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,107
How long do you suggest?

326
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:07,695
I can't say for certain,
not without talking to the officers.

327
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,035
I came north to fight alongside you

328
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,746
at great cost to my armies and myself.

329
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:22,210
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate, you want to postpone.

330
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,213
It's not just our people. It's yours.

331
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:29,050
You want to throw them into a war
they're not ready to fight?

332
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,345
The longer I leave my enemies alone,
the stronger they become.

333
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,893
The Northern forces
will honour their promises

334
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,314
and their allegiance
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

335
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,571
What you command, we will obey.

336
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,369
So...

337
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,288
if all are in agreement...

338
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:03,167
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

339
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,293
with the Northern troops

340
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:07,088
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

341
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,049
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

342
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,551
and sail from there to Dragonstone

343
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:15,221
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

344
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:20,268
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

345
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,231
We have won the Great War.

346
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,942
Now we will win the Last War.

347
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,279
In all Seven Kingdoms,

348
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,115
men will live without fear and cruelty

349
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,826
under their rightful queen.

350
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,257
We need a word.

351
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:58,097
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

352
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,850
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

353
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,452
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

354
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,478
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell...

355
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:05,813
And we will never forget them.

356
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,000
That doesn't mean
that I want to kneel to someone who...

357
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,693
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

358
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:11,986
I respect that.

359
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,198
You respect it?

360
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,576
We needed her.

361
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,122
We needed her army, her dragons.

362
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,334
You did the right thing.

363
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,295
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

364
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,796
we don't trust your queen.

365
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:35,259
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

366
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:36,594
She's not one of us.

367
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,554
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

368
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:39,847
you won't make many allies.

369
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,015
That's all right.

370
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,142
I don't need many allies.

371
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:46,020
- Arya...
- We're family.

372
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,522
The four of us.

373
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,275
The last of the Starks.

374
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:56,989
I've never been a Stark.

375
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,949
You are.

376
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,286
You're just as much Ned Stark's child
as any of us.

377
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:04,121
You're my brother.

378
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,208
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

379
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,335
My brother.

380
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,344
It's your choice.

381
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,561
I need to tell you something.

382
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:33,192
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

383
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,488
What is it?

384
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,826
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

385
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:45,454
How can I promise to keep a secret
if I don't even know what it is?

386
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:46,956
Because we're family.

387
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,379
Swear it.

388
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,631
I swear it.

389
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:01,762
I swear it.

390
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,021
Tell them.

391
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,576
So she's going to stay here with you?

392
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:29,290
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

393
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:34,754
Say something snide.

394
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:36,881
I'm happy.

395
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,632
I'm happy that you're happy.

396
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,889
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

397
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,227
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

398
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:52,980
To climbing mountains.

399
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,316
To climbing mountains.

400
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,154
- What's she like down there?
- What?

401
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,948
That's not your concern.

402
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:05,701
I haven't been with a woman for years.

403
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,244
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

404
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,413
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

405
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:11,624
I knew you were her.

406
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,002
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

407
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,796
Must be like looking in the mirror.

408
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,422
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

409
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,300
Where's your drink?

410
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,154
What are you...
What are you doing up North?

411
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,513
What are you doing with that?

412
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:26,680
Oh, this?

413
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,891
This is for you.

414
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,018
For both of you.

415
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,229
You're supposed to be south.

416
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,523
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated

417
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:36,875
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

418
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,026
Year after year,
I've shovelled Lannister shit,

419
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,236
and what do I have to show?

420
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,904
You're a knight, thanks to me.

421
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,781
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

422
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,741
as a blond hair
from your brother's

423
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,535
Power resides where men believe...

424
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,245
Shut your mouth.

425
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,973
- I'm just trying...
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

426
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,124
but say another word
and I will belt you.

427
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,751
See, I don't believe you'd do that.

428
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,231
You couldn't do it on your best day,
you one-handed

429
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,631
And your best days are long gone.

430
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,925
You broke my nose!

431
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,903
- I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

432
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:07,179
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

433
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,306
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

434
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,601
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

435
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,812
Nice big castle, good lands,

436
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,373
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

437
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:17,773
And you trust Cersei...

438
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,484
I knew your sister was dead
the second I saw those dragons.

439
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:23,112
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

440
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,114
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

441
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,575
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

442
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,704
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

443
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,375
And that's good.
Of course, the odds change

444
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,544
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

445
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,589
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

446
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:43,382
- All of a sudden...
- May I speak?

447
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,010
Why not? Only death will shut you up.

448
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,224
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

449
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:55,436
If anyone offered me money
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

450
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,354
What's double Riverrun?

451
00:39:58,397 --> 00:39:59,607
Highgarden.

452
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,277
You could be Lord of the Reach.

453
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,030
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

454
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:08,908
He's not going to kill us.
He wouldn't be talking to us if...

455
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,537
The way I see it,

456
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,581
I only need
one of the Lannister brothers alive.

457
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,417
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

458
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,628
No? Who were your ancestors,

459
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,838
the ones who made your family rich?

460
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,506
Fancy lads in silk?

461
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,175
They were cut-throats.

462
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,886
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

463
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:31,388
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

464
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,515
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

465
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,768
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

466
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:40,314
And then all your
grandsons can ruin the family

467
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:41,815
with their ways.

468
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:46,654
Highgarden.

469
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:49,531
Give me your word.

470
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,243
You have my word.

471
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,457
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

472
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,418
We ride south in the morning.

473
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:05,589
We could use an officer with
knowledge of the city's defences.

474
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:06,966
Oh, no.

475
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,009
No, my fighting days are done.

476
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,596
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

477
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,474
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

478
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,810
Till then, don't die.

479
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,339
On your own?

480
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,092
Not anymore.

481
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,178
I don't like crowds.

482
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:55,931
Me neither.

483
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,268
Why not? They all love you now.

484
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,978
You're the big hero.

485
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:03,313
Don't like heroes.

486
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:09,111
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned

487
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:11,947
Felt better than dying.

488
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,286
You're heading to King's Landing?

489
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,497
I have some unfinished business.

490
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,292
Me too.

491
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,925
I don't plan on coming back.

492
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,512
Neither do I.

493
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,975
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

494
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,312
Probably.

495
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:28,440
My lady.

496
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,447
"My lord" is the standard response.

497
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:38,951
Why her?

498
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,998
You know
she loves your brother.

499
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,751
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

500
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:51,380
You seem determined to dislike her.

501
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,717
A good relationship
between the Iron Throne and the North

502
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,762
has been the core of every peaceful,
prosperous reign we've ever known.

503
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:02,641
Jon will be Warden of the North,
so a good relationship seems likely.

504
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,688
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

505
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,398
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

506
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:15,362
Sansa, look at me.

507
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:25,581
With Jon in the capital,
you'll be the true power in the North.

508
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:29,168
I'd feel much better about the future
if I left here today

509
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:31,211
believing that you and Daenerys
were allies.

510
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:34,923
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

511
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:37,801
- Your queen still has her dragons...
- She's your queen, too.

512
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,685
You don't have to be her friend.

513
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,645
But why provoke her?

514
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:51,481
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

515
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:53,567
- or the North, or...?
- You're afraid of her.

516
00:44:56,528 --> 00:45:00,282
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

517
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,787
I don't want Jon to go down there.

518
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,749
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

519
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:13,086
No, but as your brother once told me,
he's not a Stark.

520
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:20,510
Are you all right?

521
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:29,811
Her people love her, you've seen that.

522
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,231
You've seen how they fight for her.

523
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:35,651
She wants to make the world
a better place.

524
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:39,071
I believe in her.

525
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:55,629
Tyrion.

526
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,385
What if there's someone else?

527
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:02,678
Someone better?

528
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,480
You're not gonna
ride the dragon south?

529
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:18,318
Just a horse.

530
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:20,946
Rhaegal needs to heal.

531
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,073
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

532
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,993
You weigh as much
as two fleas

533
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,204
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

534
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,124
We've had enough of the south.

535
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,876
The women down here don't like me.

536
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:38,755
This is the North, you know.

537
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,759
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

538
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,387
It isn't home.

539
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,681
We need room to wander.

540
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,950
I'll take them back
through Castle Black

541
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,768
as soon as the winter storms pass.

542
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:53,854
Back where we belong.

543
00:46:58,108 --> 00:46:59,818
It's where he belongs, too.

544
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,571
A dire wolf has no place in the South.

545
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:05,741
Will you take him with you?

546
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,411
He'll be happier up there.

547
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:12,289
So would you.

548
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:16,126
I wish I was going with you.

549
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,299
This is farewell, then.

550
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:25,302
You never know.

551
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,019
You've got the North in you.

552
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:36,980
The real North.

553
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:12,641
Yes, well, um,
the nights have been getting longer

554
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,852
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

555
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:18,105
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we...

556
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:20,941
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

557
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,738
If it's a boy,
we want to name him "Jon."

558
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:31,535
I hope it's a girl.

559
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,556
You're the best friend I ever had.

560
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:56,268
You too, Sam.

561
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,915
Think of the past 20 years.

562
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,376
The war, the murder, the misery.

563
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,338
All of it because Robert Baratheon
loved someone

564
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,298
who didn't love him back.

565
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,593
How many others know?

566
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:16,139
Including us? Eight.

567
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:18,183
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

568
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:19,684
It's information.

569
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:23,480
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

570
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:24,856
Then what happens?

571
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,691
She loses the North.

572
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:29,486
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

573
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,112
No, it's worse than that.

574
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:32,781
He has the better claim to the throne.

575
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:35,700
He doesn't want the throne.

576
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:38,245
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

577
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:42,749
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

578
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,834
Wildlings, Northmen.

579
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,171
He's a war hero.

580
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,052
He loves our queen.

581
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,556
And she loves him.

582
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:02,435
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

583
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:04,563
She's his aunt.

584
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,040
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

585
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,732
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

586
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:09,901
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

587
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:14,364
You know our queen better than I do.

588
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,127
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

589
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:20,036
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

590
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,789
Something she has in common
with every monarch who ever lived.

591
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:25,709
I worry about her state of mind.

592
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:27,961
We are advisors to the queen.

593
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:31,256
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

594
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,433
We still have to take King's Landing.

595
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,644
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

596
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:46,855
That would solve our problems.

597
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,440
Get to the skiff. Now!

598
00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:56,568
Spears!

599
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:58,570
They're coming round again!

600
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:09,122
Go!

601
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,457
Clear!

602
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,127
No!

603
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:33,719
- Go!
- Clear!

604
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,476
Missandei?

605
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:14,354
Missandei!

606
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:21,736
Missandei!

607
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,827
Our message
was well-received, then?

608
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:32,121
Your people have heard
the usurper is coming.

609
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:37,085
They are grateful for your protection
within the walls of the Red Keep.

610
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:40,755
You're certain about the dragon?

611
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:43,633
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

612
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,802
That must have been glorious.

613
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,390
The glory is yours, my queen.

614
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,143
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

615
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:55,979
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

616
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:00,567
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

617
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,085
She's coming for you.

618
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:21,462
Of course she is.

619
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,925
Keep the gates open.

620
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:28,654
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

621
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:30,889
thousands of innocent people first.

622
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:39,439
So much for the "Breaker of Chains."

623
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,830
We will storm the city,
my queen.

624
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:58,666
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

625
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,418
Your Grace.

626
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:05,757
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

627
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,926
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

628
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,932
This is a mistake.

629
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:19,354
You saw my child fall from the sky.

630
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:22,440
They took Missandei.

631
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:25,234
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

632
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:29,322
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

633
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:33,034
and the Dothraki, tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

634
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:36,621
That is why Cersei
is bringing them into the Red Keep.

635
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:41,084
These are the people
you came here to protect.

636
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,127
I beg you, Your Grace.

637
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:46,547
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

638
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:50,802
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

639
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:58,017
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

640
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:05,274
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

641
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,111
That is my destiny...

642
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,948
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

643
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:21,916
It could be a fortnight
before Jon and the allied armies

644
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,209
make it to King's Landing.

645
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:27,088
In the meantime,
demand Cersei's surrender.

646
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,341
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

647
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:34,470
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

648
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:36,305
we should make the effort.

649
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,350
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

650
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,022
But perhaps it's good the people see

651
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:47,817
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

652
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,194
and Cersei Lannister refused.

653
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:55,199
They should know whom to blame
when the sky falls down upon them.

654
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,341
I've served tyrants most of my life.

655
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:15,762
They all talk about destiny.

656
00:59:16,888 --> 00:59:19,932
She's a girl who walked into a fire
with three stones

657
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:22,643
and walked out with three dragons.

658
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,480
How could she not believe in destiny?

659
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:27,565
Perhaps that's the problem.

660
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:30,651
Her life has convinced her that
she was sent here to save us all.

661
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:32,570
And how do you know she wasn't?

662
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:36,699
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

663
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:46,084
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

664
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:49,087
You know them both.

665
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,215
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

666
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:59,435
He doesn't want the throne.

667
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,933
That's why he bent the knee.

668
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,143
Have you considered the best ruler

669
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:05,937
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

670
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:09,023
We're discussing treason.

671
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:11,829
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

672
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,695
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

673
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,659
He's temperate and measured.

674
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:23,913
He's a man, which makes him more
appealing to the lords of Westeros,

675
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,456
whose support we are going to need.

676
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,209
Joffrey was a man.

677
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,253
I don't think
is a true qualification,

678
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:31,420
as I'm sure you'd agree.

679
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:33,589
And he's the heir to the throne.

680
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:37,468
Yes, because he's a man.
Are important, I'm afraid.

681
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,640
What about my earlier proposal?

682
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,726
They could rule together
as king and queen.

683
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,063
She's too strong for him.

684
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:53,401
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

685
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:56,070
He could temper her worst impulses.

686
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:57,947
As you have?

687
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:03,202
You're drinking quite a lot.

688
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:09,208
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

689
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,752
Jon's the one man alive

690
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:14,881
who might actually be able to keep
the North in the Seven Kingdoms.

691
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:16,441
How many kings and queens
have you served?

692
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:17,758
Five? Six? I've lost count.

693
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:20,011
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

694
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,694
you choose a person you believe in,
and you fight for that person.

695
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:25,183
Even if you know it's a mistake?

696
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,811
I believe in our queen.

697
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,857
She'll make the right choice.

698
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:37,945
With the help of her loyal advisors.

699
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:44,076
You know where my loyalty stands.

700
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,495
You know I will never
betray the realm.

701
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,080
What is the realm?

702
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:49,999
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

703
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:52,210
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

704
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,128
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

705
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:56,422
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

706
01:01:57,173 --> 01:02:00,134
We don't know their names,
but they're just as real as you and I.

707
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:01,510
They deserve to live.

708
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:03,429
They deserve food for their children.

709
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:11,145
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

710
01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:15,858
So, what happens to her?

711
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:24,825
Please.

712
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:28,871
Don't.

713
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,670
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

714
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,674
Each of us has a choice to make.

715
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:43,261
I pray we choose wisely.

716
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,912
All right,
I'll put another one on it.

717
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:03,590
He's headed down to the cellar.

718
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:06,826
- I'll need a cart over here.
- That's it, thanks.

719
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,744
Thank you.

720
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,631
...as are the rest of her advisors.

721
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:24,218
What happened?

722
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:32,893
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

723
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,398
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

724
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,899
Missandei captured.

725
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:44,739
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

726
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:47,616
Seems like I won't get the chance.

727
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:57,061
They're going to destroy that city.

728
01:04:58,437 --> 01:04:59,939
You know they will.

729
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:02,608
Have you ever
run away from a fight?

730
01:05:04,402 --> 01:05:07,029
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

731
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,281
You're better than she is.

732
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:11,867
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

733
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:13,786
You don't need to die with her.

734
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,579
Stay here.

735
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:18,749
Stay with me.

736
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:21,627
Please.

737
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:24,463
Stay.

738
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:32,763
You think I'm a good man?

739
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:41,897
I pushed a boy out a tower window,
crippled him for life

740
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,774
for Cersei.

741
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:49,697
I strangled my cousin
with my own hands

742
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,783
just to get back to Cersei.

743
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:57,246
I would have murdered

744
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,708
every man, woman and child in Riverrun

745
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,710
for Cersei.

746
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:12,970
She's hateful.

747
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:16,432
And so am I.

748
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:52,671
My lord.

749
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:59,053
Queen Daenerys demands
Cersei's unconditional surrender

750
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,680
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

751
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:07,561
Queen Cersei demands
Daenerys's unconditional surrender.

752
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:11,523
If she refuses, Missandei of Naath
will die here and now.

753
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:14,568
Qyburn...

754
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,821
you're a rational man.

755
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:20,407
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

756
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,368
We have a chance here,

757
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:26,580
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

758
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:28,290
Yes.

759
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:31,001
Help me.

760
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:34,380
I don't want to see this city burn.

761
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:38,342
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

762
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:43,305
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

763
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,768
I... I don't want to hear it.

764
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,187
Help me save this city.

765
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:54,817
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

766
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,110
Your queen.

767
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:58,821
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

768
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,030
You are her subject.

769
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:01,740
Her reign is over.

770
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:04,868
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

771
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:07,371
We understand nothing of the sort.

772
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:11,041
Your queen's last dragon
is vulnerable.

773
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:14,294
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

774
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:17,798
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan...

775
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:36,525
Ready!

776
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:38,819
Nock!

777
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,781
Draw!

778
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:52,100
I know you don't care
about your people.

779
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:55,312
Why should you?

780
01:11:57,356 --> 01:12:00,192
They hate you and you hate them.

781
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,408
But you're not a monster.

782
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:12,079
I know this.

783
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:16,500
I know this because I've seen it.

784
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:23,340
You've always loved your children.

785
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:27,803
More than yourself...

786
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,263
...more than Jaime...

787
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,559
more than anything.

788
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,729
I beg you.

789
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:43,485
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

790
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:48,991
Your reign is over,

791
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:52,578
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

792
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:58,500
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

793
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,927
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

794
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:16,411
<i>Dracarys.</i>

795
01:14:26,046 --> 01:14:27,130
No.
