ASHLEY:
And that is why we love you.

164
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,715
But we see at least
a 23% uptick

165
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,934
in social media mentions
and hero hashtags

166
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,394
when there's a team-up.

167
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,444
People love a team-up.

168
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,147
- Love a team-up.
- Mm.

FRENCHIE: That stuff really
blocks the chip's signal?

182
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,327
Yeah. It's just
R.F. Shielding Foil.

183
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,311
You can get it at Fry's.

184
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,522
You in tech intelligence?

185
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,942
Uh, sales and installation.

186
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,610
TRANSLUCENT:
Ah...

187
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,321
Oh, what the fuck?

188
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,032
Where am I?

189
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,662
Oi. Morning, sunshine.

190
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,740
- You know who I am?
- Not sure.

191
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,365
I know so many
invisible assholes.

192
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,213
TRANSLUCENT:
You fucking amateurs!

193
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,288
- (electricity crackling)
- (Translucent cries out)

194
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,843
Fuck!

195
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,626
What the fuck?!

196
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,130
Ooh, mind them bars, son.

197
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,721
You'll only bollocks
yourself again.

198
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,151
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

199
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,585
Uh, okay, what do
you guys want? Money?

200
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,596
We don't want
your fucking money.

201
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,404
What do you think, Frenchie?

202
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,978
You just dropped
the Moby fucking Dick

203
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,573
of problems on my plate.

204
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,487
That's what I think.

205
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,817
Okay?

206
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,413
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

207
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,119
(sighs)
It's hard as diamonds.

208
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,830
It's nearly impossible
to penetrate.

209
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,410
BUTCHER: All right,
how 'bout we suffocate him?

210
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,286
FRENCHIE: Some Dominicans
already tried this,

211
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,963
way back in '07.

212
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,631
BUTCHER:
And what happened?

213
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,896
FRENCHIE:
They're all fucking dead now.

214
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,420
That's what happened.

215
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,026
BUTCHER: All right, then,
fuck it, electrocution.

216
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,260
We'll just increase the amps.

217
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,820
FRENCHIE: You already hit him
with enough to drop

218
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,514
a water buffalo, and look.

219
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,564
Might knock him out.
Doesn't seem to kill him, huh?

220
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,228
No. We need to pierce
the skin somehow.

221
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,977
BUTCHER: Well, how the
hell are we gonna do that?

222
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,980
FRENCHIE:
I don't know.

223
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,482
You're gonna kill him?

224
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,111
(Butcher scoffs)

225
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,531
We didn't bring him here
for a fucking Happy Meal.

226
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,660
I don't... I thought we'd
question him or something.

227
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,489
I don't know, you get a... you
get ahold of someone this big...

228
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,655
At Gitmo, we had to water board
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

229
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:08,285
183 times over six months
to get him to talk just once.

230
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,955
Now, we ain't got six months.

231
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,423
I doubt we've even got
six hours.

232
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,587
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

233
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,676
but right now, you're talking
about randomly killing

234
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,562
one of the most famous men
on the planet.

235
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,441
A goddamn national treasure.

236
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:30,818
I mean... people tend to notice
that kind of thing.

237
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,987
And if we let him go...

238
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,197
what do you think The Seven
will do to us?

239
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,778
- Hmm?
- (sighs)

240
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:42,954
You can't get A-Train if you're
a greasy smear on the pavement.

241
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,166
I'm not a murderer.

242
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,997
(Butcher scoffs)

243
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,132
That's all right.

244
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,590
- I am.
- (Hughie exhales)

245
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,429
The race is coming up quickly.
How you feeling?

246
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,598
Look, A-Train is
a fierce competitor,

247
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,573
but no one can be the world's
fastest man forever.

248
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,887
Let's just say I like my chan...

249
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,493
HOMELANDER DOLL:
I'll always protect you.

250
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,687
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Your little
hero will never be afraid

251
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,397
with the Junior
Homelander Cuddle...

252
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:13,278
I regret to inform you that I've
located the mayor's Gulfstream.

253
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,316
It's about two miles down at
the bottom of Hudson Canyon.

254
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,861
There are no survivors,

255
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,454
and I've yet to locate
the flight recorder.

256
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,740
Though the jet was fragmented,

257
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,703
there was one engine
fully intact,

258
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,453
and it appears to be
engine failure.

259
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,905
So I'd like to offer...

260
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,826
(door opens)

261
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,875
Whoa...

262
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,707
(both chuckle)

263
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,513
- Still going strong, huh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

264
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,817
I've just been pumping
for 30 minutes,

265
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,301
and I got a quarter of an ounce.

266
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,512
Hey, hey, go easy on yourself.

267
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,353
Come on, now.

268
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,348
Personally, I think it's amazing
that a woman your age

269
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,442
can have a baby, period.

270
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,729
That is so sweet of you to say.

271
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,572
Oh, no problem.

272
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,899
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

273
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,783
- You heard about that?
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,661
No, not yet.

275
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,118
Well, you know,
I could search for him.

276
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,449
Personally.

277
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,754
That's not necessary.

278
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,537
Right.

279
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,499
Hey, did you hear about
the mayor of Baltimore?

280
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,508
Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,129
Heard his plane went down.

282
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,046
Some sort of engine trouble.

283
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,434
Yeah, it's awful.

284
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,721
I saw him on Tuesday.

285
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,434
Had a meeting with him
right here.

286
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,394
Wow.

287
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,774
Well, hug your kids, right?

288
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,941
'Cause you never know
what might happen.

289
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,270
- So true.
- Mm.

290
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,435
You know what's interesting?

291
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,454
The Deep told me, and only me,

292
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,407
that there were, uh,
scorch marks

293
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,948
on the mayor's engine.

294
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,712
Almost as if from two small,
high-intensity beams,

295
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,827
roughly the width of human eyes.

296
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,552
Say what you mean to say.

297
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:03,047
Your brand is hope,

298
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,763
baseball, America...
sunshine.

299
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,466
You don't do vengeance.

300
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,733
Madelyn, I heard him
through the wall of this...

301
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,192
He was blackmailing you.

302
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,402
I am the last person
you need to save.

303
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,862
Yeah, but I-I did it for you.

304
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,242
I know, but did the timing
occur to you?

305
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,621
I have half the Senate
Appropriations Committee

306
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,868
coming tonight.

307
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,581
(scoffs)

308
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,007
How did he even know
about Compound V?

309
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,802
We are not going
to talk about that.

310
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,426
Oh, come on, Madelyn.

311
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,232
You do not need
to hide things from me.

312
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,017
I love Vought as much as you do,

313
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,190
- and I can do more.
- You can do more?

314
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,690
You've already grossed
$12.3 billion for us.

315
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,324
Right. So the pricks on 82 can
take all the fucking credit?

316
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,741
Empty fucking suits
with Cornell degrees? Come on.

317
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,370
I'm the one who's out there.
Not them.

318
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:14,909
I'm the one who,
who-who knows the audience.

319
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,206
Who knows what's good
for this company.

320
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,880
I know. I hear you.

321
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,838
I do. But what I need right now,

322
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,180
is I need you to charm the shit
out of those congressmen.

323
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,007
Right.

324
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:33,224
'Cause that's all
I'm good for, huh?

325
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,846
Smile, look pretty,
say my lines.

326
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,194
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

327
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,819
No. No.

328
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,569
You just need
to let me protect you.

329
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,034
- Oh, you're gonna protect me?
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,500
Gods are pure

331
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,251
and they're perfect

332
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,674
and they're above it all.

333
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,013
And they need to stay that way.

334
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,810
Huh...

335
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,515
You're leaking.

336
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,775
Thank you.

337
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,909

338
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,579

00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,766
(sighs)

341
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,189
(line ringing)

342
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,018
- DAD (over phone): Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

343
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,403
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

344
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,072
- I'm fine.
- But the police are saying

345
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,570
some wacko drove
into Gary's store,

346
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,411
right through the window,
and then took off.

347
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,117
I-I thought maybe you've been
hurt, or-or kidnapped.

348
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,198
I saw this Dateline
on human trafficking...

349
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,663
Dad, I haven't been
human trafficked, okay?

350
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,174
I-I closed up early. It must
have happened after I left.

351
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,956
But where'd you go?

352
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,920
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

353
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,921
- Blowing off steam.
- No... now, I called Anthony, all right?

354
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,634
I called everybody. No one's
seen you. Don't lie to me.

355
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,045
Yeah, it's kind of
hard to explain.

356
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,814
Hey, Dad, listen,
I got to, I got to go.

357
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,241
Just, l-listen,
I know you've been taking

358
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,845
Robin's accident real hard.

359
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,286
- It wasn't an accident.
- All-all right, all right.

360
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,150
My point is, you're a good boy.

361
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,937
You're a sensitive boy.
Come home.

362
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,361
Okay? Before you do something
stupid, come home, Hughie.

363
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,031
- I got to go.
- No, w-wait, Hugh...

364
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,119
(panting)

365
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,594

00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,158
Oh. Well, I heard
we had a meeting.

368
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,828
So, um,
I'll just leave you to it.

369
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,537
Well, we're having a meeting
right now, aren't we, Deep?

370
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,209
You and me.

371
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,634
- Come on in.
- Yeah. Sure.

372
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,823
So, uh, what, uh...

373
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,437
Or is there, is there anything
I can, can do for you,

374
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,904
Homelander?

375
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:16,574
Well, yeah. I-I guess, uh...

376
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,204
(sighs)

377
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,201
Well, you can help me
understand something, Deep,

378
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,203
'cause, uh...

379
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,825
(chuckles):
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.

380
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,293
Am I stupid, Deep?

381
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,293
What? No. (scoffs)

382
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,295
No. You're not stupid.
(chuckles)

383
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,088
You're-you're smart.
Very smart, right?

384
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,724
Yeah. Okay.

385
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,140
So, what possible reason...

386
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,981
what, uh, razor-sharp
fish instinct...

387
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,019
made you run to Stillwell

388
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,903
and tell her what you thought
you saw down there?

389
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,111
All right, look, I-I thought...
I thought I, I was, uh...

390
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,783
I-I don't even know... I don't
know what I saw down there,

391
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,372
as a matter of fact. It was, it
was really dark and, uh, muddy...

392
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,989
the water was really muddy.

393
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,786
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

394
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,250
I-I didn't...

395
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:12,251
I didn't really see anything
down there, as a matter of fact.

396
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,295
(chuckles)

397
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,759
That's what I thought.

398
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,008
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

399
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,261

(Homelander chuckles)

401
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,400
And I trust we never have
to have this conversation again.

402
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,818
No. Of course not.

403
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,397
Just this once.

404
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,492

Tell security to search the
area, door-to-door if necessary.

But tell them to be discreet.

I took my share of shit
when I first got here, okay?

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,170
Besides, you had
a crush on me, remember?

That gives you no right...
zero right...

You'll sic a grouper on me?

481
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,545
I'll tell everyone
you're a psycho.

482
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,056
- I'll go to Homelander.
- No, you won't.

483
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,348
See, I asked around; you're not
number two around here.

484
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,983
You're just the fish guy.

485
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,321
Everyone thinks you're a joke.

486
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,607
Me, most of all.

487
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:30,701
I cannot believe
I fell for your crap.

488
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:35,118
- You stuck-up little...
- You ever touch me again,

489
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,039
I will burn your eyes out.

490
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,036
Understand me?

491
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,924
(sighs)

492
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,211
(clattering)

493
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,885
We'll finish this later.

494
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,677
You take them from the front,
I'll come in from behind.

495
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,231

STARLIGHT:
Hey.

499
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,552
Hey, boys.

500

501
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,137
Hurry up. Move faster.

502
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,944
You're amazing. That was so
great. That was really good.

503
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,319
- Smile for the cameras.
- What? What the hell is this?

504
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,834
Yeah, stand over him
and say "This is lit."

Oh, hey, Jimmy.

506

- Madam Deputy Director, eh?
- (sighing)

513
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,927
Wow. Andrew and the kids
must be chuffed for you.

514
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,265
Keep your voice down, and don't
talk about my family.

515
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,441
It makes my skin crawl.

516
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,020
What are you doing here?

517
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,735
Just need a quick dekko
at some of your files.

518
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:36,027
- My files? What files?
- A couple of Supes.

519
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,072
Big Game, Shout Out.

520
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,075
Translucent, if you got him.

521
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,787
- Why Translucent?
- Eh, nothing special,

522
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,867
- just ticking a few boxes.
- Oh.

523
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,793
So you just broke
into my goddamn house

524
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,041
in the middle of the night?

525
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,583
All right.

526
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,836
I'm trying to find a way
to do the job on the cunt,

527
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,773
and if it's anywhere,
it'll be in Mallory's files.

528
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,047
- Now would you like me to keep talking?
- No.

529
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:59,221
No. Christ. Just don't
fucking say another word.

530
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,761
The Mallory files
are dead and buried.

531
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,306
You're the deputy director
of CIA Operations.

532
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,140
- Dig 'em up.
- No.

533
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,395
- Why not?
- Because of you.

534
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,147
- Me?
- Yes, you.

535
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,979
The director will shitcan anyone

536
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,614
who even goes near those files.

537
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,701
You made it suicide
to go after the Supes.

538
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,328
What are you even doing back
involved in this?

539
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,237
I mean, you have a death wish,

540
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,035
or are you a glutton
for punishment?

541
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,500
Yeah. A bit of both, I suppose.

542
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,505
Come on... Susan.

543
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,551
Five minutes alone
with a piece of paper.

544
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,345
For old time's sakes.
No one will know.

545
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,314
You-You're really trying
to sell this shit?

546
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,152
- Why, you buying it?
- You think I look back fondly

547
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,688
at the times we fucked
in bar bathrooms?

548
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,783
Oh, come on.
We had a few laughs.

549
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,859
Like the time you sent me
the Edible Arrangement.

550
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,485
And what we had was
you trying to use me,

551
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,453
for a Get Out of Jail Free card
at a time like this.

552
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,084
Well, if that's all
it was, then,

553
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,082
what's got you
so hot and bothered

554
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,214
when a simple "fuck you"
would suffice?

555
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,212
Fuck you.

556
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,550
Now get out of my house.

557
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,693
Did I mention this is
life or death?

558
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,731
I'll send an Edible Arrangement
to your funeral.

559
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,715
Hi.

560
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,928
I, um... I thought you
might be thirsty, so...

561
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,150
Well, if you don't want it,
I can always...

562
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,402
No, I want it.

563
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,743
Cheers.

564
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,746
(gulping)

565
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,169
HUGHIE:
So, listen, um,

566
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:37,587
I need to ask you some
questions about A-Train.

567
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:41,168
When he, uh, burst
through that woman

568
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:45,335
the other day, Robin Ward.

569
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,006
I-I need to know why.

570
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,064
Where was he going?
What was he doing?

571
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,478
Why? Was she your sister?

572
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,137
Girlfriend?

573
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,396
Girlfriend.

574
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,227
(sighs)

575
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,573
That's what all this
is about? Christ.

576
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,438
What makes you think I know
anything about it?

577
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,796
I know you and A-Train
were tight.

578
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,990
You guys came up together.

579
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,619
What are you, a fucking fan?

580
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:10,947
Listen, those two guys in there,
they want to kill you, okay?

581
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,825
So you give me something,
maybe I can...

582
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,291
What? Hold 'em off?
'Cause they hang

583
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,502
on your every word.
You're the big man around here.

584
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,713
Okay, you don't want to talk,
don't talk. I tried.

585
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:20,923
Good luck.

586
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:24,593
Buddy, my superpower
ain't invisibility.

You know that, right?

588
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,972
It's reading people.

589
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,845
Watching them when
they think they're alone.

590
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,031
I see people for who
they really are.

he's gonna burst you wide open.

00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,109
For just $9.99 a month.
That is only...

640
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,148
Hi, John.
Thanks for your support.

641
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,413
It's what makes this republic
so great.

642
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,907
Bill. How are the kids?
(chuckles)

643
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,580
Hey.

644
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,078
EZEKIEL: Give
to Samaritan's Embrace today,

645
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,910
and give a child
just like Asim...

646
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,456
Could I get a club soda?

647
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,169
Ms. Stillwell.

648
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,419
Senator, what can I get you?

649
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,922
- Jack, rocks.
- You know, we have Macallan 25.

650
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,546
You'd be wasting it.
Whiskey's whiskey to me.

651
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,433
(chuckles)

652
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,100
Boy, they're blowing
so much smoke up Maeve's ass,

653
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,689
it's a miracle she doesn't die
of lung cancer.

654
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,186
(laughs)

655
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,938
But you know it's just that,
right? Smoke.

656
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,071
- I'm sorry?
- Everyone loves

657
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:55,028
to bask in their glow,
but tomorrow morning

658
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,450
no one's putting Supes
into national defense.

659
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,370
It won't get out of committee,
much less hit the floor.

660
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,170
Because God forbid
we could have an advantage

661
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,543
in an armed conflict.

662
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,330
You send a Supe over
the 38th parallel,

663
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,044
Pyongyang's gonna answer
with a nuke.

664
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,924
Then one of my guys
will catch it.

665
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:14,511
You see Robertson over there?

666
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,798
He's got Lockheed in his state
and in his pocket.

667
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:22,763
McCrea? He's got Fort Bragg
and its couple thousand voters.

668
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,846
No one wants
to outsource to you.

669
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:29,104
America runs on weapons.

670
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,516
Hell, it's one of the only
damn things we still make.

671
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,725
But you are the chairman.

672
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:34,735
Where do you stand?

673
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,606
Me? I'm just an old leatherneck.

674
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,283
And if I was on the line,

675
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:41,662
scare the shit out of me
to have Homelander there.

676
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,120
My heroes are the most
loyal, patriotic...

677
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,371
That's just it.

678
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:49,462
They're your heroes,
aren't they?

679
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,010
Get him a Macallan 25.

680
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,127
(chuckles)

681
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:02,104
Why have average
when you can have extraordinary?

682
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,967
(chuckles)

683
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,562
Thank you.

684
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,064
(indistinct chatter)

685
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,895
WOMAN: Guys, we should get
back to the party.

686
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,668
- MAN: What?
- Elena just ordered more booze.

687
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:16,961
- Come on, let's go back.
- No, no...

688
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,046
WOMAN:
It'll be more fun at the party.

689
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,255
Please... okay, don't touch me.

690
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,069
- (laughs)
- No, please, please.

691
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,584
Oh, no, no! Stop!
No, no, no, no!

692
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,697
Please, no, no, no, no!

693
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,123
- The girl said no.
- Help.

694
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,792
We're all friends here.

695
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,210
Yeah, it's all good.
It's fine. (laughs)

696
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,796
Miss, do me a favor
and shut your eyes.

697
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,309
Fucking bitch.

698
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,228
(grunting)

699
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,493
(drilling)

700
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,083
Fucking diamond skin.

701
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,789
(door slams)

702
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,329
- Fuck.
- Merde!

703
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,625
Here.

704
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,593
Here, take it.

705
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,093
What is that?

706
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,346
It will help
with your, uh, anxiety.

707
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,308
It's LSD and MDMA.
This is a candy flip.

708
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,769
It'll smooth you right out.
Take it.

709
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,059
Uh, thank you, but I-I
don't think now is the time

710
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,863
for a major hallucinogen.

711
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,897
Fais-toi plaisir.

712
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,862
(sniffs, coughs)

713
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,696
What are you exactly?

714
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:54,366
Chemist? Engineer? What?

715
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:58,496
No. I know a little
about a lot of things.

716
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:02,295
I'm a gunrunner by trade,
but, uh, as you can see,

717
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,130
I've developed a certain niche.

718
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,716
Killing superheroes?

719
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,061
No.

720
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,176
You can count on one hand
the number of dead superheroes.

721
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,234
Sometimes you can, uh,
incapacitate them.

722
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:20,364
Truly, they are
magnificent creatures.

723
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,690
Mm.

724
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,776
Each one with a unique power
that requires a unique solution.

725
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,452
It's, uh...
it's never the same twice.

726
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,203
Who pays you to do that?

727
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,544
Whoever can pay.

728
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,132
And when you do kill a Supe...

729
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,459
or, you know, any-anyone...

730
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:45,335
um... what's it like?

731
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,143
You know... (sniffs)

732
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:58,225
I saw this woman once,
in a midtown elevator,

733
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,191
2008.

734
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,903
No more for ten seconds,
I see her, huh?

735
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,954
Stunning.

736
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,607
Five-nine.

737
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,287
Hair so black it absorbed
the light, you know?

738
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,867
Tom Ford pencil skirt,
Louboutin stilettos.

739
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,464
C'est magnifique.

740
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,839
But she had,

741
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,456
uh... she had...

742
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:25,474
I never forget this, you see...

743
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,297
she had dirt
under her fingernails

744
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,303
and callouses on her hands,
and I see this and I say, "Oh,

745
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,846
strange for such a refined woman
like this."

746
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,100
What, you...
(chuckles)

747
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,142
You a gardener?

748
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,245
You know, are you a sculptor?

749
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,149
What is this, huh?

750
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,857
And I think about this...

751
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,656
I think about her all the time.

752
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,161
She was the first person
I ever killed.

753
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,209
I carry...

754
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,499
I carry them all with me.

755
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:06,424
It's like scars in a way,
you know?

756
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,270
Okay, Senator, you ready?

757
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,267
(chuckles)

758
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,978
Oh, yeah.

759
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:21,858
Oh. (chuckles) Oh, darling.

760
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,147
- Mm-hmm?
- You know I like to watch.

761
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:26,781
No. Can't always be in control.

762
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,568
- (chuckles)
- Sir.

763
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,533
Then I guess I'll just have
to feel my way through it.

764
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,584
Oh, you'll feel
good indeed, baby.

765
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,754
- You ready?
- Oh, I was born ready.

766
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,213
- Mm-hmm.
- Feels like butter, baby.

767
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,625
Get ready, sir.

768
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,723
You're going in.

769
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,219
Yee-haw!

770
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,850
Giddyup, gal. Come on.

771
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:54,967
- Oh, God.
- (laughing)

772
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,563
That-that feels different.

773
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,599
(elevator bell dings)

774
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,989
Hey...

777
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,327
How are you?

778
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,082
Uh, I'm good.

779
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,665
Good.

780
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,511
Hey, is that your, uh,
secret identity?

781
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,388
- Mm-hmm.
- Charming.

782
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,586
Thanks.

783
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,926
Yeah, I-I gave up on mine...

784
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:41,693
oh... a long time ago now.

785
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,807
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

786
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,564

787
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,606
Good night.

MADELYN:
No. No, I did not

789
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,214
go through eight rounds of IVF

790
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,959
and bleeding nipples
to quit now.

791
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:10,092
I am doing this. Yes.

792
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,720
That little kid is gonna drink
my goddamn milk

00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,759
What are you doing?

802
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,965
Shocking our invisible friend.

803
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,476
I need him unconscious.

804
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,938
Why?

805
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,225
Because I got it.

806

Now what the fuck do you want?

808
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,782
What the fuck, Starlight?!

809
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,494
- What?
- (spits)

810
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:24,084
(grunting over phone)

811
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,955
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

812
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,380
Oh, shit.

813
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,248
And so glad you did it
in plain clothes,

814
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,295
so you could blow
your secret identity.

815
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,799
Here: "OMG. I recognize
Starlight, that's Annie January!

816
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,433
"I went to Hoover High with her.

# SheWasBulimic."

(clears throat)

819
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,399
One, this was stupid.

820
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:52,646
Two, it was really stupid
to do it on camera.

821
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,400
Always look for cameras.

822
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,782
- They were about to rape a girl.
- What girl?

823
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,700
There's no girl in that video.
You get a name?

824
00:44:58,738 --> 00:44:59,858
No, she ran off.

825
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,656
Oh, great. She ran off. Great.

826
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,239
Always get a fucking name,
Starlight. Always!

827
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,995
Well, uh...
They-they said... Hmm.

828
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,827
(stammering):
They-they said she was a friend.

829
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,253
It was date rape, I think.

830
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,291
Great.
Well, she hasn't come forward

831
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,125
and, statistically,
she's not likely to.

832
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,630
So all we really have
is two Delta Betas

833
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,723
who insist they were just
getting drunk in an alley

834
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:21,638
until you beat them unconscious.

835
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,428
They're lying! I, uh...

836
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,181
Aren't I innocent
until proven guilty?

837
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,064
When you're in the big leagues?
You flip it.

838
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,645
(exhales)

839
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,375
I don't know what you were
planning on doing today, hmm,

840
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,479
with your little... cute day,

841
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,316
but you have to cancel
everything, okay?

842
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,839
You're gonna have meetings
with Risk Assessment,

843
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,123
with Crisis Management,
with Legal.

844
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,027
Jerry is gonna lose his shit!

845
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,736
Fuck.

846
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,746
Am...

847
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,118
(Starlight exhales)

848
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,955
Are they gonna fire me?

849
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,300
Just be in Stillwell's office
at 10:00.

850
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,006
What?

851
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,086
Am I fired?

852
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:02,342
Senator, I very much appreciate
you coming bright and early.

853
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:06,505
I realize, uh,
how busy you were last night.

854
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,727
These... are fake.

855
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,534
I think we both know
they're not.

856
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,700
Look. I was with a young woman,
all right?

857
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,240
Of legal age.

858
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,623
Her name was Rhonda.

859
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,159
So this isn't possible.

860
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:31,624
They've... (scoffs) ...obviously
been doctored or something.

861
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,374
I'm sorry, they are authentic.

862
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,706
I should know. I was there.

863
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,502
You what?

864
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:40,755
(squishing and cracking)

865
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,762
You shiver when you orgasm, sir.

866
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,434
Oh, Jesus.

867
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:49,853
(door opens)

868
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,641
That will be all, Doppelganger.

869
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,685
Who the fuck is he?

870
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,649
Anyway, I would love to continue

871
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,689
our conversation
from last night.

872
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,864
This is some dirty fucking pool,
Madelyn.

873
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,574
You're really gonna clutch
your pearls, Senator?

874
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,445
I don't think either one of us
is that naive.

875
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,834
Yeah. It's not...

876
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,961
it's not fatal to be...
homosexual these days.

877
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,039
It is in Oklahoma, sir.

878
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,085
Where your voters live.

879
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,415
Even if I get the bill
out of committee,

880
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,086
nobody's gonna vote for it
on the floor.

881
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,135
No one wants your fucking Supes
in the Army.

882
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,180
We'll see.

883
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,647
- (door opens)
- MAN: Shut up, shut up, shut up.

884
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,689
(indistinct low chatter)

885
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,527
ANIKA:
Homelander. (chuckles)

886
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:47,621
Uh...
wel-welcome to Crime Analytics.

887
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,260
- (Homelander sighs)
- Can... Would you like a Red Bull?

888
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,744
Have you found Translucent yet?

889
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,285
Oh. Uh, no.
But Security's on it.

890
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:57,329
He's been missing over 24 hours.

891
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,785
- Is he in danger?
- Um...

892
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,836
Do... you even know?

893
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,430
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

894
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,860
What's his last known position,
please?

895
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,974
Why don't I just call
Ms. Stillwell?

896
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,562
- And I...
- No.

897
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:11,847
No, no, no, no, no.

898
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,139
You're talking to me.

899
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,982
Well, I'm not sure

900
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,809
- I'm supposed to be talking to...
- (sighs)

901
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:20,154
What's your name?

902
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,359
- Anika.
- Anika.

903
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,479
Sir.

904
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,685
It's a beautiful name.

905
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:24,735
(Anika chuckles)

906
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,737
Listen, Anika.

907
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,869
- (quietly): I'm the Homelander.
- Mm-hmm.

908
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,776
And I can do whatever
the fuck I want. (chuckles)

909
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,036
Okay?

910
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,788
Now...

911
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,460
Translucent's last known
position.

912
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,877
Please.

913
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,506
(typing)

914
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,062
TRANSLUCENT:
What the...?

915
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,057
Something doesn't feel right.

916
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,388
Oh, I'll bet.

917
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,983
FRENCHIE:
I'm not ashamed to admit

918
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:59,018
I have outdone myself.

919
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,977
Now, the problem is
the skin, no?

920
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,066
It's, uh, hard like diamonds.

921
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,371
But then I realized, it is just
your shell that is hard, huh?

922
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,866
Like a turtle.

923
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,699
But your insides...

924
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,124
they're like the rest of ours...

925
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,543
soft.

926
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,791
So, how do you get to the...
squishy insides?

927
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,044
Through the mouth? Non.

928
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:25,876
The stomach acid,
the gag reflex.

929
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:30,432
If I stick something down your
throat, you may vomit it up.

930
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,218
(clicks tongue)

931
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,641
There's truly only one way...

932
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,970
The fuck did you do to me?

933
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,765
He stuck a lump of plastique
up your bum, son.

934
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,151
Ass bomb.

935
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,648
Oh, my God.

936
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,736
Now...

937
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,530
you stick a little finger up
there and try and fish it out...

938
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,905
bang.

939
00:49:56,953 --> 00:50:00,293
I trigger this... also bang.

940
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,711
Savvy?

941
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,669
(crying):
Oh, please don't kill me.

942
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,341
I'll do anything.

943
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:10,089
(stammering):
I'll tell you about A-Train.

944
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,763
That's what the kid wants,
right?

945
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:14,301
I-I-I-I don't know
where A-Train was going

946
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,675
that night he killed the girl,

947
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,562
okay, but I know
where he was coming from.

948
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,728
What? Where?

949
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,386
Popclaw's.

950
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,845
He fucking... loves her.

951
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,623
He doesn't think anyone else
knows, but I know.

952
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:25,817
I know a lot of things.

953
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,397
But he-he's there every night.

954
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,742
Maybe... now, even.

955
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,046
Popclaw?
That's the hero with the...

956
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,990
the sharp things
coming out of her arms.

957
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,530
Yeah. Real D-lister.

958
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,624
Anyone knows what A-Train
was doing, it's Popclaw.

959
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,039
But that's all I know
about that, I swear to Christ.

960
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,328
But I'll tell you
anything else you want.

961
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,422
Just ask.

962
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,924
