1
00:00:00,585 --> 00:00:02,179
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,214 --> 00:00:05,307
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:06,553
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:08,644
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,</i>

5
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:11,733
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

6
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:15,275
<i>I fight crime and find other
meta-humans like me.</i>

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,212
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

8
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:20,817
<i>but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats.</i>

9
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:23,917
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

10
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:26,487
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

11
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:29,873
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

12
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,009
You're just letting us go?

13
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:32,809
Just remember
who it was made sure

14
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,908
you didn't
get thrown on that plane.

15
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:36,514
I call it the Wizard's Wand.

16
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:38,160
Captain Singh mentioned there
may be positions available

17
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:39,828
on your anti-meta-human
task force.

18
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:42,271
- Why do you want to do this?
- Mark Mardon killed my dad.

19
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:48,250
James Jesse, Your Honor,
AKA... the Trickster.

20
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,285
You're going to prison
either way, James.

21
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:52,921
You stay away from me and
you stay away from my father.

22
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:54,790
If he finds out
that he might have a son

23
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,191
that grew up
without knowing him,

24
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:57,250
it would crush him.

25
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:59,305
Jesse's my daughter
and Zoom has her.

26
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:03,148
You're next.

27
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:33,628
Go ahead.
Kill me.

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,032
But... my daughter...

29
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,501
is innocent.

30
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:41,036
Please...

31
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:42,671
Let...

32
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:45,107
Jesse...

33
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:47,209
live...

34
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,646
Go on.

35
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:54,349
Say something!

36
00:01:57,354 --> 00:02:00,889
Merry Christmas.

37
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,900
Whoo.

38
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,969
I had to fight some
old lady for the last one.

39
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:15,937
They didn't have
any Green Arrow dolls.

40
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,006
Don't know why you'd want
a toy of that crazy man.

41
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:19,508
I can't figure out
what to get Barry.

42
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,178
I was thinking
you could give him this.

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,913
Oh, that's nice.

44
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:26,748
But I kind of want to get him
something more meaningful.

45
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,685
I mean, it's been a strange,
emotional 12 months.

46
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:33,021
Yeah, you don't
have to tell me.

47
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:36,057
Oh, I know, babe.
I miss Eddie too.

48
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:39,661
How about you get Barry
a really nice watch?

49
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:41,863
Like Grandpa Ben
gave to you.

50
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,765
That ain't a bad idea.

51
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,467
You know, my dad only
gave me this watch

52
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,169
because I was always late.

53
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:48,937
- You?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,940
He always gave a gift
with a not-so-hidden message,

55
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:54,009
like this watch or the time
he bought me free weights

56
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:56,077
because he said
I was too skinny.

57
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,913
I told him,
"When I have a son,

58
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:00,615
I'm only giving him
fun presents."

59
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:04,186
This thing barely works.
Don't know why I still wear it.

60
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:10,058
Because it's from family.

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,994
You sure
you're all right?

62
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,530
Yeah, yeah.
I promise.

63
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:22,871
You know, we should really be
more professional.

64
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:25,040
You do realize
you initiated that.

65
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:28,243
Yes, and I'm fully prepared
to reprimand myself then.

66
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:31,246
I'm just saying, you know,
anyone could walk in,

67
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:35,083
like, Joe or Captain...

68
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,484
Yo.

69
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:39,354
But I have, like,
a 4:00 to 12:00, but...

70
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:42,090
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right.

71
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:44,960
- I'll see you for Christmas.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

72
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:50,699
I'm so happy for you.
Truly.

73
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:53,301
Thank you.

74
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:56,371
It means a lot to me
that you like her.

75
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,907
I don't know.

76
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:02,978
Wells, um, he left me
that message where he said

77
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,413
that I'd never
really be happy.

78
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:08,116
And for a while I really started
to believe him,

79
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:10,619
but, now... I...
I don't know.

80
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:14,456
Maybe there is a way to...

81
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,324
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

82
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:17,792
I'm so sorry.

83
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:19,995
I can't keep this
in anymore, Barry.

84
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,763
I know I was so mad
at you and Dad

85
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:23,632
for not telling me that
you were The Flash,

86
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,533
but when I found out
about this,

87
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:27,102
I didn't know what to do.

88
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:28,970
What?
What's going on?

89
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:33,642
When Francine came back,
my Dad told me not to trust her

90
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,277
and he was right.

91
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,981
I didn't know how much.

92
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:43,551
When my mother left us,

93
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:46,154
she was pregnant.

94
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,623
She had a son.

95
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,027
Joe's son.
My brother.

96
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:58,033
What's his name?

97
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,635
Wally.

98
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:03,672
Wally West.

99
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,941
When I found out,
I told her to leave

100
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,343
and never come back
and to never tell my dad,

101
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:09,978
but Barry, I feel...

102
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,380
I feel like this
is hollowing me out.

103
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,649
Every time I look at Dad,
I feel like I'm hurting him.

104
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,551
I don't...
I don't know what to do.

105
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:18,887
I think you know
what you have to do.

106
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,722
I can't.
It's gonna kill him.

107
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,490
No, it won't.

108
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:25,360
You don't have to do this alone.
We can tell him together.

109
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,228
Thank you.

110
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,265
Yeah.

111
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,304
Hey, look.
Snow.

112
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,608
Maybe it'll be
a white Christmas.

113
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,777
That'd be nice.

114
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,616
I was thinking
that if we could inject

115
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:51,653
an unstable neutrino burst
into the individual breaches,

116
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,755
it might cause them
to seal on their own.

117
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:55,223
And stop Zoom
from travelling back and forth

118
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:56,858
between our worlds.

119
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,426
At least then we wouldn't
have to worry about him

120
00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:01,062
sending any more meta-humans
over for Barry to fight.

121
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:02,864
- It means a lot.
- What does?

122
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,467
You looking after Barry.

123
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,369
He's been through a lot
the last few weeks.

124
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:11,039
Barry's not the only person
here I want to keep safe.

125
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,341
Oh, dear Lord,
just kiss already.

126
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:16,978
- Oh, the thirst is real.
- Is everything all right?

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,546
Yeah, I keep checking,

128
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:20,382
but all is quiet
on the meta-human front.

129
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:22,417
Hey, you think Zoom decided
to take Christmas off?

130
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:23,952
What's Christmas?

131
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:26,855
Oh, well,
it's this holiday we have

132
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:28,723
where we cut down trees
and sing songs

133
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,092
to celebrate the birth
of a baby 2,000 years ago,

134
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:34,229
and then the Romans killed him
so we give each other gifts...

135
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:35,897
That's your explanation?

136
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,100
- I know what Christmas is.
- Oh, right, of course.

137
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:40,769
Um, you know, Joe
and Barry and Iris

138
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,437
are having people over
for Christmas Eve,

139
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,540
and they said we could
invite whoever we want.

140
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,776
- Who... who do you want?
- You.

141
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:50,945
I want to invite you, I mean.

142
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:53,214
This is so painful.
Have you guys seen Harry?

143
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:55,283
Uh, no, I have not.
I told him to rest.

144
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:56,751
He's just as stubborn
as all the rest of

145
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:58,620
my male patients in this place.

146
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:00,055
I'm gonna
leave you two alone, okay?

147
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:01,489
I'm gonna go find Harry.

148
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,924
Holy Hannah!

149
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,727
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,963
- Everything okay?
- Sure.

151
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,066
Why wouldn't it be?

152
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:14,102
Why wouldn't it be?

153
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,843
Man,
it's really coming down.

154
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:24,679
The news didn't
say anything about snow.

155
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,481
Maybe it's
a Christmas miracle.

156
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:38,259
Let it snow.

157
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:40,762
We got a code...
Aah!

158
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,270
Knock, knock.

159
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,377
So.

160
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:59,581
Early parole.
You interested?

161
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:04,919
Don't mean to be a noodge,
but the exit is upstairs.

162
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:07,889
Just need one more thing.

163
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,759
_

164
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:20,068
You got to be kidding me.

165
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,705
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

166
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:38,118
Please tell me
this is not happening...

167
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,681
It's official,
Santa hates us.

168
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:42,245
This sudden blizzard
took out cameras

169
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,688
and the security system.

170
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,604
I mean, thank God
nobody was killed,

171
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,643
but there's no trace
of Mardon, Jesse, or Snart.

172
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:51,172
Speaking of which,
with Mardon back on the scene...

173
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:51,955
Yeah?

174
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,441
Patty might not be
thinking so clearly.

175
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:54,996
What do you mean?

176
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:58,067
What does Mardon
have to do with Patty?

177
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,707
We should have expected this.

178
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,045
The unexpected drop
in barometric pressure

179
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,413
had to mean
Mardon was back in town.

180
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,848
Patty...

181
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,750
Jesse was on full
communication lock down,

182
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:14,951
but that doesn't mean Mardon
and Snart weren't in contact.

183
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:19,689
Patty, Joe told me
about Mardon.

184
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:22,192
I can't talk
to you about this.

185
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,127
Hey, Patty, it's okay.

186
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,063
Got it.

187
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:28,932
Look, Barry,
you're a sweet guy,

188
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,600
but you have no idea what's
really going on in this city.

189
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:33,870
I mean, you don't even
know that Harrison Wells...

190
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:36,139
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to bring you up to speed.

191
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,974
That's ironic.

192
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,543
Patty, Patty,
look I care about you a lot.

193
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:42,812
I don't want to see you
do anything reckless.

194
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,380
I'm a cop.

195
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,082
Going after criminals
is in my job description.

196
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,951
It's not reckless.

197
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:50,787
And powers or not, Mardon's
gonna answer for what he's done.

198
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,822
Patty...

199
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,192
♪ Deck the halls ♪

200
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:58,528
♪ With body parts
from a girl named Holly ♪

201
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,531
♪ Fa la la la la,
la la la la ♪

202
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,133
I don't remember those
being the lyrics.

203
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:08,271
I am tremendously creative.
That I can tell you.

204
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,672
You'd better be.
I didn't break you out...

205
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,274
I didn't break
either of you out,

206
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,875
because I was looking to make
some new friends.

207
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:15,645
That is not the holiday
spirit, Marky-Mark.

208
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,147
Christmas is a time
for togetherness.

209
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,317
And what says togetherness
more than mass graves?

210
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,586
- Hmm?
- So why did you break us out?

211
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,888
Well, I owed you one,

212
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,024
and this guy,
he's just crazy.

213
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,826
It's a compliment.

214
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,361
And we all want the same thing.

215
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:34,697
- Fashion advice?
- To see The Flash dead.

216
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,733
Well, that was more of a
New Years resolution,

217
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:38,301
but, hey, I'm flexible.

218
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,638
That hasn't gone so well
for anyone in this room.

219
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,073
What makes you think
you can stop him this time?

220
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:45,475
Three against one.

221
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:48,244
Plus, the one
isn't quite what he was.

222
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:51,714
See, another speedster
dressed all in black

223
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:54,183
nearly took him out
a few weeks ago.

224
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,352
He's vulnerable.
He's weak.

225
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:59,756
It's a mistake
to underestimate him.

226
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:04,560
With my power,
his... flair, and your smarts,

227
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:06,562
we can put him
in the ground for good.

228
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:08,731
- Tell me your plan.
- Tell me you're in.

229
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,167
- I'm thinking about it.
- What's the matter?

230
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,836
A few months in the clink
make you soft, did it, Snart?

231
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:19,142
- You wanna dance?
- Boys, boys, boys!

232
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:21,611
Play nice!
Mellow out, Mardon.

233
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,480
Don't have a snit, Snart.
Here's an idea.

234
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:27,450
We all go out, have a few
drinks, kill some carolers.

235
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,652
We'll all feel better.

236
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,422
All right.

237
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:35,458
So what's it gonna be,
Snart?

238
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:39,996
Oh, yeah.

239
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,732
The Weather Wizard,
Captain Cold, and the Trickster.

240
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,300
There's three of them
and one of you.

241
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:45,902
I do not like those odds.

242
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:48,037
And I'm gonna be no help
without my speed, so...

243
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,607
Oh, oh, light bulb up here.
I have an idea.

244
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:54,377
Most weather phenomena
are marked, no pun intended,

245
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,213
by the change of electric charge
and pressure in the atmosphere.

246
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,348
We could just
map out those fluctuations...

247
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,917
To pinpoint his location.

248
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,585
Right, it would just be
a matter of removing all...

249
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,220
The electricity
from his immediate surroundings.

250
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:05,722
Attracting it to one spot.

251
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,256
The same way
a lightning rod does.

252
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,925
Only instead of a lightning rod,
we could use...

253
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,693
A wand?

254
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,395
Have we already had
this conversation?

255
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:16,165
- Kind of.
- What does that mean?

256
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,234
All right, so the last time
Mardon attacked,

257
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,104
he, um, generated a tidal wave
that destroyed

258
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:22,638
all of Central City.

259
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,108
So why are you not all
sleeping with the fishes?

260
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,909
Earth-2 has "The Godfather"?

261
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,412
Every Earth
has "The Godfather," Vito.

262
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,380
So I ran back through time.

263
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,916
One day into the past
and I got a do-over

264
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,018
and I stopped Mardon
before he could hurt anyone.

265
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,653
You shouldn't have
messed with the timeline.

266
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,188
That's what
the other Wells said.

267
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,324
So the good news is,
in that timeline,

268
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,725
you created The Wand
and it worked.

269
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,227
So you just
got to do it again.

270
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,762
For the first time.

271
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,231
- Yeah, no pressure.
- I can give you a hand.

272
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,000
- Best of both worlds?
- I like that.

273
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:55,805
You good, Harry?

274
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:59,542
Yeah,
why wouldn't I be?

275
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:01,244
Holiday blues?

276
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,212
It can't be easy knowing Zoom
still has his daughter.

277
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,114
Yeah, all right,
look, I'll be right back.

278
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:06,716
I have something
I have to deal with.

279
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,193
Hey.

280
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,464
Okay, the last time
the two of you

281
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,932
were looking at me like that,

282
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,600
it was when you both
took my convertible

283
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,002
on a joy ride
and wrapped it around

284
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,670
that big oak tree
on Fairmont Drive.

285
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:31,340
Dad, um...

286
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,209
All right, Joe, we have
something we need to tell you.

287
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:36,112
No, um...

288
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:39,248
I have something
that I need to tell you.

289
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,252
It's about Francine.

290
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:53,129
When she left us...

291
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:57,567
she was pregnant.

292
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:20,556
Did she have the baby?

293
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:22,992
Yes.

294
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:26,529
His name is Wally.

295
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,898
Wally West.

296
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,903
Short for Wallace.

297
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:39,008
That's what we were gonna
name you if you were a boy.

298
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,143
I only found out
a couple weeks ago.

299
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:44,914
Dad, I am so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

300
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:50,152
That's why she reached out to us
after all these years.

301
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:53,422
She wanted
us to know before...

302
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:57,860
Before she died.

303
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:01,664
And I thought Francine
was running out of surprises.

304
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,601
I got to get to work.

305
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,870
Dad, listen...
Dad.

306
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:11,340
I'm... I'm sorry.

307
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,745
Just let me sit with it.

308
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:27,423
Do you think that
he's gonna be okay?

309
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,659
I do, yeah, I think...

310
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:32,028
It's just a lot to take in.

311
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,564
He just needs a little time
to process it.

312
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:38,000
Ho, ho, ho.

313
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,962
Mmm. Cocoa isn't cocoa without
the mini marshmallows.

314
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:52,405
And you're out.
I checked.

315
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,442
Are you out of your mind?

316
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:55,831
Breaking into my home?

317
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,478
Careful. I made an upgrade
to the cold gun.

318
00:15:58,513 --> 00:15:59,823
If I release my grip
from the handle,

319
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,249
the core goes critical.

320
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,451
You might make it,

321
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:06,521
she won't.

322
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,462
Read your article on the
disappearing middle class.

323
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,831
Strong point of view.
Nice prose style.

324
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,566
Yeah, well,
who needs a Pulitzer

325
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:21,035
when you have a homicidal
maniac's seal of approval.

326
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,237
Didn't Barry tell you?
I had a rough childhood.

327
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,540
Everyone in this room
had a rough childhood.

328
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,542
- Get over it.
- Why are you here, Snart?

329
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:30,445
I got the Noel spirit,
wanted to give you a gift.

330
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,880
Mardon broke Jesse
and me out to kill you.

331
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:35,483
Jesse's on board, of course.
He's shaking with excitement.

332
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:37,418
Me, I'm gonna pass.

333
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,853
Why?
You grow a conscience?

334
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:41,088
Mardon wants revenge.
Jesse wants chaos.

335
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,825
I'm just not invested
like they are.

336
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,693
You mean there's no money
in it for you?

337
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:48,129
I was never much
for non-profit work.

338
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,164
If you're not in with them,
then tell me where they are.

339
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,767
Nah, consider me more
of a secret Santa.

340
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,471
Besides, you and your friends
love to solve a good mystery.

341
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:01,142
You are full of it, Snart.

342
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:04,512
I think my friends and I
saved your sister's life

343
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:06,614
and you can't stand
owing me a marker.

344
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,049
I hate to break
it to you,

345
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:10,451
but that... that right there
is called honor.

346
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:14,355
Go on, make your pitch.
I can see you're dying to.

347
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,390
Help me stop them.

348
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:20,027
Sorry, I'm not interested
in being a hero.

349
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,130
Well, you're doing
a pretty lousy job

350
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:25,800
of being a villain this week.

351
00:17:25,802 --> 00:17:28,369
Merry Christmas, Barry.

352
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:39,847
Hey.

353
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,987
I was just thinking
about a big drug bust

354
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,990
that me and Singh
made about ten years ago.

355
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:53,728
Afterward,
we went for a steak lunch

356
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,330
to treat ourselves
for a job well done

357
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,399
and while we were ordering,

358
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:00,968
I got this feeling
in my chest.

359
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,871
Like my heart
was being squeezed.

360
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:05,606
I knew something wasn't right.

361
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:07,642
So I called your school

362
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:12,547
and the nurse said to me that
she was just about to call me.

363
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,549
Iris was on her way
to the hospital.

364
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,183
When her appendix burst.

365
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:18,886
And I knew it.
I could feel it, right here.

366
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:23,057
I knew my kid needed me.

367
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,594
So if I have that feeling
as a parent,

368
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,596
why didn't I feel it
from my son?

369
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:31,465
Joe, it's not your fault that
you didn't know about him.

370
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:34,435
Yeah, it was.

371
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:37,605
When Francine left rehab
that last time,

372
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,840
I should've looked for her.

373
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,776
I'm a cop.
I could've found her.

374
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,444
Brought her back here.

375
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:44,845
Tried again.
Tried harder.

376
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,380
You were protecting Iris.

377
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:49,283
I've been telling
myself that for 20 years.

378
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:51,218
A 20-year lie,
but I wasn't protecting her,

379
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,456
I was protecting myself.
I couldn't stand it anymore.

380
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,825
I couldn't...

381
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:02,530
I hated not being able
to help Francine.

382
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:06,667
So it was easier
for her to be dead.

383
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,105
Out of my life.
Out of our lives.

384
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:13,507
But it wasn't for Iris.

385
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,376
I was being selfish.

386
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:19,013
And that poor boy
paid the price.

387
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:21,115
Joe...

388
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:24,952
He never had a father...

389
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:27,288
to read to him at night,
show him to throw a football,

390
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,124
to make him feel safe.

391
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,160
and loved.

392
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:38,866
Who taught him
how to be a man, Barry?

393
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:42,603
"Him."
I can't even say his name.

394
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,443
What have I done?

395
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:52,780
Joe, look,

396
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:55,082
you have been there for me

397
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:58,285
every day since I met you.

398
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,488
You have.

399
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:05,259
You would have done
the exact same thing for him

400
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:09,864
if you could have, I know it.

401
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:11,999
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,204
Where's your partner,
Spivot?

403
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:20,441
I don't know,
I'm not his babysitter.

404
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:23,944
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not sure where Joe is.

00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,153
He's one of a kind.

I want watch commanders

00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:26,707
Spivot, I need you to...

428
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,409
Spivot!

429
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:30,244
Are there any clues as to
where he is based on the video?

430
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:32,713
None that I can see.

431
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:35,416
Guys, there's a reflection

432
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:38,385
of something in his cornea, see?

433
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:43,290
- What is that?
- Not sure.

434
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,059
That's Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

435
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:47,094
- Come again?
- It's a doll.

436
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,529
A stuffed children's toy.

437
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:50,231
I gave one to my daughter
when she was six.

438
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,466
Mr. Jiggle Wiggle was
manufactured by Okamura Toys...

439

Yahtzee!

440
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,870
Okamura once had a shipping
facility in Central City

441
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,805
that shut down four years ago;
it's been abandoned ever since.

442
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,441

The wand's not finished.

for you.

Mardon and Jesse
aren't even here.

462
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:24,898
- They're still on the loose.
- How did you know to come here?

463
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,332
Because there was a reflection

464
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:27,734
in Jesse's eye
of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

465
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:29,903
And that's the thing
that my dad...

466
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:31,738
It doesn't even matter.

467
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,841
That's why you came here alone
without any backup?

468
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:36,342
Because of your father?

469
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:38,244
You don't know
anything about me.

470
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:40,246
I know
that you're being reckless.

471
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:42,048
And I'm sure
the people in your life

472
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,884
care enough about you to not
want to see you get hurt.

473
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:48,254
Except Mardon
didn't kill my father.

474
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,189
I did.

475
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:52,492
See, he had a little shoe shop,
and we didn't have any money,

476
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:53,893
so I worked there after school.

477
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:56,563
Except one day
I decided not to show up,

478
00:23:56,565 --> 00:24:01,301
because I was being stupid
and silly with my friends.

479
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:03,703
I didn't even call to tell him
that I was ditching.

480
00:24:03,705 --> 00:24:07,473
So he brought
the deposits to the bank,

481
00:24:07,475 --> 00:24:10,276
not me.

482
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:14,147
He was shot and killed
by Mardon, not me.

483
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:18,084
That's why you became a cop.

484
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,986
Joined the meta-human
task force.

485
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:22,388
It'll be legal
when I kill Mardon.

486
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,391
I have made my whole life about
getting justice for my father,

487
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:27,493
even if it meant
I didn't have a life

488
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:29,262
and now I met
a really great guy,

489
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,464
and that doesn't even
feel real to me

490
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:35,435
and I'm scared he's gonna
find out how angry I am.

491
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:37,604
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

492
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:39,872
Sometimes it's just easier
to say things

493
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:42,208
to someone with no face.

494
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,377
Thank you for saving me.

495
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,846
You know, even if you get
this guy that wronged you,

496
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,315
it doesn't always
make things better.

497
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:51,951
It has to be better than this.

498
00:25:03,565 --> 00:25:06,833
Patty, it's me.
Again.

499
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:09,469
I'd really love to talk.
I'm worried about you.

500
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:14,073
Anyway, just give me a call when
you get a chance, all right?

501
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:17,210
Thank you.
Bye.

502
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,312
- Barry.
- Yeah?

503
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,681
How's it look?

504
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,383
Wow, eerily familiar.

505
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:24,984
How's Patty?

506
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:26,953
She is, um,

507
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:29,489
hiding a lot of pain
behind her smile.

508
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,124
They say couples start
to resemble each other

509
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,226
after a little while.

510
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:35,695
The thing is, I mean, she only
opened up to Flash, not me.

511
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:36,896
So even if I could got her
on the phone,

512
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:38,564
I don't know what to say.

513
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:40,667
Well, it's been my experience

514
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,769
that just being around you
can be a big help.

515
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,303
Thank you.

516
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:51,577
I want an iPhone,
an iPad, and an iTouch.

517
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,414
Ho, ho, ho, dial it back,
Mr. Greedy.

518
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,316
Those are a little out
of Santa's price range.

519
00:25:57,318 --> 00:26:00,520
How about this?

520
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:05,024
Now remember,
don't open it until tomorrow.

521
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,094
It's a surprise.

522
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,511
Have you decided?

523
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:28,648
- I need more time.
- Don't we all.

524
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,384
- Decide.
- I need more time.

525
00:26:31,386 --> 00:26:34,854
Maybe if I go up there

526
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:38,991
and kill
a few of your new friends...

527
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:42,328
- No!
- One more day.

528
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,399
I'll tell your daughter
you said, "Hello."

529
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:58,141
- What's that? Is that Mardon?
- That's definitely him.

530
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,489
Atmospheric pressure
just dropped 200 hectopascals.

531
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:02,024
- Where?
- Central City Square.

532
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:03,088
The tree lighting ceremony.

533
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,027
There's thousands
of people there.

534
00:27:18,142 --> 00:27:21,944
Oh, glad to see you.
Maybe you can help me.

535
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:23,245
Help get back
in to a jail cell?

536
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:25,247
- It'll be my pleasure, Mark.
- No.

537
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,448
No, see, I'm trying to decide

538
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,017
if I should kill
everybody down there

539
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,753
with a deadly hail storm,
or... little trickier,

540
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:32,955
with acid rain,
what do you think?

541
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:35,124
Ah, let me think, um...

542
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:36,492
How about neither?

543
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:39,428
You see this wand here?
Guess what?

544
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:44,934
Um... guys?
He's flying.

545
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:47,269
He can fly?
Since when can he fly?

546
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:49,939
Well, he's using his
powers to alter the air pressure

547
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:52,341
around him to create
pockets of updraft that can...

548
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:54,210
No, he can fly.

549
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:55,744
- Barry, get him.
- Yeah.

550
00:28:27,178 --> 00:28:28,477
You didn't really think
I'd let you hurt

551
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,346
all these people,
did you?

552
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:32,281
No, of course not,

553
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:36,118
but bet you're gonna let me
hurt you.

554
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:40,656
Feliz Navidad!

555
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:44,026
Time for a real
war on Christmas.

556
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:45,194
What is this?

557
00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:47,630
That is a box
with a bomb in it.

558
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:52,568
Yup, I've handed out
about 100 of them today

559
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,237
It feels so good to give.

560
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:59,408
You see, right now,
there are 100 random children

561
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,210
<i>who've each
taken home a box</i>

562
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:02,878
<i>just like that one</i>

563
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,748
<i>and are shoving it
under their Christmas tree.</i>

564
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,816
There's no way
for you to to all of them,

565
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:09,585
even if you knew
where to look.

566
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:12,755
Oh, no,
Please don't do this.

567
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:15,324
What? Me?
Kill 100 families?

568
00:29:15,326 --> 00:29:18,260
No, that's up to you.

569
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:20,229
I'm happy just
to take your life.

570
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:22,197
So this is how it's gonna be.

571
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:26,135
You are gonna stand there
and let me end you.

572
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:28,570
Very publicly

573
00:29:28,572 --> 00:29:30,906
and very painfully

574
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:32,942
and I'll let
everybody live,

575
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:35,744
but if I see even

576
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:39,915
a little flicker
of electricity on you...

577
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:42,251
the casket makers in this town

578
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:45,087
are gonna have
a very merry Christmas.

579
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:47,823
So, Flash...

580
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:49,892
what's it gonna be?

581
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:51,694
Huh?

582
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:00,602
There you go.

583
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:10,045
- They're gonna kill Barry!
- Unless we find those bombs.

584
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:11,847
- Cisco?
- Jay, there's no way.

585
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,182
There is a way.

586
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:15,484
To find 100
randomly-placed bombs?

587
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:17,586
We don't have to find 100.

588
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:20,089
We just have to find one.
And then we get rid of them all.

589
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:21,523
- How?
- A breach.

590
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:23,325
That's right.
We sent Grodd away.

591
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:24,727
We can do the same to these
bombs, all of them.

592
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:25,961
Do you have a drone
in your workshop?

593
00:30:25,963 --> 00:30:27,129
- Yeah.
- Does it fly?

594
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,664
- Yeah.
- Good.

595
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,833
I'm taking it.
You're not getting it back.

596
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:32,334
I'll warm up the van.

597
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:50,285
I'm cross-referencing
credit card statements with

598
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:52,621
toll road usage and families
with children under ten.

599
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:53,789
Hold up...

600
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,557
Make a U-turn.
Two streets back.

601
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:06,168
Your toys.
Give them to me.

602
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,836
Mom!

603
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:10,906
Flash, you all right?

604
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:12,641
You don't look so good.

605
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:15,044
I know...

606
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:16,845
I'll give you a jolt.

607
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:25,054
Oh!

608
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:30,392
Harry, what is the plan?

609
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:32,628
One of the 52 breaches opened
by the singularity

610
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,897
is 1/4 mile
directly above the city.

611
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:37,366
We are gonna use your drone

612
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:40,436
to put this bomb
into that breach.

613
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:42,905
Okay, how does that work?
One down, 99 to blow.

614
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:45,441
Basic physics, Ramon.
Magnetism.

615
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:48,710
Magnetism. Magnets of opposite
poles attract one another.

616
00:31:48,712 --> 00:31:50,312
Help me out, Garrick.

617
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:51,880
If we can change
the dimensional frequency

618
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:53,715
of this bomb
and get it through that breach...

619
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:55,617
It'll drag all the rest of
the bombs right along with it.

620
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,853
I'll drive.
Okay, hold on.

621
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:05,727
I'm done.

622
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:07,896
He's all yours.

623
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:09,865
Oh, God...

624
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:16,905
To think
this city worships you!

625
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:22,878
But, when I kill The Flash,

626
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,348
they'll realize I'm the man
who saved Central City!

627
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,533
It's working.

628
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:46,935
- Was that you?
- No! Gut him!

629
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:49,104
All right,
I'm gutting already.

630
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:52,241
Barry,
the bombs are gone.

631
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:55,377
Uh-oh...

632
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:11,493
How do you like
the magnets, bitch?

633
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:22,604
Detective, it's taken care of.
They can't hurt anyone else.

634
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:29,111
What are you doing?

635
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:32,047
- What are you doing?
- This is for my father.

636
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:33,916
No, no, no, Detective!

637
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,686
Detective, no.
You can't do this.

638
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,496
He killed my father
for a couple hundred dollars.

639
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:47,745
What was so important that my
father had to lose his life?

640
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:49,380
Mardon will get
what he deserves.

641
00:33:49,382 --> 00:33:52,049
- He deserves to die!
- Not like this!

642
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:54,337
You don't have it
in you, pretty lady.

643
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:56,419
I've been asking myself that
for the last four years,

644
00:33:56,454 --> 00:33:57,759
and now I know.

645
00:33:57,794 --> 00:34:00,090
No, Patty!

646
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:03,009
You pull that trigger,
your life ends too.

647
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:05,696
You will go to prison.

648
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:08,405
Everything and everyone that
you could have had in your life

649
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,749
will be taken from you.

650
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:13,009
Again.

651
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:15,873
Mardon can't take anything else
from you unless you let him.

652
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,844
I didn't know your father, but
I know he wouldn't want this.

653
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:24,916
Not over him.

654
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:28,686
Please.
Please.

655
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:33,290
Mark Mardon,
you're under arrest.

656
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,930
That was beautiful.

657
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:47,338
- Barry, hey.
- Hey.

658
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,140
Everyone's heading over
to our place for Christmas.

659
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:51,842
You okay?

660
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:54,078
Yeah, no,
nothing a little meta-human

661
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,181
regenerative healing
capabilities won't cure.

662
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:59,116
How'd it go with Francine?

663
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:01,252
It was good.
It was really good, actually.

664
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:06,190
I mean, I spent so long
lying about her being dead

665
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:08,025
that I started
to believe it myself.

666
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:10,794
But the truth is, those feelings
were always there.

667
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:14,465
That anger, that regret,
the guilt...

668
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,668
I just didn't realize how much
I needed to forgive her.

669
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,506
And now...
there's room for another West.

670
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:24,174
Did you meet him?

671
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:27,244
No.
He still doesn't know.

672
00:35:27,246 --> 00:35:29,013
That'll come.

673
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:31,815
- Wow. You have a son.
- I know, right?

674
00:35:31,817 --> 00:35:33,284
It's crazy.

675
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:36,654
- Speaking of which, take this.
- What?

676
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:39,556
No, no, no, no,
I can't take that.

677
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:45,296
I've always said that one day
I would give this to my son...

678
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,605
And now I have.

679
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:58,409
Merry Christmas.

680
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:00,477
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

681
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,414
Love you.

682
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,015
- I love you too.
- See you at the house.

683
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:06,917
Yeah.

684
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,866
I know that you're not him...

685
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:28,005
But he's not here
and I have to say this for me.

686
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:31,408
In that video message,

687
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,945
you said that...

688
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:38,549
that I would never
really be happy...

689
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:45,689
And I've been trying...
I've been trying really hard.

690
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:50,527
After what Joe said,

691
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:52,863
and helping Patty,

692
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:56,266
I realize that
you're still in my heart.

693
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:02,573
How much I hate you

694
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:04,775
for what you've done.

695
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:13,150
I don't want to hate you
anymore, I can't.

696
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:15,285
Can't hate you anymore.

697
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:20,891
I forgive you.

698
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,000
You need me for something?

699
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:33,370
No, no, I'm good.

700
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:38,542
You know, you should come over
for Christmas tonight.

701
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:41,979
You shouldn't be alone.

702
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:45,015
<i>It's a nice offer.</i>

703
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:48,018
I can't celebrate
without my daughter.

704
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,820
All right.

705
00:37:56,462 --> 00:38:00,230
<i>♪ I saw you comin' down
my chimney ♪</i>

706
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:01,965
<i>♪ I saw you, Santa ♪</i>

707
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:04,768
- Strong enough?
- We'll see.

708
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:09,573
I'll be right back.

709
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:10,808
- Hey.
- Oh!

710
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,076
What do you have there?

711
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:14,211
- Mistletoe.
- What's mistletoe?

712
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:16,880
Oh, um,
it's a hemiparasitic plant

713
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:19,016
from the genus
Santalaceae family

714
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:20,684
in North America,
I think.

715
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:23,520
Caitlin, I'm kidding.
We have mistletoe on Earth-2.

716
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:26,623
Right, of course.

717
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:30,294
Um, we also have this
tradition over there.

718
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,401
We have that
tradition here too.

719
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:38,802
- Aww.
- Finally.

720
00:38:38,804 --> 00:38:40,270
Oh, let me get that.

721
00:38:40,272 --> 00:38:41,672
- Eggnog, please?
- Yeah.

722
00:38:41,674 --> 00:38:43,207
Hi, I'm so glad
you could make it.

723
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:44,675
Aw, thank you for having me.

724
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:45,843
Merry Christmas.
This is for you.

725
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:48,112
- Thank you.
- Of course.

726
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:49,713
- Hey.
- Hi.

727
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:50,948
I've been really
worried about you.

728
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,583
- I've been calling.
- I know...

729
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:54,651
and I'm really sorry.

730
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:56,987
I just have been dealing
with something by myself,

731
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:59,723
but I want to tell you
about it.

732
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:02,126
I think that I'm ready to.

733
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:04,294
Someone reminded me
of what's important,

734
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:07,664
so if you want to hear, I
would like to share it with you.

735
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:09,233
That would be
the best gift I could get.

736
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:10,868
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,504
I don't know.
This is a really sweet sweater.

738
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:15,472
I hope it's as
sweet as this one.

739
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:17,508
It's matching.

740
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,876
- Thank you.
- Of course.

741
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:21,178
- Detective Spivot.
- Hi!

742
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,747
- What brings you here?
- Merry Christmas.

743
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:28,652
Well, uh, I'm...
Barry's girlfriend.

744
00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:31,288
- About time.
- Cheers.

745
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,891
Are we expecting anybody else?

746
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,360
- Not that I know of.
- Maybe Harry changed his mind.

747
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,337
Hi, I'm Wally.
I'm Francine's son.

748
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,748
I'm... I'm... I'm Joe.

749
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,684
This is Iris.

750
00:40:00,686 --> 00:40:03,787
- Hi.
- Hi.

751
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:09,593
Uh, I just wanted to...

752
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,695
I don't know.

753
00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:14,364
I guess now's a bad time.
You've got company, so...

754
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:16,633
No. No, no, no.
Come in.

755
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,454
Time's up, Wells.

756
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:40,123
What's it gonna be?

757
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,459
I know what you're doing.

758
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:46,463
I know why you keep sending
villain after villain

759
00:40:46,465 --> 00:40:49,299
from our Earth to this one.

760
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,802
You want Barry to get faster.

761
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:56,073
You want him to get stronger.

762
00:40:56,075 --> 00:41:00,177
You want him to become more
powerful, more full of...

763
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:02,579
speed force.

764
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:09,586
You're fattening him up
like a Christmas goose.

765
00:41:09,588 --> 00:41:11,655
The more power he has,

766
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:14,858
the more I can take

767
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,795
and you're going to help me.

768
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:21,031
Let me see her first.

769
00:41:24,203 --> 00:41:25,569
Daddy?

770
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:32,843
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

771
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:34,378
Please help me.

772
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,013
Don't let him
take me back there.

773
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:38,181
I won't...

774
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:40,517
Now decide.

775
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:45,255
In return
for your daughter's life...

776
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:47,591
I'll do it.

777
00:41:51,096 --> 00:41:54,798
I'll help you steal
The Flash's speed.

778
00:41:56,987 --> 00:42:06,987
