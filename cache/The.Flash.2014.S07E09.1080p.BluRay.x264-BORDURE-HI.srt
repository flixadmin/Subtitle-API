1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,380
She's dead.

2
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:07,842
You killed Alexa.

3
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:10,070
[Speed Force as Nora Allen]
Barry and I did it together.

4
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,095
That was the only way.

5
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,889
She was the strongest.

6
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,935
I needed every ounce of power,
including your strength, to kill her.

7
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,771
I'm supposed to protect lives,
not destroy them!

8
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,857
I'm helping you clean up
your mess, Barry. This is your fault!

9
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:26,694
The night you brought me back,
you created these monsters.

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,322
You and your lightning rod.

11
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,493
When you regained your speed,

12
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,704
I wasn't the only thing
you two willed into existence.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,790
- That's impossible.
- Really?

14
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,128
Alexa was afraid to come here,
but she trusted you.

15
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:46,922
Why?

16
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,469
Because deep down,
she could feel a connection with you.

17
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,222
The same connection
that you feel with me now.

18
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,391
But these new Forces,

19
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,394
the way they've merged with
the people they chose as avatars,

20
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,896
it's corrupted them.
Because it's unnatural.

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,275
But once the other two were gone...

22
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,026
I won't help you kill again.

23
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:08,653
Oh.

24
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,198
My beautiful boy.

25
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,577
You have no choice.

26
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:18,162
Because if you don't,

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,041
those things will kill everyone
you've sworn to keep safe.

28
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:23,710
Is that what you want?

29
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,964
Then please, Barry...

30
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,091
help me.

31
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,430
No.

32
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,975
You have to help me, damn it!

33
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,102
Nora, stop!

34
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,442
I will destroy
those other Forces, Barry,

35
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,360
with or without your help.

36
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,697
Then you'll see that I'm right.

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
[Caitlin] What a day.

38
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:26,397
First Frost is sent to Iron Heights
for life, and now Alexa's dead.

39
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,524
We can't let this happen again.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
[Caitlin] I'll get to work.

41
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,321
I need to figure out
how Nora was able to...

42
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:34,864
Kill a god?

43
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,407
She could because she had help.

44
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,159
Barry, she tricked you.

45
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,242
No, she manipulated me.

46
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,913
Just like she's been doing
the whole time.

47
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,081
Honey, I know how you feel...

48
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,501
but not everything she did and said
was a lie.

49
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,063
I mean, there were moments
that felt real, too. That must mean...

50
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,588
Iris, we can't trust her anymore.

51
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:58,763
What about what Nora said about
you two creating the other Forces?

52
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:01,057
I mean, there's no proof.

53
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,018
Well, what if we find out
if Nora is telling the truth?

54
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,187
If she is, then that means

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,731
the other Forces would have been born
the same day she was.

56
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:09,899
I'll pull satellite scans

57
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,377
from the night we fought
Mirror Monarch.

58
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,194
Please and thank you.

59
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,118
Okay. You see that cluster
of kinetic energy readings?

60
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,330
Pretty sure that's the Speed Force
being reborn in the Speed Lab.

61
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,458
Whoa. There they are.

62
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:30,628
Three brand-spanking-new
isotopic signatures.

63
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,090
Nora was right.

64
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,051
We created the Forces.

65
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,349
[Cisco] Fuerza's dead.

66
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,017
Nora killed her.

67
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,186
She killed the Strength Force?

68
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,106
And now she wants to kill
the other two Forces.

69
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,234
Maybe I should go to San Francisco.

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
What?

71
00:03:56,571 --> 00:04:00,032
My series of photos on Eva's attacks
got accepted at a gallery there.

72
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,367
Babe, congrats!

73
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,413
Well, I was thinking of going
to help them install the exhibition.

74
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,206
I'd ask you to come,

75
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,751
but I know you have your perfect job
at S.T.A.R. Labs

76
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,294
and your amazing friends.

77
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,796
I mean, you're an OG member
of Team Flash.

78
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:17,967
Are you okay?

79
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,263
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

80
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,350
This is an Isotopic Scanning Lens.

81
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,020
It can detect the signatures
of all four Forces.

82
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,856
Even kinetic signatures
from Speed Force Nora.

83
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,399
And if one's nearby...

84
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,068
[Kamillia] It lights up
like an overexposed landscape.

85
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:38,738
In which case, you run the other way.

86
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,073
Okay? I'm serious.

87
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,701
I just want you to be safe.

88
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,247
Are you sure you're okay?

89
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,460
[phone rings]

90
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,839
Oh, it's Barry. I gotta get back.
They could have found Nora,

91
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,674
or worse, she's come back on her own.

92
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,387
How bad is it?

93
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,056
Okay. Did Nora kill somebody else?

94
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,517
No. And I have a way to make sure
she never does.

95
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,393
Okay. How?

96
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,522
I'm here. What's going on?

97
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,651
I spent all night
coming up with a way to fix all this.

98
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,278
Okay. What's the solve?

99
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,114
We need to wipe the new Forces
out of existence.

100
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,200
Barry, what are you saying?

101
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,701
I want to go back in time...

102
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,537
and uncreate them.

103
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,632
Barry, you're talking about
creating another Flashpoint.

104
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,008
You know we can't do that.

105
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,486
Not if I can figure out
a way to go back

106
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,053
that doesn't affect the timeline.

107
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,013
Which would be impossible.

108
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:48,891
Barry, look, I know
that you're devastated about Alexa.

109
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,018
But uncreating Forces?

110
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,354
That crosses a line.

111
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,981
I convinced Alexa to come here.

112
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,774
Her death is my fault.

113
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,319
If we don't get these new Forces
out of Psych and Deon,

114
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,822
Nora will kill them, too.
So it's on us to fix this.

115
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:03,948
By killing Deon and Psych?

116
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,533
No. I'm not killing them.

117
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,886
I'm saving them from the Forces
that took over their lives.

118
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,012
Whoever they were before this,

119
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,764
they can go back
to being those same people again.

120
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,988
And what about the other Force
that was born that night?

121
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,334
Nora. If you uncreate...

122
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,937
We're only going to target
the new Forces,

123
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,296
not Nora. That's the plan.

124
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,008
But if something goes wrong,
Barry, you might lose your speed.

125
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,342
Then I lose my speed.

126
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,305
All right? It's worth the risk
to keep everyone safe.

127
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,764
And what about the risk to Nora?

128
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,892
Does her life not matter at all?

129
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,476
Nora's not a person, Iris!

130
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,314
[sighs] She never was.

131
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:42,320
Look, if we uncreate these Forces,
we can put everything back to normal.

132
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,655
Hopefully, that'll fix her, too.

133
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:45,739
Hopefully?

134
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,327
Barry, do you hear yourself
right now?

135
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,913
Iris, I'm trying to save people.

136
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,167
I mean, how do you not see
this is the right thing to do?

137
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,962
The right thing to do would be trying
to get through to Nora.

138
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,173
Just like how we beat Eva.

139
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,009
Just like how we talked down
Abra Kadabra. That is what we do.

140
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,220
We tried talking to her.
All Nora did was double down.

141
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,719
- [sighs in exasperation]
- There's no reaching her.

142
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,142
Obviously, we disagree on this.

143
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,393
Yes, we do.

144
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,563
I have to do it.

145
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,153
Then you'll be doing it without me.

146
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:36,082
Wait. You want
to go after a Force of Nature?

147
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,710
Yeah. If I can convince Nora
not to kill Deon and Psych,

148
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,421
then Barry will see
that she can be reasoned with.

149
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,758
But how do we find her? I mean,
she's the frickin' Speed Force.

150
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,386
Well, if she finds us first,
at least we'll know she's coming.

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,848
Holy crap, you guys gotta see this.

152
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,443
You see that bright spot
at the center of you?

153
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,271
I think that's kinetic energy.

154
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,775
Guys, this is gonna sound
really wild, but...

155
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,444
Yeah, 'cause a ghost-hunting lens
isn't weird enough?

156
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,155
But if Barry and I
created these Forces,

157
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,950
what if there's a little bit
of each of them inside of us?

158
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,702
Like you're all connected.

159
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,122
Wait. Iris, when you're
over by the door,

160
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,581
your glow was brighter.

161
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,184
Like there's something
in that direction

162
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,459
that was intensifying it.

163
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,212
- What if...
- That something is Nora?

164
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,508
Guys, we can use me as a divining rod
to track her down.

165
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,219
Yup, that's weirder.

166
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,975
Elemental Force Particles?

167
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,144
They're the particles
that created the new Forces.

168
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,122
The lightning bolt
that re-birthed the Speed Force

169
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,147
was full of 'em.

170
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,732
Now, if we can extract a sample

171
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,692
of these Force Particles
from the lightning,

172
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,153
then we can send out
an electromagnetic pulse

173
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,904
that'll seek out
those same particles,

174
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,908
wherever they may be
along the temporal spectrum.

175
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,451
And you can erase
the new Forces from existence.

176
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,411
That's not bad.

177
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,955
But small detail, though.

178
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:01,834
How in the world are you supposed
to extract these particles

179
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,170
from a giant bolt of lightning?

180
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:07,048
A few weeks ago,
when Barry was Spock-Flash,

181
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,633
he modified the Tachyon Enhancer
to siphon

182
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,552
Mirror Monarch's dark matter photons.

183
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,387
So all we have to do
is tweak the enhancer

184
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,806
to siphon Force Particles
instead of photons.

185
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,727
Tweaking the Tachyon Enhancer...

186
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,106
and then send out an EMP
to 86 the Forces. That's genius.

187
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,524
I mean, it's foolproof even.

188
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,697
But it still doesn't answer
how we're supposed to do this

189
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,075
and protect the timeline.

190
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:38,621
I'll figure it out, somehow.
I will. I'll figure it out.

191
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,832
Man, I wish Nash Wells was here.

192
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,145
I mean, he came up with most of these
equations for the ASF machine.

193
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,089
I feel like he'd crack this
easy-peasy.

194
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,467
Modify the Particle
Harness Collector.

195
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,802
I'll be back as soon as I can.

196
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,096
Roger that, but where are you going?

197
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,634
To get the one person
who could help us pull this off.

198
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,108
Oh, no. Tess!

199
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,694
[laughs] President Bartlet
just mixed up his meds.

200
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,657
That's not gonna be good,
but great TV. Whoa.

201
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,743
[sighs, laughs]

202
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,330
Allen. Allen.

203
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,459
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call.

204
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,546
Not exactly. We need your help.

205
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,339
Well, how bad is it?

206
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,800
- That depends.
- On?

207
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,344
Whether or not you can
help us do the impossible.

208
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,447
Well, well, well. Honey, I'm home.

209
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,535
Holy deus ex machina. Timeless Wells.

210
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,581
- Perfect timing.
- Always.

211
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,417
So, apparently,
there's danger in Central City.

212
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,544
- Apparently.
- Well, then let's get busy.

213
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,255
Well, do you really think
we could do this

214
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,715
without affecting the timeline?

215
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:13,841
I know we can.

216
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,260
As long as we use me as your guide.

217
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,363
Harrison was there
when the Forces were created,

218
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,222
so if we use the other him
from that night

219
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,849
as a beacon to lock on to...

220
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,934
Hopefully, I can go back
to that exact moment...

221
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,146
but also bring Allen along
for the ride,

222
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,564
and he'll collect the particles.

223
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,026
Wait. So you can travel through time
with a plus one?

224
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,359
It should work.

225
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,404
When Allen and I go back

226
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,990
to that exact moment that those
dangerous Forces were created

227
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,366
17 days ago,

228
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,494
I will create
a protective time-bubble.

229
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,706
All right?
From that moment until now.

230
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,084
Preserving those days
in this timeline

231
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,713
and preventing
anything from changing.

232
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,760
Which would also allow us
to wipe out the new Forces

233
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:01,972
without altering any of the events
that have happened since then.

234
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,808
Yo, that is trippy.

235
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,810
Cisco, this'll work.

236
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,020
What about Iris?

237
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,941
When she sees everyone's safe,
she'll come around. She has to.

238
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:16,570
You're not convinced. I wasn't either
when Allen told me about this,

239
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:17,821
but then I thought of Tess.

240
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,159
I thought of my wife,
and how my future with Tess was...

241
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,244
ripped from me.

242
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,038
Until this gift,

243
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,750
which has allowed me
to relive every single day...

244
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,626
with Tess.

245
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,253
But only...

246
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,257
because I took a chance.

247
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,644
All right. I'm in.

248
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,569
It's brighter.
We must be getting close.

249
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,906
[sighs]

250
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:02,992
She should be here.

251
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,494
Maybe it was a false positive?

252
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,999
Or maybe since
Nora is the Speed Force,

253
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,418
her isotopic signature
is all over the city by now.

254
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:13,961
So what do we do?

255
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,213
I don't know,
but we are running out of time.

256
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:17,965
Well, Cisco always says

257
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,318
you can't solve a problem
till your asking the right question.

258
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,804
Isn't "Where's Nora's kinetic energy
leading us?" the right question?

259
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,599
No. The right question is,

260
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,684
"Where's Nora?"

261
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,538
We've been trying
to find the Speed Force

262
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,356
when we should be looking
for the person.

263
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,650
So where would
the real Nora Allen go?

264
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,444
Home.

265
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,612
Come on.

266
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,411
[exhales] Harness
modifications complete.

267
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,497
Let's get some time particles.

268
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,917
Actually, you know what? Um...

269
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,754
Let me just run one more diagnostic

270
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,672
on the collection disk.

271
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:01,258
[mumbling] I just need one more...

272
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,768
Oh, frak.

273
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,064
Yo, Deon. [chuckles nervously]

274
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,774
What's...

275
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,360
- What's good, man?
- You tell me.

276
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,446
Something drew me here.

277
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,032
Was it you?

278
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,744
- I don't think it was...
- Who's this?

279
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,454
I'm sorry. Who are you?

280
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,831
Who am I? Who are you?

281
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,915
Who is he?

282
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,336
Look, guys. All's good in the hood,
all right? Look.

283
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,547
Barry, this is Deon.

284
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,590
Still Force.

285
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,095
And Deon, this is Barry,
who's actually the...

286
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,807
owner of this

287
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,683
fine establishment.

288
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,228
So you're the landlord.

289
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,086
What's that got to do with anything?

290
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:01,360
Deon, it's good to meet you.

291
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,654
[Cisco] Actually, you remember me?

292
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,622
I was with him.
You called us wannabe Urkels.

293
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,533
- Oh, yeah. Cornballs.
- [nervous laughter]

294
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,659
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

295
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,035
Corn... so funny.

296
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,579
Who's the egghead?

297
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,457
Harrison Wells.

298
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,501
I'm a fellow...

299
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:21,964
visitor to Barry's place.

300
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,511
You know, y'all are being
real friendly right now.

301
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,099
But I think
y'all are acting like that

302
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,600
because you're afraid of me.

303
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,395
Now why is that?

304
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,400
No. We're just making a...
We're just doing an experiment...

305
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,482
Shut up!

306
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,167
Now,

307
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,630
why do I get the feeling...

308
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,884
that you're the reason I'm this way?

309
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,263
Because that's true.

310
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,266
And I'm sorry.

311
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,977
I never meant for this to happen.

312
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,396
So please let me fix it.

313
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,857
Fix it? Fix it?

314
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,650
So I'm a mistake?

315
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,278
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

316
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:29,948
I can feel it.

317
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,830
You wanna destroy me.

318
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,582
No. I want to save you.

319
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,376
Deon... Deon.

320
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,298
There are three other Forces.
People like you.

321
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,302
One of them, she wants to kill you.

322
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,972
Now, she's already killed
one of the other Forces.

323
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,642
The Strength Force.
And she didn't care

324
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,686
when the person
containing that Force died, too.

325
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:05,400
So, I need to make it
so the Still Force never found you.

326
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,320
It's the only way to keep you safe.

327
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,076
[softly] Nah.

328
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,454
I like being me.

329
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,213
I get it.

330
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,425
Oh, I get it.

331
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,634
Deon?

332
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,803
No, I get it. I get it.

333
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,606
This is what you're gonna use
to do it, huh?

334
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,158
This is what you're going to use
to make it like I never existed?

335
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,226
Not you. Just the Force inside...

336
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,436
Man, I am that Force!

337
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,107
Do you have any idea what it's like

338
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,150
to be told
that you shouldn't be here?

339
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,781
Well, I never asked to be born.

340
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,078
Deon, listen to me.
Look at what you're doing.

341
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,623
Okay? You don't understand
what you are.

342
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:02,749
Yeah, I do.

343
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,213
I'm a god.

344
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,051
Maybe it's time you understood that.

345
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,343
Deon, wait...

346
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,017
Time to bounce.

347
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,269
[Timeless Wells] Right?

348
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,651
What the hell just happened?

349
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,576
[Timeless Wells] I think your friend
Deon just stopped time.

350
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,119
Yeah, he does that.

351
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,787
Hey, why'd he leave?

352
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,415
Because I couldn't stop him.

353
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,009
[Barry] Deon just aged the harness
1,000 years.

354
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,427
How bad is it?

355
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,630
[Timeless Wells] Pretty bad.

356
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,557
But not hopeless. See,

357
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:05,437
I figured if we can find some way
to somehow create some sort of...

358
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,360
I was working on the collection disk
when Deon showed up.

359
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,278
I figured I'd better hide it
just in case.

360
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,448
[chuckles] Chester, you're a life saver.

361
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:20,702
As for the vest,
I'm used to working with junk.

362
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,830
I'll just need a bunch of
replacement parts from my garage

363
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,474
and she'll be up-and-running
in no time.

364
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,417
With a little help, that is.

365
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,669
I'm with you.

366
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,842
What's up?

367
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,138
I think Deon's right.

368
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:45,894
We can't just uncreate
these Forces like that.

369
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:50,065
So, what, we should just give up?

370
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,610
On this? Yeah, we give up.

371
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,196
Doesn't that feel like
the right thing to do?

372
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,119
Cisco, Nora will kill him

373
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,121
if I don't do something
to prevent it.

374
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,831
Just like she killed Alexa.

375
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,750
'Cause she's not gonna stop
until all the Forces

376
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,253
and the people
connected to them are dead.

377
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,297
Why can't you see
I'm trying to save him?

378
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,425
He doesn't want to be saved by you!

379
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,011
He just wants to be given
the chance to be himself.

380
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,139
[sighs]

381
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,558
And Iris understood that.

382
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,019
Look, every second
that we leave these Forces

383
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,564
inside Deon and Psych,
people are in danger.

384
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,108
It's only a matter of time
before someone dies

385
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,311
in one of Psych's nightmares

386
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,446
or gets killed by some kind of
Deon time anomaly.

387
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,406
Not to mention Nora declared war.

388
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,075
She doesn't care
how many people she kills,

389
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,827
as long as the Forces die.

390
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,910
You're right.

391
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,496
Yes, you're absolutely right.

392
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,498
And something needs to be
done about that.

393
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,250
And I don't have all the answers.

394
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,878
All I know is...

395
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,590
this can't be it.

396
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,263
You guys understand, right?

397
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,933
I have to uncreate these Forces.

398
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,481
Like I said,
I am Team Flash all the way.

399
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,111
But Cisco has a point, man.

400
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:23,867
Harrison?

401
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,788
If uncreating these Forces is what
you feel in your heart is right,

402
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,372
I'll take that voyage with you.

403
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,460
But all I ask is that you think,
truly think...

404
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,797
about the choice you're making.

405
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,724
Please fix the harness.

406
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:53,980
Good luck.

407
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,177
- [device chimes]
- [Kamilla] Iris, you were right.

408
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,370
These isotopic readings
are off the chart.

409
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,705
[Allegra] Where are we?

410
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,916
[Iris West] The old Allen house.

411
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,794
This is where Barry's mom was killed.

412
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,756
He also said this is where
the Speed Force went when she died.

413
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,846
Whoa. That old car is hella vintage.

414
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,889
Almost looks brand-new.

415
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,559
Must be a collector or something.

416
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,771
You can ask him when we're done,
assuming we survive.

417
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,197
[Joe] Caitlin called me about Alexa.

418
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,950
So, it turns out

419
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,912
when Iris and I brought back
the Speed Force,

420
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,083
we also created three new Forces.

421
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,795
It's our fault that
they're out in the world,

422
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,381
hurting people, killing them.

423
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:07,012
So I feel like I have to be
the one to take them out.

424
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:08,889
These Forces,

425
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,977
you think they're above saving, too?

426
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,480
I think it would be
safer for everybody

427
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,607
if they didn't exist.

428
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:22,277
You remember
when Wally first showed up?

429
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,864
Man, it wasn't just that
I found out I have a son.

430
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:31,745
I found out I have a son
who kept getting his butt in trouble.

431
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,831
But he was mad at the world.

432
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,458
There was one point

433
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,046
he said to me that he wished
he had never been born.

434
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,381
So I tried

435
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:48,303
to get close, and he pushed me away.

436
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,764
And I tried to give him space.

437
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,850
Then he felt abandoned.

438
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,061
No parent is perfect.

439
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,480
But one thing
I never stopped doing...

440
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,815
was trying.

441
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,610
And look at the man he grew up to be.

442
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,320
Strong,

443
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,281
kind, good.

444
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,700
Yeah, I get it. I do. But...

445
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,330
I mean, these Forces,
they're not my children.

446
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,623
You sure?

447
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,291
You said it yourself.

448
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,170
You brought them into this world.

449
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:26,007
Look, I know they've all
done terrible things.

450
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,343
But what if they could change?

451
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:35,100
You never judge your kids
for who they are now.

452
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:42,107
You help them become
who they know they can be

453
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,525
when they grow up.

454
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,486
So lead with love.

455
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:52,367
After that, it is up to them.

456
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,708
[door creaking]

457
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,423
[electricity crackling]

458
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,887
[Iris West] This is Barry's old room.

459
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,402
[door creaking]

460
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,410
Nora?

461
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,084
[tense music playing]

462
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,089
Psych.

463
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,387
[Psych] Hi, Mom.

464
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,152
Esperanza, don't kill me!

465
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,329
They're everywhere.
We need to keep them out.

466
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,364
Psych, stop.
You're hurting them, please.

467
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,617
Oh, they're hurting themselves.

468
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,077
Sure, I pull back the curtain,

469
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,079
but what they see is up to them.

470
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,414
Now before I show you
your worst fear,

471
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,832
why were you looking for me?

472
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,958
I wasn't.

473
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,293
No.

474
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,754
You were looking for the Speed Force.

475
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,546
Nora.

476
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,966
Why? Why are you so desperate
to find her?

477
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,051
Is it to hurt her?

478
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,928
I want to talk to her
so I can help her.

479
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,179
Are you sure?

480
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,933
Because I'm feeling the pain
that she has inflicted upon you.

481
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,142
[inhales sharply]

How deeply she's torn apart
your relationships your whole life.

483
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:48,525
Actually, the suffering she's caused
is quite beautiful.

484
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,152
That wasn't Nora. She's lost control,
just like you have.

00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,404
But if you let me,
I can help you both.

[laughs] I don't need your help.

what you fear most.

It's the person you seek.

You'll never measure up.

[Chester] Okay, it's working.

495
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,674
Now, when you're close enough
to siphon particles,

496
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,241
the disk'll light up.

Guys, I appreciate you helping me.

00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,664
Make sure the proton collection
housing's double fused.

499
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:46,874
[Timeless Wells] We did.

500
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,627
And it's good to see you.

501
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,255
What changed your mind?

502
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,548
Look, this is dangerous.

503
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,842
And it doesn't feel right...

Okay. So, Barry.

508
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,900
All you need to do

509
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:14,569
is get close enough
to the Speed Force lightning

510
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,738
to collect a sample of each Force.

The PHC
and timeless Wells' time-bubble

This is where it all started.

00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,517
We should get to the roof.

You think you can be a good wife,

00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:03,928

Everything you do
pales in comparison to me.

Besides, how could you be
a good mother?

531
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,604
You never even had one.

I'm not listening to you.

You don't have to.
You already know it's the truth.

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,736
No, you're not real.

There's no escaping your own fear.

536

I know you're still here, Psych.

537
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,952
[Psych] Very good. Hm.

538
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,662
It is not every day

539
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,707
that someone can sense my presence
in their nightmare.

540
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,791
I'm not just someone.

541

We have a connection.

I know you can feel that, too.

543
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,298
Perhaps. It's not going
to help you though.

544
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,051
Escape one nightmare
and I'll just serve up another,

545
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:46,262
because there's always
more terror to unlock.

546
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,269
Come on.

I have a team that can help you

[Psych] What makes you think
I'm not in control?

554
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,748
I know you didn't choose
to have these powers,

and you shouldn't have
to go through this alone.

I went looking for Nora.

613
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:02,328
I thought that
if I could just talk to her

614
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,788
that I could fix everything.

615

But I ended up finding Psych instead.

You were right.

617
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,214
I couldn't get through to him,

618
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,508
and it probably would have been
the same with Nora.

No, I'm the one
who should have listened.

these Forces can be.

what are we supposed to do?

that we can't judge Psych and Deon
for who they are now.

We have to help them become

00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:41,595
There was a tremor,
and Alexa sat up and looked at me.

647
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,012
Alexa's alive?

648
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:46,766
She was for a second,
but she's not anymore.

649
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:50,561
Which doesn't make any sense,
medically speaking.

650
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,190
What if us being back in sync
is what woke her up for the moment?

651
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,109
Yeah, then she reconnected
with the Strength Force.

652
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,905
Is it crazy to think
that we did this?

653
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:03,656
No.

654
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,910
Because we're all connected.

655
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,454
And if we woke her up once...

656
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:12,082
Then we could
bring her back permanently.

657
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,079
[gasps]

658
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,252
Why is everyone looking at me?

659
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,223
Listen, I'd ask you to stay,
but I already know the answer.

660
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,600
Man's gotta be where his heart lies.

661
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:17,022
He's just got to learn
to listen to it.

662
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,031
One more thing before I go.

663
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:31,412
Whether it's me or...

664
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,957
any of the many Wells predecessors,

665
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,043
I want you to know that you taught us

666
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,548
every inch as much as we taught you.

667
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,634
Maybe more.

668
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,233
Yeah, I'm never going to
get used to that.

669
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,071
Are you okay?

670
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:10,951
Yeah.

671
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,246
For the first time in a long while,

672
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,707
yeah, I feel okay.

673
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:22,004
Good, because I've been
thinking about something,

674
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,382
and after tonight,
I know I have to do it.

675
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,802
Okay, that's just weird.

676
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:32,389
I was literally about to say
the exact same thing to you.

677
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,163
- I have to leave Central City.
- I have to leave Central City.

678
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,233
- Thank God.
- Are you kidding me?

679
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,276
Oh, my God.

680
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:46,779
Babe...

681
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,031
What are you gonna tell Team Citizen?

682
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,533
What are you gonna tell Team Flash?

683
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,833
[hip-hop song playing on headphones]

684
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,753
<i>Let a dog roam
And he'll find his way home</i>

685
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,838
<i>Home of the brave
My home is a cage</i>

686
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,591
<i>Hey, yo, I'm a slave
'Til my home is a grave</i>

687
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:10,302
<i>Stop, drop</i>

688
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,680
<i>Shut 'em down, open up shop...</i>

689
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:21,078
[sniffles] You're the one
who's after me?

690
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,650
You don't look so tough.

691
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,325
What are you?

692
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,828
A reckoning.
