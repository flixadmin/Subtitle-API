<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

Alfred.

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:09,393
- The manor.
- It's my fault.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,916
Mr. Cobblepot.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,630
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me!

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,793
You're having a baby
with Barbara.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,119
<i>You don't think I'm fit</i>

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,839

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,920
<i>- You're leaving Gotham.
- I believe the time</i>

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,156
<i>has come for a change
of scenery.</i>

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,200
You found a way
out of Gotham?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,789
It's a submarine.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,034
Reunification with
the mainland hangs on

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,511
<i>by a thread. Toxic chemicals
rain down onto the city,</i>

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,315
<i>and the government
cuts us adrift for good.</i>

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,000
<i>Gotham's Golden Rule.</i>

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,677
No heroes.

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,035
<i>Watch out for him.</i>

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,754
He thinks he's a white knight.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,874
<i>He's a loose cannon.</i>

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,952
You two here to pick up
your grandchildren?

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,276
Come on, Babs.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,272
You got the only full bar
in Gotham.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,909
And if you two dinosaurs want
to keep coming here,

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,753
you better up your intel.

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,230
We got a lead on
some black market heating oil.

Well, you found us.

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,311

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,676
About her.

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,758
About what we did
to the girl.

<i>Can you please repeat
your story for Mr. Wayne, madam?</i>

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,830
We live in the shelter
on West End.

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,056
There are so many of us
crammed in there.

55
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Uh...

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,034
so much uncertainty,

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
fear.

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,631
And with the river poisoned,
it should've been awful,

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,996
but... people came together,

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,630
made it a home.

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,959
What happened?

62
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,838
<i>Couple
of weeks ago, we...</i>

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
heard rumors about something
underneath the building...

64
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
...where it connects
to the sewer.

65
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,632
<i>Then people
started going missing.</i>

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,032
Hank, my husband,

67
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,389
wanted to look for them.

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,153
Said we were a family.

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,831
So the two of you
went searching for them.

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,355
It was so dark.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,320
I didn't see
what attacked us.

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,039
I hit my head.

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,236
And when I woke up,
Hank was gone.

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,040
Please, Mr. Wayne.

75
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,679
<i>We have a daughter.</i>

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,992
We'll do everything
we can.

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,960
Should we tell
Gordon?

78
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,274
He's stretched
thin as it is.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,916
Alfred, we don't know who
or what is down there.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,671
We know there's a man
down there, in danger,

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,072
and we know this
lady sent for us.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,992
So go on, then. What do
you think we should do?

83
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,874
Let's go find him.

84
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,111
Under normal circumstances,
I wouldn't call you

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
for a couple of stiffs.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,696
What do you normally do
when a couple of your patrons

87
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,074
- get stabbed?
- Bury the bodies.

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,200
Find out who did it and
then bury those bodies.

89
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,480
See, that's not something
you should be telling a cop.

90
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,096
We're living
in a different world, Harvey.

91
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,395
So why <i>did</i> you call us?

92
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,960
Take a look.

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,835
Boggs and Lewis.

94
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,470
You know them?

95
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,719
They were cops.

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,976
They were gone
before you joined.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,376
- What happened?
<i>- They came around,</i>

98
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,119
peddling third-rate intel.

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,114
It was closing time,
so I let 'em in.

100
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,112
And then some other fossil
knifed them.

101
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,319
You saw him?

102
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,280
Yeah, he must've snuck in.
Looked like a cop, too.

103
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,516
These two knew him.

104
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
Bartender said
they called him

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,875
Micks... Hicks...

106
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Dix?

107
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Maybe.

108
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,110
No way.

109
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,955
Dix was Harvey's
old partner.

110
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,998
Well, there we go.
Case closed.

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,536
So you're telling me this guy
rolled in here in a wheelchair,

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,279
stabbed these two,
and rolled on out?

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,034
He wasn't in a wheelchair.

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,696
Then it couldn't be Dix.
He's been paralyzed

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,915
for the last 15 years.

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,874
Harvey, you're confusing me
with someone who cares.

117
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,776
I called you as a courtesy.
And now I'm wishing

118
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,520
I just dumped these two
corpses in an alley.

119
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,037
Do we even know
if Dix is still in Gotham

120
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,680
after the bridges blew?

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,869
I heard he moved into an
apartment about a year ago.

122
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,473
I meant to check up on him,
but... it can't be him.

123
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,616
I hear what you're saying,
but we should still talk to him.

124
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,869
Maybe he knows something.

125
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Fine.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,150
How are you feeling?

127
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,794
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Look,

129
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,720
I've been giving you space,

130
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,456
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,856
I'm gonna be a part
of this kid's life.

132
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,553
Oh, you seem pretty confident
about that.

133
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I am.

134
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,680
Reunification's gonna happen.

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,856
You should think
about what kind of person

136
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,155
you want to be when it does.

137
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,640
It's a chance
for you to start anew.

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,033
I like who I am.

139
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,870
Uh-huh.

140
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,675
You were due hours ago.

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,320
Yes, I was.

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,040
But I had to get us lunch.

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,551
- And I met Dale.
- I see that.

144
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,400
Do you see this?

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
Our <i>secret</i> plan
to get off this island.

146
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Relax.

147
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,837
Dale is
completely trustworthy.

148
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,616
How do you know we can trust him
if you just met him?

149
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,280
Because he's mute
and dumb as a post.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,118
Look, I know you're paranoid
about people watching us.

151
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,351
Someone <i>is</i> watching us!

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,120
Why do you think I installed
this alarm system?

153
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,480
And as safe as I feel

154
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,711
with your jingle bell
contraption in place,

155
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,877
I went out
and procured us some muscle.

156
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,275
You're welcome.

157
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,576
At least
you're doing something.

158
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,636
Ah.

159
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,513
How's my SS <i>Gertrud</i>

160
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,876
- coming along?
<i>- Our</i> submarine

161
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,396
is coming along
just fine, thank you.

162
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,153
I've been working
on the sonar,

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,955
which, turns out, is...

164
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,598
far more complex
than I anticipated.

165
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,070
Well, I am confident
you will figure it out.

166
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,759
Of course I will figure it out.

167
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,429
Because I figure
everything out.

168
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,634
The navigation system.

169
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,474
The oxygen exchange.

170
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,640
I will figure everything out,

171
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,156
because I'm the
only one working!

172
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,597
This was supposed
to be a partnership.

173
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,955
It is!

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,389
I already did my part

175
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,279
by stealing everything valuable
in Gotham,

176
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
of which you get half!

177
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
No!

178
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,790
Your goons stole it,

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,150
and then you killed 'em.

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,595
Are you expecting someone?

181
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
Who would I be
expecting, Oswald?

182
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,160
I told you
someone's watching us.

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,434
Dale, go do
what I pay you for.

184
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,790
Protect us!

185
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Wait!

186
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Penn?

187
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,832
Hello, Mr. Cobblepot.

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,273
Are you...
are you really... I...

189
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,432
I-I don't believe it.
Y-You're alive.

190
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,351
Indeed, sir.
I-I am.

191
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,116
But you-you were shot.
I-I was there.

192
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,079
This whole time,

193
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
I thought you were dead,

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,438
but you're alive!

195
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,479
You're only coming to me <i>now?!</i>

196
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,836
I-I'm so terribly sorry,
Mr. Cobblepot.

197
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,675
I wanted to come see you, but...

198
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,120
he wouldn't let me.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
"He"?

200
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,196
"He" who?

201
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,720
Mr. Cobblepot...

202
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,000
...this...

203
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
is...

204
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,278
...Mr. Scarface.

205
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,556
Wonderful.

206
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,136
<i>Look,
I'm sure Dix is in the clear,</i>

207
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,480
but we do have
to ask.

208
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,835
That's not it.

209
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,914
I just...
I feel bad.

210
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,671
I should've been by before.
I'm all he's got.

211
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,240
Well, look,

212
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,239
what can you
do, right?

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,796
Dix!
What the hell?!

214
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,351
<i>Bullock? That you?</i>

215
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah!

216
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Don't shoot!

217
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
<i>Okay.</i>

218
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,670
Come in.

219
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,910
Uh-huh.

220
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,471
Is that the way
you always answer a door?

221
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,439
Nowadays, you can't
be too careful.

222
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,234
Especially someone like me.

223
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,716
A kid comes in,

224
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,320
he'd cut my throat
for a cup of soup.

225
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,510
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

226
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,598
<i>Anyway, I
wasn't expecting you.</i>

227
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,279
Figured you forgot about me.

228
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Look, partner,

229
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,960
when the bridges came down,
I got busy and...

230
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Oh, sure, sure.

231
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,475
You forgot me.

232
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,110
Everybody forgets.

233
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
I didn't forget.

234
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,589
Planning on taking a trip?

235
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Maybe.

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,674
I like to keep a bag
packed, just in case.

237
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,240
Yeah? Where were
you last night?

238
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,436
Where was I?

239
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,109
I was right here.

240
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,320
Anybody else
here with you?

241
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,914
Anybody that can
back up your story?

242
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,156
You're asking me
if I was out there killing

243
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,436
Boggs and Lewis?

244
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,955
Does it look like I was out
there killing Boggs and Lewis?

245
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,156
So you heard
about that?

246
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,235
Let me tell you something.

247
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
If it meant

248
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,679
that I can get out of
this son of a bitch wheelchair,

249
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,834
I would confess right here
and now to Boggs, to Lewis,

250
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,759
to anybody you want me
to confess to.

251
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,395
All right, fine.
But you were a detective.

252
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,816
What would you say
if you were us?

253
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,718
We come in here, you're
packing a suitcase.

254
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,952
I would say either I did it,
which I didn't,

255
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,791
or I'd be very worried
that I'd be next.

256
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,920
What do you mean,
you being next?

257
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,633
What's your connection
to Boggs and Lewis?

258
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,235
Come on. What?

259
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,590
Nothing. I just worked
with them. That's it.

260
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,035
We, uh... we worked
a case together.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The four of you?

262
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

263
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,116
<i>Dix wasn't my partner then.</i>

264
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,839
I was a rookie cop.

265
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,629
Wet behind the ears.

266
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,870
So what was the case?

267
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,549
Woman killed her husband.

268
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,030
As far as I can remember,
it was pretty open and shut.

269
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,395
But at least we can agree
that Dix didn't walk

270
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,472
into The Sirens
and stab those two guys.

271
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,839
So who did? Barbara said Boggs
and Lewis recognized the killer.

272
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
They called him "Dix."

273
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,319
We come in here, he's packing
a suitcase, he shoots at us.

274
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
This stinks, Harvey.

275
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,590
Hey.

276
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
<i>You all right?</i>

277
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,840
What the hell?

278
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,760
These basements run
along Gotham's sewers.

279
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,316
The river is right next to it.

280
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,957
You mean the river filled
with Jeremiah's toxins?

281
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,080
Who knows what kind of damage
these chemicals could do?

282
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,069
Yeah, you're right.

283
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,598
Just don't you touch anything.

284
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,395
<i>Hold on.</i>

285
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Oh.

286
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,756
Bite marks.

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,229
Animal?

288
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,158
Well, it's no human
I've ever seen.

289
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,634
Whatever it was...

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,150
<i>...it dragged him that way.</i>

291
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,717
Seems like human skin.

292
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Here's the file you asked for.

293
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,440
Victoria Cartwright.

294
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,839
- How'd you, uh...?
- I had Harper

295
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,593
run every case the
four of you worked,

296
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,320
cross-referenced with any woman
that killed her husband.

297
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,400
Do I need to read it, or are
you gonna tell me what's in it?

298
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,279
Victoria Cartwright
was a banker.

299
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,160
She led a very boring life.

300
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,033
<i>Until she snapped and</i>

301
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,840
put two.38 caliber slugs
into her husband.

302
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
End of story.

303
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,756
You guys
rehearse that?

304
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,232
Says there was no
physical evidence.

305
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,960
She was convicted
on the statement

306
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,117
of her seven-year-old
daughter, Jane.

307
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,272
This was 20 years ago.
Where's Jane now?

308
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,193
What's the point?
The killer's a man.

309
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,392
A man that can
imitate friggin' faces.

310
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,136
What was the name
of the guy that Strange

311
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,436
got to imitate you?
A Basil something?

312
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,080
That's who
we should be looking for.

313
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,915
That was different, and you
know it. Do we have an address

314
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,400
- for this Jane?
- No.

315
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,416
But the family's old home
is in the Green Zone,

316
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,830
- just east of the clinic.
- Jim, it's a dead end.

317
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,720
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

318
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,953
You know what? Why
don't you hang back?

319
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,233
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.
You benching me?

320
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,750
Killer's still out there.
Keep an eye on your partner.

321
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,039
<i>Penn. Arnold.</i>

322
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,760
It's... Arthur.

323
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,915
You're holding a doll.

324
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,480
It's not a doll.

325
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,556
It's a dummy.

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,349
Oh, this is great.

327
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,635
I'm going
back to work.

328
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,473
- Excuse me.
- You're saying

329
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,154
he made you come here?

330
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,551
Mr. Scarface is very persuasive.

331
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,390
Persuasive?

332
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,680
He made me tell him
about your...

333
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,149
treasure.

334
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
Penn...

335
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,880
I think you need a rest.

336
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,918
And perhaps a psychiatrist.

337
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,111
Then we can discuss
you resuming your former duties.

338
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,120
Obviously, I won't pay you
for the time you were gone.

339
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,999
Shut your piehole!

340
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,553
This the one
you were telling me about?

341
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,552
Punk who thinks
he's in charge?

342
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Yes, sir.

343
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,553
That's Mr. Cobblepot.

344
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,480
Oswald, if you don't
make him leave, I will.

345
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,792
- Yeah.
- No one's going anywheres.

346
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,359
Penn,

347
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,114
show these dewdroppers
we're serious.

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,275
Forgive me.

349
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,714
Now, let's
talk turkey...

350
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
turkeys.

351
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,037
- What a mess, huh?
- Yeah.

352
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,830
Boggs and Lewis were idiots,
complete idiots.

353
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,640
They should've known when
they see a guy walking,

354
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,950
that it ain't me.

355
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,592
You think the Cartwright girl
said something?

356
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,350
How would I know?

357
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,836
So, how you been
since the bridges came down?

358
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,160
You getting enough food?

359
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,549
Medicine?

360
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,194
What if I said "no"?

361
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,439
I'd feel like crap.

362
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Then no.

363
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,193
The Cartwright girl is dead.

364
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
A buddy of mine,

365
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,514
who was a screw
over at Arkham, he said

366
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,016
she was an inmate there, and
she died a couple of years ago,

367
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,350
so this has nothing
to do with her.

368
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,110
GCPD!

369
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Coming in.

370
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,360
Check upstairs.

371
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,600
<i>Looks like
this place</i>

372
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,800
has been abandoned since
before the bridges came down.

373
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,996
Yeah.

374
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
What the hell?

375
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,314
What the hell was that?

376
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,633
Someone's been living here.

377
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,120
<i>What's that smell?</i>

378
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,509
Everything all right?

379
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,631
All good. No one's here.

380
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Hey!

381
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
No.

382
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,635
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

383
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,793
<i>We found
your handiwork.</i>

384
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,029
<i>Nothing to say?</i>

385
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,279
You're gonna have to
take that mask off.

386
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,536
The only way you're gonna keep
that mask on is if you talk.

387
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,936
<i>Otherwise,
I'm gonna reach over this table,</i>

388
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,713
<i>and I'm gonna
rip it off of your face.</i>

389
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,396
<i>Who are you?</i>

390
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Nobody.

391
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,840
You're not Jane Cartwright?

392
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,552
Because you were
in her childhood home.

393
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,520
You're about the right age.

394
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,755
Talk to me, Jane.

395
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,909
I know after
your mother

396
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,191
was convicted, you ended up
a ward of the state.

397
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,675
<i>In and out of institutions
until you ended up in Arkham.</i>

398
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,595
Then you vanished.

399
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,240
Some say died.

400
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,310
<i>What happened to you?</i>

401
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Me?

402
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,952
Nothing happened to me.

403
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,756
Okay.

404
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
What happened to Jane?

405
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,515
<i>Oh.</i>

406
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,189
Lots happened to Jane.

407
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,792
She was taken from Arkham.

408
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,197
Down, down...

409
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,359
down, the doctor
did things to her,

410
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,239
experiments on her and others.

411
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,392
You're talking
about Hugo Strange?

412
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,474
You were taken
to Indian Hill?

413
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,232
The professor was obsessed
with the power to change.

414
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,159
The way a chameleon
would change its skin.

415
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,710
He wanted humans
to have that power.

416
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,313
He made it so Jane
could change her skin...

417
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,594
her bones, her hair,
the color of her eyes.

418
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,831
All it takes is a single touch,

419
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,992
and her body becomes a mirror.

420
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,360
When it's done, she sheds
her skin and starts anew.

421
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,514
It remembers
everyone it touched.

422
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,832
It's touched you, Detective.

423
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,434
We can help you,
Ms. Cartwright.

424
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,991
Jane Cartwright is dead.

425
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,039
She died in Arkham.

426
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,951
That's when Jane Doe was born.

427
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,274
So why kill all these cops?

428
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,112
Do you want to know
why they died?

429
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,473
Ask your friend.

430
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,472
♪♪

431
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,760
What is that?

432
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Aw.

433
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,800
We should head out.

434
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,350
My battery's dying.

435
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,436
Please.

436
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,114
He's coming. He's coming.

437
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,360
Who's coming?
What happened?

438
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
He's going to kill me.

439
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,239
I barely got away.

440
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Are you Hank?

441
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Yes.

442
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,589
<i>Your wife sent us.</i>

443
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,240
Is anyone else left alive
down here?

444
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,471
They're all dead.

445
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,036
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

446
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,232
<i>Oh, God. Oh, God.</i>

447
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
<i>Oh, God.</i>

448
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,679
Hank!

449
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,592
Hank! Hold on, Hank!

450
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,159
Hand over the heaters!

451
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,720
If you don't mind.

452
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,672
Mr. Penn, can't we
just talk this through?

453
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,553
Get back!

454
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,515
I'm so sorry.

455
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,594
At least tell me what
happened after Haven.

456
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,076
Help me to
understand...

457
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,310
this.

458
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,234
Go on.

459
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,754
Sing your song.

460
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,638
After I was shot...

461
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,196
I woke up in
the GCPD morgue.

462
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,235
<i>I was alone.</i>

463
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,516
I patched my wounds
as best I could and crawled out.

464
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,956
I hid in a store.

465
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,719
An abandoned magic shop.

466
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,510
That's where
Mr. Scarface found me.

467
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,790
And he told me all about you.

468
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,920
How you used him.

469
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
Chewed him up

470
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,239
and spat him out.

471
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,832
Treated him like a palooka!

472
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's a lie!

473
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,118
Oh, please, Oswald.
It's what you do.

474
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,520
Arnold...

475
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Arthur.

476
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,996
What do you want?

477
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,514
I don't want anything.

478
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,310
But Mr. Scarface, well...

479
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,040
...he wants your treasure.

480
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,274
And...

481
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,436
to be boss.

482
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,955
Really?

483
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,354
The-the dummy wants to be
the boss of Gotham?

484
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,989
Bingo!
Now, give me the key

485
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,000
<i>- to your treasure room.</i>
- Why would I do that?

486
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,998
You're obviously gonna
kill me anyway.

487
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,200
What am I doing?

488
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,353
I'm talking to a doll.

489
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,709
Dummy.

490
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Seriously?

491
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
You know what,
Oswald?

492
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,474
Honestly, you
deserve this.

493
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,109
Nobody asked you.

494
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,555
You are
opportunistic,

495
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,679
your loyalty is...
shaky, at best,

496
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,039
and you will hurt anyone,
anyone to get what you want.

497
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,155
I hardly think you're
one to throw stones!

498
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,675
Listen, Penn...

499
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,957
Eyes down here, pal.

500
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,231
Sorry.

501
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,352
Mr. Scarface, I got
a question for you.

502
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,920
Shoot.

503
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,280
After you get your...

504
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,032
tiny wooden hands
on that treasure,

505
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
what are you gonna do?

506
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,000
<i>Where are you
gonna go?</i>

507
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,736
<i>People are gonna come
after you eventually.</i>

508
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,036
Then I'll, uh...

509
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,839
I'll take 'em all on!

510
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Yeah.

511
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,275
Show 'em who's boss.

512
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Ah.

513
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,000
You wouldn't
have to do that

514
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,396
if you could get off this
island, now, would you?

515
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,154
What are you doing?

516
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,398
Shut it!
Let the smart one talk.

517
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,394
How do <i>you</i> feel...

518
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,792
about submarines?

519
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
What are we doing here?

520
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,511
I just wanted
to take us, uh,

521
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,080
someplace quiet

522
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,155
where we could talk.

523
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
We did a bad thing.

524
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,076
Oh, come on, not that again.

525
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,671
We put a killer in jail,
all right?

526
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,235
What do you keep
moping about?

527
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,199
She was guilty.
She got what she deserved.

528
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Drop it.

529
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,714
Did you get what
<i>you</i> deserved?

530
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,234
What?

531
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,432
You made that girl
into a murderer.

532
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,280
Oh, come on.

533
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,434
You...

534
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,235
your friends...

535
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,351
- the kid.
- Come on, you're...

536
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,637
I'm gonna make sure you
never do that again.

537
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,960
Harper, where's Dix?

538
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,833
I saw Bullock
take him in the back.

539
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,880
Barbara. What are
you doing here?

540
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,879
Seems my bartender overheard
the killer say something

541
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,872
before he ice-picked
Harvey's pals.

542
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,554
I thought I'd be a good citizen.

543
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,356
Okay.

544
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,278
"The kid's guilty, too."

545
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
The kid.

546
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,159
Listen... what you said before,

547
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,512
about me being a known criminal.

548
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,559
I was on some list your army buddy had.
When the government

549
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,393
rolls in,
am I gonna be arrested?

550
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,239
Honestly,
I don't know.

551
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,920
But that would work out
for you, right?

552
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,432
I go to jail.
You get the baby.

553
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,950
I don't want that.

554
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,309
Is that a promise?

555
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,675
<i>I go straight,
I'm clear?</i>

556
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,510
Stay right here.

557
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,514
Hey, Harvey,
where'd you take Dix?

558
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,713
I didn't take Dix anywhere.

559
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,272
Oh, God. Oh.

560
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,016
She got into your locker.
Must have taken your clothes.

561
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,032
We have to lock
down the GCPD.

562
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,150
Hey, Harvey.

563
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,229
We'll find her.

564
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Come on.

565
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,875
Look at the size of it.

566
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Living down here,

567
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
the toxins in the river

568
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,397
must have driven him mad.
Get out of here! Now!

569
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Alfred!

570
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm sorry!

571
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Alfred!

572
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,995
Alfred! Stop!

573
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,629
Stop. Stop...

574
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,795
All right, everybody, listen up.
GCPD is now in lockdown.

575
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,750
Nobody goes in or out
unless I say so.

576
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,936
She could look like
anybody by now.

577
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,016
How are we supposed
to find her?

578
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,713
Jim!

579
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,998
Barbara?
What happened?

580
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,016
What do you mean,
what happened?

581
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
I've been attacked.

582
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Where'd she go?

583
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Wait a minute.

584
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,395
How do we know
it's really you?

585
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Seriously?

586
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,033
This isn't proof enough?

587
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
What the hell?

588
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
That's her.

589
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,993
She's the imposter.
Shoot her!

590
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,160
It's me, you idiot.

591
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,000
That sounds like Barbara.

592
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Barbara.

593
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,039
Tell me where we first met.

594
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Don't shoot.

595
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,876
I'm leaving here.

596
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,790
Anyone tries to follow me,
she dies.

597
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Shoot her.

598
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,356
We can't risk it.

599
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,790
Stay back!

600
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Bullock, wait!

601
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
I'm fine.

602
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,776
All right,
take her to my office.

603
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,856
Don't let her out of your sight.

604
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,916
Okay.

605
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,632
I cannot believe that you
told him about the sub.

606
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,036
And that you're playing
along with his psychosis.

607
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,714
Obviously,
he was gonna kill you.

608
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,555
I bought us time.

609
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
I have an idea.

610
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,440
If you can just keep him busy
and wait for the signal.

611
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Wait, what's the signal?

612
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,394
Quit your jawing.

613
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
So...

614
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,878
Mr. Scarface and I
have discussed our options.

615
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,350
And the submarine
sounds like a good plan.

616
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,176
And since we'll need

617
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,590
the smart one
to build this hayburner,

618
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,513
<i>he can keep sucking air.</i>

619
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,999
But Penguin ain't so lucky.

620
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,594
Do it, Penn.

621
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,592
Ventilate that mook.

622
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,559
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

623
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,474
- Oh.
- I wish things would've turned out differently.

624
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,518
Arthur, I want you to listen

625
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,672
to what I'm saying.
You accuse me

626
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,479
of manipulating you,
but what about him?

627
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,711
I never asked you
to kill anybody.

628
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,274
That is true.

629
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Hey.

630
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,831
Think of everything
that we went through together.

631
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,434
Sofia Falcone.

632
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,320
Getting cut off
from the mainland. Starving.

633
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,597
You mean Penn was starving!

634
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,560
Fighting for scraps

635
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,757
while your dog ate steak.

636
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,799
I welcomed you into my home.

637
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,511
And yes,
I was not a good friend.

638
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,520
To you or to anyone.

639
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,280
It's why I'm alone.

640
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,594
But I saw you for what you are,

641
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,638
and I valued that.

642
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,557
That must be worth something.

643
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,680
Applesauce!

644
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,870
You're a liar and a thief.

645
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,918
All you do is take,

646
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
<i>take...</i>

647
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Take.

648
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,517
And you never give anything.

649
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,273
<i>You worked me to the bone.</i>

650
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,117
Forced me to be your puppet.

651
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,230
Well, no more.

652
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,515
You hear me?

653
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,996
No more.

654
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,392
Take that. And that.

655
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,715
No.

656
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,230
Mr. Cobblepot.

657
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,351
You freed me.

658
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,879
How can I ever thank you?

659
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Aah!

660
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,713
Why did you do that?

661
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,235
- He wasn't the threat. The dummy was the threat.
- Oswald.

662
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,639
I accept you for the
person that you are.

663
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,196
Just as you accept me for
the cold logician that I am.

664
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,072
That's why this friendship
is great.

665
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,149
<i>And as friends,</i>

666
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,757
I think we can both
agree that that lunatic

667
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,274
had to be stopped.

668
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,794
Perhaps, Edward...

669
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,797
we really are meant
for each other.

670
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,636
Jane.

671
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,514
I know you're up here.

672
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,550
Jane. I knew
you'd be here.

673
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,470
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,036
It was my job to protect you,
and I let you down.

675
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,237
You made Jane into a killer.

676
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,633
You and your friends. There
have to be consequences.

677
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,674
You killed three men already.
When is it enough?

678
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,756
When you're dead.

679
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,675
Put the gun down!

680
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,634
Shoot me.

681
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,316
You killed Jane years ago,
and you didn't even know it.

682
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,273
Just shoot me.

683
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,076
Let me see your face.

684
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,635
Your real face.

685
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Why?

686
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,960
So you can see
what a monster she is?

687
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,511
Hugo Strange
only destroyed her face.

688
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,558
You destroyed her soul.

689
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,920
Let me see it.

690
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,155
<i>You see?</i>

691
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,717
You see what they did?

692
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,676
Jane...

693
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
we can work this out.

694
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,594
<i>Just put the gun down.</i>

695
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,635
The only way this ends is
with one of us dead.

696
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,916
Oh, Hank,
thank God you're alive.

697
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,520
The nurse thinks the man that
attacked us will never recover.

698
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
The toxins in the river

699
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,072
have done irreparable damage
to his brain.

700
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,056
I just think it's a
shame we couldn't save

701
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,515
the rest of the people who
went missing, Master Bruce.

702
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,200
We should've went to Gordon
from the start.

703
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,520
- We were reckless.
- Ah, that's nonsense.

704
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,070
We took decisive action.
We saved a man's life.

705
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,456
The people in this city
have suffered, Master Bruce.

706
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,915
They need someone that
will protect them.

707
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,069
I agree.

708
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,509
But there are better ways
to find absolution.

709
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,078
I, um, I don't follow.

710
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,200
What happened to Wayne Manor
wasn't your fault.

711
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,557
<i>I know you've been
blaming yourself.</i>

712
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,720
You didn't destroy our home,
Alfred.

713
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,513
But I feel like I did.

714
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,517
I feel like
I wasn't strong enough

715
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,115
to fight Tetch
or that bastard Valeska.

716
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,279
I feel like
because of my weakness,

717
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,678
you lost your last tie
to the past.

718
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,512
You lost your home,
Master Bruce.

719
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,357
I must never be that weak again.

720
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,720
Part of being a family
is that we can be strong

721
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,439
<i>for each other.</i>

722
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,477
And when did you get so smart?

723
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,674
I had a good teacher.

724
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,715
Victoria Cartwright
killed her husband.

725
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,479
After we arrested her,
she admitted it.

726
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,275
Later, she recanted.

727
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,473
<i>But the physical evidence
wasn't there.</i>

728
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,439
I was a new cop.
I wanted to make detective.

729
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,875
So you leaned on Jane.

730
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,715
Coerced a statement out of
her to put her mother away.

731
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,238
The woman was guilty.

732
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,433
<i>Later I found out
the husband...</i>

733
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,957
beat the mother and Jane.

734
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,552
I didn't know till after.

735
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,633
The bartender overheard Jane
say something about,

736
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,595
"the kid's guilty, too."

737
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,434
She meant the young cop.

738
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,914
She meant you.

739
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,039
I knew something was wrong.

740
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,314
I felt it.

741
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I said something,

742
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,840
and they told me
to keep my trap shut,

743
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,190
just close the case,
put a bow on it.

744
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,076
After a while,
I stopped feeling it.

745
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,195
And I went down that path
for a long time

746
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,074
until I met you.

747
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,156
However much I've changed...

748
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,471
I can't change the past.

749
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,111
I made that girl a killer.

750
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,877
What do you want from me,
Harvey?

751
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,914
Forgiveness?

752
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,399
Can't give that to you.

753
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,031
I just needed you to know.
