1
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,495
[host on stage] Next on stage...

2
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,246
is Malar, a 9th-grade student
from SVK School.

3
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,117
Greetings to all!

4
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:37,073
Many students
who spoke before mentioned...

5
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,558
as they scored good grades,

6
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,512
their Dads bought their phones
as soon as they asked for them.

7
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,645
But I don't have to ask my father for it.

8
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,966
I just have to think about it.

9
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,453
You may stay in the same house...

10
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,886
but you're apart with your phones in hand.

11
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:56,316
My father and I may stay apart.

12
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,696
But via phone, we're connected.

13
00:04:58,921 --> 00:04:59,854
You won't believe it.

14
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,926
Right now, at this moment,
what I am doing,

15
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,191
Where I am,

16
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,295
or what I must be talking about

17
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,089
is known to my father,
who lives abroad.

18
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:13,464
You can see my father through me.

19
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,301
If you wish to live with him...

20
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:20,105
You can through my dreams.

21
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:21,268
Thank you!

22
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,703
First prize for the essay
on "Father is my world"...

23
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:29,191
goes to Malar from SVK School.

24
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,183
Malar, you spoke well.

25
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,066
Thank you, Sir.

26
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,199
You mentioned everything.

27
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,222
But you never mentioned his name
or where he lives.

28
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
Why are you not letting me
play with you?

29
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,831
My mother asked me not to
play with you.

30
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:50,531
Why?

31
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,653
It's because your father is in prison.

32
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,625
My father is not in prison.
He is dead.

33
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:57,603
Oh, I reckon you don't know.

34
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,710
Your father committed murder
and is in prison.

35
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:01,934
-Why don't you ask your grandma?
-I will ask her.

36
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,652
Grandma!

37
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:05,466
What happened?

38
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,051
Thilagan, the Jailer has summoned you.

39
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:24,819
Let's go!

40
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:46,502
How are you, Thilagan?

41
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,268
It's been fifteen days
since a petition was filed

42
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,284
for your parole,
as your father is sick.

43
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,753
Why have you not responded yet?

44
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,398
These parole petitions are
by other inmates.

45
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,082
This is Krishnamoorthy.

46
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,219
Petition for grandson's 1st birthday.

47
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,230
This is from Rocket Rocky
for his parent's 60th anniversary.

48
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:02,082
And this is from Kumar.
Conjugal visit for 45 days.

49
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,109
There are a thousand reasons for everyone
to step outside on parole.

50
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,065
To be honest,
I'm scared to let them out on parole.

51
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:10,126
Your mother is relentlessly filing
a petition for your parole.

52
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,633
I heard you agreed to go this time,
but now you're refusing.

53
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,635
Sir, he's afraid of his daughter.

54
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,632
He's wondering how he would face
a daughter who does not like him.

55
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:19,773
Why would you, Sir?

56
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:24,346
During your sentence, did it never
occur to you to visit your daughter?

57
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:26,482
At least with an excuse
to meet your father,

58
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:27,834
meet your daughter too.

59
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:30,170
Thilagan, please go and meet them.

60
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,781
I'll think about it, Sir.

61
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,447
What is he writing on the board?

62
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,569
L I F E

63
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,236
A class on life today.

64
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,781
Among the 1200 prisoners
in this prison...

65
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:05,273
we 250 prisoners are special.

66
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,691
Because we killed someone.

67
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,848
So, tell me...

68
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:12,218
how long do you need
to kill a person?

69
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,122
A sharp knife is enough.

70
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:15,422
One stab in the stomach.

71
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,016
A button knife would do.

72
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,551
I will stab in the stomach
and call for a funeral.

73
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,928
Dude, I just need half a razor.

74
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,942
A slit in the jugular vein
will leave him paralyzed.

75
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:27,159
-He will die in no time--
-That's enough!

76
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,243
The other prisoners...

77
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:33,328
when they are released from prison
could return the items they stole.

78
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,317
But we all took someone's life.

79
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:37,098
Even if God permits...

80
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,249
we can't return it.

81
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:44,658
She killed a person
under the pretense of investigation.

82
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,778
I did not kill, Sir.

83
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:49,186
Get moving. I don't want to
see you at this station anymore.

84
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,782
We were skeptical about
you being a police officer.

85
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,148
What to do.
Our son was in love with you.

86
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:56,299
Now, this accusation of murder.

87
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,234
I did not kill, uncle.

88
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,473
Dear, I'm not implying anything here.

89
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,942
It's your department
that is accusing you of a murder...

90
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,326
and have ripped you off your uniform.

91
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:07,193
Am I right?

92
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:12,627
We don't have an answer
for our relatives.

93
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,366
Don't take me wrong.

94
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,147
This proposal won't work for our family.

95
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:19,610
Let's go!

96
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:22,740
-Come on.
-We're leaving!

97
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,138
Please listen.

98
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:25,772
Ma, one minute.

99
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,895
Nandhini!

100
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:29,973
You're the first man I trusted in my life.

101
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:31,827
And you will be the last.

102
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:32,883
Get out!

103
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,996
-Please hear me out--
-Get out!

104
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:38,843
-Let's go.
-Please hear me out.

105
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,514
Madam...

106
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,669
...the officials have summoned you.

107
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:55,743
-Did you check the file?
-Yes! And I submitted it yesterday.

108
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:57,345
The SI is troubling me.

109
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:04,660
Ask her.

110
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,006
So, have you made your decision?

111
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,877
Yes, Sir! I'll rejoin at my station.

112
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:13,364
You will ask for the same station.

113
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,019
Every month, you'd kill people
under the pretense of investigation.

114
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,220
And would go on leave
in the name of suspension.

115
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,552
I did not murder, Sir.

116
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,039
You're saved because the autopsy report
was in your favor.

117
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,266
If not, you'd have been stripped off
uniform all your life.

118
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,650
Miss. Nandhini, if this happens again...

119
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,907
there won't be any enquiries anymore.

120
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,722
I will go on parole, Sir.

121
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:26,537
Hi!

122
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,274
Sister, they're waiting for you.
Hurry up!

123
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:29,838
-Hey, wait for me.
-What is it about?

124
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:43,348
My son likes small pieces of meat.

125
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:46,184
I don't know if he got to eat
good food at the prison.

126
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,021
During his stay over here...

127
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,119
only I will serve him whatever he needs.

128
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:50,905
Understood?

129
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,880
There will be no discrimination of season
in the house anymore.

130
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,221
We will have non-vegetarian food all day.

131
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,059
Atthai, look behind.

132
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:02,593
-What is behind me?
-Look!

133
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:03,267
What--

134
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:07,591
Malar, when did you get home?

135
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,212
I arrived when you were celebrating
your prisoner son's arrival.

136
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,825
Oh, no... Malar!

137
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:14,971
-Oh, God, why did I blabber?
-What happened?

138
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,330
She's pissed at me.

139
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:17,618
Please hear me out.

140
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:19,039
My dear Malar!

141
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:21,296
Listen, Malar.

142
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:23,352
Malar, please open the door.

143
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,627
-Dear Malar...
-Amma!

144
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,565
-Amma, Amma, what happened?
-Malar!

145
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,147
As soon as she heard
that her father is arriving...

146
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,916
she went inside and locked herself up.

147
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,769
Malar, open the door!

148
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:34,635
-Malar!
-Malar! Malar!

149
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:41,064
Malar, where are you going with the bags?

150
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,628
What happened, Malar?
Malar, dear.

151
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,289
-Malar!
-Dear, Malar!

152
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:47,702
Malar, what happened to you?

153
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:49,546
-What happened, Ma?
-Ask her!

154
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,183
Malar, why are you taking down
the photos?

155
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:53,886
I don't have to see that man.

156
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,226
Neither does he need to see me.

157
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:03,587
Hey, Malar, where are you going?

158
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:06,135
-Ma, let's go to our house.
-What about this house?

159
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:08,704
Until that murderer is here,
this is not my house.

160
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:09,818
Let's go, Ma!

161
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,447
-I think he's returning from prison.
-Yes!

162
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:19,437
Not yet!

163
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:22,019
-I reckon it must be ten years.
-No, it's fourteen years.

164
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,218
Not yet!

165
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:29,742
[all] Hey, Jail Uncle has arrived.

166
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,617
My son...

167
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,483
He looks like a terror.

168
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,361
How are you, my son?

169
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:29,741
Amma!

170
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:13,672
Hey, first, you remove it.

171
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:16,155
-Amma, look at this photo.
-Show me.

172
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,174
What are you looking at?

173
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:03,607
It's been fourteen years.

174
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:05,372
Only today, I'm seeing myself.

175
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,427
The people and system
may accuse you of things.

176
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:20,196
But when your daughter grows up

177
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,696
and asks about her father,
what would I say?

178
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:23,843
Tell her, not just her mother...

179
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,841
but her father died, too.

180
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,325
It's better to live without a father...

181
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,423
then to be called a daughter
of a murderer.

182
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:47,283
Welcome brother.

183
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,651
-Brother, take a seat.
-Sit down, son.

184
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:53,893
This is my wife, Chitra.

185
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:56,031
My elder son, Arivu.

186
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:57,485
Daughter, Krithanya.

187
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,576
My son, Sanjeev.

188
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,615
This is my wife, Geetha.

189
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,856
Saadhvik, go to uncle.

190
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,891
-He's Jail uncle.
-Don't say that.

191
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:09,169
-Apologize to him.
-It's okay.

192
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:22,103
Son, I know who you're looking for.

193
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:23,741
As soon as your daughter knew
you were coming...

194
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:26,456
she went to Kamakshi's house.

195
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:31,087
It's okay, Ma.

196
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,719
I'm here only for two weeks.

197
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:37,442
Until then, please don't disturb her.

198
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:43,699
I have a property near Koot Road.

199
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,310
Yes.

200
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:45,891
I've decided to sell it.

201
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,514
What's with the sudden decision to sell?

202
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,406
I have my reasons.

203
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,591
I already spoke to the advocate.

204
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:54,764
You guys, please follow up.

205
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:55,746
Okay, Anna!

206
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,464
Malar is arrogant.

207
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:04,380
We are cooking for her father.

208
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:06,325
But she's holed up
at Kamakshi's sister's house.

209
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,090
Why do you think out of all these years,
he's now out on parole?

210
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,252
Sell the property and transfer the money
to the daughter's account.

211
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:15,741
But our husbands are fools
and working for him as a broker.

212
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:16,926
I can't agree more with you.

213
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,522
-Here...
-No, I don't want it.

214
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,718
Hey, you should eat.

215
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:23,412
Or I'll hand you over to Jail uncle.

216
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:24,066
Eat!

217
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:28,598
I believe this would be the last time
we will see him alive.

218
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:32,503
Akka, I left the stove on.
Let me go and check on it.

219
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:35,009
Mama...

220
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:36,684
I did not mean to.

221
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:38,552
I did not hear anything you say.

222
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:39,574
Please forgive me.

223
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,708
No! I should thank you...

224
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,629
for taking good care of my daughter
all these years.

225
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,442
I've been in prison most of my life.

226
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:49,505
So, I lost the human touch.

227
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,757
I will correct myself.

228
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:55,575
Are you going to eat?

229
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,209
Or this Jail uncle will catch you.

230
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,232
I ate!

231
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,757
There's no party without an heir.

232
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:02,288
Chief!

233
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,468
You made a garland out of my money.

234
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:05,351
Come on, Chief!

235
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:08,432
Hey, not you. You keep it safe.

236
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:09,284
Hold this for me.

237
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,709
Anbu, how's everything?

238
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:14,637
Thalaivar, you order and I follow.

239
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:17,569
Listen, like you were beside me
all these years...

240
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:20,288
Likewise, I want you beside my son
and make him win the elections.

241
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:21,831
Of course, I'll do it for him.

242
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,585
Why do you have a long face?

243
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:25,264
-Nothing!
-Are you sure?

244
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,590
-I'll take my leave.
-Sure.

245
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:28,519
Begin the work.

246
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:30,804
Hey, Ramadoss!

247
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,865
This year, my son is contesting
in elections.

248
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:34,971
You heard it. Work diligently.

249
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,788
Anna, I have a perfect plan
ready for you.

250
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,558
I'll kill him at his bar.

251
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,338
How can you kill him on his turf?

252
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,059
-We can find alone out there.
-Mani!

253
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:50,066
You and he always have drinks together.

254
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:51,764
On the day of the murder,
you make an excuse.

255
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,839
And I'll kill him!

256
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,539
With me beside him,
he claims the seat is for his son.

257
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,405
If I miss this opportunity...

258
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,640
I will be licking the glue
off the posters on the wall.

259
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,125
Anna, this week, the news will read,
"Manickam Thangam is dead."

260
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,786
-Fine, do it without any mistake.
-Sure.

261
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,834
-Who was it?
-Anbu, Anna.

262
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,457
He was talking about an amazing contract.

263
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,075
If I close the deal,
the profit will fetch us 50 lakhs.

264
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,194
50 lakhs, you say.
What kind of contract?

265
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:16,592
I'll tell you after it's done.

266
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,875
You call this bird nest a house?

267
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,202
We'll buy land on the outskirts
and build a nice house.

268
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,353
Hey, Thilaga Varman!

269
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,267
Bloody, Parole!

270
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,634
-Tell me.
-Do you know Velankanni?

271
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,515
Yeah, it's near Nagapattinam.

272
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,681
If you take a bus from Kanchipuram...

273
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,275
via Trichy and take another bus.

274
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,571
I'm not talking about the city, Velankanni.

275
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:51,383
Look over here!

276
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,095
I'm prisoner Thilagan's shadow police.

277
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:54,919
Hello, Sir.

278
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:55,991
Bring me Thilagan.

279
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:57,790
They kill and get convicted.

280
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,431
But they get out on leave.
Do they think it's a prison or school?

281
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:03,345
Go and bring me the murderer.

282
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:04,586
I am Thilaga Varman.

283
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:05,696
Oh, it's you...

284
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:06,962
What is your height?

285
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,900
-I'm about six feet.
-Six feet!

286
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,142
Hereafter, you're not under my shadow.

287
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,025
But I'll be under your shadow.

288
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,724
Take good care of me.

289
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,854
Aren't you aware you're supposed to
sign the register at the Police station?

290
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:24,322
I cannot step out with an officer escort.

291
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,673
It seems like I overslept
due to a hangover.

292
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:28,782
When someone asks,
this should not be your reply.

293
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:30,060
You should say
we got stuck in traffic.

294
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,456
Repeat after me. Traffic! Traffic!

295
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:32,260
-Traffic! Traffic!
-Thilaga!

296
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:34,910
Only when you sit down to eat
does the watchman show up.

297
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:35,766
Watchman?

298
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,290
We are happy.
Please spare five rupees.

299
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:39,695
He's a Police officer.

300
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:43,027
I have never seen a Police officer
with so much hair.

301
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:45,105
I'm not offended
that you called me a watchman.

302
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,156
Only when you're happy
do you spare five bucks?

303
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,857
Hey, you're a comedy Police.

304
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,506
I have served food.
Only you come inside.

305
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:51,891
-You go, Amma.
-Listen...

306
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:53,673
-Bring some water for the Police.
-Don't mind my Amma.

307
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:54,814
Does it make a difference?

308
00:21:54,904 --> 00:21:56,513
Thilagan, Anna. I'm leaving.

309
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:58,345
Sure! Carry on!

310
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:00,900
As soon as you arrive, a murder.

311
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:03,212
As I arrived, they butchered a goat.

312
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,689
Oh, that explains the food smell.

313
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:08,001
-It's rasam.
-I've never had something like it.

314
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,142
It's country chicken rasam.

315
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:10,657
A non-veg rasam!

316
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:11,713
Today's menu...

317
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:15,355
prawn fry, blood fry,
goat trotter's soup and biryani.

318
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:18,191
Do you use a plate
or a big tray to eat it all?

319
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,790
Would you like to eat?

320
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:21,218
Me?

321
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,591
How long do you take to pray?

322
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,476
I will pray until you finish your meal.

323
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,657
I'm going to feast today.
Come on!

324
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,509
Come on. Don't hesitate.
Treat it as your house.

325
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,353
-Amma, is it ready?
-Here comes the food monster.

326
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,193
-Dear, do you want to eat?
-Please come.

327
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:37,298
Why is the leaf so small?

328
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,173
Oh, come on.
This is the biggest we got.

329
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:39,939
I'll adjust.

330
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:41,681
Had I known, I would've come
prepared for a meal.

331
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:43,680
They don't serve decent food
to a Policeman.

332
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,494
Serve. Serve it all.

333
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,407
Gobble it all!

334
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,728
Eat slowly. You might choke.

335
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:50,681
Tell me something...

336
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,376
Is this mutton or goat's meat?

337
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:56,196
Please serve him some brain.

338
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:57,676
-Please serve.
-Does he not have brains?

339
00:22:57,821 --> 00:22:58,918
-What?
-Brain, Sir.

340
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:00,011
Don't mind us.

341
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:01,877
Please have it

342
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,645
-Is that rabbit meat?
-Oh, no, that's my granddaughter.

343
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,852
Sorry, I could not recognize her.

344
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:08,904
Dear, aren't you eating?

345
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,345
Only if you're done can I eat.

346
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:12,672
Here you go.
Do you want some water?

347
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,407
You give it to her.
She's your granddaughter.

348
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:16,372
I think she'll be done with you
before she grows up.

349
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:17,426
He will swallow you!

350
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:18,548
Why are you serving me more rice?

351
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:20,654
Please try some rasam with the rice.

352
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:21,795
Sure, I'll taste it. Serve it.

353
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,933
-Do you have bitter curd?
-Serve it.

354
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,627
-Shall I serve?
-Please serve.

355
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,018
Hey, where are you trying to escape?

356
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:31,699
I won't spare you
no matter where you go.

357
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:32,572
Get back!

358
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,478
-Get back!
-Rasam...

359
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,681
How dare you evade a Police officer?

360
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:37,935
Bloody Rasam!

361
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:40,581
-You carry on. I'll be back.
-You may leave.

362
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,562
Ma... Where is she?

363
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:48,039
Hold on. She'll be here.

364
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:49,094
It's time!

365
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:52,694
What are you doing?

366
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:54,843
I'm counting the days
until he returns to prison.

367
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,130
Bye!

368
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:04,422
Hey, Thilaga!

369
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,157
She's walking out.
Can you hear her?

370
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:11,417
Dear, don't waste the food.

371
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:12,453
Sure, I won't waste food.

372
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:13,412
-Okay, bye.
-Bye!

373
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,898
Hey, that's your daughter's voice.

374
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:29,579
-Bye, Arivu.
-Hey!

375
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,744
Bloody sinner!

376
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,668
Why would you park the vehicle
in the middle of the road?

377
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,502
Old lady, you're becoming
a nuisance by the day.

378
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:38,298
If I park a bit forward, you yell at me
to stop at the entrance.

379
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:40,633
If I stop at the entrance
you yell at me for that, too.

380
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:43,253
Of course, your granddaughter is boarding,
but you don't own the bus.

381
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:44,375
Annoying old lady.

382
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,590
You speak as if you invented the bus.

383
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,411
You're blocking the view.

384
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,961
Hey, Malar, sit next to me.

385
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:02,009
Bye!

386
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:09,565
Hey, Varma, that's my son.

387
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:10,849
Why are you waving at him?

388
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:11,508
No...

389
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:13,750
Shall we go to the Police station?

390
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:14,543
Let's go.

391
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:28,332
Why is she noticing everything?

392
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:34,269
When do you plan to reform?

393
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:35,946
I did not do anything wrong to reform.

394
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,290
Stealing a cycle is a crime.

395
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,305
Madam, that's not stealing.

396
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:41,451
New cycle,
and it was parked outside unlocked.

397
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,267
I checked inside the house
and noticed many luxury cars.

398
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,956
So, I took away the cycle
as they don't need it.

399
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:46,923
I ought to!

400
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:47,797
Strike him, madam.

401
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,571
Congratulations, madam,
for rejoining the duty.

402
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,135
Madam, this is Thilaga Varman,
the Parole prisoner.

403
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:53,783
Vanakkam, madam.

404
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:55,408
When are you supposed to sign the register?

405
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,103
There was heavy traffic on our way here.

406
00:25:57,226 --> 00:25:58,908
There were too many potholes
on the road--

407
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,737
-09:00 a.m. madam.
-What?

408
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,127
Say it out loud.

409
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,572
09:00 a.m. madam.

410
00:26:05,935 --> 00:26:08,932
-What's the time now?
-09:30 a.m. madam.

411
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,846
Do you expect us to wait for you
to come and sign the register?

412
00:26:13,142 --> 00:26:14,057
I apologize, madam.

413
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:18,283
Your parole ends if you're even late
by a minute after 09:00 a.m.

414
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:19,455
Understood?

415
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:22,877
I'll be alert, madam.
I'll wake him up by 07:00 a.m.

416
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:27,550
-Hello!
-She's a woman of her word.

417
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:29,149
You better wake me up by 06:30 a.m.

418
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:30,425
-Sure, sir.
-Only then we'll have time to eat...

419
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,767
-Hey, Velankanni!
-Madam!

420
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:32,632
Out!

421
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,135
I'm already outside.

422
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,400
-I'll whack you.
-At your service, madam.

423
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:40,361
Sir, parole case.
I'm the shadow Police.

424
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,299
Shadow Police is with you 24/7
for your protection.

425
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:45,507
Sign it!

426
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,791
-There, he begins with his preaching.
-Sir, it wasn't me.

427
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:48,759
-Sir.
-Go inside.

428
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:50,015
Go!

429
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:51,744
How dare you come in?
Get out!

430
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,924
Sir... Sorry, sir.
I mistook it for a criminal.

431
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:56,013
Thilaga! Thilaga!

432
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:59,627
On the road to school,
a tree has fallen.

433
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,275
-The school bus won't be coming.
-Oh, no!

434
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,331
How will Malar get to school?

435
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:04,503
She's walking to school.

436
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,814
I have an idea.

437
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:08,010
Why don't you take our vehicle
and drop her off at school?

438
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:12,026
Amma...

439
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,107
Your daughter is walking to school.

440
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:16,353
If you follow, you can see her.

441
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:17,142
Please go!

442
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,227
You're right!

443
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:20,689
I'm going.

444
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,532
Hey, don't try to escape.

445
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:27,208
-Don't spare him. Catch him!
-Hey, be careful.

446
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:29,890
-Be patient. Okay?
-That's more like it.

447
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,515
Oh, no, they tied him to
the electric pole.

448
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:34,226
Hey, how are you beating up
an auto driver?

449
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:35,031
Police, sir!

450
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:35,660
You're unaware of his past life.

451
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,573
Since yesterday,
you've lost so much weight.

452
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:41,812
-God help you.
-I'm on a diet for six packs.

453
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:43,345
Why trouble yourself?

454
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:45,553
Have you tasted crab lollipop?

455
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,969
I have eaten them separately.

456
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,604
-But never had them together.
-Right!

457
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,311
I will make you a crab lollipop.
Come with me.

458
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:54,518
-Both?
-Yes.

459
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:56,013
-Damn, Boss is getting whacked.
-Who's it?

460
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:57,951
Aren't you hungry?

461
00:27:58,006 --> 00:27:59,640
You carry on. I'll get betel nuts.

462
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:00,844
Make sure you get more.

463
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,364
Oh, no, the Boss is getting whacked.

464
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:09,625
-Sumathi! Which ward is she in?
-Ward number 24.

465
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,434
Son, which way is the new SVK school?

466
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:13,395
This way.

467
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,231
The lift is out of order.

468
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:23,853

00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,029
Hey, it's raining hard.

499
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:39,339
Stop the vehicle near the shop.

500
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:40,816
Step down and get inside the shop.

501
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:41,943
Brother four teas.

502
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,758
It's fun, though.

503
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,314
-Buddy, it's raining.
-Yeah!

504
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,884
-It'd be great if you came closer.
-Closer?

505
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:51,621
I meant you. Come closer.

506
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,195
Oh-oh! Coming closer is not enough.

507
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:56,277
Not enough.

508
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,296
Still, I can't figure out
what to check out.

509
00:30:59,673 --> 00:31:00,926
Hey, what did you say?

510
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,878
Are you going to suggest
what do we look at?

511
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,866
-Let her suggest.
-Let's not indulge them. Let's go.

512
00:31:06,185 --> 00:31:07,486
I think they got pissed off.

513
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,077
-Malar Akka!
-What happened?

514
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:11,746
-Malar Akka.
-She's putting up her price.

515
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,048
Sister, why did you not say anything?

516
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,045
Had it been me,
I would've complained to my father

517
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:18,180
and got them arrested.

518
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:20,969
Why are you sad?
They're not worth it. Let's go!

519
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:23,780
Like she mentioned...

520
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:25,875
If only my father were here...

521
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:28,547
he wouldn't have spared those boys.

522
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,060
I've been trying to woo her for a while.

523
00:31:34,263 --> 00:31:35,927
But she's a hard nut to crack.

524
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,770
I will pick up this girl for sure.

525
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:39,458
You wait and watch.

526
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,395
If I pick up this girl...

527
00:31:44,684 --> 00:31:46,129
...you have to throw me a party.

528
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:50,642
I'll come tomorrow.
Tell me what I should look for.

529
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:51,267
Understood?

530
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:53,673
Hey, turn around and look.

531
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,735
-Hey!
-Hey, buddy!

532
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,140
Hey, beat him!

533
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:00,763
Hey! Get up!

534
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,480
Creating a nuisance on the road.

535
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:03,798
Sir, let go of me.

536
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,060
-Get inside.
-I did not do anything.

537
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,282
Hey, look who's here.

538
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:16,880
Sir! Sir! This man beat us up.

539
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:18,400
Open the door.

540
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:21,025
Step outside.

541
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:23,413
Now, look closely.

542
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:25,156
Sir, I'm certain.

543
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:26,302
It's him who beat us up.

544
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,015
You enquire at the shop.
Everyone saw him.

545
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:34,619
How dare you beat up these guys
in the presence of a Police officer?

546
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,119
Sir, let me explain.

547
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,286
Stop giving excuses.

548
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,924
Let madam come.
Your parole will end today.

549
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:42,556
Sir! Sir, sir, sir!

550
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:45,759
After 14 years, yesterday,
I got a chance to see my daughter.

551
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:49,462
Do you know the lewd comments these
boys were passing on to my daughter?

552
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,413
Sir, I did not mean to.

553
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:56,399
Making a mistake in haste
has pushed me into hell.

554
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:59,286
We trust our families are safe outside.

555
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:01,087
But when we learn that's not true.

556
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:02,723
What do you expect me to do?

557
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:04,652
Sir, I did not mean to.

558
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:06,994
When I asked,
you said it was a petty fight.

559
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,427
-How dare you tease girls?
-I swear, sir.

560
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,128
-That too, school girls.
-Sorry, sir!

561
00:34:10,224 --> 00:34:11,416
How dare you, rascals?

562
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:12,497
I'll whack you!

563
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,567
-Thilagan!
-Sir!

564
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,801
I can book them under
eve-teasing case.

565
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,422
But I'm worried about your parole.

566
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,093
I can't hold them in custody.

567
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:26,915
I will have to release them.

568
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,714
Please be careful during your parole.

569
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:32,600
Okay, sir.

570
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:45,612
[radio] When it's 10:00 p.m.
everyone thinks of Illayaraja, sir.

571
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:49,229
But the last caller mentioned
it reminds him of actress Silk.

572
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:50,870
Silk!

573
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:53,252
What comes to your mind?

574
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:56,423
After 10:00 p.m. I get reminded
of my wife's face.

575
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:58,007
After seeing her face, I lose my sleep.

576
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,125
I'm used to it now.

577
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,344
What comes to your mind?

578
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:01,828
They will close the shop.

579
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,399
Liquor?

580
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:10,540
This route reminds me of...

581
00:35:11,304 --> 00:35:13,064
...Annachi Wines.

582
00:35:13,426 --> 00:35:16,189
You were in prison.
How do you know about Annachi Wines?

583
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,314
It's not like I was in prison
since my birth.

584
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:19,109
Oh!

585
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:21,400
Back in the day...

586
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,954
I used to have a chilled beer.

587
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,228
Before the beer wears out
I'll have a hard drink.

588
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,869
-Good old days!
-I agree.

589
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,567
It's not like I can drink today.

590
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:31,186
You can!

591
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,353
How? That too when
I'm with an officer.

592
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:36,016
You should stop seeing me
as a Police officer.

593
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:39,884
You see, we've come closer
with liquor talks.

594
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:41,611
You can call me by my name.

595
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,595
Have you decided to go to
the liquor shop?

596
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:47,197
-So, you won't call me by my name?
-Oh, no!

597
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:49,814
After two drinks,
you'll call me many names.

598
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:54,377
We are here to buy liquor in black.

599
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,847
And they're running away
looking at the Police.

600
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:59,377
-What is this?
-A precaution.

601
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:00,155
For?

602
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:04,205
You see, a police officer
and a prisoner on parole...

603
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,938
if someone clicks a picture of us drinking
and upload it

604
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:08,314
we'll be in trouble.

605
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,744
-Anna, you're a genius prisoner.
-Thanks!

606
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:15,142
Hey!

607
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:17,647
-Waste bottle. Open up!
-Wait!

608
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:20,736
Drunkard! They will only come
running after we close down.

609
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,072
What the hell is he doing?

610
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:25,587
Sir! Oh, no!

611
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,977
-Bring me a case of liquor.
-The shop is closed, sir.

612
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:31,416
How dare you read the rules to me?

613
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:32,384
Off you go!

614
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:39,328
Hurry up! Or else I'll book you
for a murder.

615
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:40,698
I'm rolling outside.

616
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,209
Go and put it inside the Jeep.

617
00:36:44,092 --> 00:36:45,219
Sir, I'll put it inside.

618
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:52,161
His ideas will never work out.

619
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,384
How come he's here now?

620
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:56,547
Come on. Let's have a drink.

621
00:36:57,011 --> 00:36:58,172
Thala, he's right here.

622
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,516
-Anna, I'm leaving.
-But there's Police with him.

623
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,086
I'm surprised with your response.

624
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:04,820
In the morning,
I have a "Ban Liquor" protest to hold.

625
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:06,830
Oh, yeah... Ban the liquor.

626
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:08,986
Also, I have to gather boys
for the protest.

627
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:10,682
-I'll take my leave.
-You carry on.

628
00:37:10,744 --> 00:37:11,948
My boys are holed up
at the marriage hall.

629
00:37:12,044 --> 00:37:13,541
It'd be great
if you send some liquor.

630
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,808
-Hey, Jackie!
-Yes Boss!

631
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:16,445
-Bring me two cases of liquor.
-Come here.

632
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:17,728
-Deliver it to the marriage hall.
-Okay, Boss!

633
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:18,212
Hurry up!

634
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:19,563
See you, Anna!

635
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:21,140
-Velankanni!
-Vanakkam, Anna.

636
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,836
Are you partying because
your Inspector, Madam, rejoined?

637
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:24,850
No way!

638
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,702
She does not even shake hands,
and you speak about a party.

639
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:30,664
You see, that man is my parole--

640
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:32,820
I mean, he's from abroad.

00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:42,855
There's a chance they cut power
and killed him.

804
00:47:42,962 --> 00:47:43,605
Also...

805
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:45,831
I did not kill, sir.

806
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:47,028
You mean to say, Manickam?

807
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:49,988
First, find a way to catch the murderer.

808
00:47:50,895 --> 00:47:52,207
Hey, DSP has arrived.

809
00:47:53,785 --> 00:47:54,581
Isn't DSP our man?

810
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:55,738
-Step aside.
-Calm down.

811
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,462
Please stop.
Don't scream. Calm down.

812
00:47:58,658 --> 00:47:59,472
Can't you see I'm speaking?

813
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:01,657
How can we stay calm?

814
00:48:01,743 --> 00:48:03,191
Someone has killed our leader.

815
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:04,787
Do you expect us to bury him in vain?

816
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:06,243
You don't have to find the killer.

817
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,728
We will find him and kill him.

818
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:10,177
Listen, I understand your pain.

819
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,331
Please be calm.

820
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:13,066
Don't speak like a Police officer.

821
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,862
Please think as a member
of our community.

822
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,472
Anbu, don't see me
just as a Police officer.

823
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:19,958
Please take Annachi away
and perform the last rites.

824
00:48:20,457 --> 00:48:20,910
Go ahead.

825
00:48:21,207 --> 00:48:22,751
I thought you said DSP is our man.

826
00:48:22,887 --> 00:48:24,496
But he's asking us to perform
the last rites.

827
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:25,665
End of the day, he's a Police officer.

828
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,296
The routine is you and Manickam
have drinks together.

829
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:34,538
Even when I invite you, you always
insist on drinking with your Chief.

830
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:37,602
On the day of his murder...

831
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,225
...how did you go missing?

832
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:43,697
DSP, I'm angry at myself
for not being there.

833
00:48:45,346 --> 00:48:46,233
Here, is the root cause.

834
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:51,549
Had I not left him alone
on that night...

835
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:53,553
No one could dare lay their hands
on my Chief.

836
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,108
I would've handled him myself.

837
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:04,896
Greetings brother.
This is Kanni speaking. How are you?

838
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,296
How could I be at peace
when my Leader's killer is at large?

839
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:10,244
Hey!

840
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:13,106
Oh, no! I forgot to mention.

841
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:17,189
The knife that was used to stab him
was found at the bar.

842
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,299
They have extracted fingerprints.

843
00:49:19,572 --> 00:49:22,159
I'm sure we will catch the killer.

844
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:25,674
Please recommend my name
for a promotion.

845
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:26,431
Okay, Velankanni.

846
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:30,483
Hereafter, if you come to know anything,
let me know beforehand.

847
00:49:30,695 --> 00:49:33,307
Anna, you don't have to mention it.

848
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:34,549
I'll make sure!

849
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:35,429
I'll have some snacks.

850
00:49:35,453 --> 00:49:38,455
-My land matter...
-Do you want him dead too?

851
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,676
Oh, God! My land matter...

852
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:44,057
-Anna, I need a small favor.
-Tell me.

853
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:47,088
My friend owns the land
at the Koot Road.

854
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:48,436
Could you please process the deal?

855
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:50,061
You will get a good value in that area.

856
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:52,478
-Of course, you wouldn't let it go.
-What?

857
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:55,010
-Velankanni.
-I was asking you to process the deal.

858
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:58,588
-Let things cool down.
-Sure!

859
00:49:58,724 --> 00:49:59,843
Bring him next month.

860
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,478
Next month is my birthday...

861
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:03,114
-I concur it's pretty close...
-Listen! Listen!

862
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:04,283
What is it?

863
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:07,413
Tell him I have to go abroad.

864
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:10,491
My friend has come down from abroad.

865
00:50:10,786 --> 00:50:13,424
In a week, his Pizza will expire.

866
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,299
Listen, it's Visa.

867
00:50:15,386 --> 00:50:16,692
I meant his Visa will expire.

868
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,283
-Oh, no!
-Please do this for me.

869
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,510
Okay, you come to the farmhouse
at 08:00 a.m.

870
00:50:22,174 --> 00:50:25,588
Is it the same house that Saroja visits?

871
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:26,521
Hey!

872
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:28,502
Please process the deal.
Thank you.

873
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:34,607
-Mani, is everything in order?
-Brother!

874
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:36,473
Everything is in order, Anna.

875
00:50:37,258 --> 00:50:38,329
Of course!

876
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,982
The Police just called me...

877
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:43,319
and informed that they found
a knife at the bar.

878
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:45,247
Also, there are fingerprints on it.

879
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:47,802
Anna, don't worry about it.

880
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:49,763
I have a plan for everything.

881
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:52,517
You and your useless plans.

882
00:50:54,368 --> 00:50:57,358
It took twenty-five years for me
to execute this plan.

883
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,990
The DSP I'm having drinks is our man.

884
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:02,911
Still, if he knows, I will be in trouble.

885
00:51:03,108 --> 00:51:03,854
You do one thing.

886
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,361
Give this money to your wife.

887
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,418
And surrender yourself at the court.

888
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:12,197
The first headlines I see tomorrow...

889
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:16,169
It should read, "Manickam's murderer
is found. Mani has surrendered."

890
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:18,574
Hey!

891
00:51:19,028 --> 00:51:22,950
If you try to play any tricks...

892
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:29,098
Then the news will read,
Manikandan has been murdered.

893
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:30,529
-Understand?
-Understood.

894
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:42,278
Hey!

895
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:44,520
What's in the bag?

896
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,317
Come on, DSP. It's not like
he's carrying bundles of money.

897
00:51:47,466 --> 00:51:49,232
He's carrying obituary posters of Chief.

898
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:51,106
-Hey, get lost.
-Go!

899
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:56,252
Are you happy? The deal is done!

900
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:57,709
-I didn't even ask for my commission.
-Yes, I'm happy.

901
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,914
I heard you talk about a knife
and fingerprints.

902
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:03,984
Nothing about it.

903
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:06,761
Do you remember the murder
at the liquor shop?

904
00:52:07,084 --> 00:52:09,408
The killer left the knife behind.

905
00:52:09,746 --> 00:52:12,572
Had he left an address,
it would've been easier for us.

906
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:15,455
The department keeps nagging.

907
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:17,033
What can we do?

908
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:19,861
Thilagan, Anna.
But I can assure you...

909
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:24,034
when you return to prison
one person will accompany you.

910
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:25,298
I'm certain!

911
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:39,065
Your DSP called me and asked for
a separate report.

912
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,217
What seems to be the problem
between you guys?

913
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,605
He asked me to file a false case.
And I did not.

914
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,495
Senior Officer... It's obvious.

915
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:49,046
Okay, let's discuss Manickam's case.

916
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:53,241
The killer stabbed eight times
at the same spot on Manickam's neck.

917
00:52:53,357 --> 00:52:54,271
Did you notice?

918
00:52:54,395 --> 00:52:55,848
You've already mentioned it
in the report.

919
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:56,943
Take a look.

920
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:02,303
It's similar to Manickam's death.
He has bled through his ears and nose.

921
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:03,536
Not just that...

922
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:05,580
the eight files you're holding...

923
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:08,431
died due to an eardrum blast.

924
00:53:08,802 --> 00:53:09,862
Are you serious, Doctor?

925
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,880
In 1995, when I was working
at Madurai GH...

926
00:53:12,992 --> 00:53:16,355
for the first time, I performed
a post-mortem on a similar murder case.

927
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:20,175
Later, near Trichy
a similar murder occurred...

928
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:21,924
and the Doctor who performed
post-mortem mentioned it.

929
00:53:22,076 --> 00:53:23,427
Six months ago...

930
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:25,228
a murder in the same pattern.

931
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:27,907
By 1999, eight murders were
in the same pattern.

932
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:32,220
It raised a question about the bleeding
through ears and nose...

933
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:35,275
and the Police were clueless
without any evidence.

934
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:38,729
Because the killer used
metal-like substances,

935
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:43,174
created high-decibel noise
and blasted the victim's eardrums.

936
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,876
During that time, the killer used
the same pattern in another murder.

937
00:53:49,263 --> 00:53:50,651
But he also used a knife
to stab the victim.

938
00:53:50,712 --> 00:53:52,255
The Police were able to arrest him

939
00:53:52,336 --> 00:53:53,565
with the help of the fingerprints
found on the knife.

940
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,859
Why did he use a knife?

941
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,018
The victim was trying to escape.

942
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,260
What if it's the same MO
in Manickam's case?

943
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:02,072
-What's his name?
-David.

944
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,648
They were holding him in Central Jail.

945
00:54:19,682 --> 00:54:21,775
The list of convicts transferred
from Central Jail to Puzhal.

946
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,213
The list of convicts transferred
to Palayamkottai.

947
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:46,171
Which David are you referring to, Madam?

948
00:54:46,893 --> 00:54:51,283
David, who murdered people in 95'-99'
by bleeding their ears and noses.

949
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,540
David, who was transferred
from Central Jail?

950
00:54:53,736 --> 00:54:54,571
Yes him!

951
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:55,752
He was released long ago.

952
00:54:55,947 --> 00:54:58,752
His native is a small village
near Villupuram.

953
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:04,392
-Sir!
-Tell me, Madam.

954
00:55:04,432 --> 00:55:07,041
Does David live in that village after
being released from Palayamkottai Prison?

955
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:08,364
That's right, Madam.

956
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:11,203
Then, monitor his movement
and arrest him right away.

957
00:55:11,276 --> 00:55:12,794
We closed his case file.

958
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:14,505
A notorious killer was released...

959
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:16,472
and you say the case file is closed.

960
00:55:16,536 --> 00:55:17,463
Madam, he is dead!

961
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:20,650
Dead?

962
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:22,517
When he was released,
he was bedridden.

963
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:24,273
Madam, is it anything important?

964
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,360
Only if he speaks, we'll know the truth.

965
00:55:26,452 --> 00:55:27,975
Even if he's alive, he can't speak.

966
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:29,728
Because he's deaf and dumb.

967
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:35,080
Madam, there's no way ahead.
Please go back!

968
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:36,971
Please turn around.

969
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:42,337
Okay.

970
00:55:42,976 --> 00:55:43,664
On the night of the murder...

971
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:46,767
What was the time when you went
to deliver the liquor?

972
00:55:51,406 --> 00:55:52,509
I'm not sure about the time.

973
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:54,692
I gave liquor to Annachi and left.

974
00:55:54,877 --> 00:55:58,064
-Whose watch is it?
-It's mine, Madam.

975
00:55:58,376 --> 00:55:59,233
Where did you buy it from?

976
00:55:59,479 --> 00:56:01,716
I did not buy it.
It's a gift from my girlfriend.

977
00:56:03,953 --> 00:56:04,857
Bloody hell!

978
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:06,828
Girlfriend's gift, my foot.

979
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:08,857
This watch is not mine.

980
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:10,863
After they cleared Annachi's body...

981
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:12,344
I picked it up while cleaning the place.

982
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:15,053
I knew it must be a watch
that rich people buy.

983
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:17,643
-Oh, God!
-Madam, this watch...

984
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:18,187
It's mine!

985
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:21,408
I must've misplaced it when I was
investigating at the liquor shop.

986
00:56:21,683 --> 00:56:22,818
You stole and, on top of it, lying--

987
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:26,375
While closing up shop,
did you encounter anyone new?

988
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,626
A Police officer came and bought
a case of liquor.

989
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:30,669
Also, he brought a friend from abroad.

990
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:31,769
-Murthy!
-Madam?

991
00:56:31,818 --> 00:56:33,398
Check who was on patrol
on that night.

992
00:56:33,883 --> 00:56:35,121
Madam, he's lying.
Don't pay heed to him.

993
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:38,969
There were two glasses on the table.

994
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:40,633
Did Manickam have company?

995
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:42,105
This glass was for Anbu Anna.

996
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:44,986
-Was Anbu present there?
-He visits often.

997
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,947
He left early on that night
and did not drink.

998
00:56:47,056 --> 00:56:48,051
Where can I find Anbu?

999
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:49,965
As per the information,
he's at his farmhouse.

1000
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,297
-I need to meet him.
-Okay.

1001
00:56:51,362 --> 00:56:54,132
Madam, he only meets people
with an appointment.

1002
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,531
I'm not going to meet.
I need to investigate.

1003
00:56:57,743 --> 00:56:59,934
"Live on Annachi"
It should be in bold letters.

1004
00:56:59,982 --> 00:57:00,696
Okay!

1005
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,547
Below it is a huge picture of mine.

1006
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:05,905
Be rest assured. We will do it.

1007
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,203
It'll be just as grand as we did
for Manickam Anna.

1008
00:57:08,452 --> 00:57:10,390
It's two kilometers
from the gate to the house.

1009
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:11,404
It's scorching hot!

1010
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,077
Velankanni!

1011
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:14,887
I left the papers in the vehicle.

1012
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:16,709
Could you please bring it to me?

1013
00:57:16,742 --> 00:57:17,924
I don't get it!

1014
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:20,450
Don't I look like a Police officer to you?

1015
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:23,928
Oh, no, you misunderstood, Velankanni.

1016
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:25,684
I'm on parole.

1017
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,683
-If I go alone, you'll be--
-I'll be in trouble!

1018
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:31,994
You use this to extract work from me.

1019
00:57:32,421 --> 00:57:34,277
I've worked for you more
then at the station.

1020
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:35,562
Not on purpose.

1021
00:57:35,707 --> 00:57:37,825
Wait in a corner. I don't want
anyone to see you alone.

1022
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:38,608
I'll take my leave.

1023
00:57:38,641 --> 00:57:39,719
-Hey!
-Anna!

1024
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:41,493
Mani was supposed to surrender.

1025
00:57:41,652 --> 00:57:42,528
No news from him.

1026
00:57:42,653 --> 00:57:44,616
-Go and check on him.
-Sure.

1027
00:58:05,555 --> 00:58:06,320
Who is it?

1028
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,178
I'm talking to you. Who are you?

1029
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:13,661
Can't you hear me?

1030
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,712
Can you hear me or not?
Who are you?

1031
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:24,642
Velankanni brought me here
to fix a deal for my land.

1032
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:26,814
Oh, you're that client.

1033
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,073
Do I know you from somewhere?

1034
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,750
Oh, no, I'm new to town.

1035
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:37,734
I'm here to sell my land.

1036
00:58:39,072 --> 00:58:40,346
Aren't you the ambulance driver?

1037
00:58:40,624 --> 00:58:42,624
No. I'm here to sell my land.

1038
00:58:46,374 --> 00:58:48,226
Aren't you Thilagan?
What do you want?

1039
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,641
I don't want anything.

1040
00:58:49,884 --> 00:58:53,903
I'm here to return what I was given
fourteen years ago.

1041
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:55,071
How dare you?

1042
00:59:31,282 --> 00:59:32,399
Are you looking for this?

1043
00:59:46,669 --> 00:59:49,788
Do you believe
Am I doing good to you?

1044
00:59:53,747 --> 00:59:56,977
You have made a good man
act like a good man.

1045
01:00:43,802 --> 01:00:45,435
Criminals are afraid of the Police.

1046
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,679
In my case, the Police is afraid
of the criminal.

1047
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:49,225
Oh, no, Nandhini is coming.

1048
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,116
Why is she arriving over here?

1049
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:55,842
Oh, no, Thilagan Anna is here.

1050
01:01:08,646 --> 01:01:10,456
If she finds him over here...

1051
01:01:10,645 --> 01:01:12,116
she'll hang me upside down.

1052
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:17,655
Thilagan, Anna!

1053
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:19,267
Come on, let's go!

1054
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:20,606
-Come on.
-What happened?

1055
01:01:20,669 --> 01:01:21,486
The Police are arriving.

1056
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,624
-You're the Police.
-It's not important.

1057
01:01:23,649 --> 01:01:25,683
-Nandhini is coming.
-Why is she coming over here?

1058
01:01:25,921 --> 01:01:27,206
To buy two acres of land.

1059
01:01:27,313 --> 01:01:28,909
Stop with the questions.
Let's go!

1060
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:30,048
What about my land deal?

1061
01:01:30,164 --> 01:01:31,353
You're the landlord,
and I'm the broker.

1062
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:32,904
If they find us here,
she'll whack me.

1063
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:34,876
Let's go.
Oh, no, she's coming this way.

1064
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:36,146
Go! Let's use Saroja's route.

1065
01:01:36,194 --> 01:01:36,772
Go! Go!

1066
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:39,723
-That's her room.
-Saroja always goes this way.

1067
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:40,514
Fine, keep moving.

1068
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,022
As it is, she's pissed off with me
for not cutting my hair.

1069
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,278
If we get caught...

1070
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:48,837
She'll skin me alive.

1071
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:49,991
Come on. Hurry up!

1072
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:58,248
-Murthy!
-Madam?

1073
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,803
-Check over there.
-Okay, Madam.

1074
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:05,174
Anbu!

1075
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:08,721
Anbazhagan!

1076
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,806
Hey, what happened?

1077
01:02:27,253 --> 01:02:29,760
Shall we cross out the place
near the bus stand?

1078
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,160
But the land near Koot Road...

1079
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:33,254
What's your opinion about it?

1080
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,183
How come you're watching the news?

1081
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:38,948
Let's listen to a song.

1082
01:02:39,107 --> 01:02:40,757
After building the house,
what shall we name it?

1083
01:02:44,237 --> 01:02:46,633
I'm excited about the house,
and you're watching the news!

1084
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:47,788
Hey, give it back!

1085
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:51,725
[news] UMMK Secretary Anbazhagan
was found dead at his farmhouse.

1086
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:55,685
As their party, Chief Manickam
was killed a few days ago.

1087
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,663
Anbazhagan was next in line
for the position.

1088
01:02:57,745 --> 01:03:01,146
But his mysterious death
has created a stir in Kancheepuram.

1089
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:06,049
I don't get how only your enemies
are dying under your jurisdiction.

1090
01:03:06,172 --> 01:03:07,944
How could the time of death
in Anbu's post-mortem report...

1091
01:03:08,047 --> 01:03:09,580
and your arrival be the same?

1092
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:12,546
Sir, I went there to investigate
Manickam's murder case.

1093
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:15,866
-I'm happy.
-Were you there to investigate or murder...

1094
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:17,729
-...how do we know? Tell me?
-Nagu is yelling at her!

1095
01:03:17,785 --> 01:03:18,344
Question her, Sir.

1096
01:03:18,492 --> 01:03:20,843
-What's happening?
-Grill her!

1097
01:03:20,946 --> 01:03:23,290
Whoever your Inspector enquires
they end up dead.

1098
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:26,014
Don't bother. Let her endure it.

1099
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,647
Sir, you're accusing me of murder.

1100
01:03:31,006 --> 01:03:31,663
What's the time?

1101
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:35,769
-It's 09:00 a.m.
-Do you drink?

1102
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:37,998
Liquor?

1103
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:41,798
I wonder how your watch ended up
at the liquor shop.

1104
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,697
I feel sorry for Madam.

1105
01:03:46,754 --> 01:03:48,279
-Shall we tell them?
-What?

1106
01:03:48,685 --> 01:03:50,235
On that day, we were at the farm.

1107
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:53,269
What about the night at the bar?
Shall we tell them about it, too?

1108
01:03:53,294 --> 01:03:54,166
Sure, let's tell them.

1109
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,209
Hey, you'll return to prison in 10 days.

1110
01:03:56,234 --> 01:03:57,506
Are you planning to take me along?

1111
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,106
Do you remember how she yelled at you?

1112
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:00,967
She has beaten me many times.

1113
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:02,999
It isn't bad, even if she gets beaten up.

1114
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:03,874
Let's grab drinks!

1115
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,283
You have 48 hours.

1116
01:04:07,404 --> 01:04:09,644
Find out who's the suspect
and bring him to me.

1117
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:10,772
If you don't,

1118
01:04:11,036 --> 01:04:13,486
I'll use your watch as evidence
and launch an investigation on you.

1119
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:16,604
Hey!

1120
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:19,687
The deceased belongs to my caste.

1121
01:04:19,911 --> 01:04:21,543
If you don't find the murderer,

1122
01:04:21,664 --> 01:04:23,197
no one in this station will survive.

1123
01:04:26,377 --> 01:04:28,489
Is it the prisoner who was transferred
from Central Jail?

1124
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,278
David who was released
from Palayamkottai jail--

1125
01:04:39,639 --> 01:04:42,182
The victims bled through
their ears and nose.

1126
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,366
And died of ear drum blast.

1127
01:04:50,455 --> 01:04:53,556
This killer's pattern is to kill
and bleed to death.

1128
01:04:55,628 --> 01:04:57,322
Even if he were alive,
he can't speak.

1129
01:05:05,253 --> 01:05:07,346
A Police officer came and bought
a case of liquor.

1130
01:05:07,476 --> 01:05:09,385
Also he brought a friend
from abroad.

1131
01:05:22,855 --> 01:05:23,728
It's not him.

1132
01:05:31,023 --> 01:05:32,721
He looks so huge!

1133
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:33,847
It's not him, Madam.

1134
01:05:34,338 --> 01:05:36,300
-Are you wasting our time?
-Sir, let go of my neck.

1135
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,234
Did no one from here
come to the bar on that night?

1136
01:05:38,324 --> 01:05:39,065
No, Madam.

1137
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:42,669
Karthi, show him pictures of officers
that were off and on the night shift.

1138
01:05:42,785 --> 01:05:43,425
Okay, Madam!

1139
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:47,538
You can leave only after you
find the Police officer.

1140
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:48,571
Okay, Madam.

1141
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:50,719
Rightfully, the Police should find out.

1142
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:52,504
But she's asking me to find the Police.

1143
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:55,307
Doctor from the report
you issued on Anbazhagan

1144
01:05:55,526 --> 01:05:56,564
I arrived at a guess.

1145
01:05:56,596 --> 01:05:58,670
-What is it?
-Ma'am, my son is missing.

1146
01:05:58,757 --> 01:06:00,465
-Murthy...
-Ma'am, please hear me out.

1147
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:03,386
For the past 20 years
Anbazhagan has relied on a inhaler.

1148
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,112
But according to the autopsy report...

1149
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,533
he inhaled Hydrogen Cyanide.

1150
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:10,604
If a person inhales Hydrogen Cyanide,
it causes blood sweat.

1151
01:06:10,668 --> 01:06:11,528
You do.

1152
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:15,255
In medical terms,
we call it Hematidrosis.

1153
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:18,728
At the time of his death
Cortisol levels were high.

1154
01:06:18,909 --> 01:06:20,900
His stress level was too high.

1155
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:24,519
So, the killer must've infused
Hydrogen Cyanide in Anbu's inhaler.

1156
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:25,228
Maybe!

1157
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:28,617
In my experience, this is the first case.

1158
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:31,223
You know what, Doctor.
This has happened before.

1159
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:32,543
The three victims in the pictures...

1160
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:35,661
-died of blood sweat like Anbazhagan.
-Oh!

1161
01:06:36,044 --> 01:06:39,574
Rishi - He killed them all
in a similar pattern.

1162
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:45,887
Rishi has been in Puzhal Jail
since 2011 till present.

1163
01:06:46,013 --> 01:06:48,794
His pattern was used
in Anbazhagan's murder.

1164
01:06:49,262 --> 01:06:53,400
David - 'In 99-'2007, he was
in Central Jail.

1165
01:06:53,529 --> 01:06:56,357
In 2007, he was transferred.
to Palayamkottai jail.

1166
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,357
David's pattern was used
in Manickam's murder.

1167
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:01,512
But David is not alive.

1168
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:05,231
So, if a murder has occurred now
in a pattern

1169
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:08,707
that resonates with prisoners
from two different prisons...

1170
01:07:10,082 --> 01:07:13,320
-...there's a third person involved!
-Three days since my son is missing.

1171
01:07:13,844 --> 01:07:15,796
-I won't leave.
-Don't yell. Get out!

1172
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,702
-I will leave once I get help.
-Murthy!

1173
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,464
Why are you making so much noise?

1174
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:20,993
Madam...

1175
01:07:21,445 --> 01:07:23,747
Please find my son.

1176
01:07:25,268 --> 01:07:26,892
-What case is it?
-Missing case!

1177
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,532
Her son is a thief.

1178
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:29,603
She is not listening.

1179
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,432
-Get lost!
-No, you're mistaken.

1180
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:34,826
I've been coming over here
since my son went missing.

1181
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:36,611
They're refusing to file a complaint.

1182
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:38,775
As if we're sitting here jobless.

1183
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,400
There must be many complaints
against your son.

1184
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:45,197
-Get lost from here.
-Murthy!

1185
01:07:49,509 --> 01:07:50,115
Sorry, Madam!

1186
01:07:52,876 --> 01:07:53,918
What is the name of your son?

1187
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:57,113
Vikram, ma'am. Vigneshwaran.

1188
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:03,433
Your son is a petty thief.

1189
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:06,288
No ma'am. He has stopped.

1190
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,800
She's right.
Nowadays, he's into eve teasing.

1191
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:11,135
Last week,
he was troubling a schoolgirl.

1192
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,356
And was beaten up by the father.

1193
01:08:13,949 --> 01:08:15,322
Did they beat up my son?

1194
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:18,328
-Madam...
-Who beat him up?

1195
01:08:19,226 --> 01:08:20,147
Madam, it was...

1196
01:08:20,257 --> 01:08:21,685
Who beat him up?

1197
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:24,523
This man beat us up.

1198
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,830
Why was I not informed about it?

1199
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:39,616
Poor thing. He's out on parole.

1200
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:41,728
A prisoner on parole has indulged
in a fight.

1201
01:08:42,342 --> 01:08:43,175
Feeling sorry, my foot!

1202
01:08:44,174 --> 01:08:46,045
Ma, they will file a complaint.

1203
01:08:46,203 --> 01:08:47,198
-You may go.
-Okay, ma'am.

1204
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:48,740
Get going!

1205
01:08:52,347 --> 01:08:53,304
Puzhal-Central

1206
01:08:53,404 --> 01:08:54,530
Only a prisoner who was at
both the prisons could've done it.

1207
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,631
Do you mean the prisoner
who was released from Central Jail?

1208
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:57,983
He was released
from Palayamkottai prison.

1209
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,585
A Police officer came and bought
a case of liquor.

1210
01:08:59,632 --> 01:09:00,567
He died, Madam.

1211
01:09:00,607 --> 01:09:02,666
Also he brought a friend from abroad.

1212
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:06,155
Parolee, Thilaga Varman, Madam.

1213
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:09,538
-Murthy!
-Madam!

1214
01:09:10,231 --> 01:09:11,151
Which prison is Thilagan from?

1215
01:09:12,366 --> 01:09:12,996
Puzhal.

1216
01:09:13,242 --> 01:09:15,999
-Which year?
-2005 till current.

1217
01:09:16,898 --> 01:09:18,798
In 2005, there was no Puzhal prison.

1218
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:19,861
What is his mother prison?

1219
01:09:21,928 --> 01:09:24,126
Go and bring me the probation report.

1220
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,400
-Which prison?
-Central Prison!

1221
01:09:28,756 --> 01:09:31,608
In 2005, Thilagan was with David
in Central prison...

1222
01:09:31,725 --> 01:09:33,455
and later with Rishi in Puzhal.

1223
01:09:33,891 --> 01:09:34,454
Jack!

1224
01:09:40,086 --> 01:09:42,129
-Was it him?
-Yes, that's him!

1225
01:09:42,224 --> 01:09:43,354
How did you find him?

1226
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:49,025
Is he the friend from abroad?

1227
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:52,541
Not sure. But he was tall.

1228
01:10:10,212 --> 01:10:11,546
When did you find this watch?

1229
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:15,309
I found it while cleaning
after Annachi's body was cleared.

1230
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:16,006
Did you forget?

1231
01:10:19,012 --> 01:10:22,020
I found it at the entrance before
I discovered Annachi's dead body.

1232
01:10:24,312 --> 01:10:26,026
Madam, that means your watch...

1233
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,429
I thought I lost it
when I went there for investigation.

1234
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,593
But the watch was present
when the murder occurred.

1235
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:34,936
So, Thilagan swiped my watch
to mislead the case.

1236
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:39,317
Where can I find Thilagan?

1237
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:43,829
Anna, who are you looking for?

1238
01:10:44,217 --> 01:10:46,324
We're running out of auspicious time.

1239
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:48,983
Anna, the client,
is going to sign the papers.

1240
01:10:49,069 --> 01:10:50,061
If you sign, too, it'll be done.

1241
01:10:50,085 --> 01:10:51,372
-Please come.
-I'm coming.

1242
01:10:54,444 --> 01:10:55,306
Thank you!

1243
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,000
Did you notice?

1244
01:11:10,211 --> 01:11:11,543
Everyone looks fine.

1245
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,309
But when we visit, they end up dead.

1246
01:11:14,522 --> 01:11:16,197
Many have come down today.

1247
01:11:16,503 --> 01:11:17,709
I don't know who's going to die next.

1248
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:19,524
Velankanni, stop scaring me.

1249
01:11:19,652 --> 01:11:21,652
I'm waiting for my daughter to arrive.

1250
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:24,790
Oh, you're excited to see your daughter.

1251
01:11:25,293 --> 01:11:27,883
My daughter is determined
not to see me.

1252
01:11:28,323 --> 01:11:29,040
Why?

1253
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:32,848
Of course, I love my daughter
as she was born to me.

1254
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:34,847
But in the case of our children...

1255
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:38,057
they don't love just because
they're born to us.

1256
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:39,999
Their love depends on how we raise them.

1257
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,866
My daughter should never feel that way.

1258
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,655
Please let me know when she arrives.

1259
01:11:47,442 --> 01:11:48,874
I'll be on the other side.

1260
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,374
Is it imperative that I should come?

1261
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,735
It is because you're the only daughter.

1262
01:11:54,867 --> 01:11:56,227
They need you for the registration.

1263
01:11:56,351 --> 01:11:57,508
We can leave once you're done.

1264
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,249
Will that man be present?

1265
01:12:00,408 --> 01:12:02,297
Hey, after so many years...

1266
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:04,601
you're going to see your father
for the first time.

1267
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:06,698
Please don't be so harsh on him.

1268
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:09,324
I'm saying it because
I never want to meet him.

1269
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,515
Please don't call him my father.

1270
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:19,242
Malar, dear, we will build
a new house on this land.

1271
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:22,208
In this house, you, me,
and Mother will live happily.

1272
01:12:41,688 --> 01:12:42,645
Come to the station.
You're doomed!

1273
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:43,887
-What happened, Sir?
-She's going to kill you.

1274
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:44,774
Oh, no!

1275
01:12:46,794 --> 01:12:47,520
Vanakkam, Madam.

1276
01:12:49,108 --> 01:12:50,195
Sir, what is the issue?

1277
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:58,165
Why did you murder Anbu and Manickam?

1278
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,028
Did he murder them?

1279
01:12:59,182 --> 01:12:59,812
Murder?

1280
01:13:00,403 --> 01:13:01,805
What are you saying, Madam?

1281
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,087
You committed a murder...

1282
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,129
Step aside. Come to the station
and discuss further.

1283
01:13:06,161 --> 01:13:07,805
-Sir, what happened?
-Madam, I did not murder them.

1284
01:13:13,704 --> 01:13:14,226
Madam...

1285
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:15,609
I did not do it.

1286
01:13:17,132 --> 01:13:19,507
My daughter is here.
Please take your hands off me.

1287
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,578
Madam, let go of me.

1288
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:22,218
Hey!

1289
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:29,390
I... did not... do it...

1290
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:32,436
How dare you?

1291
01:13:32,864 --> 01:13:34,570
Come on! Come on!

1292
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:35,765
-What happened, Sir?
-What happened, Sir?

1293
01:13:35,836 --> 01:13:37,077
I'll explain later. Come with me.

1294
01:13:37,922 --> 01:13:40,437
Oh, no! Hey! Madam...

1295
01:13:41,624 --> 01:13:43,765
Sir, what are you doing?
I'm holding a child.

1296
01:13:43,937 --> 01:13:45,882
What happened, Sir?
Tell me what's the issue.

1297
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,468
-Ma, please go back.
-Where are you taking him?

1298
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:50,874
-Get inside.
-Madam, please hear me out.

1299
01:13:51,195 --> 01:13:52,937
-What happened, Sir?
-What happened, Ma?

1300
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:54,343
Where are you taking my son?

1301
01:14:16,944 --> 01:14:18,831
Velankanni, Sir, was with me all the time.

1302
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,450
How could I be at the murder site?

1303
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:22,159
You may give many reasons.

1304
01:14:22,184 --> 01:14:23,760
As it was time,
I asked him to shut the shop.

1305
01:14:24,034 --> 01:14:25,060
"If you don't, I'll file a case."
That is what I told him.

1306
01:14:25,534 --> 01:14:26,105
Rascal!

1307
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,338
And he's accusing me of buying
a case of liquor.

1308
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:30,261
After this place,
we did not go anywhere else.

1309
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,184
Sir, please believe me.

1310
01:14:31,293 --> 01:14:33,276
Madam, I know the owner of this shop.
Meat is delicious here--

1311
01:14:33,347 --> 01:14:34,308
You're annoying me...

1312
01:14:34,409 --> 01:14:37,948
What if the prisoner on parole
died of hunger?

1313
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,575
-Then people will speak badly of us.
-I'm telling the truth.

1314
01:14:39,964 --> 01:14:42,596
You're focused on the gallery.
Please check my wallpaper.

1315
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:44,706
-You will be surprised.
-Sir, why are you taking my prints?

1316
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:46,670
-Sir, please hear me out.
-I have your picture.

1317
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,232
-You're my inspiration, ma'am.
-Sir, I know everything.

1318
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,228
Sir, please...

1319
01:14:49,467 --> 01:14:51,964
-Hey! What happened to the fingerprints?
-I got them, madam.

1320
01:14:52,441 --> 01:14:53,362
Hey, place your hands on it.

1321
01:14:59,222 --> 01:15:02,050
Case No. 34/2005 - Thilaga Varman.

1322
01:15:02,661 --> 01:15:05,933
Listen, your prints are registered
on the knife.

1323
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,456
There's a witness, too.

1324
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:10,295
On that night when I was
returning from work...

1325
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:15,271
I saw him stabbing his wife and Kathir.

1326
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:16,776
I did not commit the murders, madam.

1327
01:15:18,836 --> 01:15:21,003
-Shall I take another picture of you?
-I'll handle you later.

1328
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:22,839
Hurry up!
We must take him to the judge.

1329
01:15:27,404 --> 01:15:28,106
Vanakkam, sir.

1330
01:15:29,503 --> 01:15:30,044
Sir!

1331
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:33,553
Do you only work your cases
during the night?

1332
01:15:33,623 --> 01:15:35,623
Why can't you visit the court
during the day?

1333
01:15:35,842 --> 01:15:37,733
Sorry, Sir. It was an urgent case.

1334
01:15:38,388 --> 01:15:40,803
A prisoner on parole
has committed two murders.

1335
01:15:41,357 --> 01:15:43,653
Also, a minor boy is missing.

1336
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,615
If we pity and grant you parole...

1337
01:15:45,701 --> 01:15:47,701
you don't seem to respect that.

1338
01:15:48,037 --> 01:15:49,639
I did not kill anyone.

1339
01:15:50,194 --> 01:15:52,451
The Police won't arrest you
without evidence.

1340
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,780
Indeed, I was arrested
without evidence.

1341
01:15:55,178 --> 01:15:56,061
What do you mean by no evidence?

1342
01:15:57,257 --> 01:15:59,028
Sir, this is Thilagan's copy
of the judgment.

1343
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:03,178
The deceased Anbazhagan was
a witness who incriminated him.

1344
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:04,895
On the 10th, he got out on parole.

1345
01:16:04,983 --> 01:16:06,615
And on the 14th,
the first murder occurred.

1346
01:16:06,694 --> 01:16:08,209
Then, on the 18th,
the second murder occurred.

1347
01:16:08,436 --> 01:16:11,764
In both the murders, the same pattern
was used as his inmates.

1348
01:16:11,873 --> 01:16:14,654
Sir, just because I got out on parole
on the 10th...

1349
01:16:14,748 --> 01:16:17,444
and the following murders are resonating
with the pattern of my inmates...

1350
01:16:17,522 --> 01:16:19,209
she is accusing me of being the murderer.

1351
01:16:20,382 --> 01:16:23,863
But a dead body was recovered
from a bridge in Wallajah on the 8th.

1352
01:16:24,116 --> 01:16:26,647
The pattern was the same as the inmates.

1353
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:29,525
They hide a needle inside the torchlight...

1354
01:16:29,641 --> 01:16:32,795
then use it to stab the victim
and throw it right there.

1355
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:35,056
Torchlight murders continue.

1356
01:16:35,673 --> 01:16:39,433
A man named Vamsi murdered
Sixteen people in this pattern.

1357
01:16:39,564 --> 01:16:41,028
Whether it's the prison
or in the department...

1358
01:16:41,176 --> 01:16:44,582
everyone knows about torchlight murders.

1359
01:16:44,923 --> 01:16:48,469
But two years ago,
he was hanged to death.

1360
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,462
Then, who committed the murder
on the 8th?

1361
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:55,852
-Umm... I need to investigate.
-So, you did not.

1362
01:16:57,908 --> 01:17:00,868
-No, Sir--
-Sir, madam may not know about it.

1363
01:17:00,969 --> 01:17:04,172
Because she was under suspension.

1364
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:07,556
Were you under suspension?

1365
01:17:08,759 --> 01:17:09,446
Yes, Sir.

1366
01:17:10,063 --> 01:17:11,242
Custodial death, Sir.

1367
01:17:11,313 --> 01:17:13,524
In the pretense of investigation,
she beat him to death.

1368
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:16,423
Mister, he died of a heart attack.

1369
01:17:16,587 --> 01:17:18,906
However, the reason for her suspension...

1370
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:21,760
is the protest staged
by the deceased Manickam and Anbu.

1371
01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:24,743
The deceased and her have enmity.

1372
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:28,720
Looks like the case is now
pointing towards you.

1373
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:33,149
That is why she's cornering
an innocent prisoner on parole.

1374
01:17:33,728 --> 01:17:36,438
Sir, I'm out on parole
after fourteen years.

1375
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:39,922
I don't get it. Why is madam
giving me a hard time?

1376
01:17:40,774 --> 01:17:43,477
Despite being under the watch
of shadow police 24/7...

1377
01:17:43,767 --> 01:17:46,946
yet I don't understand why she thinks
I'm the murderer.

1378
01:17:47,236 --> 01:17:50,977
This is an embarrassing moment
for the Police department.

1379
01:17:51,509 --> 01:17:54,197
The situation calls for remand
the Police officer.

1380
01:17:55,361 --> 01:17:57,579
You stay out of trouble
until your parole is over.

1381
01:17:57,774 --> 01:17:59,667
Don't allow him to visit public places.

1382
01:18:00,016 --> 01:18:00,664
Okay, Sir.

1383
01:18:00,992 --> 01:18:03,234
Sir, this week is their village carnival...

1384
01:18:03,415 --> 01:18:05,282
It'd be great if you gave him
permission to attend it.

1385
01:18:05,337 --> 01:18:06,579
He's out on parole to meet
the sick father.

1386
01:18:06,657 --> 01:18:08,235
But now you're celebrating
the village carnival.

1387
01:18:08,329 --> 01:18:10,196
Spoiling my sleep cycle.

1388
01:18:10,736 --> 01:18:13,266
Do they see me as a judge
or an accused?

1389
01:18:14,076 --> 01:18:14,961
Incorrigible people!

1390
01:18:15,227 --> 01:18:15,954
Listen!

1391
01:18:25,478 --> 01:18:26,712
Once I find Vicky...

1392
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,321
I will prove that you murdered them both.

1393
01:18:30,679 --> 01:18:32,237
I did not kill them, madam.

1394
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:39,868
Thank goodness you gave me
this newspaper.

1395
01:18:40,045 --> 01:18:41,632
If not, we must've been
in deep trouble.

1396
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,188
Hey, he's out here.

1397
01:18:57,298 --> 01:18:57,961
Hurry up!

1398
01:18:58,063 --> 01:19:00,003
He's out there.
Hey, stop right there.

1399
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:14,625
Make way for Kalimuthu, Anna.

1400
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:20,548
Keep your anger under control.

1401
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,628
It does not matter how you were outside,
in prison, be a good man.

1402
01:19:23,783 --> 01:19:25,766
The prison will reward you
with the Good Man stamp.

1403
01:19:25,984 --> 01:19:27,617
On that day,
you can avenge your enemies.

1404
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:33,679
Thilagan, you're not like us who are
in prison to serve for their crimes.

1405
01:19:34,415 --> 01:19:37,069
But you're the one who will serve first
and then commit the crime.

1406
01:19:38,391 --> 01:19:42,374
A mere bow and arrow is not enough
for hunting in the forest.

1407
01:19:43,056 --> 01:19:46,030
But patience is paramount.

1408
01:19:46,821 --> 01:19:48,413
You're new in the prison.

1409
01:19:49,009 --> 01:19:53,436
There's a lot you can learn
from every inmate.

1410
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:02,179
Like Kalimuthu, Anna, suggested...

1411
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:05,316
I started to act as a good man
despite being a good man.

1412
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:14,749
I taught the prisoners about
the value of human life...

1413
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:18,288
Yet I learned from them
how to take a life.

1414
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:21,475
I was getting ready for a hunt...

1415
01:20:21,954 --> 01:20:26,079
and learned every move
of the three I was hunting.

1416
01:20:28,211 --> 01:20:30,354
If I get out on parole...

1417
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:32,172
my only goal was to...

1418
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:35,938
kill them all without getting caught.

1419
01:20:38,095 --> 01:20:39,915
Thilagan, this is my number.

1420
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,227
Whenever you make up your mind
to kill them...

1421
01:20:42,352 --> 01:20:43,988
just give me a call.

1422
01:20:44,103 --> 01:20:46,460
For you, I will kill them,
no questions asked.

1423
01:21:01,473 --> 01:21:04,833
During your sentence, did it never
occur to you to visit your daughter?

1424
01:21:05,788 --> 01:21:06,811
I'll think about it, Sir.

1425
01:21:15,749 --> 01:21:16,983
May I borrow your phone?

1426
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:18,146
One minute.

1427
01:21:28,368 --> 01:21:29,319
Go ahead, talk.

1428
01:21:34,386 --> 01:21:35,480
Son, check who's calling.

1429
01:21:35,785 --> 01:21:37,847
-Grandpa, it says, Jail.
-Give it to me.

1430
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:41,319
-Who's it?
-Thilagan.

1431
01:21:41,589 --> 01:21:43,874
Hey, how are you?

1432
01:21:44,637 --> 01:21:46,402
Only now you remembered--

1433
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:49,706
Who should I kill?

1434
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:53,124
At Kanchipuram, GH, look for
ambulance driver Ganesan.

1435
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:55,714
Go and meet him.
He will give you an unclaimed corpse.

1436
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:59,093
Put the corpse on the bridge in Wallajah
and stab him with a needle.

1437
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:00,792
Why do you want to kill a corpse?

1438
01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:03,413
I thought you promised to do it,
no questions asked.

1439
01:22:03,754 --> 01:22:07,624
I've met many who killed like you
in prison.

1440
01:22:07,901 --> 01:22:10,026
Unfortunately, in some way,
you all got caught.

1441
01:22:10,784 --> 01:22:14,519
It's because you all believed
you'd never get caught.

1442
01:22:15,613 --> 01:22:17,991
But I believe
I will definitely get caught.

1443
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,350
I will finish the job.
Check the newspapers.

1444
01:22:20,589 --> 01:22:22,382
Grandpa, what did your friend say?

1445
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:23,784
Nothing, my dear.

1446
01:22:24,043 --> 01:22:26,113
What do we do when we're about to fish?

1447
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,209
We put small fish as bait
to catch the big fish.

1448
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,980
That's what my friend asked me to do.

1449
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,522
Sir, I'll go on parole.

1450
01:23:01,698 --> 01:23:03,381
-Hi!
-Hi.

1451
01:23:09,331 --> 01:23:10,577
-Hi, sit--
-No need.

1452
01:23:11,732 --> 01:23:13,585
Hi, did you finish your homework?

1453
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:16,112
-Did you finish your drawing?
-I could not do it.

1454
01:23:16,316 --> 01:23:18,561
I gave it to my brother,
and he drew it for me.

1455
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:22,764
Listen, girls, since you arrived,
you have not spoken to me.

1456
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:24,949
It's because your father is abroad.

1457
01:23:25,089 --> 01:23:26,198
So what?

1458
01:23:26,433 --> 01:23:28,534
Wait! What does your father do?

1459
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,027
My father is a school teacher.

1460
01:23:30,121 --> 01:23:32,121
-Your father?
-Bank Manager.

1461
01:23:32,144 --> 01:23:33,019
-Your father?
-Auditor!

1462
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,378
My father is an advocate.

1463
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,613
What is your father?

1464
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:37,691
-He is abroad.
-Abroad?

1465
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,409
-Where in abroad?
-In abroad...

1466
01:23:40,465 --> 01:23:43,003
Abroad... Say that he's in a prison abroad.

1467
01:23:44,595 --> 01:23:45,046
No!

1468
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:46,909
You lied and won the speech competition.

1469
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:50,665
Why did you not say that your
father is in prison, not abroad?

1470
01:23:51,176 --> 01:23:53,542
Abroad Jail.

1471
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,561
-Come on, let's play.
-It's okay. Carry on.

1472
01:24:00,688 --> 01:24:01,871
It's been ages since we played this game.

1473
01:24:03,445 --> 01:24:04,445
I blindfolded him.

1474
01:24:04,535 --> 01:24:05,670
Spin him around.

1475
01:24:05,876 --> 01:24:07,305
He's ready. Go ahead.

1476
01:24:07,385 --> 01:24:08,666
-Catch them.
-You can't catch me.

1477
01:24:08,737 --> 01:24:09,969
Hey, Malar's father is in prison.

1478
01:24:10,056 --> 01:24:11,313
So, all this while she was lying to us.

1479
01:24:12,246 --> 01:24:13,772
-Hey out!
-Hey, he's out!

1480
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:15,601
-Come on, brother.
-Let's blindfold Velankanni now.

1481
01:24:15,678 --> 01:24:17,373
Hey, take your hands off my pocket.

1482
01:24:17,492 --> 01:24:19,275
You're the watchman who monitors our uncle.

1483
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,194
-What did you say?
-Hurry up, run!

1484
01:24:20,234 --> 01:24:21,120
Stop right there.

1485
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,305
How dare you call me a watchman?

1486
01:24:22,345 --> 01:24:23,908
-Hey, brat!
-Run! He's coming for you.

1487
01:24:23,982 --> 01:24:25,109
-Oh, no!
-Oh, God!

1488
01:24:46,669 --> 01:24:48,497
You lied and won the speech competition

1489
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:18,560
That's right.
On the night of the 14th...

1490
01:25:18,818 --> 01:25:19,670
think well and answer.

1491
01:25:20,223 --> 01:25:22,520
I was here until 10:00 p.m.
I did not see him.

1492
01:25:22,567 --> 01:25:23,654
No, Sir, I have not seen him.

1493
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:24,513
-Did you not see him?
-No!

1494
01:25:24,545 --> 01:25:26,795
Madam, no one saw Thilagan
on that night.

1495
01:25:29,756 --> 01:25:31,991
Murthy, what are they saying?

1496
01:25:32,163 --> 01:25:33,451
Madam, they have not seen him.

1497
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:37,208
-Madam...
-I reckon they did not see him, too.

1498
01:25:37,568 --> 01:25:39,045
A girl claims she saw him.

1499
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:39,817
A girl?

1500
01:25:40,526 --> 01:25:41,982
-Please come.
-Come here.

1501
01:25:44,429 --> 01:25:45,546
When did you see him?

1502
01:25:45,835 --> 01:25:48,701
It was on the 14th night
at 12:30 a.m.

1503
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,967
How are you precise with the time?

1504
01:25:51,278 --> 01:25:53,050
I noted it down in the calendar.

1505
01:25:53,175 --> 01:25:55,644
He and a Police officer...

1506
01:25:56,144 --> 01:25:58,886
got down from the vehicle
and went inside the house.

1507
01:25:59,488 --> 01:25:59,995
Damn!

1508
01:26:01,685 --> 01:26:03,919
-Where do you live?
-She's Thilagan's daughter.

1509
01:26:04,803 --> 01:26:06,847
Please don't address me
as that murderer's daughter.

1510
01:26:07,622 --> 01:26:10,043
Fine, you may leave.
I'll call you if I need you.

1511
01:26:13,577 --> 01:26:14,134
Ma'am...

1512
01:26:15,349 --> 01:26:16,614
do not spare that man.

1513
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,170
Why did you let her go, madam?

1514
01:26:21,288 --> 01:26:22,459
Her statement won't stick in court

1515
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,529
She's talking out of spite
because her father is a murderer.

1516
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:26,847
We can arrest him
only if we find Vicky.

1517
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:29,685
-Have you seen them both?
-No, Sir.

1518
01:26:30,022 --> 01:26:30,896
I did not see them, Sir.

1519
01:26:31,116 --> 01:26:33,381
I have not seen the man.
But this boy hired my auto.

1520
01:26:33,553 --> 01:26:35,193
-I dropped him off.
-Where?

1521
01:26:35,763 --> 01:26:36,739
Yes, Sir. Over here.

1522
01:26:38,475 --> 01:26:39,185
Go ahead, tell me.

1523
01:26:39,264 --> 01:26:41,068
Madam, five days ago an auto driver,

1524
01:26:41,116 --> 01:26:43,209
claims to have dropped Vicky
near Thilagan's land.

1525
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:48,616
-What time did you drop him?
-07:30 p.m.

1526
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:49,763
Was he with someone else?

1527
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:50,912
There was no one.

1528
01:26:50,951 --> 01:26:52,638
He was speaking over the phone
and went toward the arch.

1529
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,348
Isn't this Thilagan's land?

1530
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:56,233
Stop.

1531
01:26:57,488 --> 01:26:58,316
Reverse the car.

1532
01:27:15,278 --> 01:27:16,260
Go in the field and check.

1533
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:36,745
Damn! This madam is a torture.

1534
01:27:36,942 --> 01:27:39,088
She won't rest until she arrests
the prisoner on parole.

1535
01:27:43,308 --> 01:27:44,537
I checked everywhere, madam.

1536
01:27:44,777 --> 01:27:45,611
There's nothing around.

1537
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:33,190
Anna!

1538
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:35,548
-Malar... Malar...
-What happened?

1539
01:28:35,605 --> 01:28:36,737
She hit puberty.

1540
01:28:42,308 --> 01:28:44,237
-I won't come to that house.
-Please hear me out.

1541
01:28:44,933 --> 01:28:47,767
I'm upset and counting the days
because my son will return to prison soon.

1542
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:49,034
I really don't care.

1543
01:28:49,206 --> 01:28:52,042
Ask him to return to the prison
or else go and die.

1544
01:28:52,067 --> 01:28:52,839
What did you just say?

1545
01:28:54,613 --> 01:28:55,681
For fourteen years,

1546
01:28:55,744 --> 01:28:57,837
he was locked up inside,
longing to see his daughter...

1547
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:00,212
Despite being so close to you,
he cannot see you.

1548
01:29:00,698 --> 01:29:02,300
You wouldn't know
what he's going through.

1549
01:29:02,721 --> 01:29:06,971
He's away from you now because
he does not want you to suffer.

1550
01:29:07,565 --> 01:29:08,846
You call me your mother.

1551
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:10,675
I'm asking this to my daughter...

1552
01:29:11,682 --> 01:29:12,783
Please do it for me.

1553
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,391
-Please listen to her.
-Fine, I'll come!

1554
01:29:15,774 --> 01:29:19,000
But until I'm in that house,
he should not step out of his room.

1555
01:29:19,383 --> 01:29:20,109

-Come on, let's go to the station.
-Hold on, man.

1590
01:32:04,141 --> 01:32:05,566
Hey, where are you taking me?

1591
01:32:07,912 --> 01:32:09,114
Hey, stop shaking the bike.

1592
01:32:12,975 --> 01:32:13,857
Vanakkam, sir.

1593
01:32:14,515 --> 01:32:16,421
Velankanni, sir, did not show up.

1594
01:32:16,492 --> 01:32:17,241
So I came.

1595
01:32:17,304 --> 01:32:19,507
You can sign the register later.
Wait over there.

1596
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:24,601
Sir, I arrived on time.

1597
01:32:24,788 --> 01:32:26,648
That does not mean
I have to hurry up.

1598
01:32:27,023 --> 01:32:27,913
Go and sit down.

1599
01:32:34,219 --> 01:32:36,163
-Velankanni!
-Welcome!

1600
01:32:36,337 --> 01:32:37,195
Where were you?

1601
01:32:37,423 --> 01:32:38,732
At least they let you come to them.

1602
01:32:38,964 --> 01:32:40,319
But they brought me here last night.

1603
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:42,985
He's speaking indifferently,
and you're blabbering.

1604
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:43,699
What's happening?

1605
01:32:43,762 --> 01:32:46,101
Hey, why did you kill that young boy?

1606
01:32:46,326 --> 01:32:48,398
-Did you say I killed him?
-Yes!

1607
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:51,213
-I did not kill anyone.
-Who else, then?

1608
01:32:51,276 --> 01:32:52,338
-They killed my son.
-Don't cry.

1609
01:32:52,575 --> 01:32:53,813
That boy's mother is here.

1610
01:32:53,922 --> 01:32:54,898
Don't cry, Ma.

1611
01:32:57,314 --> 01:32:59,635
Ma! Ma! This is the man.

1612
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,580
He's the one who beat Vicky.

1613
01:33:04,112 --> 01:33:05,991
-Bloody killer.
-Ma'am.

1614
01:33:06,054 --> 01:33:07,354
You killed my son!

1615
01:33:07,425 --> 01:33:08,784
You won't prosper in life.

1616
01:33:08,878 --> 01:33:10,463
-Ma'am, please let him go.
-What did you do to my son?

1617
01:33:10,503 --> 01:33:11,924
-I won't spare you.
-Take your hands off him.

1618
01:33:11,957 --> 01:33:13,049
I won't spare you.

1619
01:33:13,151 --> 01:33:14,619
Why? Why did you do it?

1620
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:16,885
-Please let go of him.
-I will kill you.

1621
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:18,089
-Take your hands off.
-Go! Go! Go! Take her away.

1622
01:33:18,247 --> 01:33:19,519
Behave yourself.
This is a Police station.

1623
01:33:19,612 --> 01:33:22,244
-Why did you kill him?
-You won't die a peaceful death.

1624
01:33:22,424 --> 01:33:24,936
-Get going.
-Hey, take her outside.

1625
01:33:25,682 --> 01:33:26,826
Hang him to death.

1626
01:33:27,862 --> 01:33:30,330
-This uncle saved your life.
-Thanks, uncle.

1627
01:33:35,097 --> 01:33:36,390
Sister, be careful.

1628
01:33:36,822 --> 01:33:37,487
Be careful.

1629
01:33:46,424 --> 01:33:48,752
Hey, only now...

1630
01:33:49,744 --> 01:33:51,197
do I see fear on your face?

1631
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:55,164
You'll co-operate only if we
arrest you with evidence.

1632
01:33:55,525 --> 01:33:57,063
-And I did.
-Madam...

1633
01:33:58,112 --> 01:33:59,955
I did not kill him.

1634
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:03,297
I will tell you
if you murdered him or not.

1635
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,993
Tell me, Saravanan.

1636
01:34:07,135 --> 01:34:08,701
Madam, Thilagan's fingerprints
did not match.

1637
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:11,025
It did not match.

1638
01:34:11,143 --> 01:34:13,323
Knife from the bar.
Main board lever...

1639
01:34:13,534 --> 01:34:16,614
Prints from both did not match
Thilagan's fingerprints.

1640
01:34:18,587 --> 01:34:21,658
Velankanni, you were with me
all the time on that day.

1641
01:34:21,862 --> 01:34:23,771
How could I have killed him?

1642
01:34:23,873 --> 01:34:25,111
I should be asking this question.

1643
01:34:29,135 --> 01:34:31,674
Madam, we have to take him
to the Magistrate.

1644
01:34:32,885 --> 01:34:35,536
-Huh?
-We're running late.

1645
01:34:38,147 --> 01:34:39,778
When did you find this watch?

1646
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:44,380
I picked it up at the entrance
before I found Annachi's corpse.

1647
01:34:47,185 --> 01:34:47,910
Please wait.

1648
01:34:48,568 --> 01:34:50,473
-I need a favor.
-Again?

1649
01:34:50,839 --> 01:34:53,377
I need Vicky's post-mortem report.

1650
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,874
Hey, that's on Madam's table.

1651
01:34:57,255 --> 01:34:58,122
If I get caught...

1652
01:34:58,201 --> 01:35:00,078
she will strip me to undies
and make me sit on the floor.

1653
01:35:00,222 --> 01:35:03,278
Only if we get the report
can we get your uniform back

1654
01:35:03,408 --> 01:35:05,962
and I can clear myself as not a murderer.

1655
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:06,681
Please!

1656
01:35:13,368 --> 01:35:15,396
-Please check on this sooner.
-Okay, Madam. Sure!

1657
01:35:18,218 --> 01:35:19,470
Thank goodness he's not here.

1658
01:35:20,821 --> 01:35:23,584
Lakshmi Akka, your husband,
is caught in a harassment case.

1659
01:35:23,672 --> 01:35:25,301
-Go and straighten him up.
-He never changes.

1660
01:35:25,326 --> 01:35:26,571
-I'll handle him.
-Poor woman.

1661
01:35:26,799 --> 01:35:28,851
Velankkani, why are you going to
madam's room?

1662
01:35:29,165 --> 01:35:31,608
Madam called and asked me to spray
the room with room spray.

1663
01:35:31,682 --> 01:35:32,770
-You keep scribbling.
-Do as you please.

1664
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:35,730
Instead of work,
she's interested in other things.

1665
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:38,697
Oh, God, it's her uniform.

1666
01:35:44,692 --> 01:35:46,313
I should be careful with fingerprints.

1667
01:35:50,998 --> 01:35:52,200
What happened?
Did you not get it?

1668
01:35:54,733 --> 01:35:55,692
Here you go!

1669
01:35:56,146 --> 01:35:57,844
-Thanks Velankanni.
-First, open and check.

1670
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:14,923
Madam, who does these
fingerprints belong to?

1671
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:15,557
Why do you ask?

1672
01:36:16,027 --> 01:36:20,161
Fingerprints from the murder weapon
and bar lever both match.

1673
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:24,463
Your face and this dress do not match.

1674
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:26,760
As if you look like
a crisp IPS officer in uniform.

1675
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:27,431
Oh, Madam is here.

1676
01:36:27,582 --> 01:36:29,418
Everything is ready, Madam.
Shall we bring him to the Magistrate?

1677
01:36:29,731 --> 01:36:31,394
Thilagan did not murder Manickam.

1678
01:36:31,527 --> 01:36:33,174
-Then who did it?
-Check the report.

1679
01:36:37,554 --> 01:36:38,612
Madam, Vicky?

1680
01:36:40,307 --> 01:36:43,327
I thought Thilagan swiped my watch
to mislead the case.

1681
01:36:43,723 --> 01:36:44,937
However, Vicky must've swiped it.

1682
01:36:45,958 --> 01:36:47,302
Thilagan beat up Vicky.

1683
01:36:47,754 --> 01:36:49,441
Was Vicky held at the station
the whole night?

1684
01:36:49,551 --> 01:36:51,613
Yes, Madam. We let him go
only the following day.

1685
01:36:51,768 --> 01:36:54,148
The following night,
Manickam was killed.

1686
01:36:54,386 --> 01:36:56,988
-Vicky went missing the next day.
-Hey, don't go over there.

1687
01:36:57,043 --> 01:37:00,136
Madam, I need to talk to you
about this post-mortem report.

1688
01:37:00,206 --> 01:37:01,198
How did you get this?

1689
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:03,629
Madam, please read what's written
in the report.

1690
01:37:03,723 --> 01:37:05,902
Who gave you permission
to touch the report?

1691
01:37:06,011 --> 01:37:08,277
A murderer you,
how dare you access my table.

1692
01:37:08,339 --> 01:37:09,662
Madam, I'm unlike you.

1693
01:37:10,028 --> 01:37:11,936
To murder someone under
the pretense of investigation.

1694
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:13,254
Did you witness it?

1695
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:14,808
Did you see me kill that person?

1696
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,049
Everyone says otherwise.

1697
01:37:16,215 --> 01:37:18,293
-Who is saying it?
-Madam, I did not say it.

1698
01:37:18,371 --> 01:37:20,367
Who said it?
Who the hell said it?

1699
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:22,269
It's making you angry, right?

1700
01:37:23,455 --> 01:37:24,814
You're a high-ranking officer...

1701
01:37:24,956 --> 01:37:28,125
But you do get angry when someone
accuses you of something you did not do it.

1702
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,293
I'm an ordinary prisoner on parole.

1703
01:37:30,987 --> 01:37:33,314
When people accuse me of a murder
that I did not do it...

1704
01:37:33,573 --> 01:37:34,963
won't I fear, Madam?

1705
01:37:35,542 --> 01:37:37,854
I swear I did not kill him.

1706
01:37:43,035 --> 01:37:46,457
Madam, someone has inflicted
scratches on the boy's body.

1707
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:50,237
Also, the report states there was
a shred of skin between the teeth.

1708
01:37:50,512 --> 01:37:53,949
The scratches on the hand
and skin in between the teeth...

1709
01:37:54,098 --> 01:37:57,066
indicates it happened during a fight.

1710
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,480
And the boy must've bitten
the attacker while escaping.

1711
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:02,372
If you want, you can run a DNA test.

1712
01:38:02,397 --> 01:38:03,612
I wonder what's a DNA?

1713
01:38:04,252 --> 01:38:05,908
We'll handle the DNA test.

1714
01:38:06,152 --> 01:38:06,995
What about stabbing?

1715
01:38:07,332 --> 01:38:09,300
I swear I did not stab him.

1716
01:38:09,387 --> 01:38:11,459
Please run my fingerprints if you want to.

1717
01:38:16,686 --> 01:38:17,150
Go!

1718
01:38:21,873 --> 01:38:23,405
-Velankanni!
-Madam!

1719
01:38:24,636 --> 01:38:25,207
Yes, Madam.

1720
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:28,318
Thilagan explained the report beautifully.

1721
01:38:28,987 --> 01:38:31,453
-Brilliant!
-He's not brilliant, Madam.

1722
01:38:31,882 --> 01:38:33,553
-I'm brilliant.
-How?

1723
01:38:34,013 --> 01:38:36,494
I stole the file from your table.

1724
01:38:38,873 --> 01:38:39,718
Thilagan!

1725
01:38:40,057 --> 01:38:42,804
Velankanni? Velankanni?

1726
01:38:43,986 --> 01:38:44,852
Did you call me?

1727
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:47,251
I called you.

1728
01:38:47,492 --> 01:38:49,554
My left ear is out.
Let me move to the other side.

1729
01:38:50,614 --> 01:38:51,897
-What?
-I need a favor.

1730
01:38:52,123 --> 01:38:54,248
I gave you everything I possibly could.

1731
01:38:54,455 --> 01:38:56,015
-There's nothing left.
-There's one thing.

1732
01:38:56,724 --> 01:38:59,247
-What?
-That register.

1733
01:39:00,483 --> 01:39:02,786
-He spoke to someone called Manikandan.
-Yes, Madam.

1734
01:39:02,882 --> 01:39:04,608
After that,
Vicky's phone was switched off.

1735
01:39:05,313 --> 01:39:06,630
Sorry for the disturbance, Madam.

1736
01:39:07,318 --> 01:39:08,800
I need to speak in private.
Please step out.

1737
01:39:08,833 --> 01:39:10,368
-Hey!
-Mannerless fellow.

1738
01:39:11,451 --> 01:39:16,212
Madam, usually Vicky's mother
signs the register and takes him.

1739
01:39:16,296 --> 01:39:19,452
But this time, Manikandan
signed the register for him.

1740
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:20,553
What do you reckon?

1741
01:39:20,742 --> 01:39:23,335
If we find Manikandan,
we can find the murderer.

1742
01:39:23,468 --> 01:39:25,303
Are you teaching us
how to investigate?

1743
01:39:25,522 --> 01:39:27,756
We're in trouble because of your
irresponsible shadow policing.

1744
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:29,224
Why don't you give it a try?

1745
01:39:29,865 --> 01:39:30,827
-Murthy!
-Madam!

1746
01:39:30,919 --> 01:39:32,333
Find out where Manikandan is.

1747
01:39:32,576 --> 01:39:34,427
Madam, we'll eventually get to it.

1748
01:39:34,489 --> 01:39:36,840
But it was Thilagan who beat up the boy.

1749
01:39:36,975 --> 01:39:38,037
Also, he buried him in his land.

1750
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:40,069
We can't get more
substantial evidence than this.

1751
01:39:40,764 --> 01:39:42,053
Please do as I said.

1752
01:39:42,616 --> 01:39:44,607
Didn't I follow her orders?
Go ahead!

1753
01:39:45,703 --> 01:39:46,398
Please, Sir.

1754
01:39:48,539 --> 01:39:49,487
The first time, it's always bitter.

1755
01:39:49,559 --> 01:39:50,823
-You'll eventually get used to it.
-Velankanni!

1756
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:51,951
Madam?

1757
01:39:52,343 --> 01:39:53,853
-Ask Thilagan to leave.
-Okay, Madam.

1758
01:39:54,107 --> 01:39:55,239
Ma'am, I have a request.

1759
01:39:55,897 --> 01:39:56,987
What is it?

1760
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:01,249
People are making fun of me
in this dress.

1761
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,510
It'd be great if you could
give me back my uniform.

1762
01:40:07,791 --> 01:40:08,580
Oh, no!

1763
01:40:08,636 --> 01:40:10,493
Why did you sign for Vicky
at the station?

1764
01:40:10,798 --> 01:40:12,688
Why did he make the last call to you?

1765
01:40:13,054 --> 01:40:13,905
Confess!

1766
01:40:14,233 --> 01:40:15,921
Did you kill Vicky?

1767
01:40:16,436 --> 01:40:18,948
Confess! Come on, confess!

1768
01:40:19,191 --> 01:40:21,631
Yes, Madam. I killed Vicky.

1769
01:40:23,694 --> 01:40:25,301
-Why did you kill him?
-You see...

1770
01:40:25,444 --> 01:40:27,574
-Confess! Confess! Confess!
-Madam, madam, madam.

1771
01:40:28,082 --> 01:40:28,518
Why?

1772
01:40:28,543 --> 01:40:30,752
We had a conflict about
how to share 50 lakhs.

1773
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,624
-He threatened me, Madam.
-Money matters, is it?

1774
01:40:33,976 --> 01:40:36,104
Where did you find 50 lakhs
to buy a land?

1775
01:40:36,225 --> 01:40:38,020
Anbu Anna gave me the money.

1776
01:40:39,358 --> 01:40:41,002
Why did Anbu pay you 50 lakhs?

1777
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:42,756
It's hurting, Madam.

1778
01:40:43,242 --> 01:40:45,580
Tell me!
Why did Anbu give you money?

1779
01:40:45,655 --> 01:40:47,284
-Tell me!
-To kill Manickam.

1780
01:40:47,446 --> 01:40:49,268
To kill Manickam, Madam.

1781
01:40:49,655 --> 01:40:51,502
To kill Manickam, Madam.

1782
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:57,458
Here, Sir.

1783
01:40:57,999 --> 01:41:00,383
Hey! Hey! Hey, get up.

1784
01:41:03,242 --> 01:41:05,617
Did you and the young boy
together kill Manickam?

1785
01:41:05,821 --> 01:41:08,440
Sir, we, too, thought we killed him.

1786
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:09,469
I ought to!

1787
01:41:11,436 --> 01:41:13,038
-Tell me.
-He's right here.

1788
01:41:13,547 --> 01:41:15,531
-But there's Police with him.
-It's not an issue.

1789
01:41:15,968 --> 01:41:18,272
Let him start drinking.
I'll be there in half an hour.

1790
01:41:18,908 --> 01:41:22,033
Vicky did petty theft,
so I lured him with money.

1791
01:41:22,381 --> 01:41:25,017
And took him along to kill Manickam.

1792
01:41:25,545 --> 01:41:27,455
Once he enters the bar...

1793
01:41:27,656 --> 01:41:29,338
First, I asked him to switch off
the main power.

1794
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:34,213
Then I asked him to enter
Manickam's room.

1795
01:41:34,445 --> 01:41:37,166
I asked him to lock the door
if he started asking questions.

1796
01:41:37,288 --> 01:41:39,299
I reckon he was high
and did not ask any questions.

1797
01:41:40,056 --> 01:41:42,132
Meanwhile,
I came from the window behind...

1798
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:43,349
and stabbed him, sir.

1799
01:41:46,726 --> 01:41:48,338
He died! Died! Died! Died!

1800
01:41:49,366 --> 01:41:51,699
After I killed him, I asked him to leave
from the front entrance.

1801
01:41:51,891 --> 01:41:53,757
And I escaped through the back exit.

1802
01:41:58,156 --> 01:42:00,523
I know one day I will get caught
in Manickam's murder case.

1803
01:42:00,604 --> 01:42:02,078
That's why I brought in Vicky.

1804
01:42:02,266 --> 01:42:03,500
I paid him five lakhs...

1805
01:42:03,577 --> 01:42:06,037
And I told him
I'll bail him out in 6 months.

1806
01:42:06,062 --> 01:42:08,264
But we did not find any of your
fingerprints at the bar.

1807
01:42:08,335 --> 01:42:10,757
You're right, Madam.
If at all Vicky tried to bail on me...

1808
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,008
I didn't want to get caught.

1809
01:42:12,088 --> 01:42:15,500
So, I planned in such a way
that Vicky's prints were all over.

1810
01:42:15,578 --> 01:42:16,518
As per the plan,

1811
01:42:16,603 --> 01:42:19,392
I told Vicky to surrender
after Manickam Anna's death.

1812
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:21,803
Based on trust
I took money from Anbu Anna.

1813
01:42:21,921 --> 01:42:24,312
And I was waiting for the news
of his surrender.

1814
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:25,869
But news of Anbu Anna's death
was on TV.

1815
01:42:26,038 --> 01:42:26,961
I was confused.

1816
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:28,213
On that evening...

1817
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:31,429
I asked you to surrender in court.
Where were you?

1818
01:42:31,727 --> 01:42:32,451
The money isn't enough.

1819
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:34,288
What the heck?
I gave you five lakhs yesterday.

1820
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:35,913
I want twenty-five lakhs.

1821
01:42:36,211 --> 01:42:37,460
-Hey!
-Take your hands off.

1822
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,725
-I ought to. Come with me.
-Anna, let go of me.

1823
01:42:40,805 --> 01:42:42,554
-Take your hands off me.
-How dare you threaten me?

1824
01:42:43,177 --> 01:42:43,801
Anna!

1825
01:42:44,687 --> 01:42:46,052
Why are you beating me in vain?

1826
01:42:46,492 --> 01:42:47,937
What happened to you?

1827
01:42:48,148 --> 01:42:49,210
I asked you to surrender.

1828
01:42:49,999 --> 01:42:51,186
But you're planning to get me caught.

1829
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,264
I killed him.

1830
01:42:52,358 --> 01:42:54,342
All you did was throw away the knife,
and five lakhs isn't enough.

1831
01:42:54,602 --> 01:42:56,672
You stabbed a dead body...

1832
01:42:56,867 --> 01:42:59,330
and took the money to settle down.

1833
01:42:59,633 --> 01:43:00,695
What nonsense?

1834
01:43:01,005 --> 01:43:01,762
I'm not blabbering.

1835
01:43:05,084 --> 01:43:05,927
I'm telling the truth.

1836
01:43:06,077 --> 01:43:07,765
Before you stabbed Manickam...

1837
01:43:07,897 --> 01:43:09,765
he was bleeding through his ears
and his nose.

1838
01:43:09,859 --> 01:43:12,421
When I switched off the main board,
the killer stepped out.

1839
01:43:13,632 --> 01:43:15,773
I thought it was Manickam and hid.

1840
01:43:16,194 --> 01:43:17,514
Let's split it equally.

1841
01:43:17,789 --> 01:43:19,887
If not, I'll confess to the Police.

1842
01:43:20,679 --> 01:43:23,155
-Hey!
-It's hurting. Take off your hands.

1843
01:43:26,413 --> 01:43:28,442
If he goes to the Police,
I'll be in trouble.

1844
01:43:28,545 --> 01:43:29,544
So I killed him.

1845
01:43:29,577 --> 01:43:31,895
And buried him in the same land
as I was going to buy it.

1846
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:35,430
You did not see who killed Manickam.

1847
01:43:35,694 --> 01:43:37,073
Vicky told me he did.

1848
01:43:37,204 --> 01:43:38,328
And you killed Vicky.

1849
01:43:39,086 --> 01:43:40,612
Evidence points toward Vicky.

1850
01:43:40,813 --> 01:43:42,266
Then who killed Manickam?

1851
01:43:42,461 --> 01:43:44,461
You arrested a man who
took money to kill Manickam.

1852
01:43:44,571 --> 01:43:46,125
But he fabricated evidence
on someone else.

1853
01:43:46,274 --> 01:43:47,914
On top of it, you claim
the pattern is of old killers from prison.

1854
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,289
I, too, have the same confusion.

1855
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:50,633
We will have clarity
once we go to Puzhal prison.

1856
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:52,656
You don't have to do anything.

1857
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,250
What is the name of the deceased boy?

1858
01:43:54,672 --> 01:43:55,414
Vigneshwar.

1859
01:43:56,172 --> 01:43:57,992
File a FIR on him in that murder case.

1860
01:43:58,165 --> 01:44:00,031
Hereafter, don't interfere in
Anbu and Manickam's case.

1861
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:03,677
I will investigate this case.

1862
01:44:13,227 --> 01:44:16,648
Madam, if the DSP knows it,
we'll be in trouble.

1863
01:44:16,891 --> 01:44:19,141
I can't sit ducks and watch people die.

1864
01:44:24,649 --> 01:44:25,461
-Rishi?
-Yes, sir.

1865
01:44:25,515 --> 01:44:27,515
You can't interrogate him.
He's deaf and dumb.

1866
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,461
-Is Rishi deaf and dumb?
-Yes!

1867
01:44:29,797 --> 01:44:30,969
Also, we don't have a translator.

1868
01:44:32,062 --> 01:44:36,463
Sir, the previous murders occurred
in deaf and dumb David's pattern.

1869
01:44:36,578 --> 01:44:38,369
If Rishi is deaf and dumb...

1870
01:44:38,578 --> 01:44:40,297
it does not sound like a coincidence.

1871
01:44:40,928 --> 01:44:43,791
Sir, what's the count of deaf
and dumb prisoners in this prison?

1872
01:44:44,289 --> 01:44:46,112
-How many?
-There are four prisoners.

1873
01:44:46,968 --> 01:44:49,393
Sir, can I interrogate all four?

1874
01:44:49,626 --> 01:44:51,240
Only then can I get a lead on the case.

1875
01:44:51,286 --> 01:44:52,698
-Please!
-All four, you say?

1876
01:44:53,038 --> 01:44:54,639
I'll arrange a translator.

1877
01:44:54,735 --> 01:44:55,852
Just fifteen minutes.

1878
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:57,376
Okay, let's go.

1879
01:45:08,415 --> 01:45:12,268
Ask them if they have shared their
killing patterns with someone else.

1880
01:45:21,054 --> 01:45:22,361
Are they kidding us?

1881
01:45:22,584 --> 01:45:25,069
If they don't speak the truth,
I'll whack them.

1882
01:45:25,956 --> 01:45:26,918
Come on, translate it.

1883
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:42,922
I'm talking.
How dare you walk away?

1884
01:45:42,969 --> 01:45:44,219
Madam, what are you doing?

1885
01:45:44,508 --> 01:45:45,196
Come over here.

1886
01:45:45,852 --> 01:45:47,547
How could you beat a prisoner
in the name of interrogation?

1887
01:45:47,867 --> 01:45:49,446
This is not a Police station.

1888
01:45:49,891 --> 01:45:51,759
-You don't have proper permission.
-What else do you expect?

1889
01:45:52,023 --> 01:45:54,062
All the murders happening outside
are of their pattern.

1890
01:45:54,383 --> 01:45:55,387
They're lying.

1891
01:45:59,735 --> 01:46:01,885
Madam, they want their advocates
to come over.

1892
01:46:02,032 --> 01:46:03,430
They won't speak to us, sir.

1893
01:46:03,531 --> 01:46:04,882
Tomorrow morning, Thilagan will return.

1894
01:46:04,967 --> 01:46:05,879
Once he's here, we'll do it.

1895
01:46:07,155 --> 01:46:07,955
Thilagan?

1896
01:46:08,978 --> 01:46:10,844
-Parole prisoner Thilagan?
-Yes.

1897
01:46:10,984 --> 01:46:12,494
He is their translator.

1898
01:46:27,659 --> 01:46:28,581
-Madam...
-Sir, one minute.

1899
01:46:28,657 --> 01:46:29,133
Hold on!

1900
01:46:30,379 --> 01:46:31,825
-Madam, wait.
-Step aside.

1901
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:41,239
Sir, tell them he's been
murdering people outside.

1902
01:46:47,042 --> 01:46:49,806
No! They consider him as a God.

1903
01:46:51,167 --> 01:46:53,378
They consider a wife killer a God.

1904
01:46:58,355 --> 01:47:00,971
If you wish to save a life...

1905
01:47:01,878 --> 01:47:03,956
you will pray to God, right?

1906
01:47:04,338 --> 01:47:06,916
If that's the case,
for his people, he is...

1907
01:47:07,641 --> 01:47:08,430
...God!

1908
01:47:27,013 --> 01:47:28,102
Dinesh, come!

1909
01:47:28,169 --> 01:47:29,895
Watch out. Sit down.

1910
01:47:30,329 --> 01:47:32,618
-Anna, please come here.
-Hurry up!

1911
01:47:32,649 --> 01:47:33,662
Don't worry. We're here.

1912
01:47:35,403 --> 01:47:36,554
Nurse, over here.

1913
01:47:36,974 --> 01:47:39,002
Only your hand is hurt.
Don't worry.

1914
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:40,491
Nurse, please come.

1915
01:47:41,136 --> 01:47:42,975
Please call for a Doctor or a nurse.

1916
01:47:43,031 --> 01:47:45,382
-What?
-I'm dying in pain.

1917
01:47:45,428 --> 01:47:46,135
I am sorry.

1918
01:47:47,202 --> 01:47:48,702
Hello, I've been calling you.

1919
01:47:51,293 --> 01:47:52,979
It's not that important now.

1920
01:47:54,828 --> 01:47:57,770
The patient out there
is suffering in pain.

1921
01:48:05,271 --> 01:48:06,009
What?

1922
01:48:06,096 --> 01:48:08,250
Hello, you were distracted
and blaming me.

1923
01:48:08,305 --> 01:48:10,527
Thilagan, why are you yelling?
What happened?

1924
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,591
Who is that girl?

1925
01:48:11,628 --> 01:48:13,994
I kept calling her.
But she was doing other work.

1926
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,618
Let me go and complain to Father.

1927
01:48:15,704 --> 01:48:16,791
Hey, stop right there.

1928
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,689
Father appointed her as the nurse.

1929
01:48:19,459 --> 01:48:20,715
That girl is deaf and dumb.

1930
01:48:25,404 --> 01:48:26,185
Okay, sister.

1931
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:27,494
-Are you serious?
-Yes!

1932
01:48:27,702 --> 01:48:29,967
She is Sister Mary's daughter.

1933
01:48:30,491 --> 01:48:32,741
She aspired to be a nurse like her mother.

1934
01:48:32,773 --> 01:48:35,237
And with a lot of difficulties,
she's here on a special appointment.

1935
01:48:35,328 --> 01:48:36,546
She's a very good girl.

1936
01:48:45,929 --> 01:48:48,288
Don't you know to call me
on arrival?

1937
01:48:49,029 --> 01:48:51,338
Oh, I did not call you.

1938
01:48:54,756 --> 01:48:56,239
If you click this switch...

1939
01:48:56,727 --> 01:48:58,132
the light over there will come on.

1940
01:48:58,476 --> 01:49:00,093
Only then I will know.

1941
01:49:00,897 --> 01:49:01,482
Oh!

1942
01:49:03,537 --> 01:49:04,255
Understood?

1943
01:49:10,630 --> 01:49:12,927
Okay. Come on, we have to
discharge patient number 4.

1944
01:49:12,998 --> 01:49:15,005
We have a lot of work.
Please take him home.

1945
01:49:15,076 --> 01:49:16,560
Come on, son. Let's go.

1946
01:49:16,646 --> 01:49:17,630
We have work to do.

1947
01:49:17,997 --> 01:49:20,356
-Oh, so you've fallen...
-Yeah!

1948
01:49:20,802 --> 01:49:22,193
Is Nurse Mary married?

1949
01:49:22,896 --> 01:49:25,403
She's the proof that Mary was married.

1950
01:49:25,607 --> 01:49:27,669
Sorry, I meant,
is this nurse married?

1951
01:49:27,787 --> 01:49:30,074
-She's not married.
-She will be soon.

1952
01:49:36,544 --> 01:49:38,646
Akka, how do I apologize to her?

1953
01:49:38,951 --> 01:49:40,661
To others like this.

1954
01:49:41,028 --> 01:49:43,802
But to her, you can hug her.

1955
01:49:43,896 --> 01:49:45,434
So hug it is.

1956
01:49:45,553 --> 01:49:46,771
Go ahead.

He escaped from there.
But we'll kill him here.

1991
01:53:46,957 --> 01:53:49,066
-Kathir?
-Anna, they're going to kill me.

1992
01:53:49,214 --> 01:53:51,057
-Please save me.
-Kathir, don't panic.

1993
01:53:51,386 --> 01:53:53,605
-Where are you?
-I'm near Periyar Salai junction.

1994
01:53:53,722 --> 01:53:54,596
Please come soon.

1995
01:53:54,776 --> 01:53:56,502
Don't fear. Call the Police.

1996
01:53:56,668 --> 01:53:58,064
It's the Police who asked to kill me.

1997
01:53:59,051 --> 01:54:00,417
I'll be there in ten minutes.

1998
01:54:03,957 --> 01:54:06,183
Hey, you won't bear hunger.
Please eat something.

1999
01:54:06,301 --> 01:54:07,105
Ma, it's an emergency.

2000
01:54:07,277 --> 01:54:09,808
-He ran in here.
-Hey, go and look for him.

2001
01:54:12,957 --> 01:54:14,089
Hey, look inside it.

2002
01:54:16,512 --> 01:54:17,136
Kathir!

2003
01:54:19,692 --> 01:54:21,783
Hey, Kathir! Kathir!

2004
01:54:22,151 --> 01:54:22,914
Switch on the lights.

2005
01:54:23,043 --> 01:54:23,737
Look properly.

2006
01:54:33,028 --> 01:54:33,496
Get up!

2007
01:54:34,256 --> 01:54:34,723
Anna!

2008
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:39,122
Hey!

2009
01:54:42,794 --> 01:54:44,294
The inspector wants your signature.

2010
01:54:44,519 --> 01:54:46,658
So, it would be best
if you wrote it yourself.

2011
01:54:48,309 --> 01:54:50,978
-Sir...
-I didn't ask you for your wealth.

2012
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:53,434
-I asked for a suicide note.
-Sir, please, sir.

2013
01:54:53,628 --> 01:54:55,628
Hurry up.
The train is about to arrive.

2014
01:54:56,338 --> 01:54:57,650
Sir, please leave me.

2015
01:54:57,754 --> 01:54:59,042
The hell don't you hear me?

2016
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:00,463
-Sir!
-Hey!

2017
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:02,598
What are you doing?

2018
01:55:04,299 --> 01:55:05,197
Hey, step aside.

2019
01:55:06,087 --> 01:55:07,731
-Oh, no!
-Please save me.

2020
01:55:07,966 --> 01:55:09,725
Hey, who are you?

2021
01:55:10,122 --> 01:55:11,317
Ambulance driver!

2022
01:55:11,522 --> 01:55:13,779
Hey, two of you,
go and bring me the stretcher.

2023
01:55:13,835 --> 01:55:14,537
Hurry up!

2024
01:55:14,733 --> 01:55:16,842
Don't panic.
The hospital is nearby.

2025
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:20,209
Hey, you guys are standing like statues.

2026
01:55:20,348 --> 01:55:21,668
He's bleeding.

2027
01:55:21,786 --> 01:55:23,333
It's us who made him bleed.

2028
01:55:23,941 --> 01:55:26,067
We have many here,
and we'll take blood from them.

2029
01:55:26,418 --> 01:55:27,459
I ought to hack you.

2030
01:55:27,505 --> 01:55:27,942
Hey!

2031
01:55:29,997 --> 01:55:31,899
I'll stab him to death,
and you can take him.

2032
01:55:36,075 --> 01:55:38,372
I'll take him.
I dare you to stab him.

2033
01:55:52,198 --> 01:55:54,137
My septum broke.

2034
01:55:54,675 --> 01:55:55,871
Hey, don't be a child.

2035
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:59,434
You're freaking too old
to be whining like this.

2036
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:03,420
What happened?

2037
01:56:03,795 --> 01:56:05,021
I can't breathe.

2038
01:56:05,342 --> 01:56:06,896
You got cramps, that's it.

2039
01:56:06,982 --> 01:56:07,895
It's not like you're dead.

2040
01:56:08,082 --> 01:56:09,043
Inhale and exhale ten times.

2041
01:56:10,834 --> 01:56:11,349
Come on!

2042
01:56:36,037 --> 01:56:37,795
-Usha!
-Usha?

2043
01:56:37,867 --> 01:56:39,716
When you get hurt,
people shout, "Amma."

2044
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:43,126
Sir, it's been only a week
since my wedding.

2045
01:56:43,264 --> 01:56:45,654
Oh, God! You should've told me.

2046
01:56:45,725 --> 01:56:46,670
I'm really sorry.

2047
01:56:46,716 --> 01:56:48,308
Heel jump. Heel jump.

2048
01:56:48,379 --> 01:56:49,434
Keep doing it.

2049
01:57:08,942 --> 01:57:11,288
Local hospitals won't work
for you; only Puttur will.

2050
01:57:11,965 --> 01:57:12,785
Go!

2051
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:17,567
Let's go.

2052
01:57:18,309 --> 01:57:18,949
Hey!

2053
01:57:20,567 --> 01:57:22,238
What's wrong with you?
Oh, wheezing!

2054
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:25,658
I dare you to go past me.

2055
01:57:34,151 --> 01:57:36,457
Six stitches, and don't take
a head bath for three days.

2056
01:57:42,127 --> 01:57:44,220
-What happened, Doctor?
-What's wrong with you?

2057
01:57:44,475 --> 01:57:45,789
Take him to a Government hospital.

2058
01:57:45,861 --> 01:57:47,541
Doctor, I have to travel
ten more kilometers for it.

2059
01:57:47,635 --> 01:57:49,715
-You give him first aid.
-You're an ambulance driver.

2060
01:57:49,790 --> 01:57:50,899
To you, all cases are the same.

2061
01:57:51,023 --> 01:57:52,827
If he dies, I'll be in trouble.

2062
01:57:52,904 --> 01:57:53,725
I can't do it.

2063
01:57:54,686 --> 01:57:56,291
-Where is Jenny?
-Over there.

2064
01:57:58,132 --> 01:57:59,437
He's not going to live.

2065
01:57:59,583 --> 01:58:00,503
No one should attend to him.

2066
01:58:00,555 --> 01:58:01,164
Okay, sir.

2067
01:58:15,528 --> 01:58:16,442
What did you tell her?

2068
01:58:18,122 --> 01:58:20,362
It's our duty to save lives.

2069
01:58:21,274 --> 01:58:24,485
I can't lose a life to save my job.

2070
01:58:25,393 --> 01:58:27,763
Sir, you go ahead and
prescribe diabetes medicine.

2071
01:58:32,706 --> 01:58:33,362
Oh, God!

2072
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:40,135
It's hurting!

2073
01:58:48,517 --> 01:58:51,251
I and inspector Nagalingam's sister
are in love.

2074
01:58:51,955 --> 01:58:52,944
We belong to different castes.

2075
01:58:53,541 --> 01:58:56,306
They called me to speak about marriage.

2076
01:58:56,678 --> 01:58:57,701
I trusted them and went to
meet them.

2077
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:02,554
There, Nagalingam and Manickam
threaten me.

2078
01:59:02,832 --> 01:59:05,146
He beat his sister
right in front of my eyes.

2079
01:59:05,211 --> 01:59:06,929
-I ought to!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

2080
01:59:07,428 --> 01:59:09,476
Bloody! Hey, Kathir!

2081
01:59:09,782 --> 01:59:13,040
I did not mean to disrespect you
by eloping with your sister.

2082
01:59:13,845 --> 01:59:16,212
I intend to marry your sister
and lead a happy life.

2083
01:59:17,101 --> 01:59:18,610
If my sister elopes with you

2084
01:59:18,635 --> 01:59:20,368
-I would die of humiliation.
-Sir, please don't do it.

2085
01:59:20,822 --> 01:59:22,259
Just because we let you people
inside our town...

2086
01:59:22,384 --> 01:59:24,532
How dare you come and ask
my sister's hand in marriage?

2087
01:59:25,303 --> 01:59:27,969
As I was dating his sister,
he tried to kill me.

2088
01:59:28,141 --> 01:59:29,384
However, I managed to escape.

2089
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:30,829
And my brother came to my rescue.

2090
01:59:32,284 --> 01:59:35,120
Why file a case?
I'll try to convince the inspector.

2091
01:59:35,253 --> 01:59:37,830
Speaking to him won't kill
the caste fanatic in him.

2092
01:59:38,064 --> 01:59:43,258
There's more danger in Police's lathi
then the knife of a murderer.

2093
01:59:43,386 --> 01:59:46,073
Sir, please file a case.

2094
01:59:47,759 --> 01:59:48,368
Tell me.

2095
01:59:48,643 --> 01:59:49,517
Sir, the eyewitness,

2096
01:59:49,775 --> 01:59:51,126
the ambulance driver,
is very strict.

2097
01:59:51,253 --> 01:59:52,448
Speak like a Police officer.

2098
01:59:52,817 --> 01:59:53,899
What we file becomes a case.

2099
01:59:54,338 --> 01:59:55,767
Suppose it's just the boy
there are no issues.

2100
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:56,759
But there's a witness, too.

2101
01:59:56,862 --> 01:59:59,151
It's best to finish it within your station.

2102
01:59:59,268 --> 02:00:02,541
If not... do you expect me to
get my sister married to him?

2103
02:00:03,193 --> 02:00:03,953
I will kill him.

2104
02:00:04,839 --> 02:00:06,370
-Sir, don't act in haste.
-What do you expect?

2105
02:00:06,845 --> 02:00:08,752
In this case, you're A-1.

2106
02:00:09,103 --> 02:00:10,610
Then, the entire town will come to know.

2107
02:00:15,336 --> 02:00:17,820
The ambulance driver messed with us
without knowing our might.

2108
02:00:18,228 --> 02:00:19,261
Bear this in mind, Inspector.

2109
02:00:19,635 --> 02:00:22,330
If I see him, I'll bury him alive.

2110
02:00:22,549 --> 02:00:25,627
If something were to happen to him,
we three would be in prison.

2111
02:00:26,126 --> 02:00:28,768
Then Kathir will marry my sister
and live happily.

2112
02:00:28,886 --> 02:00:29,940
What do you suggest we do?

2113
02:00:32,064 --> 02:00:32,564
Wait!

2114
02:00:33,486 --> 02:00:34,744
-In some time...
-Listen...

2115
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:35,563
I'll handle it.

2116
02:00:35,744 --> 02:00:37,056
-Me?
-Yes, you. Come!

2117
02:00:37,573 --> 02:00:39,409
You go and have your meal.
I'll join you.

2118
02:00:41,566 --> 02:00:42,284
Tell me, sir.

2119
02:00:43,135 --> 02:00:45,915
We questioned the boy who interfered
in our sister's life

2120
02:00:45,996 --> 02:00:47,752
Why did you intervene in vain?

2121
02:00:49,215 --> 02:00:50,963
Sir, the Police can question a criminal.

2122
02:00:51,291 --> 02:00:53,291
But your methods are wrong, sir.

2123
02:00:53,799 --> 02:00:55,924
You're supporting him too much.

2124
02:00:56,192 --> 02:00:57,222
Is he your man?

2125
02:00:58,389 --> 02:01:00,154
-Sir, he's your sister's man.
-Hey!

2126
02:01:04,728 --> 02:01:05,813
Don't get worked up, sir.

2127
02:01:07,229 --> 02:01:10,370
Whoever calls in an emergency,
I'm their man.

2128
02:01:10,501 --> 02:01:14,177
Tomorrow, if you're in trouble,
I'll be your man.

2129
02:01:14,589 --> 02:01:15,721
Think about it, sir.

2130
02:01:16,394 --> 02:01:18,761
Both the boy and the girl
are pursuing medicine.

2131
02:01:18,854 --> 02:01:20,494
Why don't you get them married?

2132
02:01:21,127 --> 02:01:23,221
Just because they are both pursuing
medicine won't change the dynamics.

2133
02:01:24,035 --> 02:01:26,400
It won't be equal even if he
comes into a fortune.

2134
02:01:28,049 --> 02:01:31,353
You see, I have a pet dog at home...

2135
02:01:32,318 --> 02:01:33,388
I will touch that dog.

2136
02:01:34,213 --> 02:01:35,752
It was crawl on me and play with me.

2137
02:01:36,363 --> 02:01:38,149
It will try to cuddle, and I will, too.

2138
02:01:39,331 --> 02:01:43,166
That doesn't mean
I will share my plate with the dog.

2139
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:49,363
Hey, the caste has prevailed
since our ancestors.

2140
02:01:49,673 --> 02:01:51,966
A bunch like you
don't try to destroy it.

2141
02:01:52,307 --> 02:01:55,338
Caste indeed prevailed since our ancestors.

2142
02:01:55,939 --> 02:01:59,517
But it's not wrong to hope it will change
with our upcoming generations.

2143
02:02:00,519 --> 02:02:02,917
If a profession decides one's caste...

2144
02:02:03,386 --> 02:02:05,620
The boy and your sister are doctors.

2145
02:02:06,127 --> 02:02:10,228
If you believe that caste is
based on one's profession...

2146
02:02:10,464 --> 02:02:12,271
-You're a Police officer...
-Hey!

2147
02:02:14,843 --> 02:02:16,918
I was trying to level with you,
but you're going overboard.

2148
02:02:18,306 --> 02:02:20,157
Ten seconds are enough to scare you.

2149
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:27,195
Oh, no, ten seconds are up.

2150
02:02:29,916 --> 02:02:33,605
Don't scare a person
who wears death on his sleeve.

2151
02:02:34,409 --> 02:02:35,891
I can't help but laugh.

2152
02:02:39,121 --> 02:02:42,145
One more thing:
Someone said there's no caste...

2153
02:02:42,261 --> 02:02:44,512
Please don't go looking for
which caste he belonged to.

2154
02:02:55,075 --> 02:02:56,324
-Welcome.
-Anna, one tea.

2155
02:03:01,629 --> 02:03:05,340
-Hello!
-On Periyar road, an auto was arriving.

2156
02:03:06,926 --> 02:03:10,309
On the other side, a truck drove fast.

2157
02:03:15,746 --> 02:03:18,587
When I looked, it nicked the auto.

2158
02:03:20,629 --> 02:03:22,976
-Oh, no!
-The auto was crushed.

2159
02:03:23,179 --> 02:03:24,934
Poor thing,
there was a girl inside the auto.

2160
02:03:25,097 --> 02:03:27,487
-I hope she's not badly hurt.
-No, no!

2161
02:03:28,161 --> 02:03:29,546
People around came for help.

2162
02:03:29,614 --> 02:03:30,631
Hold his hand. Pull him up.

2163
02:03:31,967 --> 02:03:33,526
I'm going to give you ten seconds...

2164
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:37,028
No, just in one second...

2165
02:03:38,957 --> 02:03:39,973
Shall I instill fear in you?

2166
02:03:42,332 --> 02:03:43,699
The girl can't speak.

2167
02:03:47,857 --> 02:03:48,410
She's a mute.

2168
02:03:50,134 --> 02:03:52,068
Don't be in haste,
and listen to the story.

2169
02:03:53,934 --> 02:03:56,280
Once they realized
that girl is your wife...

2170
02:03:57,122 --> 02:04:01,098
A mustache man brought a big knife...

2171
02:04:07,184 --> 02:04:08,356
...and stabbed her in the stomach.

2172
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,191
Hey, Nagalingam. Nagalingam!

2173
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:22,552
Your wife is lying alone on the road.

2174
02:04:22,958 --> 02:04:24,207
You're an ambulance driver, right?

2175
02:04:24,458 --> 02:04:26,868
Don't you know every second you waste
is losing a life?

2176
02:04:27,339 --> 02:04:29,088
The fire may or may not burn you.

2177
02:04:30,012 --> 02:04:31,074
But the caste will burn you!

2178
02:04:49,443 --> 02:04:50,380
Jenny!

2179
02:04:57,794 --> 02:04:58,364
Jenny!

2180
02:05:06,606 --> 02:05:07,238
Jenny!

2181
02:05:08,373 --> 02:05:09,067
Jenny!

2182
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:22,020
You can't go to the hospital.
Heavy traffic.

2183
02:05:44,090 --> 02:05:44,684
Hey, come on!

2184
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:46,173
Hey, throw it on the windshield.

2185
02:05:47,771 --> 02:05:48,982
-Hit it hard.
-Do it!

2186
02:05:58,138 --> 02:05:59,095
Why is he glaring at us?

2187
02:06:00,010 --> 02:06:00,853
Yeah, right!

2188
02:06:07,197 --> 02:06:08,262
Hey, break the glass.

2189
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,723
Hey, keep reversing!

2190
02:06:16,855 --> 02:06:17,854
Go! Go! Go! Go!

2191
02:06:19,028 --> 02:06:20,410
Turn around. Turn it around.

2192
02:06:25,221 --> 02:06:26,150
Come on!

2193
02:06:29,687 --> 02:06:30,218
Jenny!

2194
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:44,514
Drive!

2195
02:06:45,363 --> 02:06:46,104
Drive faster!

2196
02:06:49,749 --> 02:06:51,702
-Go near him.
-Throw the bottle.

2197
02:06:53,796 --> 02:06:54,866
Don't spare him!

2198
02:06:56,570 --> 02:06:57,546
Stop the vehicle!

2199
02:06:58,023 --> 02:06:59,015
I said, stop it!

2200
02:06:59,374 --> 02:07:00,702
Hey, stop it!

2201
02:07:00,891 --> 02:07:02,891
Don't let him get away.

2202
02:07:26,624 --> 02:07:27,257
Jenny!

2203
02:08:04,467 --> 02:08:05,295
Doctor!

2204
02:08:06,552 --> 02:08:07,515
Doctor!

2205
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:08,174
Jenny!

2206
02:08:09,223 --> 02:08:09,730
Doctor!

2207
02:08:12,132 --> 02:08:12,741
Jenny...

2208
02:08:14,348 --> 02:08:15,051
Jenny!

2209
02:08:17,757 --> 02:08:18,512
Please save her.

2210
02:08:19,699 --> 02:08:20,394
Jenny!

2211
02:08:21,153 --> 02:08:21,746
Jenny....

2212
02:08:24,339 --> 02:08:25,464
Hey, let me be inside.

2213
02:08:41,125 --> 02:08:43,391
Doctor, is Jenny is doing well?

2214
02:08:43,804 --> 02:08:45,038
I'm sure she's fine.

2215
02:08:45,464 --> 02:08:47,347
I have a track record of no casualties.

2216
02:08:47,382 --> 02:08:49,155
Till today,
nothing has happened to anyone.

2217
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,391
You, too, have mentioned it.

2218
02:08:50,489 --> 02:08:52,771
That I'm a lucky charm.

2219
02:08:55,257 --> 02:08:56,710
Doctor, why aren't you saying anything?

2220
02:08:57,633 --> 02:08:59,203
Akka, did she call for me?

2221
02:08:59,703 --> 02:09:01,907
-Only I know the sign language...
-Thilagan.

2222
02:09:02,922 --> 02:09:05,140
She died on the way in the ambulance.

2223
02:09:05,875 --> 02:09:07,875
Had you brought her
a few minutes earlier...

2224
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:09,072
we could've saved her.

2225
02:09:12,047 --> 02:09:12,882

2244
02:10:55,202 --> 02:10:58,163
-Thilaga, come with me.
-What happened?

2245
02:10:58,305 --> 02:10:59,977
-Come with me.
-Sir, what happened?

2246
02:11:00,242 --> 02:11:01,828
-I'll explain.
-Tell me what happened.

2247
02:11:01,961 --> 02:11:03,265
I said I'll explain. Keep walking.

2248
02:11:03,336 --> 02:11:05,070
-Sir, what are you doing?
-Take the child.

2249
02:11:05,181 --> 02:11:06,360
-Come!
-Sir, what happened?

2250
02:11:06,385 --> 02:11:07,494
What happened?
Please tell me what happened.

2251
02:11:07,579 --> 02:11:08,899
Where are you taking him?

2252
02:11:09,031 --> 02:11:11,538
What happened?
Where are you taking him?

2253
02:11:11,617 --> 02:11:13,617
-What happened, sir?
-What happened?

2254
02:11:13,642 --> 02:11:15,079
Malar! Malar!

2255
02:11:16,423 --> 02:11:17,240
Thilaga!

2256
02:11:17,286 --> 02:11:19,203
A-1 accused, Thilaga Varman...

2257
02:11:19,429 --> 02:11:22,757
as his wife, Jennifer
had an affair with Kathir,

2258
02:11:22,952 --> 02:11:26,320
on 14-01-2005, 11:00 p.m.

2259
02:11:26,453 --> 02:11:28,742
killed them both with a knife.

2260
02:11:28,828 --> 02:11:31,249
And put up an act to save her
by taking her to the hospital.

2261
02:11:31,351 --> 02:11:33,421
It has been proved
with substantial evidence.

2262
02:11:33,563 --> 02:11:36,117
As per Section - 302

2263
02:11:36,273 --> 02:11:40,344
The court sentenced Thilaga Varman
to a life sentence.

2264
02:11:43,633 --> 02:11:46,398
He was accused of killing the person
he saved.

2265
02:11:46,836 --> 02:11:48,148
They killed his wife.

2266
02:11:48,749 --> 02:11:50,374
And pinned the murder on him.

2267
02:11:50,594 --> 02:11:51,727
As if that was not enough...

2268
02:11:51,913 --> 02:11:54,092
you're accusing him of
again committing a murder.

2269
02:11:56,266 --> 02:11:57,937
Now tell me... is he a murderer?

2270
02:11:58,117 --> 02:11:58,965
Is he a murderer?

2271
02:12:01,009 --> 02:12:02,820
Back then,
maybe he was not a murderer.

2272
02:12:04,613 --> 02:12:06,575
But the current murders
were done by him.

2273
02:12:14,473 --> 02:12:16,551
When I see this road...

2274
02:12:16,888 --> 02:12:18,551
I get reminded of Annachi Wines.

2275
02:12:18,684 --> 02:12:20,592
I have picked a place outback.

2276
02:12:47,192 --> 02:12:48,098
Who is it?

2277
02:12:50,222 --> 02:12:51,197
Who are you?

2278
02:12:57,707 --> 02:12:59,761
Hey... it's you!

2279
02:13:01,005 --> 02:13:03,479
Oh, did they release you
from the prison?

2280
02:13:04,457 --> 02:13:07,284
You drove an ambulance
to save the people.

2281
02:13:07,621 --> 02:13:10,089
But you could not save your wife.

2282
02:13:10,629 --> 02:13:11,973
You lost your life.

2283
02:13:12,293 --> 02:13:13,692
You lost your wife.

2284
02:13:13,824 --> 02:13:15,191
You lost everything.

2285
02:13:15,377 --> 02:13:16,908
At least save yourself.

2286
02:13:17,223 --> 02:13:18,597
Get out of here.

2287
02:13:23,957 --> 02:13:25,371
Why did you tie me up?

2288
02:13:25,933 --> 02:13:26,835
What are you going to do?

2289
02:13:27,762 --> 02:13:29,004
What are you going to do?

2290
02:13:38,056 --> 02:13:40,557
You demand pure caste blood.

2291
02:13:43,098 --> 02:13:44,691
Now you will witness it.

2292
02:13:47,013 --> 02:13:48,788
Hey, stop it!

2293
02:13:49,090 --> 02:13:50,879
I can't take this sound.
Stop it!

2294
02:13:51,136 --> 02:13:53,865
Hey, please stop!

2295
02:14:01,031 --> 02:14:02,905
Hey, don't do it!

2296
02:14:53,502 --> 02:14:54,017
Anna...

2297
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,602
Let's have a couple of last drinks.

2298
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:59,642
Don't say no.

2299
02:15:00,644 --> 02:15:02,336
Tonight, your parole ends.

2300
02:15:19,664 --> 02:15:20,344
Tell me, madam.

2301
02:15:20,391 --> 02:15:23,453
Sir, fourteen years ago,
you filed an FIR on Thilagan...

2302
02:15:23,836 --> 02:15:24,976
is now out on parole.

2303
02:15:26,288 --> 02:15:27,413
Do you remember, sir?

2304
02:15:28,098 --> 02:15:31,684
We suspect him to be the murderer
of Manickam and Anbazhagan.

2305
02:15:32,414 --> 02:15:35,845
Tell me the name of the inspector
whose sister Kathir was in love with.

2306
02:15:36,132 --> 02:15:37,077
You see...

2307
02:15:37,149 --> 02:15:39,312
Only if you tell me
can I alert that person?

2308
02:15:39,726 --> 02:15:40,671
Please understand, sir.

2309
02:15:41,257 --> 02:15:44,574
It's your DSP Nagalingam.

2310
02:15:45,163 --> 02:15:47,636
Back then, I was an ordinary SI.
That's why I couldn't...

2311
02:16:02,117 --> 02:16:04,012
-Madam, how come you're here?
-Please sit down.

2312
02:16:17,367 --> 02:16:19,444
Have it before it gets cold.

2313
02:16:26,077 --> 02:16:27,863
Nagalingam!

2314
02:16:34,610 --> 02:16:35,390
Super!

2315
02:16:37,781 --> 02:16:39,211
The tea is fantastic.

2316
02:16:39,344 --> 02:16:40,719
Shall I get you one cup?

2317
02:16:44,009 --> 02:16:44,891
I appreciate your courage.

2318
02:16:45,252 --> 02:16:47,828
But only tonight is left.

2319
02:16:49,297 --> 02:16:51,945
The Police have surrounded
your house.

2320
02:16:53,407 --> 02:16:54,930
At dawn, your parole ends.

2321
02:16:55,289 --> 02:16:59,583
I won't let you go past me and do it.

2322
02:17:09,078 --> 02:17:10,890
After the car did the rounds,
I will be back here.

2323
02:17:11,007 --> 02:17:13,296
Until then, Thilagan should not
leave the house.

2324
02:17:13,351 --> 02:17:14,085
Okay, madam.

2325
02:17:14,125 --> 02:17:16,038
-You two guard this gate.
-Okay, madam.

2326
02:17:16,116 --> 02:17:18,968
And constable, you stand guard
near the verandah.

2327
02:17:20,914 --> 02:17:21,882
-Ratnam...
-Madam!

2328
02:17:22,054 --> 02:17:22,820
you go to the backside.

2329
02:17:22,851 --> 02:17:24,390
We'll play after dinner.

2330
02:17:24,687 --> 02:17:26,147
Shall I be inside the house on alert?

2331
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:28,421
We had enough of your "On alert."

2332
02:17:28,508 --> 02:17:30,046
Please don't show me your face
for a month.

2333
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:32,210
I was planning to apply for
one month of medical leave.

2334
02:17:32,289 --> 02:17:32,750
What?

2335
02:17:33,395 --> 02:17:35,505
I'll get you oil from Velankanni.
I'm certain!

2336
02:17:35,585 --> 02:17:36,715
I'll WhatsApp you my leave letter.

2337
02:17:39,461 --> 02:17:40,054
-Abdul!
-Sir!

2338
02:17:40,179 --> 02:17:41,858
-Ask the battalions to be on alert.
-Okay, sir.

2339
02:17:41,937 --> 02:17:43,280
-In the morning, bring back the rope.
-Okay, sir.

2340
02:17:43,460 --> 02:17:44,359
-Kumaravel!
-Sir?

2341
02:17:44,569 --> 02:17:46,264
Check if all the roads are blocked.

2342
02:17:46,367 --> 02:17:46,804
Sir!

2343
02:17:47,702 --> 02:17:48,941
Are you here to worship the car?

2344
02:17:50,795 --> 02:17:53,162
No, sir. I was investigating
Manickam's case.

2345
02:17:53,477 --> 02:17:55,039
I told you not to investigate that case.

2346
02:17:55,451 --> 02:17:58,091
Sir, it's not safe for you to be here.

2347
02:17:59,311 --> 02:17:59,842
What?

2348
02:18:00,538 --> 02:18:02,084
After Manickam and Anbazhagan...

2349
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:03,952
you're the next target.

2350
02:18:05,530 --> 02:18:06,709
Were you dreaming?

2351
02:18:06,835 --> 02:18:08,639
I'm telling you
after a thorough investigation.

2352
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:10,655
The car has left.
Everyone be on alert.

2353
02:18:10,726 --> 02:18:12,366
Follow the instructions on the walkie.

2354
02:18:13,062 --> 02:18:13,695
Go ahead!

2355
02:18:14,022 --> 02:18:15,232
His name is Thilagan.

2356
02:18:21,272 --> 02:18:23,514
-What name did you say?
-Ambulance driver Thilaga Varman.

2357
02:18:23,843 --> 02:18:26,304
Fourteen years ago, he was
incriminated for his wife's murder...

2358
02:18:26,601 --> 02:18:28,569
Manickam, Anbazhagan, you...

2359
02:18:28,695 --> 02:18:31,337
Wait! Is he out of prison?

2360
02:18:31,508 --> 02:18:32,320
He's out on parole.

2361
02:18:32,451 --> 02:18:33,730
Tonight, his parole ends.

2362
02:18:33,866 --> 02:18:35,584
That's why I'm saying
you're not safe here.

2363
02:18:35,758 --> 02:18:38,211
-Abdul, what is your team doing?
-I can manage. You leave.

2364
02:18:38,795 --> 02:18:40,240
-Why is it crowded before the car?
-Sir...

2365
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:41,319
You may leave.

2366
02:18:42,186 --> 02:18:43,334
Clear the crowd.

2367
02:18:50,912 --> 02:18:53,064
-It's not possible in Kanchipuram.
-You're right, sir.

2368
02:18:53,142 --> 02:18:55,025
-I don't know...
-Everyone, please be on alert.

2369
02:18:57,109 --> 02:18:58,655
-Sir, Vanakkam.
-Where are you?

2370
02:18:58,921 --> 02:19:00,412
I'm here to shadow a paroled prisoner.

2371
02:19:00,664 --> 02:19:01,991
-Thilagan?
-Yes, sir.

2372
02:19:02,132 --> 02:19:04,108
-Do you have your gun?
-Yes, I do.

2373
02:19:04,421 --> 02:19:05,561
Listen closely.

2374
02:19:06,124 --> 02:19:08,616
The car is on rounds.
There will be the sound of crackers.

2375
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:11,827
Say he was trying to escape
and shoot him dead.

2376
02:19:12,146 --> 02:19:14,630
-Sir!
-You're shocked, as if it's new to you.

2377
02:19:15,381 --> 02:19:17,084
Finish the job.
You belong to my caste.

2378
02:19:17,171 --> 02:19:18,212
How long do you intend to remain SI?

2379
02:19:18,259 --> 02:19:19,610
As you say. I'll do it, sir.

2380
02:19:20,070 --> 02:19:22,335
But there are a couple
of our officers here, too.

2381
02:19:22,592 --> 02:19:24,329
Tell them I asked to go to car duty.

2382
02:19:24,468 --> 02:19:26,186
-Hey, Venkat, come over here.
-What is it?

2383
02:19:26,570 --> 02:19:28,062
DSP is yelling over the phone.

2384
02:19:28,187 --> 02:19:29,702
They're short on force near the car.

2385
02:19:29,804 --> 02:19:32,585
He's yelling why are there four shadows
for one paroled prisoner.

2386
02:19:32,882 --> 02:19:34,006
It's a complicated case.

2387
02:19:34,116 --> 02:19:35,396
I can't reason with him.

2388
02:19:35,828 --> 02:19:36,452
One

2389
02:19:36,783 --> 02:19:37,460
You go inside and hide.

2390
02:19:37,492 --> 02:19:38,093
Two

2391
02:19:38,383 --> 02:19:40,671
-Who will be here?
-I will be here.

2392
02:19:40,867 --> 02:19:42,116
I have a gun with me.
I can handle it.

2393
02:19:42,695 --> 02:19:43,366
Five

2394
02:20:13,116 --> 02:20:15,530
The carnival this year is crowded.

2395
02:20:15,765 --> 02:20:16,820
It's massive.

2396
02:20:17,219 --> 02:20:18,367
I thought of attending it.

2397
02:20:18,648 --> 02:20:19,847
There's too much chatter.

2398
02:20:19,974 --> 02:20:20,928
Sorry, Ma'am.

2399
02:20:34,499 --> 02:20:35,077
Hey!

2400
02:20:37,336 --> 02:20:38,348
Where's your uncle?

2401
02:20:38,445 --> 02:20:40,397
We're looking for him too.

2402
02:20:40,577 --> 02:20:42,865
If you find him,
we'll make him out.

2403
02:20:44,271 --> 02:20:46,921
Keep moving. Don't crowd.

2404
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:49,132
Ladies carrying lamps,
please watch out.

2405
02:20:49,262 --> 02:20:51,186
Dear God, save us all.

2406
02:20:51,211 --> 02:20:53,211
Come on! Keep it moving.

2407
02:20:53,288 --> 02:20:55,473
The crowd will keep getting large.
Don't be gawking out there.

2408
02:20:56,629 --> 02:20:59,241
Bloody morons. I'm yapping here,
but no one's answering.

2409
02:21:15,514 --> 02:21:16,546
Why are you still standing there?

2410
02:21:18,796 --> 02:21:22,361
Hey, ten Police at the main entrance
come to the live location of the car.

2411
02:21:23,256 --> 02:21:25,843
The car is jammed
and is not able to move.

2412
02:21:29,256 --> 02:21:29,719
Go!

2413
02:21:30,029 --> 02:21:31,983
MLA's wife is arriving
near the 2nd barricade.

2414
02:21:32,343 --> 02:21:33,100
Receiving sir.

2415
02:21:33,459 --> 02:21:35,201
Take the battalion and leave now.

2416
02:21:35,304 --> 02:21:36,046
-Sir!
-Go! Go!

2417
02:21:37,374 --> 02:21:37,865
Sir!

2418
02:21:49,241 --> 02:21:51,299
Why is everyone surrounding DSP?

2419
02:21:52,093 --> 02:21:52,733
Copy sir.

2420
02:21:53,264 --> 02:21:55,084
-Leave from there.
-Okay, sir.

2421
02:21:55,390 --> 02:21:55,834
Sir!

2422
02:22:08,750 --> 02:22:10,383
-Hey, what happened?
-Power cut, ma'am.

2423
02:22:20,905 --> 02:22:22,653
Give me the exact location
of the power cut.

2424
02:22:23,072 --> 02:22:24,866
The power is down at the car street.

2425
02:22:39,329 --> 02:22:40,657
Where did he go?

2426
02:22:42,783 --> 02:22:44,915
-Sir!
-What happened?

2427
02:22:45,025 --> 02:22:46,150
Sir, we're playing hide and seek.

2428
02:22:46,268 --> 02:22:48,376
-I'm looking for him.
-To hell with you.

2429
02:22:48,979 --> 02:22:49,572
Hang up!

2430
02:23:42,587 --> 02:23:43,189
Sir!

2431
02:23:45,024 --> 02:23:45,609
Sir!

2432
02:23:57,882 --> 02:23:58,360
Damn!

2433
02:24:39,435 --> 02:24:42,493
Hey, have you not learned
your lesson yet?

2434
02:24:42,931 --> 02:24:45,048
You will regret this for life.

2435
02:24:45,630 --> 02:24:46,571
Life?

2436
02:24:47,725 --> 02:24:49,735
Hereafter, I don't have a life!

2437
02:25:30,619 --> 02:25:31,635
Hey! Hey!

2438
02:25:31,923 --> 02:25:32,595
Don't do it.

2439
02:25:33,544 --> 02:25:34,204
Don't do it.

2440
02:25:44,728 --> 02:25:45,939
I can't hear you!

2441
02:25:49,282 --> 02:25:50,477
I can't hear you!

2442
02:26:01,977 --> 02:26:04,383
Sir! DSP, sir!

2443
02:26:07,070 --> 02:26:07,657
Sir!

2444
02:26:23,727 --> 02:26:26,783
Sir, sir. DSP, sir.

2445
02:26:33,914 --> 02:26:35,774
Hey, hurry up! Lift him.

2446
02:26:35,845 --> 02:26:36,618
Call for an ambulance.

2447
02:26:36,673 --> 02:26:38,751
Ambulance, reverse.

2448
02:26:40,345 --> 02:26:41,978
-Watch out.
-Please be careful.

2449
02:26:42,977 --> 02:26:44,204
Come on, drive!

2450
02:26:44,508 --> 02:26:45,469
Make way.

2451
02:26:48,884 --> 02:26:50,423
Check with the driver
which hospital he's taking him to.

2452
02:26:50,462 --> 02:26:51,602
Madam, Guru is with him.

2453
02:26:51,735 --> 02:26:53,218
-Then call Guru.
-Okay, madam.

2454
02:26:54,337 --> 02:26:55,751
Guru is coming in the car.

2455
02:26:58,845 --> 02:27:00,845
Hey, make way for the ambulance.

2456
02:27:00,939 --> 02:27:03,048
Hey, just now, one ambulance left.
Who called another one?

2457
02:27:03,142 --> 02:27:04,345
Who called for an ambulance?

2458
02:27:09,118 --> 02:27:10,860
Hey, it's The ambulance driver.

2459
02:27:26,368 --> 02:27:28,812
The woe of not being able to
voice out your pain...

2460
02:27:30,165 --> 02:27:31,581
Now, you must realize it.

2461
02:27:33,047 --> 02:27:35,050
My Jenny would've suffered similarly.

2462
02:27:38,458 --> 02:27:40,056
The way she struggled...

2463
02:27:40,286 --> 02:27:41,728
You, too, struggle and die.

2464
02:27:49,323 --> 02:27:50,931
Who asked you to leave the house?

2465
02:28:01,511 --> 02:28:04,262
-We must find Uncle soon.
-You're right.

2466
02:28:09,223 --> 02:28:10,267
-Go and close the gate.
-Okay, ma'am.

2467
02:28:10,313 --> 02:28:11,360
You go around and check.

2468
02:28:19,535 --> 02:28:20,464
What happened, madam?

2469
02:28:21,059 --> 02:28:22,926
Hey, how did you get here?

2470
02:28:23,393 --> 02:28:25,393
I was hiding inside.

2471
02:28:25,714 --> 02:28:26,769
Hiding?

2472
02:28:28,128 --> 02:28:29,355
Sir, too, saw me.

2473
02:28:29,730 --> 02:28:31,737
Yes, madam.
They were playing hide and seek.

2474
02:28:31,792 --> 02:28:32,924
I, too, was searching for him.

2475
02:28:33,292 --> 02:28:35,785
Yay, uncle is caught. He is here.

2476
02:28:35,988 --> 02:28:37,261
They found me.

2477
02:28:37,348 --> 02:28:39,223
You, please apply sacred ash
to your forehead.

2478
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:41,510
I meant, please take some sacred ash.

2479
02:28:42,458 --> 02:28:45,582
As I could not attend the carnival...

2480
02:28:46,767 --> 02:28:48,746
Also, the house is surrounded
by the Police.

2481
02:28:48,989 --> 02:28:51,284
So I bathed and prayed
inside the house.

2482
02:28:51,308 --> 02:28:53,260
Uncle, we looked for you everywhere.
Where were you?

2483
02:28:53,370 --> 02:28:55,119
Even the bald Police
was looking for you.

2484
02:28:55,232 --> 02:28:57,012
-Where were you?
-I'll tell you.

2485
02:28:57,052 --> 02:28:58,793
Tell me, uncle, where were you hiding?

2486
02:28:59,020 --> 02:28:59,535
Damn!

2487
02:29:05,105 --> 02:29:09,009
KANCHIPURAM DSP,
NAGALINGAM, MURDERED

2488
02:29:17,833 --> 02:29:20,215
-Take care of Malar.
-Malar is my daughter, too.

2489
02:29:22,325 --> 02:29:23,807
Thank you, uncle.

2490
02:29:24,058 --> 02:29:25,035
What's this uncle?

2491
02:29:25,211 --> 02:29:29,790
For your education,
I have deposited money in the bank.

2492
02:29:30,017 --> 02:29:31,263
Study well.

2493
02:29:35,355 --> 02:29:38,047
Velankanni, I may have caused you
trouble knowingly or unknowingly...

2494
02:29:38,096 --> 02:29:39,165
Let it be unknown to me.

2495
02:29:39,462 --> 02:29:41,462
I'll be happy that the uniform
was of use to you.

2496
02:29:43,985 --> 02:29:46,190
Mummy, hereafter, please send food
to the Police station.

2497
02:30:17,895 --> 02:30:21,941
Do you think it's right to avenge them
after so many years?

2498
02:30:23,510 --> 02:30:24,898
You ignore the one who causes harm.

2499
02:30:25,083 --> 02:30:28,583
It feels wrong when you say
not to avenge them.

2500
02:30:29,011 --> 02:30:31,760
But you can't even tell your daughter
how good a person you are.

2501
02:30:32,449 --> 02:30:33,705
That's your fate!

2502
02:30:34,254 --> 02:30:38,847
Have you heard the cries of
the daughters of the prisoners?

2503
02:30:39,551 --> 02:30:40,965
I have heard them inside the prison.

2504
02:30:41,341 --> 02:30:44,864
It's best that she thinks I'm evil
and stay happy

2505
02:30:45,051 --> 02:30:48,199
then to know that I'm good and be sad.

2506
02:30:48,684 --> 02:30:52,363
As a father, if my going to prison
brings her happiness...

2507
02:30:53,746 --> 02:30:56,784
I am ready to give her that happiness
until I'm dead.

2508
02:31:12,872 --> 02:31:14,591
Anna, someone is here to meet you.

2509
02:31:14,881 --> 02:31:16,483
I don't meet anyone.

2510
02:31:16,537 --> 02:31:19,082
Her name is Nandhini.
She's the Kanchipuram inspector.
