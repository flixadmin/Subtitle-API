1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,354
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,960
General Wade's
landing craft docked.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,599
<i>His convoy's
on the way here now.</i>

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,637
<i>Reunification day is today.</i>

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,155
- Captain Gordon.
- General, welcome to Gotham.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Incoming!

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,999
Get back!

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,998
(filtered breathing)

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,190
Eduardo.
What did Walker do to you?

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,509
Eduardo's dead, Jim.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,954
There is only Bane now.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,920
Everything I have done here
is about punishing Gotham

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,356
for the sins
of Bruce Wayne.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,669
I'm not leaving.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,035
And I don't
think I can

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,191
let you leave... either.

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,396
What are you doing?

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,994
(grunting)

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,913
Ra's al Ghul.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,839
This is revenge

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,876
for his death.

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
And who am I?

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,076
You're his daughter.

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,913
(grunting)

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,071
(shouting)

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,475
Barbara Kean.

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,835
Run!

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,116
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

29
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,078
I believe
you knew my father.

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,400
- Where's Nyssa?
- I don't know,

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,496
but she's planning
on using the military

32
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
to wipe out Gotham.

33
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:06,954
I can order them to stand down.

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
Then let's get you
out of here.

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,429
This is General Wade.

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,670
Begin your
bombing run

37
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,880
- on my order.
- Wait, wait.

38
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,519
(explosions in distance)

39
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,552
(helicopter blades whirring)

40
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,552
(indistinct chatter)

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,831
GORDON:
We need to get ahold of Barbara.

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,479
Nyssa al Ghul's coming for her.

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,040
The sooner she and Lee get back
here with the baby, the better.

44
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,656
LUCIUS: We got refugees coming
in from all over Gotham, Jim.

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,716
People are scared.

46
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,314
I know you're
not one to quit,

47
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,176
but if there was ever a time
to wave the white flag,

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
now is it.

49
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,273
Nyssa al Ghul doesn't want
to just conquer Gotham...

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,840
she wants to destroy it,

51
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,434
kill everyone she finds.

52
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,433
The only thing standing between
her and these people is us.

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,113
Gather the team.

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,793
Get every able-bodied refugee

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,554
down into the bunkers
beneath the GCPD.

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,950
Why do I get the feeling
he's concocting

57
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,396
an elaborate plan
to get us all killed?

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,359
Better gather up
these refugees.

59
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,993
Look at him.

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,238
The medics did everything
they could to stabilize him.

61
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,718
Now all we can do is wait.

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,110
This is my fault.

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,515
I sent him on this mission.

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,354
Alfred knew what he
was signing up for, Bruce.

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,397
We all did.

66
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,757
Nyssa and Bane
are coming after me and Barbara.

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,397
Coming after Gotham.

68
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,431
Because of what
we did to Ra's.

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,915
What you did was stop him.

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,560
Twice.

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,192
We'll stop his psycho
daughter together.

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,079
I'm sure you
recognize this knife.

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,914
You touch my baby,

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,520
and I will turn you
into a pile of ash,

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,313
just like I did your father.

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,871
A bit cruel, don't you think?

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,156
To let this little one
get too attached

78
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,674
when you won't be around

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,830
much longer.

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,195
(shudders)
Mmm.

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,953
(cooing)

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,396
Soon, you and Bruce Wayne

83
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,199
will see Gotham

84
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,513
and Jim Gordon's precious
Green Zone destroyed.

85
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,839
Then I'll allow you to die.

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,755
My father made his name
destroying empires.

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,639
Now it's my turn.

88
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,359
(panting)
Hello.

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,591
Listen to me.
There is a submarine

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,433
in the docks,
full of Gotham's gold.

91
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,590
It's yours.

92
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,751
Just leave the city.

93
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,399
Let me and my baby go.

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,518
(cooing)
No.

95
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,190
I think I'll keep
this little one

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,273
and raise her as my own.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,354
As an al Ghul.

98
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,920
(laughing)

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,072
I take it the army has landed.

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,919
They're just awaiting
my orders.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,992
Then what are you waiting for?

102
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,350
What a cute
little baby.

103
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,392
(indistinct chatter)

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,556
Wait, what?

105
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,552
You're ordering us to destroy
the Green Zone?

106
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,314
Anyone still in Gotham
is an enemy of the state.

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
I won't be party to the murder
of civilians, General.

108
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,234
Then you're relieved
of command.

109
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,079
The hell are you?

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,276
(filtered breathing)

111
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,714
I'm your new commander.

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,031
(snap)

113
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,870
Does anybody else have a problem
with the general's orders?

114
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,110
Good.

115
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,476
Let's get started.

116
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,916
♪♪♪♪

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,113
What's the matter?

118
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,114
Can we really be so cavalier
about the destruction of Gotham?

119
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,669
(sighs)
Let me think about that.

120
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,719
Yes!

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,518
(groans)

122
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,795
Damn it!

123
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,792
Oswald!

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,030
Where are you going?

125
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,713
Oswald!

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,917
This is my city,
and I will be damned

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,878
if I'm gonna let
those bastards take it!

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,394
I cannot let you do this.

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,800
You, of all people,

130
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,349
should want to stop
those monsters.

131
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,955
They forced you
to destroy Haven,

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,952
to murder hundreds
of innocent civilians.

133
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,077
You're just gonna let
'em get away with it?

134
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,719
I was kind of planning on it,
yeah.

135
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,914
Very well.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,151
I'm going to follow my heart.

137
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,990
Oswald!

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,439
You have been down
this road before.

139
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,393
Following your heart has
never worked out for you.

140
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,280
Perhaps.

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,914
But perhaps
you could learn something

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,117
if you listened
to <i>this</i>

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,998
instead of <i>this.</i>

144
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,914
I'm gonna miss you,

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,356
Edward.
(crying)

146
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,033
I'll miss you, too, Oswald.

147
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm not talking to you.

148
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,115
I'm talking to the...

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,554
God!

150
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,632
(chuckles)
Come on, baby.

151
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,393
All right.

152
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,516
Okay.

153
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,920
Good boy.

154
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,876
(panting)

155
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,440
Go with the man
in green.

156
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,755
(shuddering inhale)

157
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,718
You'll be safe.

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,793
Oswald, if you
walk off this dock,

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,678
I'm taking this submarine.
(sniffles, exhales)

160
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,672
And the treasure!

161
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,672
Nyssa al Ghul wants
to kill everyone in Gotham.

162
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,436
But, to get to us, the army has
to follow the Western Corridor.

163
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,680
That's where we make a stand.

164
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
We got a handful of men.

165
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,718
How are we gonna
take on an army?

166
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,792
We just have to slow
the army down long enough

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,156
to get General Wade out
from under Nyssa's control.

168
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,959
Then he can reverse
the invasion order.

169
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,278
We're trying
to reach the Sirens.

170
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,319
Still no luck.

171
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,232
All right. I'll go.

172
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
Jim.

173
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,976
I need to get Barbara
and Lee back here.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,136
I'll meet you at the barricades.
I know you haven't seen

175
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,675
your kid yet,
but the GCPD needs a leader,

176
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,240
and they're looking to you.

177
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,390
I'll go to Sirens.

178
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,119
Okay.

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,550
(siren wailing in distance)

180
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,636
You sure
you want to do this?

181
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,189
It doesn't take two of us
to track the general's signal.

182
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,590
And if Jim's making a stand,
that's where I should be.

183
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,909
Okay.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,071
Wayne Enterprises EMP,

185
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,800
smoke bombs,
signal jammers.

186
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,031
Not enough to even the odds,
but...

187
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,440
it may buy you some time.

188
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,159
What's this?

189
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,472
Ah. Remember
the Nightwing Project?

190
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,155
Portable, next-gen stealth tech.

191
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,039
Put it on any aircraft,
and it's invisible to radar.

192
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,240
But, unfortunately, it also
seems to serve as a beacon

193
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,357
to certain animals.

194
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,590
Never know.

195
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Might find a use for it.

196
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,199
Oswald, come in.

197
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,993
(chuckles)

198
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,879
Still have those eyes in
the back of your head, Jim.

199
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,633
No.
(sighs)

200
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,952
You just have
a remarkably recognizable odor.

201
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,720
Part dandy,
part snake.

202
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,871
After all these years,
it hasn't changed.

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Drink?

204
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,912
No, thank you.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,151
Dulls the senses.

206
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,640
That's what I was going for.

207
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,278
Surprised
you're still here.

208
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,397
Figured you'd be
long gone by now.

209
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,440
That storm you've warned me
about for so long,

210
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,631
it's finally here.

211
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,955
We've shared
some turbulent times, you and I.

212
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,952
That we have.

213
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,430
When you spared my life
on the pier that day,

214
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,989
banished me from Gotham,

215
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,549
that was the most lost
I've ever been.

216
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,994
(chuckles)

217
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,510
Because I was away
from the city, you see.

218
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,636
(chuckles)

219
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,235
It's part of me.

220
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,993
You know what I'm talking about,

221
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,719
because it's part
of you, too.

222
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,399
(chuckles)

223
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,994
Sure, I could escape...

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,150
with money, I might add...

225
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,152
but then what?

226
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,833
Stand on the shores
of the mainland

227
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,389
and watch the army burn it
to the ground?

228
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,075
Then watch tasteless
industrialists

229
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,914
and vapid politicians
rebuild it?

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
(chuckles)

231
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,753
No.

232
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,313
My life is etched on the walls
of every alley

233
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,517
and dirty warehouse here.

234
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,038
My blood lives
in its broken concrete.

235
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,433
I'm staying to fight.

236
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,839
For my legacy.

237
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,149
BULLOCK:
Hey.

238
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,016
The army just busted
through the GCPD checkpoint.

239
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,952
They're heading
to the barricades.

240
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,269
Bane's leading them.

241
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,396
How many men?

242
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,119
(sighs)
600, 700?

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,317
- Still want to fight?
- (gulps)

244
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,880
How many do we have?

245
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,879
Maybe 30?

246
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,779
(laughs)

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,359
Thirty-one.

248
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,896
Takes two men to pilot
that submarine, Oswald.

249
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
The dog can't do it.

250
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,150
(exhales)

251
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
Ditto on that blood
and concrete thing.

252
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,793
Kind of like this city
the way it is.

253
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,599
Shall we?

254
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,399
I believe
time is of the essence.

255
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,153
Gentlemen.

256
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,074
Remind me to talk to you
about that full pardon.

257
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,030
♪♪♪♪

258
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,073
Alvarez!

259
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,833
Harper, Bruce!

260
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,639
You take the left flank.

261
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,359
Harvey and I will
take the right.

262
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,671
Holy Mary, Mother and Joseph.

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,151
BANE:
Captain Gordon...

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,755
I always knew you had
a savior complex,

265
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,559
but this is too much.

266
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,916
What happened to you, Eduardo?

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,616
There was a time
when you would have been up

268
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,154
on these barricades with me.

269
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,110
Yes... but that was before
I found my true purpose.

270
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,556
Stand by.

271
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,240
Fire on my command.

272
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,437
Jim, it's a lot
of innocent soldiers

273
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,233
down there
just following orders.

274
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,829
Target Bane
and Nyssa's commandos.

275
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,956
Fire on my command.

276
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,714
For Gotham.

277
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,117
(groans)

278
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,112
SELINA:
Lee?

279
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,759
(gunfire in distance)

280
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,109
Selina.

281
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
Hey. Come on, we got
to get out of here.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,435
Where's Barbara
and the baby?

283
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,637
(exhales)
Nyssa al Ghul took them.

284
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,915
We have to tell Jim.

285
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,195
Yeah.

286
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,192
(gunfire continues)

287
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,480
The Narrows.

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,673
They never stood
a chance.

289
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,434
The ones who could
escaped to the GCPD.

290
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,796
Then that's where
I'm needed.

291
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,160
(grunts)

292
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,839
(grenade whistling)

293
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,314
- Target Jim Gordon.
- (grunts)

294
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,312
I'm sorry! I don't
think he can hear you

295
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,039
through the bullet
in his ear!

296
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,600
(groans)

297
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,834
Eddie!

298
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,480
(screaming)

299
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,711
They're only delaying
the inevitable.

300
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,431
Jim, that thing's
pointing right at us!

301
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,434
(groans)

302
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,079
BANE:
Go, go, go, go, go!

303
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,998
Find me Jim Gordon
and Bruce Wayne.

304
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,376
If the army gets through
the barricades,

305
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,616
they'll have a straight shot to
the GCPD and the people there.

306
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,757
We need to find another way
to slow them down.

307
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,433
I think I have a way.

308
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,016
GORDON: Gather all the ammunition
you can.

309
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,952
Fall back to the GCPD.

310
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,440
Go, go now!

311
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,636
Fall back!

312
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,518
We got to go.
(grunts)

313
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,471
Well, that was a disaster.

314
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,711
Come on, Oswald,
we have to keep moving.

315
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,759
Where? There's
nowhere to hide, Jim.

316
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,952
Wherever we go,
the army will find us.

317
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,096
<i>LUCIUS (over radio):
Get me Gordon.</i>

318
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,554
It's Lucius.

319
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,536
Tell me you were able
to track the general's signal.

320
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,756
It's coming from City Hall,
but there's a problem.

321
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,354
Selina radioed.

322
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,070
<i>Barbara and the baby were
kidnapped by Nyssa al Ghul.</i>

323
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,753
General Wade's at City Hall.

324
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,196
Chances are Nyssa, Barbara
and the baby are, too.

325
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,795
Our best bet is for me to sneak
into City Hall alone.

326
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,475
One good electrical zap should
short out the general's chip,

327
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
then you can get him
to reverse the invasion order.

328
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,277
See you back at the GCPD.

329
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,716
Get Barbara and
the baby back safe.

330
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,712
Come on. Hey, move!

331
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,437
Upsy-daisy, Oswald.
(Oswald grunting)

332
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,000
We're running
out of time.

333
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,517
(gasps)
Just give me one minute.

334
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,035
I'm so sorry.

335
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,840
I saw the grenade and I froze.
(exhales)

336
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,434
I'm sor...
Shh.

337
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,035
It's the least I could do.

338
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
But tell me...

339
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,470
Does it look bad?

340
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,637
No, it's just
a scr... (gags)

341
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,552
Looks fine. Let's go.

342
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,439
Where'd everybody go?

343
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,637
She's gonna need some morphine.

344
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
(explosion)

345
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,918
And this bandage needs changing.

346
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,872
Lee.

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,036
Bruce.
Is Jim...?

348
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,998
He's okay. For now.

349
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,240
We'll need to get Jeremiah's
battery from the basement.

350
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,397
After the bridges went down,
Lucius re-modified

351
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,279
Jeremiah's bomb to be used
for its original purpose...

352
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,320
as a battery.

353
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,039
It's been powering
the GCPD.

354
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,520
Right.

355
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,791
We need to make
it a bomb again.

356
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,519
You got to be kidding me.

357
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,035
Jeremiah knew exactly
where to put his bombs

358
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,316
to topple buildings,
turn Gotham into a maze.

359
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,760
We stopped him.

360
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,797
But if we could use
just part of his plan,

361
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,792
we can trap the army
and slow them down.

362
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,758
By knocking buildings down
like dominos.

363
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,480
But for that to work, we need
to put a bomb in this building.

364
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,916
Ground Zero for the blast.

365
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,673
Wayne Enterprises.

366
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,240
Bruce...

367
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,554
There's no other way.

368
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,031
Okay. How do we get
this thing out of here?

369
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,160
To use it as a bomb,
you don't need the whole thing.

370
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,876
All you need is... the core...

371
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,193
and the activator.

372
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,192
(electricity powering down)

373
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,195
That's it?

374
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,600
It may look modest,

375
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,194
but all it took was one of these

376
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,555
to blow up an
entire bridge.

377
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,120
Not to mention the
Gotham Clock Tower.

378
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,998
Bruce, you can't
do this alone.

379
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,480
He's not alone.

380
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,392
I know where to place the bomb.

381
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,312
And you and Lucius
are needed here.

382
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,598
I can't believe
we're letting them do this.

383
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Add that to the list

384
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,719
of things that I cannot
believe are happening.

385
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,356
Hey.

386
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,999
What?

387
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,678
(grunting)

388
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,830
(snap)

389
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,033
BARBARA:
The key's there.

390
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,752
Where is she? Is she okay?

391
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,976
Yeah, she's upstairs
in the office

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,276
with Nyssa and
the general.

393
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,616
Nyssa is not gonna stop until
she's killed everyone in Gotham.

394
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,553
One thing at a time,
let's go save our baby.

395
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,075
NYSSA:
Hello, Captain Gordon.

396
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,674
(guns cocking)

397
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,954
Ah.

398
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,795
You're seeing your baby
for the first time.

399
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,075
(sighs)

400
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,277
I wish I had a camera.

401
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Hand her over.

402
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
No.

403
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,678
I don't think I will.

404
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,672
Put down your guns.

405
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,959
Unless you want the little
one hurt in the crossfire.

406
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,596
(chuckles)

407
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,838
Even now, the army is making
its way to the Green Zone

408
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,833
while Bane is hunting down
Bruce Wayne.

409
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,752
Only question is,

410
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,116
what to do with you?

411
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,556
This is it.

412
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,199
The bomb will weaken
the support column

413
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,511
and topple the
entire building.

414
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,239
This is crazy.

415
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,279
I mean, we've spent this entire
time trying to stop Jeremiah

416
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,192
and now we're actually using
part of his plan.

417
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,115
Believe me...

418
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,556
if there was any other way...

419
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,594
SELINA:
You sure you want to do this?

420
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,835
First Wayne Manor gets destroyed

421
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,151
and now Wayne Enterprises.

422
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,074
This building is the heart
of my family's company.

423
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,640
There are things above us

424
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,600
my parents spent
their entire lives on.

425
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,512
Some of my earliest memories

426
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,193
are playing with Alfred
in this lobby,

427
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,431
waiting for my parents
to come down these escalators.

428
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,039
But my parents
built this company

429
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,271
to make Gotham a better place.

430
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,870
They would have sacrificed
everything for this city.

431
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,919
They did sacrifice
everything.

432
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,751
And if that's what it takes...

433
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,910
...so will I.

434
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,872
(exhales)

435
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,236
SELINA: So remind me
how this works.

436
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,917
Pulls energy from the air
and magnifies it.

437
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,799
And when it does that?

438
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,434
We run!

439
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,357
(clamoring)

440
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,756
(screaming)

441
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,998
♪♪♪♪

442
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,794
I knew you'd come
for your child.

443
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,837
I just didn't think
you'd be foolish enough

444
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,513
to come alone.

445
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,273
I don't need help
to take you down.

446
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,999
Don't you see?

447
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,912
It's over.

448
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,559
Gotham will burn.

449
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,519
And I'll achieve
what my father couldn't.

450
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,274
Including killing you.

451
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,073
(chuckles)

452
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,675
She likes to be held upright.

453
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,638
(baby cooing)
There.

454
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,390
Barbara, I'll deal with you
once Gotham has been destroyed.

455
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,710
But I'd like you
to see this.

456
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,316
(both grunting)

457
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,590
I was expecting
a little more gusto.

458
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,273
You want gusto?

459
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,795
(both grunt)

460
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,994
Is that all you got?
(radio beeping)

461
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,074
It's Lieutenant Angel.

462
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,596
They did what?

463
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,512
No, no.

464
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,637
Is there another
way around?

465
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,598
Then tell the army

466
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,160
to blast through.

467
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,993
GORDON:
Hey.

468
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,356
I'm not done with you yet.

469
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,830
Your friends
may have bought you some time,

470
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,560
but the Green Zone's destruction
is only delayed.

471
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,759
And now to meet your fate.

472
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,877
(handcuffs close)
Let's meet it together.

473
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,600
(grunting)

474
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
Barbara!

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,035
(Gordon screams)

476
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,879
(gunfire)

477
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Shoot him.

478
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,590
No.

479
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,434
(grunting)

480
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,719
You think you can defeat me?

481
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,315
Better men and women
have tried and failed.

482
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,198
(grunting)

483
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,709
(shouts)

484
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,714
I'm an al Ghul.

485
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,117
You'll never beat me; I have
my father's blood in my veins.

486
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,998
I am his one true heir.

487
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,799
Do you ever stop talking?

488
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
(cries out)

489
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,356
You two do share
one thing.

490
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,432
You both love getting
stabbed by this knife.

491
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,034
General Wade.

492
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,640
Execute fail-safe.

493
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,400
No.

494
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm going to enjoy watching
Gotham be destroyed!

495
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,959
And then my legacy
will be complete.

496
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,080
We got to hurry.

497
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,296
It's only a matter of time
before the army breaks through.

498
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,600
We need to get back to the GCPD.

499
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,512
- (grunts)
- Bruce!

500
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,075
Impressive. You blew up
your father's building

501
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,719
to stop the military.

502
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,075
It will take more
to stop me.

503
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,196
Go on ahead, Selina!

504
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,350
Warn the GCPD!

505
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,477
No, we're doing this
together.

506
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,239
You shouldn't have hurt Alfred.

507
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,996
Collateral damage.
It happens in war.

508
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,830
I'm sorry you weren't there
to see me break your butler,

509
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,560
but I'm so glad you won't miss
me killing your little friend.

510
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,632
Let her go.

511
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,996
In war, there are
no attachments.

512
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,032
Only then can you fight
without your hands tied.

513
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,353
You see... just a little ounce
of pressure.

514
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,636
That's all that separates
the living from the dead.

515
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,518
(shouts)
(cries out)

516
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,155
(device beeping)

517
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,469
SELINA:
What is that?

518
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,296
BRUCE: Wayne cloaking device,
but it had some glitches.

519
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,880
Apparently, it's a beacon
for certain winged mammals.

520
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,189
SELINA:
What winged mammals?

521
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,600
(wings flapping)

522
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,592
(squealing)

523
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,760
Bats.

524
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,992
(pained grunting)

525
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,552
There's no way to reverse
the invasion order.

526
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,438
We have to find another way.

527
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,677
- Is she all right?
- She is now.

528
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,594
There, there. Mama's here.
(baby cooing)

529
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,232
And your father.

530
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,479
Try not to get blood on her.

531
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,678
Sir...
- (rasping): Come on.

532
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,717
We're almost at the Green Zone.

533
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,110
(mask whirring and clicking)

534
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,954
(hisses)

535
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,271
(breathing steadily)

536
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Lee?

537
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,754
Jim.

538
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,718
The baby?
I checked her over, she's fine.

539
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,120
Though she could use a feed.

540
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,431
(baby cooing)

541
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,637
Where's General Wade?
The army's broken through.

542
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,279
General Wade's dead.

543
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,272
Nyssa al Ghul escaped.
There's no way

544
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,714
to order the army to stand down.

545
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,513
So, now what?

546
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,195
The army blew up
Wayne Enterprises

547
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,840
and knocked down
two other buildings.

548
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,479
We don't stand a chance.

549
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,319
Actually, that was
Bruce and Selina.

550
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,834
What?

551
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,354
The army's blocks away.

552
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,278
GORDON: From what direction?
Every direction.

553
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,396
We're surrounded.

554
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,319
Jim. I need to get her
out of here.

555
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,837
All right. The tunnels
underneath the GCPD.

556
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,640
There's a vent shaft, it
connects to the subway line.

557
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,270
Take the baby and the refugees
down into the subways.

558
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,874
Get 'em behind enemy lines.

559
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,792
- Don't stop till you get to safety.
- Okay.

560
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,837
But what about you?

561
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,518
We'll hold 'em off outside,
buy you some time.

562
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,875
- Jim...
- These refugees,

563
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,216
most of them are
from the Narrows.

564
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,560
They know you, they trust you.

565
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,472
They know you'll
protect them.

566
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,674
Go.

567
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,997
Oh, there you are,
Master Bruce.

568
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,117
Rest, Alfred.

569
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,273
All this time,
I tried to protect you.

570
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,398
Here you are,
a soldier.

571
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,032
A soldier for good.

572
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,999
You've spent your life
protecting me.

573
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,115
Now it's time for me
to do the same.

574
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,920
It's time for me
to protect Gotham.

575
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,438
Even if there's nothing left
to defend.

576
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,997
All right, everyone,
let's move. Okay.

577
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,515
All right, you'll walk
about five blocks underground,

578
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,559
and then you'll get
to a subway vent. Go.

579
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,392
You're not coming with us?

580
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,756
Jim and our friends are
out there making a stand.

581
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,876
That's where I belong.

582
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,600
Wait, what are we going
to do without you?

583
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,118
Survive. Make sure this
was all worth it. Go.

584
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,354
What was that for?

585
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,079
Everything you've done
for me.

586
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,913
And for her.

587
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,957
Just get them to safety.

588
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,196
It's over, Jim.

589
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,920
Our war's come to an end.

590
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,199
This isn't a war.
This is a firing squad.

591
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,996
I told you to go.

592
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,309
And I didn't listen.

593
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,800
Ready.

594
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
(panting)

595
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,600
Aim.

596
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,592
(rifles cocking)

597
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,391
MAN:
Shoulder to shoulder.

598
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,994
- Stand together.
- What the...?

599
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,833
They're here for us, Jim.

600
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,873
Fire.

601
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,679
(crowd quiets)

602
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,515
I said fire!

603
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,080
GORDON:
You have a choice.

604
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,794
You can stand with us,
or you can stand with them.

605
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,840
(crowd cheering)

606
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,794
CROWD (chanting):
We are Gotham!

607
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,873
We are Gotham! We are Gotham!

608
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,991
(coughing)

609
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,633
So that bitch was telling
the truth after all.

610
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,072
(dog barking)

611
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,656
LUCIUS: We managed to raise
the mainland on the radio.

612
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,160
They know everything.
As of right now,

613
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,833
the army's being repurposed

614
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,116
for the humanitarian mission
of rebuilding Gotham.

615
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,318
These refugees will get food,
water, medical treatment.

616
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,676
They're setting up a crisis
center in Federal Square.

617
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,638
I'll be damned.

618
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,598
Hey.

619
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,679
So...

620
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,873
this whole
"not listening" thing.

621
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,599
It's not gonna become
a habit, is it?

622
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,994
You're welcome.

623
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,150
Go.

624
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,153
(chuckles softly)

625
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,356
Well, this is gonna make

626
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,558
one hell of a bedtime story
some day.

627
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,193
Can I?

628
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,556
Of course.

629
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,080
I don't even know
what to call her.

630
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,913
Barbara.

631
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Oh.

632
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,950
Barbara Lee Gordon.

633
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,710
In this city, it's important
she know who she can rely on.

634
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,917
(cooing)

635
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,399
Bruce, what's wrong?

636
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,040
We won.

637
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,794
Nyssa al Ghul is
still out there.

638
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,952
And she and Bane
were right.

639
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,475
All this happened
because of me,

640
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,438
because people were
trying to hurt me

641
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,671
and the people
I care about.

642
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,871
When Bane had you...

643
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,696
I thought he was
gonna kill you, Selina,

644
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,677
and there was nothing
I could do.

645
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,032
Hey.

646
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,998
I will be here

647
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,958
whenever you need me.

648
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,674
What?

649
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,599
That's what my parents
used to tell me.

650
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,754
Come here.

651
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,316
That bitch stole
our submarine!

652
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,470
And our gold.

653
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,279
And by now she's probably landed

654
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,920
somewhere on the mainland,
impossible to track!

655
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,111
After all we've been through
these last months,

656
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,476
we are once again left
with nothing!

657
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,914
Nothing!

658
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
(grunts)

659
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,640
Back to square one.

660
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,120
Common criminals.

661
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,840
We saved this city
from certain damnation,

662
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,276
but will we see any
credit for our loyalty,

663
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,874
our selfless bravery?

664
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,076
Of course not!

665
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,640
I don't want their thanks.

666
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,871
(panting)

667
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,917
Or their respect.

668
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,639
You know what I felt,

669
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,157
standing shoulder to shoulder
with those people out there?

670
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,873
Nothing.

671
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,473
I...

672
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,279
feel...

673
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,800
absolutely nothing

674
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,714
for those drab...

675
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,353
boring people.

676
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,997
That was me once.

677
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,394
Minimum wage
at a thankless job

678
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,755
at the GCPD.

679
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,910
"Yes, sir. No, sir.

680
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,117
Thank you so much, sir."

681
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,474
Picking up scraps
from my master's floor.

682
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,200
Shy, awkward...

683
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,079
pathetic Ed.

684
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,232
Common criminals?

685
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,797
Never again.

686
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,110
I've shown this city
who I truly am once before,

687
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,271
and I will do it again.

688
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,955
They will bow

689
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,316
to the Riddler,
and they won't get up

690
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,110
until I permit them to.

691
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,078
Yes.

692
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,072
You're right.

693
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,356
Our accomplishments
have been erased,

694
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,478
our brilliant minds
underrated.

695
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,280
If they had let me run this city
the way I wanted to,

696
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,631
it would not be in ruins now.

697
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,757
I have the men, the money,

698
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,594
- the guns...
- Gordon took them.

699
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,558
Why? Because he still sees you

700
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,200
as Fish Mooney's umbrella boy,
and he always will.

701
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,676
Yes.

702
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,272
I only came back
to help him save this city

703
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,239
so that I could take it
for myself.

704
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,232
We would be stronger together.

705
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,599
No one could stop us.

706
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,237
Yeah, perhaps.

707
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,159
Let's make a pact,

708
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,471
here and now.

709
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,711
We will take what we want

710
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,757
from who we want,

711
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,719
and we will suffer
no fools.

712
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,398
Together.

713
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,233
Shall we shake
on that?

714
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,674
Please,

715
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,911
we're brothers.

716
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,997
A hug.

717
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,640
A hug it is.

718
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,030
(panting)

719
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,159
(sighs)

720
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,317
Life begins anew.

721
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,037
Shall we get to work?

722
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,558
MAN: Thank you all
for coming here today.

723
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,111
It is my great honor
to introduce Mayor Chang.

724
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,919
(crowd murmuring)

725
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,515
CHANG:
<i>With reunification underway</i>

726
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,990
<i>and the bridges being rebuilt,</i>

727
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,790
<i>it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon</i>

728
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,349
<i>the title of commissioner.</i>

729
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,358
(applause)

730
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,560
(indistinct chatter)

731
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,996
We're gonna miss you
around the bullpen.

732
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,037
I won't be far.

733
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,873
And the mission doesn't change.

734
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,199
Still trying to make this city
a better place.

735
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,600
Be careful.

736
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,273
You're swimming with sharks now.

737
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,671
If you need anything, ever...

738
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,717
I know who to call.

739
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,680
You deserve this, Jim.

740
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,911
You really do.

741
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,831
I'm gonna go get
a drink before...

742
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,559
you get all teary-eyed on me.

743
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,552
(sniffles)

744
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,394
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

745
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,233
Bane's in prison, it's over.

746
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,317
My life here... it's too public.

747
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,640
You've made up your mind.

748
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,240
Gotham's in
good hands.

749
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,516
Commissioner.

750
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,279
Yeah.

751
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,113
Thank you, Bruce,

752
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,193
for everything you've done
for me and for the city.

753
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,791
Gotham will always be your home.

754
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,559
Bruce is all grown up.

755
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,920
- That he is.
- Well,

756
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,992
now you have another
little one to look after.

757
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,838
Where's Bruce?

758
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,991
Um...

759
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,632
he left you this.

760
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,872
(shuddering)

761
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,797
BRUCE: You know how to reach me
if you need anything?

762
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,354
Yes.

763
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,474
Well, you know me, Master Bruce,
I'll be very self-sufficient.

764
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,517
Busy, actually. You know,
we start the reconstruction

765
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,798
of Wayne Enterprises
and Wayne Manor tomorrow.

766
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,519
You will remember everything
I taught you, won't you?

767
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,480
Of course.

768
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,030
Good, that's... that's good.

769
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,074
I never tried to replace
your parents, you know?

770
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,752
I couldn't, I never would.

771
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,879
But I want you to know,
Master Bruce,

772
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,280
that you are the only son

773
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,670
that I will
ever have,

774
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,991
and I could not be more proud.

775
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,594
(shuddering)

776
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,872
(turbine whirring)

777
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,992
