1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,072
My tattoo just has to be
gnarly.

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,277
This is a symbol
of great evil.

3
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:20,319
Awaken from shadow!
Serve your new master!

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,224
Gan! Ren! Chui! Zhen!

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,499
Prepare for battle!

6
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,235
Wow!
We rock!

7
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,303
Uhh!
Uhh!

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,407
Yah!
Ooh!
Uhh!

9
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,241
(Gasps)

10
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,077
Busted.

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,379
(Jade sighs)

12
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,349
Dullsville.

13
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,886
No. The capital
of Georgia is Atlanta.

14
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,089
Jade, your geography test
is tomorrow.

15
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,891
Let's try Oregon.

16
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,727
Why does tohru get to
study the fun stuff?

17
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,963
Uncle is waiting.

18
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,965
I know this one.

19
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,902
That is a symbol
for a conjuring spell,

20
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:13,772
one which requires
garlic and...Ginger?

21
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:18,977
Correct...
If you are making
chicken chow mein!

22
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,114
Do you plan on
becoming chi wizard,
tohru?

23
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,116
Then you must
prepare for day

24
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,287
when new evil
enters our world.

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,492
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

26
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,761
Want gruel with that?

27
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,563
Today's special.

28
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,434
Hey, how's that
special sauce coming?

29
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,270
(Chanting)

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,141
This had better
work, "wizard."

31
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:53,912
While I no longer
possess my full powers...

32
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:58,016
I, daolon wong, have amassed
the spell ingredients

33
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,620
required to make our escape.

34
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,423
(Chanting becomes feverish)

35
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:07,993
Come to me. Yes!

36
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,163
Liberate us, shadowkhan!

37
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:16,135
Rise, my army of darkness!

38
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,136
Tarakudo:
Your army?!

39
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,637
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

40
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,508
I am the one and only king
of the shadowkhan!

41
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,227
I am the one and only king
of the shadowkhan!

42
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,163
Tarakudo?
Awakened?

43
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,667
And ready to reclaim
my ninja magic,

44
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:27,105
a task for which I will
require "assistance."

45
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,574
Ratso: Uh...

46
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,575
Finn: We have to go
check on dessert now.

47
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,512
(Roars)
Aah!

48
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,181
Yahh!
Uhh!

49
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,983
(Escape sirens)

50
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,263
Jackie, the dark hand thugs
have escaped from prison.

51
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:54,099
(Gasps) Daolon wong!

52
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,302
Good news is, the "wizard"
is still in custody.

53
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,770
(Cell phone rings)

54
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,405
Black.

55
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,040
Miller airfield?

56
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,141
Send in every
available agent.

57
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,576
Huh?

58
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,812
Your assistance
will not be necessary!

59
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,214
Magic will defeat magic!

60
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,816
Good-bye.

61
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:14,219
Uncle: Daolon wong
or no daolon wong...

62
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:19,324
A new, greater evil
has forced its way
into our realm!

63
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,127
When we find
dark hand thugs,
we will find this evil.

64
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,395
Hurry!

65
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,463
Yes!

66
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,933
50 states,
50 capitals.

67
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,836
Uhh!

68
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:35,307
Serve me well,
and your reward
will be great.

69
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,442
Yeah...About that.

70
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,178
We appreciate you
busting us out and
all, tarakudo-San,

71
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,080
but the truth is,
we're kinda burnt out

72
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,816
on the whole
- henchman-for-hire thing.

73
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,520
Ah! You require
motivation, then.

74
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,428
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,264
Ok.

76
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,365
When do we start?

77
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,533
Ready to work!

78
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,302
Phew!
(Sighs of relief)

79
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,770
That's the spirit!

80
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:08,573
Now, where is
this "dark hand jet"?

81
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,143
Visitors?

82
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,278
Jackie chan
and friends!

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,781
He's always
gettin' in our way.

84
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,785
So now would be
an excellent time
to bring on the ninjas!

85
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,954
Not just yet.
Ready the plane.

86
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,823
(Roars)

87
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,658
(Gasps) <i> Oni.</i>

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,959
(Gasps)

89
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,828
Uh, "new evil,"
right?

90
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,531
The symbol
of the shadowkhan!

91
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,301
What fun is a "symbol"
without drums?!

92
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,578
Tohru!
Come on, big fella.

93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,147
Trying to save you
a nasty bruise here.

94
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,349
Uhh!

95
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,084
(Gasps)

96
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,852
Captain black!

97
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,487
(Moans)

98
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,789
Uncle: Jackie! Quickly!
Floating head!

99
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,564
Aah! Dahh! Ooh!

100
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,565
Ehh!

101
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,370
Hey, Jackie.

102
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,671
Bwaaa!

103
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:13,839
Before you get mad,
listen.

104
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,174
The capital of Kansas
is Kansas City.

105
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,945
The capital is
Topeka, and that
is not the point!

106
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,213
Uh-oh.

107
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,581
Whoa.

108
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,282
<i>You.</i>

109
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,928
Ah! The former "queen
of the shadowkhan."

110
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,598
Returning to
the forces of darkness?

111
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,701
Thank you, no.
Not today!

112
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,603
Er--what Jackie said.

113
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,705
In time.
You're young.

114
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,811
Find cover.

115
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,952
Enforcers: Come on!

116
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,992
The spells
are not working!

117
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:10,328
Aah!
Aah!

118
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,799
That is because
you do not study
hard enough!

119
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,273
Hmm. Spell work
after all.

120
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:25,143
No. Something tells me
big head got on the plane.

121
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,077
Black: Jackie!

122
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,167
You want a barf bag, chan?

123
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,671
'Cause you're about to
experience some air sickness.

124
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,807
Aah! Whoa!

125
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,942
Buh-bye.

126
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:02,080
Aah!

127
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,189
Bad day, bad day,
bad day, bad day!

128
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:15,560
It's Jackie,
and he doesn't appear
to have a parachute.

129
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,630
Tohru,
catch Jackie!

130
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,232
Uh...

131
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,000
Happy trails, chan.

132
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,401
Huh?

133
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,736
(Yells)

134
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,406
Jackie would <i> so</i> not approve.

135
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,249
Aah--aah--aah--
aah--aah--aah--
aah--aah--aah!

136
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,683
Hey, Jackie!

137
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,752
Bwaaa! Jade!

138
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,788
Never exit an aircraft
without one of these!

139
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,098
Good catch, tohru.

140
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,268
Quickly now! We must
follow floating head!

141
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,737
(Groans)

142
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,644
(Grunts)

143
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,862
Mommy!

144
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,730
(Panting)

145
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,965
Tohru?
Tohru?

146
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,036
Heh! Bad dream.

147
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,405
Lemme guess.
Mr. creepy head?

148
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,909
Jade, you are supposed
to be with captain black.

149
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,545
Thought I should be
here in case you fall
from another plane.

150
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:44,549
The head.
It reminded me
of the oni.

151
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,917
The who-ni?

152
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,053
When I was a child
growing up in Japan,

153
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,755
my mother told me
tales of the oni--

154
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,991
hideous, horned demons

155
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,494
who would sneak
into the rooms of
disobedient children.

156
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:01,066
And what did they
want with these
disobedient children?

157
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:06,438
The oni would--(Gulps)--
Eat their souls! Eww!

158
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,308
So these oni are
like Japanese bogeymen.

159
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,644
Pfft! Fairy tales!

160
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:15,814
Floating head
cannot be "oni."

161
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,082
It can't?

162
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,917
Of course not!

163
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,021
Everyone who has
controlled the shadowkhan
has been <i> Chinese!</i>

164
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:27,425
Shendu, Chinese!
Daolon wong, Chinese!

165
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,028
But oni are <i> Japanese!</i>

166
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,263
(Beep)

167
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:35,800
Radar indicates
the dark hand jet
has landed in Hong Kong.

168
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,004
See? Hong Kong! Chinese!

169
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,207
Jackie: Shendu's palace?

170
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,678
Shendu collected many
artifacts possessing
great magic.

171
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,682
Floating head may be
seeking one of these.

172
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,884
Check it out! Rabbit hole!

173
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,191
Uh...I will
stand guard outside.

174
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,793
don't be afraid, t.

175
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,795
It's just
a silly old head.

176
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,530
(Gulps)

177
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,899
Just a silly old
soul-stealing,

178
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,934
shadowkhan-controlling head.

179
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,707
Tarakudo: Ahh!
Consider it a gift.

180
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,177
Oh, just like Christmas!

181
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,880
Bet there's a ton
of treasure in it!

182
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,552
Dude, you brought us
all this way for a mask?

183
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:31,990
It was from this "mask"
that shendu drew the power

184
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,325
to control
his shadowkhan army

185
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,195
and through which
daolon wong's magic

186
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,998
channeled
- that very same power.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,001
Why don't you
see how it fits?

188
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,336
(Gasps) Jackie!

189
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:48,106
I know.

190
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,410
Yes!

191
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,778
Peek-a-boo!

192
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,880
Seagull shucks oyster!

193
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,382
Aah!
(Grunts)

194
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,217
(Growls)

195
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,618
Aah!
Aah!

196
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,920
Uhh!

197
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,593
Uhh!
Ooh!

198
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,061
Again?!

199
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,297
Who <i> are</i> these people?

200
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,866
Well, Jackie chan's
some kind of do-gooder,

201
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,068
and the big guy
over there used to be
one of us,

202
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,603
but now
he's on their side,

203
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,004
and the old guy pointing
the blowfish--uhh!

204
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,211
Who else wants
a piece of uncle?!

205
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:30,315
You have no idea
who you are dealing with.

206
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,317
Enlighten me.

207
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:36,955
Bow before tarakudo,
king of all shadowkhan,

208
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:40,158
lord of all oni!

209
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,495
(Gasps)
So you <i> are</i> Japanese!

210
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,997
Uhh!

211
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,999
Consider yourself
enlightened.

212
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,968
Tohru!

213
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,035
Uhh!

214
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,004
Huh?

215
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,709
Tarakudo: Mind over matter!

216
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,181
Mine!
Not so fast!

217
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,052
Hey!

218
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,190
What's going on?!

219
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,195
Grr! I wanted that!

220
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,164
Handsome devil,
isn't he?

221
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:23,468
Chow here will stick
around and familiarize
himself with his new powers

222
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,038
while we make
further preparations.

223
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,276
Aah!
Uhh!
Aah!

224
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,846
What does he mean by
"further preparations"?

225
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,348
(Grunts)

226
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,284
Aah!

227
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:43,188
Four against one.
Now, that hardly seems fair.

228
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,560
(Roars)

229
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,662
Uh...Jackie?

230
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,697
I'm getting
the feeling

231
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,233
this masked thing
gives chow the power
to summon...

232
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,569
Shadowkhan.

233
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,154
(Efforting)

234
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,291
Uhh!

235
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,830
Boo!

236
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,802
Face your fear, t!

237
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,706
(Growls)

238
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,541
Uhh!

239
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,276
Light as a feather!

240
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,279
Waaah--uhh!

241
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,614
Uhh!

242
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,885
Aiyaaa!

243
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,621
We must remove
demon mask from host

244
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,756
in order to defeat
shadowkhan!

245
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,758
Jackie, one more thing!

246
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,896
Keep shadowkhan busy,
so uncle can cast
proper spell!

247
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,999
I am trying, uncle. Aah!

248
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,569
What spell
would that be, sensei?

249
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,070
("I don't know" sound)

250
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,973
Hey, lookee here.

251
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,042
Maybe this picture
book can help.

252
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,246
Catch me if you can!

253
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,015
Chan hunt!

254
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,318
What do the
inscriptions say, unc?

255
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,589
These are <i> Japanese,</i> kanji.
Uncle only reads <i> Chinese.</i>

256
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,993
Uh, I read Japanese...
But it has been many years.

257
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,828
In fact,
I am probably too shaky,

258
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,096
so forget
that I mentioned--

259
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,265
tohru, read kanji now!

260
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,199
Yes, sensei.

261
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,104
Uhh!

262
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,506
Aah!

263
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,374
(Efforting)

264
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,219
The kanji tell
of ancient warriors

265
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,323
who once cast a spell
to defeat this oni,

266
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,059
trapping its spirit
within the mask.

267
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,696
The key ingredient
was Japanese steel...

268
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,132
Specially forged
for a samurai sword.

269
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:12,370
Aiyaa! We will
not find steel
of samurai sword here

270
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,406
because shendu
is not Japanese!

271
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,708
Hmm.

272
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,645
Bwaaa!

273
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,153
Well, it doesn't say
"made in Taiwan."

274
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,669
Smackdown time, chan!

275
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,772
Waaah! Daaah!

276
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,007
Uhh!

277
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,508
Uhh!
Daaah!

278
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,777
You've been
working out, chow!

279
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:57,115
Jade, what
makes you certain
this is Japanese steel?

280
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,850
Uh...I'm not.

281
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,118
Haaah!
Daaah!

282
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,386
Diiih!
Ohh!

283
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,387
Daaah!
Ohh!

284
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,455
Uhh! Ohh!

285
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,126
It's over, chan.

286
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,962
(Tohru and uncle chat)

287
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,799
Yes. It is.

288
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,135
(Chant finishes)

289
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,342
Jackie, remove mask!

290
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,646
Uhh!
Get him off me!

291
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,882
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

292
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:31,949
Aah!

293
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,386
Ohh!

294
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,588
Aah!
Aah!

295
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,290
Why isn't it
coming off?

296
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,758
Patience!

297
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,227
Aah!

298
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,495
Uhh!

299
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,696
Uhh!

300
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,634
Destroy him!

301
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,339
"Boo."

302
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,842
Aah!

303
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,846
Perhaps this would
be safer in the vault
at section 13.

304
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,649
New evil
has been defeated.

305
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,318
Um...One more thing.

306
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,920
Oh, no.

307
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,422
Guys?

308
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,858
Guys?!

309
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,361
Hey, guess this means
I'm finally a free
henchman. Heh heh!

310
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:21,432
Aah!

311
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,636
(Pants)
don't do that!

312
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,339
You have failed me.

313
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:33,544
Do not fret.
It is but a minor defeat.

314
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,946
That's cool.

315
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,381
Tarakudo's
an ok guy.

316
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:42,720
Besides, our mission
has only yet begun.

317
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,155
Uh...

318
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,023
It has?

319
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,159
It goes on to say...

320
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:53,397
That tarakudo once
terrorized the land with
his trusted oni generals.

321
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,701
Each demon general
controlled its own army

322
00:18:56,703 --> 00:19:00,505
which were comprised
of a different tribe
of shadowkhan.

323
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,508
Uh, different how?

324
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,344
I would prefer not
to have to find out.

325
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,846
Tohru: Tarakudo's reign
came to an end

326
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,183
when the spirits
of his generals were
trapped within masks.

327
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:17,255
9 generals, 9 masks.

328
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,224
9 "different" tribes
of shadowkhan?

329
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,093
What are we
waiting for?

330
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,996
There are
8 more masks
which we must find

331
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,098
before forces
of darkness do!

332
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,900
Let me guess.

333
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,335
The masks were scattered
across the earth?

334
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,406
Yep. Uh, one more thing.

335
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,576
Should the 9 masks
ever be revived,

336
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,512
their combined power may
summon enough shadowkhan

337
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:46,551
to engulf the entire earth
in eternal darkness.

338
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:50,621
Aiyaa! Tohru
must do research!

339
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,390
He must?

340
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,793
You were told
childhood tales
of oni by mother.

341
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,628
You read Japanese.

342
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,200
You <i> are</i> Japanese,
so <i> you</i> must do
research!

343
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,202
(Gulps)

344
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,638
Yes, sensei.

345
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,210
Yes! New adventure,
uh-huh! Find the masks,
be the shadowkhan...

346
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,156
Hey Jackie do you ever get
tired of traveling all over the
world?

347
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,025
Yeah, I do get tired of
traveling around the world.

348
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,194
I've been--
the last 20 years,

349
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,696
I've been travel,
travel, travel.

350
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,431
One day I want to
settle down,

351
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,866
have my own studio,

352
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,603
just shoot everything
in the same place.

353
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,771
Then I don't have to
travel anymore.

354
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,674
But, put another way,
travel is good.

355
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,076
I learn so many things--

356
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,044
different cultures,
different cities.

357
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,412
Everything's different.

358
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,647
Yeah. That's the good thing.
