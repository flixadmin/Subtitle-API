00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,536
What's green and red
and goes round and round?

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,271
Zebra with a gaping hole.

4
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,773
Your brilliant mind is as damaged
as the rest of your body.

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:12,223
(chuckles): I guess she was right.

6
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:13,691
You're not smart!

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,324
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

8
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,289
Makes me miss Falcone.

9
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:20,458
SOFIA: You came looking for a gangster.
That's exactly what you found.

10
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:22,060
I'm a Falcone.

11
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:23,227
I need to know what you're going to do.

12
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:24,963
You want the city back from Penguin,

13
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:26,297
I'll give that to you.

14
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,333
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure it out?

15
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:29,968
The two of you have been whispering

16
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,637
like teenagers for weeks.

17
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:34,639
You never deserved her
in the first pl...

18
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,808
BARBARA: Yes, I killed him.

19
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:38,435
I am sorry.

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,371
There's a legend about this knife.

21
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:43,081
The man that killed my grandfather
can't have this.

22
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:44,082
I promise.

23
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:46,084
That's Ra's al Ghul.

24
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,753
RA'S AL GHUL: That knife
is the key to everything.

25
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:50,922
Give me the knife
and I will release the boy.

26
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,523
- Bruce, hand me the knife.
- I can't.

30
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:03,368
ORDERLY: Ah, used to be a gangster.

31
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:06,671
Name's, uh, Gilzean. Maybe Gold?

32
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,841
Took a slug in the noodle.
Been in a coma six months.

33
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:12,343
So, hospital brass wants
to free up some beds?

34
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,546
Yeah, say take him upstate.

(both laughing)

36
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:31,129
Rest in peace, Butch Gilzean.

37
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:33,965
Cyrus Gold. (laughs)

Hey, Harvey.

Has anyone contacted you
about Ra's al Ghul?

No.

45
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,508
I just heard from Judge Bam Bam's clerk.

46
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:20,211
- His trial got pushed off the docket.
- And?

47
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,714
And I want to make sure
him being minister

48
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:25,508
of a foreign country doesn't
let him weasel out of this.

49
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,724
He killed a boy.

50
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,019
That's above my pay grade, pal.

51
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:31,009
I just, uh, bust the bad guys.

52
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,767
Do you?

53
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:36,034
These are release forms.

54
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,053
Of my collars.

55
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,835
Let me guess,
each one of them has a license

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,937
from Penguin, right?

57
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,789
Jim, I am stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

58
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:46,270
Every mook you bust with a
license, the commissioner

59
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:47,739
orders me to let him go.

60
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,073
What am I supposed to do?

61
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,909
- Your job!
- I am doing my job!

62
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,277
HARPER: Gordon, got a call

63
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:55,813
from the judge's clerk;
it's about Ra's al Ghul.

64
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,548
Here.

65
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:59,450
I'm doing my job.

66
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:08,559
Master Bruce.

67
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,728
No sleep?

68
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:13,097
Again?

69
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,503
Once more, about that boy's death...

70
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:20,638
Don't say it's not my fault.

71
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,609
It is my fault.

72
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,375
Alex is dead because I hesitated.

73
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,710
Well, perhaps you did,

74
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,421
but that doesn't make you
his murderer, does it?

75
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:30,132
Ra's killed that innocent little boy,

76
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:31,179
and he's gonna pay for it.

77
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:33,117
You really think locking him up
in Blackgate will stop him?

78
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,153
He still wants this dagger.

79
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:36,454
Stop going on about
the bloody dagger, will you?

80
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:38,116
Just so we can just get some breakfast.

81
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,490
- Please.
- I think I finally found something

82
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:41,093
in Dr. Winthrop's notes.

83
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:42,460
There's a description on the handle

84
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,760
that Dr. Winthrop was able to decipher.

85
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,531
Says the knife is intended for the one

86
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,499
who has bathed in the healing waters.

87
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:49,967
Right. Well, assuming that's not me,

88
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:51,435
that must be our boy Ra's.

89
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,482
But that doesn't have
to mean it's for him to use.

90
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:57,542
Perhaps it's to be used against him.

91
00:03:57,577 --> 00:03:59,343
I see.

92
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,344
No.

93
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,046
You clearly don't.

94
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:03,514
What you're suggesting is

95
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,715
that knife and that knife alone

96
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:06,384
is the only thing capable
of doing him in.

97
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,452
If Ra's al Ghul believes
this knife will kill him,

98
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,321
that could explain why
he wants it so badly.

99
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:11,722
So he can destroy it.

100
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,560
Before someone fulfills the prophecy.

101
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:22,066
Master Bruce, I know that
you feel bad about Alex.

102
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:23,701
We all do.

103
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,838
But at this point, you
must remember your vow.

104
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:30,842
No killing.

105
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,316
No killing.

106
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,924
Taking a life, never mind how justified,

107
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,149
will lead you down

108
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,484
a darker path than
you could ever possibly imagine.

109
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,320
I know. I've been down it.

110
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,522
You understand me, Master Bruce?

111
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:46,390
I understand.

112
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:48,125
Good.

113
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:59,403
Let's get yourself ready.

Chop, chop.

115
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:12,450
WOMAN: Such a tragedy.

116
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:16,394
He was only a child
and always so lovely.

117
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:17,801
A heinous crime

118
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:21,259
perpetrated against
such an innocent boy.

119
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:22,593
WOMAN: And his grandfather,

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,963
murdered just the day before.

121
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,832

122

123
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,752
Diplomatic immunity?

00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,420
You are joking, aren't you?

125
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:52,390
The Nanda Parbat embassy filed
papers to have him extradited.

126
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:54,208
Could happen this week.

When it does, I need you to watch Bruce.

132

I'm worried about him.

133

And you blame me?

134
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,327
You're his guardian, aren't you?

135
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:13,477
You're supposed to protect him,

136
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:15,513
and instead you've been
placing him in harm's way.

137
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,748
ALFRED: Oh, I see. So that's
what rankles, is it?

138
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:20,117
Keeping you in the dark.
Well, if I was you,

139
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:21,953
I'd focus on your own job, Detective,

140
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:24,701
which is keeping Ra's al Ghul
behind bars, tucked up.

141
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:26,691
Just keep the news away
from Bruce as long as you can.

142
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:30,065
On that, we agree, Detective.

143

License compliance

00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,937
The program is an unmitigated success.

205
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,522
Numbers, Mr. Penn.

206
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:03,791
A-According to my tabulations,

207
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:08,362
86% of crime is accounted for
under Pax Penguina.

208
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,599
Which means that 14% of crime

209
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,835
happens outside of my licensing system!

210
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:18,333
Uh... the numbers are
very good, Mr. Cobblepot.

211
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:21,611
Get Firefly. I want examples made!

212
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,013
Yes, that might help.

213
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,883
But, then, if scorching a
few idiots was all it took,

214
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,652
anyone could rule Gotham.

215
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:32,055
Thank you for your
insight, Miss Falcone.

216
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,674
I don't recall summoning you.

217
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,093
I came to see if you had
lunch plans tomorrow.

218
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,263
An invitation?

219
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,666
After...

220
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:46,203
I killed your father's
last remaining loyalists?

221
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,971
(chuckles): Perhaps you

222
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,042
overestimate the pleasure
of your company.

223
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,241
Oswald...

224
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:54,906
you may think you have everything,

225
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:57,914
but there is one thing you don't have.

226
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,414
The Falcone name.

227
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,652
A name that once accounted

228
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:06,056
for all criminal activity
in Gotham... as in...

229
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:08,758
one hundred percent.

230
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,827
Now you're just rubbing it in.

231
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,600
I propose we have lunch
somewhere public.

232
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,668
By doing so, you'll show
Gotham that you have

233
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,604
the support of the Falcone family.

234
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,339
And that should be enough to send

235
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,740
those outlying criminal elements

236
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,983
scurrying back under your umbrella.

237
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:31,709
Mr. Penn, item number
four on my to-do list.

238
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:36,486
"Kill Sofia Falcone."

239
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,425
Add a question mark, will you?

240
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,778
Tomorrow it is.

241
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,306
Come on, you people have
pills for everything!

242
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,700
Insomnia, anxiety! You have
to have something for me!

243
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,645
I don't know, a pill
to reverse the effect

244
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,323
of having your brain
frozen and unfrozen?

245
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:04,948
That's kind of specific.

246
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,583
(bottle shatters)

247
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:10,003
I will not be condescended to

248
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:12,155
by an idiot in a lab coat!

249
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,324
You're not even a doctor!

250
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,029
Okay, relax, man.
Just... tell me your symptoms.

251
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,963
Fogginess of the mind.

252
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,441
Decreased capacity
to think ten steps ahead.

253
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,699
Inability to solve riddles!

254
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,972
God.

255
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:29,673
I have got to improve my brain function.

256
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,649
I could take a pill or a vitamin.

257
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:34,751
I'll even consider a natural remedy.

258
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:37,870
I don't want to get your hopes
up, but there is something.

259
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:39,665
What? Tell me.

260
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,807
A trial drug.

261
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:44,243
It claims to boost your
natural cognitive abilities.

262
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,578
That's perfect. Where is this?

263
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:46,946
The sample drawer.

264
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:48,981
What is it called?

265
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:51,470
Uh, Smartivia.
Blue pills, diamond-shaped.

266
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,152
Smartivia. Smartivia.

267
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,520
I don't see them.

268
00:13:54,556 --> 00:13:56,022
Try towards the back.

269
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:57,677
I don't see it.

270
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,692
Ah, here it is.

271
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,715
Ow!

272
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,221

276
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:15,742
Ow! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I just need to know.

277
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:18,104
- Do these work?
- No, dummy.

278
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,606
They're sugar pills.

279
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,041

Barbara Kean... she is the problem.

293

You and Tabitha are innocent bystanders.

294
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,456
Wow, you don't get much sun.

295

No...

Bruce is gone.

302
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,814
- What?
- You've got to get me into Blackgate.

303
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,908
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:32,713
When we got back from the
wake, he said he was gonna go

305
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:35,248
straight to bed, but he must've
snuck out between then and now.

306
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:38,251
My concern is that he's
taken the knife...

307
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:41,421
and he's gonna try and kill
Ra's al Ghul.

308
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,456
You're serious?

309
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,024
Yes, I'm bloody serious.

310
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,759
We've got to go to Blackgate now.

311
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:48,761
And then you can tell me the many ways

312
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:50,497
I've failed the child, all right?

313
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,632
- Oh, I will.
- Listen to me.

314
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,434
The boy is on the verge
of doing something

315
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:56,936
that there's no coming back from.

316
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,628
He needs our help.

317
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,208
Right.

318
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,810
Let's go.

You're still not ready.

332
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,708
(coughs)

333
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,652
My name is Bruce Wayne.

334
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:23,883
Stop him. Stop him.

335
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:28,855
Master al Ghul.

336
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:32,107
Take him below.

337
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:34,460
What? What are you doing?

338
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:47,683
We got your call, but...
I checked the logs...

339
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,875
- Bruce Wayne hasn't been here.
- With all due respect,

340
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,877
I don't think he'd come
as a regular visitor.

341
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:53,492
He's a billionaire, after all.

342
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:55,735
I think what Mr. Pennyworth
is trying to say is

343
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:58,316
Bruce Wayne could have paid
someone to get him in here.

344
00:18:58,352 --> 00:18:59,517
No offense.

345
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:02,320
We just want to look around.

346
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,323
Sure. Whatever you want.

347
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,826
But you came all the way here
for nothing.

348
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,895
And we're gonna need your weapons.

349
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,332
Standard procedure.

350
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:16,902
Of course.

351
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,972
(clears throat)

352
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:26,511
(clears throat)

353
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:40,182
- Finished?
- That's absolutely it.

354
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,193
Unless you want to check
my undercrackers.

355
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,197
This way.

356
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:49,000
(whispers): Undercrackers?

357
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:52,570
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

358
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:55,140
They're here.

359
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:58,176
(sirens wailing)

360
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,212
(car horns honking in distance)

361
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,016
(groans)

362
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:09,688
(pained gasps)

363
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:16,361
Sugar pills, my foot.

364
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:19,564
That dream was horrible.

365
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,099
Oh, God!

366
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:23,568
Oh, you're real. (gasping)

367
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:24,602
Oh...

368
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,500
You... know...

369
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:29,240
...Grundy?

370
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:31,211
What? No. No.

371
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,677
No, who's Grundy?

372
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:35,080
Solomon Grundy.

373
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,615
Born on Monday.

374
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,251
Your hand! How...

375
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,520
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,489
What happened to you?

377
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,985
Grundy not know.

378
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,755
Okay, let me get this straight.

379
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,697
You don't... remember...

380
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,793
who you are

381
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:56,774
or how you got here?

382
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,970
(laughs)

383
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,574
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,109
Grundy...

385
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:07,540
I don't know you. Best of luck, though.

386
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,714
Hope you get the skin thing
figured out. Later.

387
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,882
(groans)

388
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,385
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

389
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,720
You know Grundy.

390
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:17,922
You help Grundy.

391
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:19,557
Be...

392
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,992
Grundy...

393
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,701
friend.

394
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:26,998
I'm attempting to be civil...

395
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,834
but I can't help you.

396
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,469
Why?

397
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:33,238
I just can't, all right?

398
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:34,839
- Why?
- Because...

399
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,074
Why?!

400
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:38,957
Because I can't even help myself!

401
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:40,521
Ow.

402
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,156
You don't know who you are.

403
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:46,230
Well, that makes two of us.

404
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:50,496
I used to be smart... brilliant...

405
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:52,624
and now that's gone.

406
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,686
I can't even rob a pharmacy!

407
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:58,530
So you want me to help you?

408
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:01,896
I can't.

409
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:18,516
Well, I am feeling a pit peckish.

410
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:30,138
We are closed.

411
00:22:30,163 --> 00:22:32,030
Janos.

412
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,961
Last I saw you was at my tenth birthday.

413
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,642
You bought me ruby earrings.

414
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,570
Said it would be a fitting gift

415
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:40,605
for the daughter of the king of Gotham.

416
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,807
Sofia Falcone.

417
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,158
I heard you had returned to Gotham.

418
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,251
What can I do for you?

419
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:50,348
I was wondering how you were faring

420
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:52,016
under Penguin's rule.

421
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:54,719
The Szabo family is quite content

422
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:57,713
under Oswald Cobblepot's
licensing system.

423
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:59,524
But even if we were not,

424
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:02,996
we would be wise enough
not to say anything.

425
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:05,774
Good. Because I've invited him

426
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,265
to your restaurant for lunch,

427
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:10,776
and I want it to be a lunch
he'll never forget.

428
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:30,044
RA'S AL GHUL: Bruce.

429
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,655
BRUCE: Where am I?

430
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:40,899
Beneath Blackgate Penitentiary.

431
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:44,388
Alfred Pennyworth and Jim Gordon

432
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:47,472
are upstairs in the company,

433
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:50,318
unbeknownst to them, of my men.

434
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:51,309
Let them go.

435
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:53,028
They have nothing to do with this.

436
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:56,428
Still playing
the white knight, Bruce.

437
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:58,449
You replaced the guards
before I got here.

438
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,822
I'm sure your friends
can fend for themselves.

439
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,554
You applied for diplomatic immunity,

440
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:04,410
knowing I'd hear about it

441
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:05,790
and come for you.

442
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,392
I wanted the knife,

443
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,961
but not for the reason you think.

444
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:16,218
It's been ages since
I first held this dagger.

445
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,971
It was given to me
moments after I was bathed

446
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:21,982
in the Lazarus Pit.

447
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:25,451
Submerged in the waters...

448
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:29,614
(gasps)

449
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,321
...suspended between

450
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:39,203
life and death,

451
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:42,694
I saw a vision of you...

452
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,564
...my heir.

453
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,467
You're insane.

454
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:51,386
I'm not your heir.

455
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:53,237
I don't even understand what that means.

456
00:24:53,262 --> 00:24:56,801
It means that you are the only one

457
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,638
who can end my suffering.

458
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:06,076
Please.

459
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:09,503
You want me to kill you?

460
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:12,957
Set me free.

461
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:26,172
Well, thanks for the snack, big guy.

462
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,317
It's been an emotional day.

463
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:31,911
I got to go.

464
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,899
- No.
- Oh.

465
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,934
Not this again. Come on!

466
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,804
God... I've told you,
I'm better off on my own,

467
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,568
and you are, too.

468
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:43,141
So let go!

469
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:44,609
Let go!

470
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,411
MAN: Hey, freak.

471
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:48,179
Ha, I knew we'd find you.

472
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,282
And it looks like you got a friend.

473
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:52,440
(chuckles) I assure you,

474
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,119
we are not friends.

475
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,487
MAN: Get 'em.

476
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:56,655
Both of 'em.

477
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,656
No! No!

478
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:00,458
(grunting, screaming)

479
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,534
Grundy!

480
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,803
(screaming)

481
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:14,700
- (screaming)
- Hot... hot!

482
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:16,464
Grundy friend, help!

483
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,477
Don't leave, no. Help. Help.

484
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:21,079
Hot.

485
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:24,189
Hot... hot...

486
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:26,117
- (steam hissing)
- (sighing)

487
00:26:29,784 --> 00:26:31,515
Grundy friend not dumb.

488
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,727
Grundy friend... smart.

489
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,328
Well, I guess...

490
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,398
...yeah, you're right.

491
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,867
Water beats fire. (laughs)

492
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:45,323
That was smart. (chuckles)

493
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:47,238
Oh, boy...

494
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,374
(grunts)

495
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,669
(straining): I can't breathe.

496
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,046
(horn honks, siren wails)

497
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:07,592
Oswald. They said this is
their best table.

498
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,194
Interesting choice.

499
00:27:09,983 --> 00:27:12,129
Are you sure it's not too intimate?

500
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:13,690
The point was to get the word out

501
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,277
that the Falcones support me.

502
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:17,802
Don't worry, people will talk.

503
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,142
I chose this place

504
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,908
because I heard your mother
was Hungarian.

505
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,112
I thought you might like
a taste of home.

506
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:49,134
I can assure you, Oswald,
I'm not here to poison you.

507
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,109
Perhaps.

508
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:53,138
(coughing)

509
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:56,746
The chef likes to go heavy
on the paprika, doesn't he?

510
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:58,043
(coughing)

511
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,145
How is the food, otherwise?

512
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:02,981
Serviceable.

513
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,292
Well, I'm stuffed.

514
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,754
Thank you so much
for meeting me, Miss Falcone.

515
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,880
(louder): And thank you to your
family for their support.

516
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:14,539
You can't leave until
you've tried the goulash.

517
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:16,341
If it's anything like
the chicken paprika,

518
00:28:16,784 --> 00:28:19,377
- I'll pass.
- It's the house specialty.

519
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:25,817
(sighs)

520
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:29,721
My mother made goulash.

521
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:31,990
Brought the recipe from Budapest.

522
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:35,260
Handed down through her family
for 300 years.

523
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:40,248
I doubt this will hold a candle.

524
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:06,558
- I'm leaving!
- SOFIA: Oswald?

525
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,294
Oswald?

526
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,201
It took me forever
to find his mother's recipe.

527
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:18,403
Did you follow it exactly?

528
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:20,438
I followed the recipe to a T.

529
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:22,574
The little man didn't like?

530
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,710
Honestly, I don't know.

531
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,285
GORDON: How long have you worked here?

532
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,652
Two years, thereabouts.

533
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:38,190
I was in Blackgate for a time.

534
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:39,391
We must not have overlapped.

535
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,693
Here? As a guard?

536
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:43,746
As a prisoner.

537
00:29:43,964 --> 00:29:46,431
Oh, yeah. Heard about that.

538
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:47,899
Is there a reason why
you're not taking us

539
00:29:47,935 --> 00:29:49,634
through maximum security?

540
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,204
Prisoners are in the yard
this time of day.

541
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:55,023
Been some changes since you were here.

542
00:29:57,844 --> 00:29:58,944
"McCloskey."

543
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:01,112
That's funny.

544
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:04,082
I know another J. McCloskey
who works here.

545
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:08,987
My cousin. Gets confusing sometimes.

546
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:11,443
All right, let's go.

547
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:13,158
- Through this door.
- ALFRED: I got to say, mate,

548
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:14,759
I really love what you've
done with the old place.

549
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:17,397
However, I've got a question for you.

550
00:30:17,764 --> 00:30:19,898
Yeah?

551
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,700
Where are the real guards?

552
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,736
(grunting)

553
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:32,611
(gunshots)

554
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:39,337
Where is Bruce Wayne?

555
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,820
Ra's al Ghul has plans for the boy.

556
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:42,821
Where is he?!

557
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:45,190
(laughs) You'll never find him.

558
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:48,059
Oh, you underestimate my resolve, pal.

559
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,955
Well, at least we know Bruce is here.

560
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:57,936
Well, we've walked the floor.
Where could he be?

561
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,588
There's the yard,

562
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:02,166
the tower... but they're too public.

563
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:05,321
There's a sub-basement,
accessible by the service elevator.

564
00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:07,020
Which way?

565
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,429
(car horns honking in distance)

566
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:20,482
(door opens)

567
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:24,966
(scoffs)

568
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,872
Who did I tell you specifically
not to let in here?!

569
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:31,581
Uh, Miss Falcone is here
to see you, sir.

570
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:35,297
I'm sorry, Oswald.

571
00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:36,998
I'm not sure what upset you, but I...

572
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:38,133
Enough!

573
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:40,645
Did you think I would really believe

574
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,373
this was all some coincidence?

575
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:45,941
That goulash tasted exactly
like my mother used to make!

576
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:48,914
You can't fault me for
the restaurant's authenticity.

577
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,416
You're buttering me up.

578
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,252
But for what?

579
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,587
Is it so hard to believe

580
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,372
that someone would want to do
something nice for you?

581
00:31:58,397 --> 00:31:59,411
There was only one person

582
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:00,833
in my whole life
who ever did things for me

583
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:02,895
without wanting something in return.

584
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,897
And that was my mother.

585
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:07,303
Then I envy you.

586
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:11,270
My father never helped anyone
unless it benefited him.

587
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:14,640
And eventually it drove away
everyone who loved him.

588
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,744
Go.

589
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,046
I'll decide what to do with you later.

590
00:32:24,718 --> 00:32:27,386
Oswald, I only want to help you.

591
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:29,354
Oh, you want to help? Try leaving.

592
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,123
(sniffles)

593
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,590
Your foot.

594
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:35,879
It's just the weather.

595
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,096
(exhales)

596
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,604
What are you doing?

597
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:50,242
- Don't.
- It's okay.

598
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,451
I won't judge.

599
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:15,255
When I was a child, I broke my ankle

600
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,111
while playing with my cousins.

601
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:20,739
I was desperate.

602
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:22,908
Crying in pain.

603
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:26,111
My father told me to put ice on it.

604
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,826
Toughen up, stop with the tears.

605
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,516
But my mother went with me
to the hospital.

606
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:34,104
And on the way, she told me

607
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,848
that cold actually increases the pain.

608
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:42,187
What's needed is warmth.

609
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,397
My mother.

610
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:49,773
She used to sing.

611
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,973
(humming)

612
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:16,094
RA'S AL GHUL: This may be
hard for you to understand.

613
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:21,720
But I have walked this earth
for centuries.

614
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,674
Waiting for you, Bruce.

615
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:27,316
Only you can kill me.

616
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:30,042
And only with that dagger.

617
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:32,784
That is my curse.

618
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,854
That is the meaning of my vision.

619
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,083
I don't believe you.

620
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,718
Believe me.

621
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:42,187
This is just another manipulation.

622
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:44,756
See.

623
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:48,226
Look.

624
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:50,729
My true form.

625
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:54,505
Every moment of my life

626
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,328
is agony.

627
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:01,002
End my suffering.

628
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:05,028
Whatever your curse is,

629
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,440
you deserve it for what you've done.

630
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:11,216
You're angry, Bruce. I understand.

631
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:13,785
But unless you strike me down
with that blade,

632
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,306
you will never be free.

633
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:16,436
No!

634
00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:20,131
I won't.

635
00:35:21,895 --> 00:35:24,730
Then allow me to tell you
what will happen...

636
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,217
...if you don't kill me.

637
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,169
I will disappear

638
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:36,288
and let you live your life.

639
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,627
You will follow the path of light.

640
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,814
Grow into a fine man.

641
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,883
Become a husband.

642
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,471
A father.

643
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:52,828
There may be a day
when you forget I ever existed.

644
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:59,071
But then I will return.

645
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,935
And I will kill everyone you love.

646
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:07,307
Just as you watched your parents die,

647
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:12,265
just as you watched me
slice your friend's throat,

648
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:16,240
I will slaughter your wife and children

649
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:18,250
before your very eyes,

650
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:22,120
and there will be nothing
you can do about it.

651
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:25,190
(shouts)

652
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:27,192
- Die.
- (dagger slices)

653
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,194
(yells)

654
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:47,883
Yes.

655
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:49,981
(panting)

656
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:54,886
(crackling)

657
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:21,079
MAN (over speaker):
<i>Attention, all inmates.</i>

658
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,028
<i>The prison is on official lockdown.</i>

659
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:25,068
(continues indistinctly)

660
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:32,482
Are you going to arrest me?

661
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,011
For what?

662
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:38,214
For murder.

663
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,250
I don't know what I just saw in there.

664
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:42,085
But as far as I'm concerned,

665
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,688
Ra's al Ghul's men broke
into Blackgate and he escaped.

666
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,917
I betrayed myself
and my parents' memory.

667
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:54,130
I took a life.

668
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:57,175
I did exactly what Ra's said I would.

669
00:37:57,703 --> 00:37:59,669
Just because you know you're
capable of doing something

670
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,597
doesn't mean it has to happen again.

671
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:07,570
Bruce, you and I have known
each other a long time.

672
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,117
Since the night
your parents were murdered.

673
00:38:10,382 --> 00:38:12,600
Now, you may not feel
like you're that kid anymore,

674
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,344
but I know that you are.

675
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:17,520
One who believes in doing good.

676
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:20,601
In fighting for what's right.

677
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:24,460
Who will do anything to keep
the people he loves safe.

678
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:30,976
Nothing that happened today
changes that.

679
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:45,014
What are you doing?

680
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,050
You said it yourself.

681
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,174
It's over.

682
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,989
No.

683
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,243
- Can't let you do that, Master Bruce.
- Alfred.

684
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:56,793
Listen, we started

685
00:38:56,828 --> 00:39:00,897
this vigilante caper to prepare
for Ra's' return, didn't we?

686
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:03,333
But it's become
so much bigger than that.

687
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:07,191
I see that now. I mean,
I was wrong and you were right.

688
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:10,773
You can make a difference.

689
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:15,781
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

690
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:20,350
I made that decision the
moment I killed Ra's al Ghul.

691
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:24,624
I took the dark path.

692
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,170
Yes, you did.

693
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,988
And it's gonna be
a long, bumpy journey back.

694
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,764
But I believe in you, Master Bruce.

695
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:38,496
I always have, and I... I always will.

696
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:42,522
Now, I understand
that you don't feel worthy now.

697
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:46,476
But when you do, this...

698
00:39:48,546 --> 00:39:51,547
...this will be waiting for you.

699
00:39:53,585 --> 00:39:55,985
As will I, sir.

700
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160

702

NYGMA: Those guys that attacked us

703
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:20,944
didn't even have five bucks between 'em.

704
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:23,646
(scoffs) We need a new plan.

705
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:29,919
What?

706
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:32,155
Truth.

707
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,234
Grundy friend...

708
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,923
know Grundy?

709
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:40,938
You deserve to know.

710
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,967
You and I...

711
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,439
...were the very best of friends.

712
00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:51,441
And then something happened to you.

713
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:52,988
And I just didn't recognize you.

714
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:56,512
But what is important
is that, with your muscles,

715
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,212
we can make money.

716
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:02,604
And with money,
we can make me smart again.

717
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:05,455
And then we'll figure out
what happened to you.

718
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:08,557
Just trust me. Okay?

719
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:14,130
Grundy, come on.
