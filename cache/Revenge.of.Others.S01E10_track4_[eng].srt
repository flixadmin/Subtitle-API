1
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,048
That's it!

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,427
Ji Sooheon, you bastard! You're doomed.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,803
You son of a bitch!

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:15,181
Fucking son of a bitch.

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,558
fivestars_GI
THE REAL FUN BEGINS NOW!!! LIVESTREAM

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,477
Wow, with the crutches.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,895
Don't worry. The hero will win eventually.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,230
I agree. Sa Junggyeong's legs
are injured after all.

9
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,150
-Right.
-Stop it, you motherfucker!

10
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,651
Fucking shit, you motherfucker!

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,778
Wow, did he really block that?

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,198
Fuck.

13
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,326
Oh, oh, oh!
He's taking it off! He's taking it off!

14
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,632
THE REAL FUN BEGINS NOW!!! LIVESTREAM

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,889
Osung.

16
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,515
Was your livestream a success?

17
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,600
Fuck.

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,577
REVENGE OF OTHERS

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,460
TWENTY MINUTES AGO

20
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,254
Yeah, we're heading towards
where you told us to go.

21
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,839
Uh...

22
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,383
Yeah, we just passed
the convenience store.

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,136
Left turn, left turn.

24
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,770
Yes, if you go straight from there,
you'll see the RV.

25
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,980
Oh, okay. Thank you, Seonha.

26
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,732
Of course.

27
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,068
Oh, no. This is all because of me.

28
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,320
No Seonha, this isn't your fault.

29
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,948
Those demons Sa Junggyeong and Gi Osung
are the ones to blame.

30
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,744
Chanmi will be able to get to Sooheon
before something bad happens, right?

31
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,724
Sooheon!

32
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,643
Sooheon!

33
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,103
Seok Jaebum.

34
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,606
I won't forgive you for this.

35
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,072
Shit.

36
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,452
You!

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,915
What is this?
That wasn't that bastard Ji Sooheon!

38
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,167
The police are here. Go, now.

39
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,543
Fuck, hang tight.

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,259
Fuck.

41
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,852
Gi Osung.

42
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,231
I guess you have some explaining to do?

43
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,905
Fuck.

44
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,532
Hey, Seok Jaebum.

45
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,576
Were you the one who smashed my foot?

46
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,869
I know it wasn't you, huh?

47
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,038
I guess you were waiting for someone else?

48
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,249
Do you have a death wish, you bastard?

49
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,421
Who was it?

50
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,715
The one you were waiting for?

51
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,634
You know who he is, don't you?

52
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,888
Stop it.

53
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,600
The livestream is over.

54
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,060
You guys need to come with me
to the police station.

55
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,104
Gi Osung just had to screw up like this.

56
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,105
You.

57
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,774
Hand me that mask.

58
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,861
What are you doing?
I asked you to hand over the evidence.

59
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,239
Hurry up and get out of there.

60
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,700
This RV needs to be preserved
for evidence.

61
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,166
FUNERAL HALL

62
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,294
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

63
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,449
It was Gi Osung
who planned the incident last night.

64
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,118
He had several assistants
to put together his livestream,

65
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,330
including Sa Junggyeong,
his cousin, and his friend.

66
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,539
GI WANGDO, HEAD OF YONGTAN POLICE STATION

67
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,167
Sa Junggyeong's cousin and his friend
have criminal records.

68
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,086
I let the five people involved
with the livestream incident

69
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,588
go back home on the condition

70
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,922
that they come
to the station this morning.

71
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,591
What's wrong with them?

72
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,844
Why the hell are they playing cops
and robbers? On a livestream?

73
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,138
Sir. This wasn't a game.

74
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,890
They had a clear intention
to catch the culprit

75
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,601
and reveal his identity
to their fellow students.

76
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,061
Yeah, I know!

77
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,189
Osung set a trap to catch the culprit,

78
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,899
and he had set up the camera, right?

79
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:03,154
Gi Osung seems to know a lot
about these recent cases.

80
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,741
Are you implying that

81
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,494
there's a clear connection
to the body shop incident?

82
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,079
That is what I suspect.

83
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,165
I'll report to you
after the investigation.

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,842
Detective Jin.

85
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,969
What?

86
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,180
Do you remember the guy
who was wearing the mask?

87
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,223
Seok Jaebum?

88
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,516
He's the only son of the owner
of Seungpil Group.

89
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,725
A grandson of a chaebol.

90
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,604
-So?
-He's here with 2 lawyers.

91
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,733
Let's go.

92
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,327
I'm Detective Jin Sojeong.

93
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,037
I'm Mr. Seok's lawyer.

94
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,582
-Good morning.
-Why don't we head inside?

95
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,669
Sir, I'd like to be questioned alone,
if possible.

96
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,004
Ah, you don't have to do that.
No need to feel pressured.

97
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,589
We'll just be there to listen in.

98
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,674
It's not anything
to be concerned about anyway.

99
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,633
Of course.

100
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,803
Since it's not a big deal,
I'd like to be questioned alone.

101
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,513
Would that be okay, Detective?

102
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,181
Yes.

103
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:22,316
I've known that Sa Junggyeong
lives in that RV since last month.

104
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,402
How?

105
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,448
Because I've seen him smoking
in front of his RV while driving.

106
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,868
-Do you have a license?
-Yes.

107
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,538
I'm not a minor.

108
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,417
Then did you drive to the RV
with your car?

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,960
No, I took a taxi.

110
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,546
Because I had been drinking
at a nearby park.

111
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,591
I was watching the livestream there

112
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,384
when suddenly Sa Junggyeong came on.

113
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,970
So I assumed that Gi Osung

114
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,514
was staging a hero act
with the livestream.

115
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:58,811
That's when I suddenly felt
this strong urge to punish Sa Junggyeong

116
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,730
just as the hero would.

117
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,857
You know the hero, right?

118
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,027
The hero who crushed Sa Junggyeong's foot
earlier this semester.

119
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,702
Anyways, I didn't want to lose
the chance to claim the title,

120
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,579
so I took a taxi and headed to the RV.

121
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
What about the mask?

122
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,127
Do you always carry a mask with you?

123
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,755
No, of course not.

124
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,758
I found it on the road.

125
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,760
-The mask?
-Yes.

126
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,762
I thought of that as part
of playing a hero.

127
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,348
So I put the mask on and headed to the RV.

128
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,061
I trusted that Osung would help me out
if things went wrong.

129
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,147
Do you still believe
that the livestream incident

130
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,316
was a part of a hero make-believe?

131
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,196
I mean...

132
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,199
I could never have imagined

133
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,576
that I'd see Osung
make a facial expression like that.

134
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,206
After taking my mask off,
Osung looked very surprised at first.

135
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,500
Then he became extremely mad.

136
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,586
That was the moment when

137
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,881
I thought maybe
this wasn't actually a prank.

138
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,758
That's what crossed my mind.

139
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,177
Oh, by the way, Detective.

140
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,096
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

141
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,641
Will this be considered a crime?

142
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,442
We're trying to figure out right now
whether it will be or not.

143
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,611
Ah.

144
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,697
I see.

145
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,663
Jaebum, could you tell me about the reason

146
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,456
why you took a year off from school?

147
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,133
Well, that's not really related
to what happened last night,

148
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,467
but I'll tell you.

149
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,054
I was involved in a traffic accident.

150
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,683
I was in the hospital for half a year.

151
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,768
I even lost all of my memories.

152
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:16,240
I wanted to get revenge
on the guy who did this to my foot.

153
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,535
It's not a crime to think that, is it?

154
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,955
Did you not understand what I said?

155
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,499
I'm asking how you knew
the hero was going to come to your RV.

156
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,129
Detective, how would you know
when a fish would come to bite your bait

157
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,130
while you're fishing?

158
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,383
You just leave the bait and wait.

159
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,135
What was the bait?

160
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,638
The bait?

161
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,599
Junggyeong,

162
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,434
you couldn't have been the bait.

163
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,519
You had already been punished

164
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,812
and even transferred
to a different school.

165
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,980
Why would he come back
to punish you again?

166
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,358
Well...

167
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,400
Min Seonha.

168
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
I know you've been harassing her again.

169
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,491
If you started harassing her again,
the hero would come back for you.

170
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,160
That was the bait, wasn't it?

171
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,123
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

172
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,502
How did Gi Osung get involved with this?

173
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,379
Gi Osung was the one who approached me
about it. About catching the hero.

174
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,297
Why did he want to catch the hero?

175
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,174
Has the hero done anything to Gi Osung?

176
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,301
I don't know about that.

177
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,594
But in any case, Gi Osung told me

178
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
it would be fun to do a livestream
and asked me to join.

179
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,140
So Gi Osung knows who the hero is?

180
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,894
Because he was planning to unmask
the hero on his livestream.

181
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,940
I said I have no idea.

182
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,820
Why was your gangster cousin
there with you during the livestream?

183
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,863
The vehicle that was used
for the livestream belongs to him.

184
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,741
He was just helping a cousin.

185
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,499
Don't you feel like Gi Osung used you?

186
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,299
I'm not so sure about that.

187
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,392
I think I was being careless.

188
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,020
This is the last time
I would ever do something like this.

189
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,439
I'm not here for your apology.

190
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,190
I need you to tell us
what really happened.

191
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,192
We don't think this was a prank.

192
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,028
I just wanted to become popular
with the other kids.

193
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,613
Do you think the other kids enjoyed it?

194
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,699
What?

195
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,908
I'm asking if you thought the other kids

196
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,785
would enjoy you revealing
the hero's identity.

197
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,454
The kids love the hero.

198
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,915
But what you did could've put him
at risk of being arrested.

199
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,420
Wouldn't that have caused the other kids
to blame you for causing his arrest?

200
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,965
The result would have been
the opposite of what you had wanted.

201
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,718
I'm pretty sure
you had that figured out already.

202
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,429
I didn't consider that possibility.

203
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,807
You just wanted to hand
the hero over to us,

204
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,852
even if it meant
that you'd risk getting blamed for it.

205
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,897
Come on.

206
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,774
That's just not true.

207
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,485
What did you think about Seok Jaebum
putting on a mask?

208
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,404
-And coming to the RV?
-You should ask him about that.

209
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,572
I'm asking what you thought about it.

210
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,032
Of course,
I had no idea that would happen.

211
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,283
It made things more fun though.

212
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,286
That's why I'm saying
that the livestream was just for fun.

213
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,997
It didn't seem like you were
enjoying it though, in the livestream.

214
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,250
Your expression was priceless
when you took Seok Jaebum's mask off.

215
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,169
Your face looked really mad.

216
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,047
I was just really shocked is all.

217
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,799
Who were you expecting to see?

218
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,134
Whose face did you want to reveal on air
when you took that mask off?

219
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,928
I didn't have anyone in mind.

220
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,890
I believe you already know about
Park Wonseok's murder case, yes?

221
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,017
Since you were in the same school,
same year?

222
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,018
Of course I do.

223
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,770
And I believe you're already familiar
with Ju Hyeokgeon's case,

224
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,854
the juvenile delinquent, correct?

225
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,733
Since you went to the same middle school
as Ju Hyeokgeon,

226
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,861
and your study café receipt
was found at the crime scene?

227
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,196
Yes, I'm aware of that.

228
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,449
We believe these cases
are connected to each other.

229
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,952
In both of the murder cases,

230
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,497
the victims were punished by the hero.

231
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

232
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,504
No, I think you know perfectly well
what I'm talking about.

233
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,385
Me?

234
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,096
Ah.

235
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
I do know.

236
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,558
I know about all three of those cases.

237
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,188
Besides that, what else would I know?

238
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,190
Are you trying to make me out
to be a scapegoat?

239
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,068
What you wanted was to hand the hero
over to the police,

240
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,820
since we failed to arrest the culprit.

241
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,073
It may have seemed like
you were trying to reveal who the hero was

242
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,993
to the students through the livestream,
but actually you wanted the police to see.

243
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,369
Stop talking nonsense.

244
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,789
And once the police arrested the hero
from Sa Junggyeong's case,

245
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,294
the hero would be under investigation
for all the other cases as well.

246
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,094
Have I revealed too much of your plans?

247
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,182
This is a pretty common trick
criminals use to distract the police.

248
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,434
Are you telling me

249
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,438
I'm a suspect in both murder cases?

250
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,490
I personally believe

251
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,328
Ji Sooheon's the killer.

252
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,810
GO GO STADIUM MEMBERS

253
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,911
I'm here to pay my respects.

254
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,739
May your mother rest in peace.

255
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,450
I know things will be hard for you,

256
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,536
but I hope you're able
to find some peace of mind.

257
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,579
Thank you.

258
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,039
My deepest condolences to you.

259
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,334
Thank you.

260
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,678
REST IN PEACE

261
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,929
Please have some food before you leave.

262
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,347
It's okay, thank you.

263
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,099
Honey, let's go.

264
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,225
I wish you all well.

265
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,526
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

266
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,113
Maybe we should've stayed longer.
There weren't that many people in there.

267
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,033
My presence would've only
made him feel uncomfortable.

268
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,993
You think so?

269
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,162
Anyways, I feel bad for Ji Sooheon.

270
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,040
He's completely alone in this world now.

271
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,216
Come on, let's have some lunch too.

272
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,723
Sooheon.

273
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,767
I know you probably
don't have much of an appetite,

274
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,268
but you have to eat something.

275
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,103
Okay. You guys eat up, too.

276
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,356
Thank you for helping me out.

277
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,986
We don't know much
about what to do at a funeral.

278
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,322
So if there's anything you have in mind,
just let us know.

279
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,324
Okay, sounds good.

280
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,201
Let's eat.

281
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,288
Ah, Jaebum.

282
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,958
Do you know the people who were just here?

283
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,754
Yes, they're cops.

284
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,258
That woman was the police officer
who raided Sa Junggyeong's RV last night.

285
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,218
Who was the man?

286
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,136
He's probably a cop as well.

287
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,846
That's just overkill.

288
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,473
The cops followed you to the funeral?

289
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,933
They're here to pay their respects.

290
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,062
Were you okay at the police station?

291
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,856
I'm sorry I got you involved in that.

292
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,316
Nah, it's nothing.

293
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,027
I told them it was out of curiosity,

294
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,279
and they couldn't find anything
to charge me with.

295
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,866
How did you explain the mask to them?

296
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,828
I just told them I found it
on the side of the road near the RV.

297
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,871
And did they believe you?

298
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,166
Well, that's what I told them.
What else could they do?

299
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,711
Let's talk about that some other time.

300
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,508
Let's eat.

305
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,310
Thank you guys

306
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,520
for all your help.

307
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,742
Actually,

308
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,078
Park Wonseok is here too.

309
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,295
Well, I guess you could say
I was close to Park Wonseok.

310
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,507
But I never knew where his ashes were.
I've never been here before, either.

311
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,301
I'm sorry, Chanmi.

312
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
No worries.

313
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,095
Where is he?

314
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,141
Let's go together to pay respects.

315
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,268
Uh...

316
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,103
Yeah? Shall we then?

319
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,320
Ah, shit.

320
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,738
I know that photo.

321
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,824
He showed it to me,
saying he looked great in it.

322
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,411
Why in the world can't the police
manage to catch the killer?

323
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,580
Are they even investigating it?

324
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,791
We may not know who did it,

325
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,127
but if the suspect managed
to play that video in the auditorium,

326
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,797
shouldn't they have already arrested
the suspect by now?

327
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,298
What are they doing? Seriously.

328
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,178
Chanmi.

329
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,515
Do you and Sooheon know something?

330
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,984
We have a suspect

331
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,986
in mind.

332
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,987
Seriously?

333
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,411
The person who I think did it is...

334
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,955
Gi Osung.

335
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,542
Gi Osung?

336
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,751
Gi Osung?

337
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,422
I'm pretty sure of it.
It's more than a hunch.

338
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,550
But I haven't shared it
with the police yet.

339
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,260
What's keeping you?

340
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,929
It's because his father
is the head of the police station.

341
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,183
Oh, actually, it's because
I don't have definitive evidence yet.

342
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,729
I also feel like I won't feel satisfied

343
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,356
if I just hand him over to the police.

344
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,486
Are you sure it's Gi Osung?

345
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,863
I'm almost certain.

346
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,576
I'm sure this goes without saying,

347
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,829
but let's just keep
this to ourselves for now.

348
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,955
Of course.

349
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,123
Don't worry.

350
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,958
You don't need to worry about me either.

351
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,376
Okay.

352
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,549
-Hey, what are you looking at, stop, huh?
-Damn.

353
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,925
Hey! It's the masked Jaebum.

354
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,177
Oh, yeah.

355
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,554
You're late for class.
That's exactly what a hero would do.

356
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,683
I had to help Sooheon place
his mother's urn in a columbarium.

357
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,645
Oh. I see.

358
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,358
You're a real hero
for helping a friend in need.

359
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,777
-I'm off.
-Okay.

360
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,330
We need to talk.

361
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,048
Seok Jaebum.

362
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,972
I'm not going to treat you
as a friend anymore

363
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,724
since you've crossed the line.

364
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,228
I don't care about
what you've said to the police,

365
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,146
but I hope we can be frank
with each other.

366
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,567
On the night of the livestream,

367
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,444
you ran into Ji Sooheon near the RV,
didn't you?

368
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,613
That's why you wore Ji Sooheon's mask

369
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,781
and went into the RV
instead of him, isn't it?

370
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,324
Do I even have to answer your question

371
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,992
when you already seem to have
an answer you want to hear?

372
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,828
Don't be a coward. Tell me.

373
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,832
You met up with Ji Sooheon
and wore his mask.

374
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,378
Why were you helping Ji Sooheon?
Why did you betray me?

375
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,963
Betray you?

376
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,714
Seok Jaebum, had it not been for you,

377
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,425
I would've caught Ji Sooheon.

378
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,888
He would've said something
while beating Sa Junggyeong up in the RV.

379
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,056
Please, no. It wasn't me.

380
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,183
He wouldn't have known
he was on a livestream.

381
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,894
He would've said something like,

382
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,564
"you need another beating
since you haven't learned your lesson."

383
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,442
He would've crushed Sa Junggyeong
for Min Seonha's sake.

384
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,902
Did you like that?

385
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,529
That was all supposed
to be livestreamed.

386
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,739
Seok Jaebum,
why are you getting in my way? Why?

387
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,491
I didn't want Ji Sooheon to get caught.

388
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,204
Ah.

389
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,207
I knew it.

390
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,917
You two met up that night.

391
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,210
If I'm being more specific,

392
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,796
I didn't want Ji Sooheon
to be caught by you.

393
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,715
What did Ji Sooheon ever do for you?

394
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,634
Has he done more for you than I have?

395
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,721
And you still have the nerve to betray me?

396
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,224
You think you've done a lot for me?

397
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,519
You think you've treated me well?

398
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,150
Ugh, I guess that's just how it goes.

399
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,611
There's no point in being nice to people.

400
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,530
Ugh, am I really that clueless?

401
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,784
I told you everything
you couldn't remember

402
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,661
and helped you recover.

403
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,455
And now you have the audacity
to question what I've done for you?

404
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,664
Don't you remember
you came to me for help,

405
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,875
asking all kinds of questions?

406
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,293
Was the time and effort
I put into you all for nothing?

407
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,878
That was probably your way

408
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,757
of manipulating me
and planting what you wanted me to think.

409
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,304
Why did you give me pictures
of just me and Park Wonseok?

410
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,556
Wasn't that your way

411
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,685
of making me think I was dating
Park Wonseok before I lost my memory?

412
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:26,358
I know there were other photos
of you, me, Park Wonseok, and Gwon Sejin.

413
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,859
Don't you think you're overreacting?

414
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,277
Your imagination
must be popping off right now.

415
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,987
Answer my question.

416
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,200
What was my intention in only
giving you photos of you and Park Wonseok?

417
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,705
It was to make sure you could remember.

418
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,542
The relationship you had
with Park Wonseok.

419
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,212
That's what's important.
The other two people don't matter.

420
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,506
What is it you want me to remember?

421
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,634
Are you trying to get me to recognize
the memories you've cherry-picked for me?

422
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,386
At this point,
you probably won't even believe me

423
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,222
even if I tell you the truth.

424
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,769
So I'll give you a clue.

425
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,230
Your family's company building.

426
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,066
The building next to the horse track.

427
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,694
The building where you jumped from
to commit suicide.

428
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,779
Well,

429
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,699
after all, you survived
and ended up in a coma instead.

430
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,828
Seok Jaebum.

431
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,081
And even though you've betrayed me,

432
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,501
you'll soon come to appreciate
what I've done for you.

433
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,877
You'll come back to me,

434
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,046
knowing that I'm the only ally
you can count on.

435
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,800
Once you remember
what happened at that building.

436
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,843
Can you tell me something?

437
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,637
What do you want me to tell you?

438
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,680
I don't care about the topic.

439
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,932
Just...

440
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,893
-I just want to hear someone talking.
-Hmm.

441
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,936
How about a YouTube video?

442
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,939
That's fine.

443
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,816
Just talk about anything.

444
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,485
Okay.

445
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,029
Then I'm just going to tell you
something random, yeah?

446
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,155
Okay.

447
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,115
Hmm.

448
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,492
Okay.

449
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,996
It was during winter break
of my second year of middle school.

450
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,539
I was planning to meet up
with my older brother

451
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,707
after a long time apart.

452
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,669
Since I was living in Busan,
and he was living in Seoul,

453
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,171
we decided to meet
somewhere in the middle.

454
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,923
Uh, Daejeon. It was in Daejeon.

455
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,010
The thing is, it was a pretty cold day,
but even still,

456
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,345
he suddenly showed me his belly,

457
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,596
saying he wanted me
to check out his six-pack.

458
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,557
He said he'd been working out really hard
and got a six-pack.

459
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:10,146
But I couldn't see any muscle
no matter how hard I looked.

460
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,648
It was completely flat.

461
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,902
But when I looked more closely,
I noticed there was something there

462
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,112
about the size of a quarter.

463
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,322
Whether it was muscle or not,
I don't know.

464
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,576
It looked like a flat surface
with thin circular tiles,

465
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,370
like a jade mat or something.

466
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,332
That's why I started calling him
Jade Mat from that point on.

467
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,209
You know how our last name means jade?

468
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,170
So, I changed his name on
my phone to Jade Mat

469
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,005
and called him that
whenever I sent him a message.

470
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,883
He begged me to change it,

471
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,512
so I decided to be generous
and changed his name back to Ok Chankyu.

472
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,819
The sun's about to set.

473
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,297
It looks like it's cooked.

474
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,632
I think so. I'll try one.

475
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,011
It's hot.

476
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,641
Hmm. Hey, have some. Have some.

477
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,310
Mmm.

478
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,853
Delicious.

479
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,496
This is the photo my brother sent me.

480
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,622
He told me he had taken it

481
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,123
while he was on a date
with his girlfriend.

482
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,210
Like this?

483
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,003
Yeah.

484
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,590
He told me Ajung was his girlfriend
then shared this photo with me.

485
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,091
But Ajung said they weren't actually
dating each other.

486
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,969
-That it was just a fake relationship.
-Oh.

487
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,305
She told me she's allergic to clams.

488
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,599
But...

489
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,726
Ah...

490
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,236
even though he said it was his girlfriend,

491
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:26,324
I wonder if the person
he was actually dating

492
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,117
was one of the people in this photo.

493
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,495
I've never heard of anything
like that before.

494
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,291
Just something I was thinking about.

495
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,296
Maybe one of these four guys
might know something?

496
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,383
If that's the case...

497
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,969
Seok Jaebum has lost all his memories...

498
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,430
Gwon Sejin is out of reach
since he left for the United States...

499
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,059
My older brother can't tell us
anything about it...

500
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,147
So the only one left is Gi Osung.

501
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,358
Are you saying Gi Osung's
the only one who can tell us?

502
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,653
I guess he's both a suspect
and a witness at the same time.

503
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,322
We need to find a way to get him to talk.

504
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,208
I shouldn't have brought it up.

505
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,794
Let's just eat for now. Eat.

506
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,296
Okay.

507
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,259
Eat up.

508
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,807
Come in.

509
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,321
Why are you taking away
my phone all of a sudden?

510
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,116
Isn't it obvious?

511
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,410
I promised you I won't ever do
another livestream anymore.

512
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,454
What's going on with you recently?

513
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,581
Have you lost your mind?

514
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,292
At the police station,
the guys are talking about

515
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,252
whether they should look
into my own son as a murder suspect.

516
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,048
Meanwhile, my very son
is playing pranks and imitating crimes!

517
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,052
Is this what I get for trusting you?

518
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,264
Stop getting involved
in all this weird nonsense.

519
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,475
I forbid you to go anywhere else
but school and home.

520
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,186
Where's your answer?

521
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,272
-Yes, father.
-Now go.

522
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,938
Who are you?

523
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,998
-Uh, Jaebum.
-Hey.

524
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,877
-I'm not late, am I?
-No, I just got here early.

525
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,962
I'm sorry I asked to meet up
so early in the morning.

526
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,423
No worries. It's fine. What's up?

527
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,009
I have a favor to ask you.

528
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,471
Seems like every time we meet,
I'm asking for a favor. Sorry.

529
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,890
In that case,
let me ask you for a favor first.

530
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,059
Stop saying you're sorry. Please.

531
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,646
Okay, done.

532
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,649
So, what is it? Tell me.

533
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,944
Ah, uh...

534
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,990
It's about Gi Osung.

535
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,159
Gi Osung?

536
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,786
Yeah.

537
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,424
Have you thought
more about that clue I gave you?

538
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,344
Did you remember anything?

539
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,098
That employee training building.

540
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,686
Does it have something to do
with Park Wonseok?

541
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,687
Ooh.

542
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,313
Whoa, what else?

543
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:58,698
Osung, I promise I'll trust what you say,
so can you just tell me the truth?

544
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,074
You're going to trust me?

545
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,495
I will.

546
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,373
You're the only person who can tell me
the truth now.

547
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,001
Please.

548
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,964
I'm just so frustrated.

549
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,799
Please, Osung.

550
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,303
Jaebum.

551
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,639
You've been good about solving
all the riddles up until now.

552
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,601
You're so close,
but your explanations still fall short.

553
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,936
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

554
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,523
You figured out it wasn't
a car accident, right? That's correct.

555
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,192
It wasn't a car accident.

556
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,612
You remembered that you tried to kill
yourself at the stables, right?

557
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,531
It wasn't the stables.

558
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,534
It was the employee
training building next to it.

559
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,746
Do you realize that tomorrow
will mark a year

560
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,122
since the incident happened?

561
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,957
April 22nd.

562
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,503
We went horse riding together that day
because it was school foundation day.

563
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,547
So I jumped from

564
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,884
the employee training building.

565
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,261
You're right about falling from the roof
of the employee training building.

566
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,305
But that wasn't something
you decided to do on your own.

567
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,434
What do you mean?

568
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,144
Someone

569
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,689
pushed you off from the roof
of the building, and you fell.

570
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,072
Are you serious?

571
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,115
I thought you said
you were going to trust me?

572
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,493
You said you were going to trust
what I told you.

573
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,913
If you don't believe me,
we can just stop here.

574
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,207
I trust you.

575
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,251
I trust what you're saying.

576
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,879
Who do you think

577
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,132
pushed you off the rooftop?

578
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,230
Was it Park Wonseok?

579
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,483
Correct.

580
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,446
You've solved all the riddles.

581
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,949
It was Park Wonseok.

582
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,660
The one who put you in a coma.

583
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,414
Your parents were busy sweeping it
under the rug

584
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,708
because they thought
you had tried to kill yourself.

585
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,252
But it was Park Wonseok who did it.

586
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,754
How...

587
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,966
how do you know
it was Park Wonseok who did it?

588
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,720
I saw him with my own eyes.

589
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,221
You saw him?

590
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,642
-If you did, why...
-Why didn't I report him to the police?

591
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,103
Why didn't I tell your parents about it?

592
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,442
Because Park Wonseok saw me as well.

593
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,319
That means...

594
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,238
Hey, Seok Jaebum, Gi Osung.

595
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,365
What are you guys doing here?

596
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,660
Go back to class, now.

597
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,607
Mom, have you been reunited with Soomin?

598
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,524
DATE OF BIRTH JULY 2ND 2002
JI SOOMIN

599
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,609
DATE OF DEATH MAR 18TH 2019

600
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,526
DATE OF BIRTH DEC 3RD 1974
SHIN YOOKYUNG

601
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,903
Soomin, are you with Mom?

602
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,159
I'm jealous of you guys.

603
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,543
Wow, that's so pretty.

604
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,920
Really?

605
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,129
Hey, Ji Sooheon.

606
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,172
YONGTAN HIGH
READING & DEBATE COMPETITION

607
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,799
Hey, long time no see.

608
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,135
I heard about your mother.

609
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,554
I couldn't be there to pay my respects

610
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,265
because I was held up
at the police station, thanks to you.

611
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,811
I hope you understand.

612
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,023
You.

613
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,735
I guess you dragged
Seok Jaebum into it too.

614
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,030
You may have escaped this time
thanks to him,

615
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,615
but time's ticking for you.

616
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,328
I feel so sorry for you.

617
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
You'll have no one to visit you
once you're in jail.

618
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,549
Leave me! Shit!

619
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,134
Sooheon, calm down, calm down, okay?

620
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,689
Huh, huh? Hey, Sooheon.

621
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,023
-Sooheon!
-What's going on?

622
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,191
Sooheon, Sooheon!

623
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,276
Sooheon.

624
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,277
-Wake up, Sooheon.
-Sooheon, Sooheon.

625
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,945
-Hey, Sooheon. What's going on?
-Sooheon, Sooheon, Are you okay?

626
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,655
-What's going on?
-Mr. Jo!

627
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,865
Tell me what's going on!

628
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,950
-Sooheon, are you all right?
-Sooheon! Hey, Sooheon, wake up!

629
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:53,868
-Ji Sooheon!
-Ji Sooheon!

630
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,035
Wake up!

631
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,078
-Sooheon, Sooheon.
-Sooheon, are you all right?

632
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,329
Hey! Hey, what's going on with you?

633
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,831
Hi, this is Yongtan High School...

634
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,166
Open your eyes.

635
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,211
It was Park Wonseok.

636
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,047
The one who put you in a coma.

637
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,270
What happened?

638
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,938
He was fighting Gi Osung
when he suddenly passed out.

639
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,190
What should we do?

640
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,357
Where are you going, sir?

641
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,235
To the nearest hospital.
Get out of the way. Move.

642
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,154
You need to go to Woosung Hospital.
He has a brain tumor.

643
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,489
There's a doctor there
who's taking care of him.

644
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,531
You need to go there.

645
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,657
Call Woosung Hospital,
and you, get in the ambulance.

646
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,909
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

647
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,877
AMBULANCE
119 EMERGENCY

648
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,505
Everyone, go inside. Go inside, everyone.

649
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,258
Sooheon...

650
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,594
has a brain tumor...

651
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,559
DESIGNATED MEETING TIME
BY MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE

652
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,477
12:00 - 14:00
17:30 - 20:00

653
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,394
ENTRANCE TO THE FACILITY IS LIMITED
TO VISITING HOURS

654
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,312
WE ASK FOR YOUR COOPERATION

655
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,690
I believe we met at the funeral, no?

656
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,067
Yes, we did.

657
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,151
It seems you already knew that Sooheon

658
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,153
was coming to this hospital
and that he was sick?

659
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,616
Is Sooheon okay?

660
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,076
I don't believe his life
is at risk right now.

661
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,413
Sooheon will be asleep
for the next 24 hours.

662
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,249
So don't worry about him and go home.

663
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,583
I'll call you once he's awake.

664
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,961
Thank you, sir.

665
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,337
See you later.

666
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,839
Excuse me, doctor.

667
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,096
Will Sooheon really

668
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,682
die because of this?

669
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,475
His condition might become critical
at some point,

670
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,270
or it might stay the same as it is now.

671
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,438
What do you mean it might stay
the same as it is now?

672
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,107
Are you asking when the end might be?

673
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,693
It's just like what life is like
for the rest of us.

674
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,070
We do our best and keep moving along.

675
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,156
That's what's important. Trying our best.

676
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,850
Go back to class, now.

677
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,607
What happened after Park Wonseok saw you?

678
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,944
What kept you from reporting him
to the police?

679
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,654
Tell me the truth.

680
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,491
Okay, I wasn't going to,
but I'll tell you what you want.

681
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,118
You really should thank me.

682
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,120
I had to save myself.

683
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:47,041
Park Wonseok knew one of my weaknesses
and had me in a bind.

684
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,587
You didn't report him
for fear of him revealing your weakness?

685
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,422
Jaebum.

686
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,759
Reporting him
wouldn't have changed anything.

687
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,220
Besides, you fell into a coma
after falling from the rooftop.

688
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,058
And Park Wonseok
is no longer a part of this world.

689
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,394
That's why I told you.

690
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,064
Not to get too close with Ok Chanmi,
Park Wonseok's younger sister.

691
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,318
But you didn't listen to me
and you became close with them anyway.

692
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,278
Jaebum.

693
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,280
I deserve better.

694
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,948
Park Wonseok.

695
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,662
Why did Park Wonseok do that to me?

696
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,871
I have no clue.

697
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,957
It was between you and Park Wonseok.

698
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,270
I did some research online during class.

699
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,856
Brain tumors can be deadly.

700
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,441
If you get surgery,

701
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,236
you might live.

702
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,988
Why didn't he tell us he was sick?

703
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,200
If he hid it from us,
does that mean it's serious?

704
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,369
Why is this happening

705
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,456
to Sooheon?

706
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,125
I can't believe it either.

707
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,545
Call Chanmi again.

708
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,091
The number you dialed is...

709
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,927
Her cell phone's off.

710
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,388
Seriously, what's going on?

711
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,607
Who do you think

712
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,277
pushed you off the rooftop?

713
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,906
It was Park Wonseok.

714
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,326
The one who put you in a coma.

715
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,852
I feel like I'm losing my mind!

716
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,104
I get the feeling that
I did something that I didn't do.

717
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,940
And for things that I did do,
I have no memory of them.

718
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,192
Who are you?

719
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,194
Was I the one

720
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,529
who killed Park Wonseok?

721
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,510
Wow, that was a great meal.
Wow, I'm so full.

722
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,303
-Did you enjoy that?
-Yes.

723
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,056
It was so delicious!

724
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,182
Good.

725
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,977
Wow, it's really such a nice day.

726
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,145
Ah!

727
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:02,486
It feels good to be out here with my sons.

728
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,240
You chose the right day to go out.

729
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,204
How long has it been since we all
went out on an outing like this?

730
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,003
Mom?

731
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,589
Soomin?

732
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,843
Mom!

733
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,262
Soomin?

734
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,138
Soomin?

735
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,518
Mom!

736
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,728
Mom!

737
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,389
WELLNESS CENTER

738
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,226
Ok Chanmi was in the ambulance with you
and brought you to the hospital.

739
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,186
Ok Chanmi?

740
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,898
Yes, it was fortunate
that I was able to see you right away.

741
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,691
What?

742
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,193
I thought you told her
about the brain tumor.

743
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,695
It seemed like
she already knew everything.

744
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,948
Ah, yes.

745
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,409
If you feel something's off,
come see me right away.

746
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,161
Yes, sir.

747
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,413
-Take care.
-Thank you, sir.

748
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,262
The number you've called does not exist.

749
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,513

OK CHANMI
SENT A VIDEO

755
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,827
Sooheon, are you okay?

756
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,248
I guess you're probably awake
if you're watching this video right now.

757
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,175
I'm going to give it all up.

758
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,512
I had come to Seoul

759
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,515
because I was frustrated
and wanted to catch the murderer.

760
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,475
Only to realize that it's all in vain.

761
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:45,190
I can't do anything for my brother,
or rather, Park Wonseok anymore.

762
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,944
My brother...

763
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,738
tried to kill

764
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,366
Seok Jaebum.

765
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,160
Jaebum survived,

766
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,246
but that doesn't change the fact
that my brother tried to kill him.

767
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,164
Also...

768
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,083
Sooheon.

769
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,546
It's time for you to stop working
on my brother's case as well.

770
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,881
It's time for you
to go back to your own life.

771
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,509
I don't think I should keep pursuing this.

772
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,388
This will be the last time
I'll be in touch with you,

773
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,849
so you shouldn't reach out to me either.

774
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,810
Take your mind off this case.

775
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,397
I hope you're able
to enjoy your life more.

776
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,650
I'm sorry for everything.

777
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,029
And thank you.

Ji Sooheon

780
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,328
I feel really bad that you are sick.

781
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,040
I'm sorry that I couldn't do
anything to help you.

782
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,335
I'll always pray that you'll be okay

783
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,921
and that nothing bad
will ever happen to you.

784
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,967
I made this bracelet
with your mom's shoelaces you gave me.

785
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,554
A red string bracelet
might just bring you some luck.

786
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,640
If I have good luck,

787
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,185
I'll pray to god so that he sends
my luck over to you.

788
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,438
Stay healthy.

Please accept my apology.

00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,756
I'm so sorry.

793
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,425
Don't forgive Park Wonseok.

794
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,180
I know you told me not to say sorry,
but I should say it anyway.

795
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,476
Jaebum, I'm so sorry.

796
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:56,483
And thank you so much.

797
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,342
My brother...

798
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,680
tried to kill Seok Jaebum.

799
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,934
That might be true,
but how did Chanmi find out about it?

00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,436
Hey.

801
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,313
I guess you dragged Seok Jaebum
into it too.

802
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,067
Gi Osung knows everything
about Seok Jaebum, right?

803
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,362
GI OSUNG

804
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,280
CALLING
GI OSUNG

805
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,451
The number you are trying to...

806
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,475
-Sir, please wait out here.
-Okay.

807
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,604
What are you doing, dumbnut?
Hurry up and get him.

808
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,498
-Hey. Get lost.
-Okay.

809
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,292
I'll wait in the taxi.

810
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,501
Fuck off.

811
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,338
Do you want to die?

812
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,506
I'm a hundred percent sure
I saw the suspect running away.

813
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,799
The murderer was wearing a pair
of white sneakers with red shoelaces.

814
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,343
White sneakers with red shoelaces.

815
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,720
I don't recall anyone else wearing
those shoes other than Ji Sooheon...

816
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,556
Then are you saying the suspect
is pretending to be like Ji Sooheon?

817
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,604
Did you fucking lose your phone?

818
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,273
Why haven't you been answering?

819
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,608
My father took it away.

820
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,651
What's up?

821
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,366
-Get in. We can talk when we get there.
-About what?

822
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,326
Fuck, are you going to just leave
things this way?

823
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,620
Get in for now.
We'll talk when we're there.

824
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,138
Are you really going to let it go

825
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,348
after all the shame I had to go through?

826
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,432
Listen, you bastard!

827
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,475
Didn't you tell me Ji Sooheon
is behind all this?

828
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,976
Now, look what a mess you've made.

829
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,145
Hey, what are we going to do
about Ji Sooheon?

830
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,563
We gotta kill him, don't we?!

831
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,107
Fuck, just hold your horses.

832
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,567
I have a plan in mind.

833
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,946
Hey, you bastard, you think you're
gonna kill him by just talking about it?

834
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,697
Get Ji Sooheon and bring him to me.

835
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,867
Are you out of your fucking mind?

836
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:53,910
Hey,

837
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,995
do you have a death wish?

838
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,483
Ah, what the fuck!

839
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,027
What was that?

840
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,619
What the fuck?

841
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,375
Move! I'll kill you! Get out!

842
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:47,464
Did you tell Ok Chanmi that Park Wonseok
tried to kill Seok Jaebum?

843
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,923
I told Seok Jaebum that yesterday.

844
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,759
Well, that was quick.

845
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,220
And Seok Jaebum doesn't know about it?

846
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,973
Even though Park Wonseok
tried to kill him?

847
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,641
Of course he doesn't know.

848
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,393
He has absolutely no memories.

849
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,520
I think you made up that story

850
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,483
to frame Seok Jaebum
as Park Wonseok's killer.

851
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,234
You crazy bastard.

852
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,820
Stop talking nonsense. Get out!

853
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,123
-You killed Park Wonseok, didn't you?
-You're crazy!

854
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,666
I'm done listening to your nonsense.
Get out already!

855
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,545
Gi Osung, you need to die.

856
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,173
You crazy bastard!

857
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,023
Let me go!

858
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,484
Let me go.

859
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,690

863
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,554
We went horse riding together that day

It was the employee
training building next to it.

867
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,071
Do you realize that tomorrow

We went horse riding together that day
