12-06 HIM OR YOU -
ONE OF YOU WILL DIE

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,399
KNOWING THE DATE OF YOUR DEATH

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,879
MEANS YOU ALREADY
HAVE STARTED DYING.

<i>Emergency service,
how can I help you?</i>

<i>Hello, this is Anna on Prenzlauer
Allee, and there has been an emergency.</i>

8
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
<i>And I think somebody died.</i>

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,439
<i>It's dark. I don't feel safe.</i>

10
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,000
<i>- Come quickly. There are injured people.
- Help is on the way. Please stay calm.</i>

But there won't be
anyone right now.

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Right.

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,719

<i>Hi, this is Caro.</i>

31
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
Hello, Caro.

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,439
<i>I'm at the bus stop
at Mexikoplatz and...</i>

33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,959
<i>There are some guys
across the street.</i>

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,719
<i>They keep staring. I'm scared
they're going to come over.</i>

35
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,999
Are you waiting for the bus?

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,319
{\an8}<i>Yeah, for the 109. It
should be here by now.</i>

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,119
{\an8}Okay, Caro.

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,120
How many guys are
there? How old?

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
<i>Five.</i>

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,079
<i>I have no idea how old they are.</i>

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,679
<i>Young. They're all
wearing hoodies.</i>

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,239
Okay. Don't show them your fear.

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,480
Stand under a streetlight,
so you're well-lit.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,720
<i>- They're coming over. What do I do?</i>
- Stay calm.

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,799
- Are there any parked cars there?
<i>- Yes.</i>

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,479
- Go over there and hit the hood.
<i>- Why?</i>

47
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,680
Just do it.

48
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,759
<i>- What are you doing?
- Stupid bitch.</i>

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,240
<i>Okay. They ran off.</i>

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,080
Well done.

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,880
<i>- Here comes my bus.</i>
- Very good.

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,559
Stay on the line until
you're on the bus, okay?

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,720
<i>Okay.</i>

54
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
Are you safe?

55
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
<i>Yes.</i>

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
<i>Thank you.</i>

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,800
Well, have a nice evening.

58
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
<i>Have a nice evening.</i>

59
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,039
<i>In the darkest depths of the oceans
where the game of predator and prey...</i>

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,319
<i>I think nowadays you cannot
believe anyone anymore.</i>

61
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,079
<i>Then say it. What do you think?</i>

62
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,279
<i>The date of the victim's death was
written on the wall in blood each time.</i>

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,639
<i>This is the modus operandi to which
the murderer now owes his name,</i>

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,960
<i>Calendar Killer.</i>

65
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,439
<i>So far, this handwriting is
the only lead to the murderer.</i>

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,799
<i>Pay attention to the particular
squiggle at the end of the number "2."</i>

67
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
<i>Do you recognize
this handwriting?</i>

68
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>Have you ever seen it...</i>

69

Walk Me Home Helpline.
How may I help you?

72
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,520
This is the Walk Me Home
Helpline. You just called us.

73
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,520
How can I help you?

74
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,920
As you're not answering, I'll ask...
Are you being harassed or threatened?

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
Cough if you're
being threatened.

76
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,159
- Hello?
<i>- Who's there?</i>

77
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,240
- The Walk Me Home Helpline.
<i>- Why did you call me?</i>

78
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,599
That's not possible. I
don't know who you are.

79
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,800
- I don't have your number until now.
<i>- Then it was probably my phone.</i>

80
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,159
Would you rather speak
to a female colleague?

81
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,840
I can connect you right away.

82
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,000
No. There's no need.

83
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't hang up, please.

84
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,200
I can hear that
you're in trouble.

85
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,560
- Are you injured?
<i>- It's too late.</i>

86
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,679
What happened? How
can I help you?

87
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,880
<i>It's too late.</i>

88
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,040
Too late? Why?

89
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm going to be killed tonight.

90
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
Killed?

91
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,599
- Why do you think that?
<i>- He announced it.</i>

92
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,400
May I ask your name?

93
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,000
My name is Jules.
Jules Tannberg.

94
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
<i>Klara...</i>

95
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
<i>Klara Vernet.</i>

96
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
All right, Klara.

97
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,920
Who wants to kill you?

98
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,240
<i>I'm very tired.</i>

99
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,759
<i>Nobody will believe me anyway.</i>

100
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Yes, I believe you.

101
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,800
<i>Talking to you is
pointless. I'm sorry.</i>

102
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
<i>It's too late.</i>

103
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,120
<i>It's too late.</i>

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,480
Do you know who
wants to kill you?

105
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,479
<i>Yes.</i>

106
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,880
Who?

107
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,400
<i>The Calendar Killer.</i>

108
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,080
You don't believe me, do you?

109
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,639
I do.

110
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,960
Of course, I do.

111
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,079
What makes you think it's him?

112
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
<i>He wrote it on the wall...</i>

113
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,199
<i>with a photo of
me and my husband.</i>

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,679
<i>Underneath, it said...</i>

115
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,719
<i>12-06. One of you
will die. Him or you.</i>

116

{\an8}DECEMBER 6 21:31

117
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,560
12-06 HIM OR YOU -
ONE OF YOU WILL DIE

00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,399
{\an8}3 KOSER STREET

119
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,120
{\an8}27 RENATA STREET

120
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,160
<i>I don't see any
other option than...</i>

121
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,359
Klara, if you're being threatened,
you have to tell the police.

122
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
<i>I already did. But
they didn't believe me.</i>

123
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,359
<i>That I woke up in a basement with
a death threat on the wall...</i>

124
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,719
<i>I couldn't prove anything.</i>

125
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,120
When was that?

126
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,279
<i>A few weeks ago.</i>

127
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
<i>I can't remember properly.</i>

128
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,439
<i>I woke up in a park</i>

129
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,040
<i>and went straight home.</i>

130
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,079
- Are you at home now?
<i>- No.</i>

131
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,200
Why not?

132
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,040
Are you scared that
the killer is there?

133
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,399
What about your husband?

134
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,840
<i>- He won't help me.</i>
- Why not?

135
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
<i>Because he thinks
I imagined it all.</i>

136
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,520
<i>That's also what
he told the police.</i>

137
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,319
<i>He was so embarrassed
and I was very ashamed.</i>

138
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,479
But no one makes up something like
that. Isn't your husband worried?

139
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,840
He's being threatened, too.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,440
<i>He just laughed at me.</i>

141
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,679
It's nothing to laugh about.

142
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,280
NO STREET NOISE
QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD

143
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,599
Where are you now, Klara?

144
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,200
<i>I shouldn't have told you
any of this. I'm sorry. I...</i>

145
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
<i>But at least I've
made it this far.</i>

146
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,320
What do you mean "this far"?

147
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,760
Are you in a garage?

148
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
Are you driving away?

149
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Klara?

150
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

151
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,080
What are you up to?

152
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,760
Please wait a moment.

153
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,880
Stay on the line for a moment.

154
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Klara...

155
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,800
- Don't do anything hasty, please.
<i>- I'm not. Why do you think that?</i>

156
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,999
I worked at the Berlin Fire
Department's call center for many years.

157
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,960
I know how it sounds when
someone is in major distress.

158
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,400
You've called us
three times already...

159
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,840
but not because of
the Calendar Killer.

160
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,519
- Why did you call then?
<i>- I was scared to walk home in the dark.</i>

161
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,719
<i>Isn't that what
this service is for?</i>

162
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes, of course.

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,160
Forgive me.

164
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,559
VICTIM OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE. CREDIBLE?

165
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,200
May I ask you a question?

166
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
<i>What?</i>

167
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,200
Is everything okay at home?

168
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

169
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,840
Where's your husband now?

170
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,359
- Why are you walking alone at night?
<i>- Why are you asking all these questions?</i>

171
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,960
Because in our notes, it says there's
a suspicion of domestic violence.

172
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,159
<i>- These conversations are recorded?</i>
- Yes, why?

173
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,719
<i>So everything I tell
you is documented?</i>

174
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,159
Yes, but only for 48 hours. And
it's covered by data protection.

175
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,640
- Why?
<i>- So...</i>

176
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,599
<i>So if something were to
happen to me tonight,</i>

177
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,200
<i>then the police would find
out about this conversation?</i>

178
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,400
What are you getting at?

179
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,920
A killer is after you.

180
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,360
And you won't go to the police
or home to your husband. Why?

181
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,800
27 RENATA STREET

182
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,400
<i>You don't believe me either.</i>

183
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,760
Are you being abused?

184
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,200
<i>Yes.</i>

185
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
I am sorry.

186
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,680
You're afraid.

187
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,040
It's even worse than that.

188
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,640
It's the kind of fear...

189
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,439
that makes you want
to tear your skin off,

190
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,600
so that you'll stop
from burning up inside.

191
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,240
<i>Hell's most evil trick is to
disguise itself as paradise.</i>

192
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,000
Good evening.

193
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,880
Thank you.

194
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,280
Good evening, Mr. Gerrich.

195
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,200
Oh, the von Bülows.

196
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,360
They made a big donation to the
election campaign. Nice people.

197
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,800
Thank you for dressing the
way I've asked you to, Klara.

198
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,400
You look fantastic.

199
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
My pleasure.

200
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,720
Klara.

201
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,999
My goodness.

202
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,440
How are you? We never
see you anymore.

203
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Wow.

204
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,759
- Martin, congratulations on the new job.
- Thank you.

205
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,479
- How's the air up there?
- Quite thin.

206
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,160
But it can blow right in your
face if you're not careful.

207
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
- You look fantastic, Meret.
- Thank you.

208
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,480
May I introduce you? Dr. Paul
Wassmann, our new associate.

209
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,319
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Dr. Martin Vernet.

210
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,559
Our State Secretary of the
Interior for three weeks now.

211
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,719
And this is my traitorous friend, Klara,
one of the best lawyers at our firm,

212
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,440
until she discovered
life as a full-time mom.

213
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,240
- Don't you miss work just a little?
- I do sometimes.

214
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,720
I really hope you'll
come back to us.

215
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,079
- Maybe when Amelie starts school...
- If Klara prefers to raise our daughter,

216
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,839
then she should do it.

217
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,080
I miss her.

218
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,840
Let's go for coffee, at least.
And you can bring Amelie.

219
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,480
I promise.

220
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,840
- Martin.
- Enjoy your evening.

221
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

222
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,679
Dear Lord, doesn't
she ever stop?

223
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,000
Be glad you don't have
to deal with her anymore.

224
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,040
Actually, it's a shame
I don't see her anymore.

225
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
But you have me and Amelie.

226
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
That's true.

227
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
So... let's celebrate
our anniversary.

228
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
- Evening.
- Thank you.

229
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,239
Thank you.

230
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,920
So here's to an exciting night.

231
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,960
Enjoy your meal.

232
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,160
I know you don't like seafood,

233
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,560
but you need protein for
what's planned later.

234
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,680
What do we have planned tonight?

235
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
I am sorry.

236
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So sorry.

237
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,160
Have you stopped
taking your pills?

238
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,520
Damn it, Klara.

239
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,999
Do I need to have you
admitted to the clinic again?

240
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
- Martin, I'm fine.
- I'm warning you.

241
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,119
I won't let Amelie have a
mentally deranged mother.

242
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,520
- I can't stomach the pills.
- The doctor can prescribe something else.

243
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,160
- Forgive me.
- So...

244
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,560
Time to eat.

245
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,280
How long is the
babysitter staying?

246
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,920
Vigo will stay
until we get home.

247
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,240
Give me your phone.

248
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
Welcome to our VP Night.

249
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,599
I'm here for you,
whatever you might desire.

250
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,240
What's a VP Night?

251
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,960
Very exclusive.

252
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,520
Martin, please. I'd like to go.

253
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,840
You haven't even
finished your drink.

254
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,319
What's the matter? These women are
being paid very well for their services.

255
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,759
The entrance fee is donated
to the Children's Foundation.

256
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,920
It's a good thing.

257
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,200
Martin, please.

258
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,280
It's for a good cause.

259
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,760
<i>He must have put something
in the champagne.</i>

260
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
That's horrible.

261
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,960
<i>I only regained consciousness
because of the pain.</i>

262
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,600
Martin, please...

263
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,680
Klara, you must
leave your husband.

264
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
<i>Yes.</i>

265
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,080
<i>I should have done it a
long time ago. It's just...</i>

266
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,320
I don't want Amelie to find
out what he's done to me.

267
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,680
<i>That's understandable. You
didn't want to hurt her...</i>

268
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
- How old is your daughter?
<i>- Amelie is six.</i>

269
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,240
I have a daughter, too.
Her name is Fabienne.

270
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,880
She's six, too.

271
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,200
<i>- Where is your daughter now?</i>
- She's asleep.

272
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,560
<i>And who's looking after
her? Is she alone?</i>

273
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Of course not.

274
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,320
<i>We've got a babysitter.</i>

275
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,040
Can you believe that
he's a good father?

276
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,000
<i>It's hard to believe,
but it's true.</i>

277
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,720
Amelie loves him.

278
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,319
I have to go, now,
before he finds me.

279
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,360
Where are you?

280
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,959
<i>You are closing a garage door.</i>

281
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,079
You opened a car door.
What are you planning?

282
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,519
For what I'm planning to do,
it's better if I'm alone.

283
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,479
<i>No.</i>

284
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,200
No, don't do that.

285
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,439
Please don't do it.

286
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,880
Don't tell me what to do.

287
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,520
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

288
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,480
I'm so sorry, but
you cannot do this.

289
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,360
Don't do this! Don't
do this, please!

290
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,040
<i>I am begging you.</i>

291
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,359
<i>Klara! Klara, please!</i>

292
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,639
MARTIN - I always know where
you are! Brace yourself!

293
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,919
<i>Either the Calendar Killer
or Martin will kill me.</i>

294
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,560
<i>So I'd rather do it myself.</i>

295
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,000
If you do this...

296
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,719
Amelie will never get over it.

297
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Believe me.

298
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,840
<i>I can hear that
you're not driving.</i>

299
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,320
<i>I am begging you. Please
stop. We'll find a way.</i>

300
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
<i>Klara?</i>

301
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,760
<i>Hello? Klara, please.</i>

302
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,359
Enough!

303
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,199
I don't want to have
to take her to the ER.

304
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,360
<i>I don't want to have
to take her to the ER.</i>

305
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,240
You did well, darling.

306
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,720
Let's take a little break, okay?

307
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,640
Please take care of my wife.

308
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,480
Come. I'll show you
to our powder room.

309
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,080
I'll go get you a
stronger painkiller.

310
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,320
Did your wife enjoy it?

311
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,799
You never forget the first time.

312
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,040
Excuse me, please.

313
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,440
- Where's my wife?
- She must still be in the powder room.

314
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,640
<i>Yo, this is Vigo. Feel free to
leave a message after the beep.</i>

315
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,720
Hi, Vigo.

316
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,640
This message is for Amelie.

317
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,800
Hi, sweetie.

318
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,319
Mommy!

319
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,560
<i>I just wanted to tell
you how much I love you.</i>

320
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,120
It wasn't your
fault, you hear me?

321
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,400
I love you so much.

322
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,000
CALLING

323
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,320
DAD INCOMING CALL

324
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,559
I have no time right
now. Call tomorrow.

325
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,999
<i>How come? What's wrong?</i>

326
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,559
- An emergency.
<i>- An emergency?</i>

327
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,399
<i>I thought you were
still on leave?</i>

328
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,919
- I'm not at the emergency switchboard.
<i>- So where are you?</i>

329
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,639
Walk Me Home
Helpline. Voluntary.

330
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,879
There's a woman who
wants to kill herself.

331
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,119
<i>Then call the police.</i>

332
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,560
I don't know where she is.

333
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,919
<i>- Maybe I can help you?</i>
- That would be a first.

334
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,599
<i>Tell me her name, and I'll
find out where she is.</i>

335
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,079
No, I'm not allowed to.

336
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,039
<i>Jules, you're talking to a
woman who wants to kill herself.</i>

337
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,959
<i>I can imagine what
that's doing to you.</i>

338
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,479
- You can?
<i>- Yes. I can.</i>

339
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,639
<i>You want to save her,</i>

340
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,400
<i>- after the incident with Dajana...</i>
- Stop it!

341
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,680
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- At home. Where else?

342
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,559
What?

343
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,239
<i>Jules, I want to help you.
Damn it. I'm your father.</i>

344
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,760
- Congrats on that realization.
<i>- Tell me what you know.</i>

345
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,360
<i>So, what's her name?</i>

346
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,599
<i>All right. It's up to you.</i>

347
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,040
<i>- If it all goes wrong and you haven't...</i>
- Her name is Klara.

348
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,359
<i>- Klara... Klara what?</i>
- Vernet.

349
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
<i>That's it?</i>

350
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,439
She was at the Le
Zen Hotel today.

351
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,960
There must be some secret
pervert club there.

352
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,880
<i>That's news to me.</i>

353
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,280
<i>But I'll ask around. I
still know someone there.</i>

354
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,040
Stay out of
everything else, okay?

355
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,959
<i>Further snow showers are
expected in Berlin tonight.</i>

356
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
<i>So please drive carefully, or
make yourself comfortable at home.</i>

357
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,520
<i>It's 10:03 p.m. The next
news will be at 11:00 p.m.</i>

358
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,679
Thank God. How are you feeling?

359
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,800
Shitty.

360
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,040
I feel sick. I threw up.

361
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,400
<i>I can't go on. I am so tired.</i>

362
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,959
Where are you now?

363
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,240
<i>Where the Calendar Killer
will never find me...</i>

364
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,519
<i>Why is this so important to you?</i>

365
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,800
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

366
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,280
I'm sure you can't
imagine it, but...

367
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,080
I know exactly what
you're going through.

368
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,879
<i>I've been on the phone with
women like you for a long time.</i>

369
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,120
<i>Women who were crying because their
men had beaten them half to death.</i>

370
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,880
And were you able to help them?

371
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,720
I tried.

372
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,200
Over and over again.

373
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,040
But as soon as the
police arrived,

374
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,240
<i>suddenly everything was only half as
bad, and the men got away with it.</i>

375
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,720
<i>I don't understand it.</i>

376
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,680
Why do women put up with it?

377
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,640
Because they're
financially dependent.

378
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,000
Or they don't want to take
the kids from their dad.

379
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,120
Because they're ashamed.

380
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,200
Because they don't
know where to go.

381
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,480
Or they think they're to
blame for the beatings.

382
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,280
Because they're terrified it'll only
get worse, and they'll be killed.

383
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,080
Or the husband has some hold over
the woman and is blackmailing her.

384
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,439
Klara, put an end to this
misery, but don't end your life.

385
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,160
Why is it so important to
you? You don't know me at all.

386
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,240
I told you about my
daughter. Fabienne?

387
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,520
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,080
Her mother killed herself.

389
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,679
Ever since that, Fabienne
hasn't been doing...

390
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,280
Why are you telling me all this?

391
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,680
To make me feel guilty?

392
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,439
No.

393
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
<i>Her mother was in a clinic.</i>

394
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,680
<i>At first, it seemed
things would be okay.</i>

395
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,159
<i>The doctors at Berger Hof...</i>

396
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,520
- That was the clinic she was in.
<i>- Berger Hof?</i>

397
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,640
- I was there, too.
<i>- What? What for?</i>

398
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,840
Dissociative disorders.

399
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,920
Sometimes, I see things
that aren't there.

400
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
<i>- Were they able to help you?</i>
- Yes, they did.

401
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,200
But I have to take medication.

402
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,240
<i>And Martin threatens to have me
admitted again for every little thing.</i>

403
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,360
Dajana suffered from
severe depression.

404
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,920
I had hoped that they would
be able to help her, but...

405
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,480
<i>It was too late.</i>

406
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,560
You're not the only one
who's been through hell.

407
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,359
Mommy! Please open the door!

408
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,640
Mommy! It's on fire!

409
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,560
Mommy!

410
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Mommy!

411
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,520
We can't get out!

412
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,999
<i>Hurry, there's a fire, and
I hear someone screaming.</i>

413
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,159
<i>It's a child.</i>

414
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,519
The firefighters will be
there in under two minutes.

415
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,159
Do not open the door!

416
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,719
It could cause a back draft,
and you'll be in flames.

417
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,879
- Please leave the building.
<i>- But what about the kid? The screams...</i>

418
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,599
My colleagues will take care
of it. Please get out of there.

419
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,720
Just a moment.

420
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,519
- Yes?
<i>- Incident command vehicle 26. Stelling.</i>

421
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,679
<i>Tannberg, what's going
on? There's nothing here.</i>

422
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,439
- What do you mean?
<i>- There's no fire anywhere here.</i>

423
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,359
Okay.

424
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,079
- Mr. Damelow?
<i>- Yes? Where are you?</i>

425
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,999
There's no fire in
Brandenburgische Street.

426
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,959
<i>What?</i>

427
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,679
- That prank will be expensive.
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

428
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,119
<i>I was in a panic, and I
gave you the wrong address.</i>

429
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,599
- Where are you?
<i>- I am so sorry.</i>

430
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,240
<i>I'm at 24 Prince Regent
Street. Third floor.</i>

431
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,400
- Please repeat that.
<i>- 24 Prince Regent Street. Hello?</i>

432
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,600
Let me through! Damn it!

433
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,640
What happened?

434
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,680
<i>Dajana locked up the
kids in their rooms.</i>

435
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,640
<i>She wanted to spare them the sight
of their dead mother in the bathtub.</i>

436
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,920
<i>My little ones tried
desperately to get out.</i>

437
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,120
<i>Fabienne managed to
hide in the closet.</i>

438
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,480
<i>She was taken to the hospital.</i>

439
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,120
My son was probably playing
with a leftover birthday candle.

440
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,400
She must have noticed the smoke.

441
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,400
But it was too late.

442
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,880
She wanted to unlock the door.

443
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,880
But she had no strength left.

444
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,840
<i>I am sorry.</i>

445
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,520
<i>Look at me.</i>

446
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,799
Just a moment. I need
to check something.

447
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,000
<i>Stay on the line.</i>

448
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
<i>Turn around!</i>

449
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,520
<i>Come over here.</i>

450
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,480
<i>Show your face.</i>

451
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
<i>Klara!</i>

452
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,640
12-06 HIM OR YOU

453
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,880
<i>Look at me. Look at me.</i>

454
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,920
<i>Now... turn around.</i>

455
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,039
<i>Show me your face.</i>

456
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,400
<i>Klara! Look at me!</i>

457
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,319
<i>Look at me! Look at me!</i>

458
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,960
<i>Turn around.</i>

459
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,520
<i>Now show me your face.</i>

460
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,599
<i>Klara!</i>

461
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,120
<i>Look at me!</i>

462
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
Mommy?

463
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,519
Klara, I'm back.

464
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,560
Jules... he was here.

465
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,440
<i>- He was here.</i>
- Who?

466
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,240
The Calendar Killer. He
was here in the cabin.

467
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,680
Listen. This is what we'll do.

468
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,479
I'll send a cab to
take you straight home.

469
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,680
Give me the address.

470
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,280
<i>I'd rather take my car.</i>

471
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
No, wait.

472
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,520
I'll send you something.

473
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,640
12-06 HIM OR YOU

474
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,960
<i>Now they'll have to believe me.</i>

475
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,720
The police and Martin.

476
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,440
He said it was just another
one of my delusions.

477
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,400
He asked how anyone would know
when I was in the parking garage.

478
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,960
Martin wanted to have me
readmitted to Berger Hof.

479
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,080
He has left you completely
alone with your fear.

480
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,440
The more I think about it...

481
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,560
the more I believe...

482
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,080
<i>I believe that
Martin's behind it all.</i>

483
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,760
Why?

484
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,960
<i>He's the only one who
always knows where I am.</i>

485
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,320
He knows the cabin.

486
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,800
He's got the videos.

487
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,080
He's using my
illness against me.

488
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,120
<i>And on December 6...</i>

489
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
We got married on December 6.

490
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,560
Please drive home right
away and get your child.

491
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,200
We'll meet in front
of your apartment.

492
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,800
I'll help you.

493
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,560
You don't know him.

494
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,080
He always wins.

495
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,920
Not this time.

496
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,960
Jules.

497
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,880
He's here.

498
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,800

Klara, tell me what's happening?

500
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,080
Klara, is there
someone in your house?

501
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,879
<i>Can you hear me?
Is someone there?</i>

502
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,040
<i>Can you hear me?
Klara, please...</i>

503

{\an8}DECEMBER 6

504

<i>- Is the woman still on the line?</i>

505
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,280
Where are you?

506
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,639
I'm standing here
in front of Le Zen.

507
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,879
And you?

508
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,080
<i>- Did you find out anything?</i>
- The manager was beside himself.

509
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,080
<i>Obviously, he's
going to deny it.</i>

510
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,120
<i>He would have told me. Trust me.</i>

511
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,000
- Did you really look everywhere?
<i>- Yes, there's nothing there.</i>

512
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,240
<i>Jules, do you hear me?
The woman lied to you.</i>

513
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,840
Why should I believe
you more than her?

514
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,480
- Given all the times you lied to Mom...
<i>- The woman is lying.</i>

515
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,200
And I swear to you. Her
suicide story doesn't add up.

It's Hendrik, right?

Just let me out somewhere
when we get to the city.

533
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,320
It looks like you need a doctor.

534
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,160
I'll get you to the next ER.

535
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,519
It's nice that you're
concerned. But I'm fine.

How come you're driving around
at night in a Santa costume?

539
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,480
Bachelor's party.

540
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,320
I'm a stripper.

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,200
You should see my underpants.

542
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,840
Red with a white pom-pom in
front of the family jewels.

Klara! Are you all
right? What happened?

547
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,280
I saw him.

548
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,840
The Calendar Killer
was in our cabin.

549
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,719
But I made it out.

550
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,999
<i>- Where are you now?</i>
- On my way to the city. I got a ride.

551
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
- Who with?
<i>- Santa Claus.</i>

552
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,560
<i>- Excuse me?</i>
- Don't worry about it.

553
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,239
Listen. Martin must be on his way home.
I have to get to Amelie before him.

554
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,840
Please be careful.

555
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,600
You shouldn't trust
anyone tonight.

<i>Daddy!</i>

557

Please stay on the line. I
need to check on my daughter.

558
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,520
Mommy.

559
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,120
Daddy.

560
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,360
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

561
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,160
No. No, she is burning up.

562
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,800
I need to check if there's any
liquid fever medication left.

563
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,800
Mommy.

564
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,000
Mommy.

565
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,640
Daddy.

566
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,640
Mommy.

567
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,240
Can you sing?

568
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,120
- What?
<i>- Sing?</i>

569
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,840
Well...

570
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,560
<i>Put the phone next
to Fabienne's ear.</i>

571
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,160
<i>Behold, the moon has risen</i>

572
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
<i>The golden stars, they glisten</i>

00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,080
<i>Upon the heavens bright</i>

574
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:23,480
<i>The forests rest in shadows</i>

575
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,160
<i>And from the quiet meadows</i>

576
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,400
<i>White haze rises into the night</i>

577
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,880
Dajana used to always
sing that to Fabienne.

578
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,960
<i>Is she calmer now?</i>

579
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,880
Yes, she is.

580
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,760
Thank you.

581
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,520
I can't leave Amelie all alone.

582
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,040
I have to be there for her.

583
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,000
I mustn't destroy her life.

584
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,920
<i>I've let that happen
to me all these years.</i>

585
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,240
I loved Martin.

586
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,240
But I can't do it anymore.

587
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,200
<i>I have to go home
to my daughter...</i>

588
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,560
<i>and finally leave Martin.</i>

589
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,920
I'll help you if you want.

590
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,640
I can make sure you
and Amelie are safe.

591
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,760
Just tell me where
you are and...

592
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,680
- I'll come.
<i>- You've already helped me enough.</i>

593
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,600
I have to do this alone.

594
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,600
And with the photo, I have
proof that the Calendar...

595
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,760
That I didn't just imagine it
all. Now they have to believe me.

596
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,040
Just another hour and
December 6 will be over.

597
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,840
My offer still stands.

598
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,360
Thank you, Jules.

599
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,880
My pleasure, Klara.

600
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,280
What was that all about?

601
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,760
The Calendar Killer
is after you?

602
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,560
Can I get one of those?

603
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,120
Sure.

604
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,680
Another pack should be
in the box back there.

605
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,080
My first one in 15 years.

606
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,519
Do you have a light?

607
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,680
Where is it?

608
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,359
- Stop the car. Right now!
- Hey, calm down.

609
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,039
I always have the taser with me.

610
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,919
- Calm down!
- Open the door!

611
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,119
- Take it easy!
- Open!

612
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,639
I won't hurt you.

613
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,879
Okay?

614
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,519
Everything is fine. Really.

615
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,999
I'm not going to hurt you.

616
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,400
Hey, what...

617
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,040
Martin!

618
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,400
Stop it!

619
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,039
It wasn't nice of you
to take off earlier.

620
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,200
Get in!

621
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,199
- We can't just leave him. He'll freeze!
- Get in. Now!

622
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,240
Let go!

623
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,200
I'm so sorry.

624
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
I'm so sorry.

625
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,000
You must have
known I'd find you.

626
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,840
Who was that?

627
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,920
I saw footprints in
front of the house.

628
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,880
Didn't you go into the bedroom?

629
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,400
The bedroom?

630
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,320
What's that?

631
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,160
A death threat from
the Calendar Killer.

632
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,159
The Calendar Killer?

633
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,960
Klara, don't start
with all that again.

634
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,159
I'll drive back there tomorrow.

635
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,360
If it's really written
there, I'll call the police.

636
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,520
But if you're just making it up again,
I'll take you back to Berger Hof.

637
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,720
I was in the garage.
I saw the tube.

638
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,120
Don't ever do that again.

639
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,000
What are you doing?

640
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,240
I'm checking if Vigo texted me.

641
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,520
I was thinking about us.

642
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,680
Last year, after I took
you to the ER in Potsdam...

643
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,319
When we went back home
and I cooked for you,

644
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,240
you asked me for the thousandth
time why I don't get therapy.

645
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,920
The truth is, I started therapy.

646
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,559
But the guy just reeled
off the usual spiel.

647
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,680
How I lacked confidence

648
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,559
because I had an abusive father
and a mother who ran away.

649
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,160
I don't need a
therapist for that.

650
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,080
You see?

651
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,840
I have no problem saying it.

652
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,439
If there was a self-help group like the
AA where you had to introduce yourself,

653
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,359
I'd do it.

654
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,560
I'd stand up and say,

655
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,800
"Hello. My name is Martin.
I'm 44 and I beat my wife."

656
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,840
And that's supposed
to justify everything?

657
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,280
You need to stop
provoking me, Klara.

658
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,120
Provoking you?

659
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,640
- I'm provoking you?
- Yes.

660
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,280
How?

661
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,880
Why didn't you leave
a long time ago?

662
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,600
You just put up with it.
The beatings, the shouting.

663
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,400
You let it all happen, Klara.
Every punch, every kick.

664
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,400
Let it happen?

665
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,240
I let you...

666
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,400
drag me to that perverted club?

667
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,280
Let you offer me up...

668
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,360
to be whipped like
a piece of meat?

669
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,640
- Are you serious?
- I didn't say that.

670
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,520
But you make me angry so
often, just by being there.

671
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,520
How can I respect you if you
don't even respect yourself?

672
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,160
You scare the shit out
of me every day, Martin.

673
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,840
I know.

674
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,680
And I'm sorry about that.

675
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,400
Do you believe me?

676
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,000
Do you believe that I love you?

677
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,000
I'll tell you something.
You won't leave me!

678
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,920
Do you understand me?

679
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,040
Drive me home.

680
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,000
I want to be with my daughter.

681
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,040
I can help you.

682
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,280
So...

683
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,480
brace yourself
for what's coming.

684
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,320
You won't touch me
in front of Amelie.

685
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,800
Don't tell me what to do.

686
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,680
Never touch me again.

687
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Klara!

688
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,920
Klara!

689
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,280
Vigo?

690
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,280
Vigo?

691
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:23,880
<i>Behold, the moon has risen</i>

692
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:31,040
<i>The golden stars, they glisten</i>

693
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:37,320
<i>Upon the heavens bright</i>

694
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,880
Amelie?

695
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,920
<i>The forests rest in shadows</i>

696
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:52,800
<i>And from the quiet meadows</i>

697
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:00,520
<i>White haze rises into the night</i>

698
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,240
Hello, Klara.

699
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,440
Jules?

700
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,079
What's wrong with Amelie?

701
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,679
Don't worry. She's fine.

702
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,280
Just a sleeping pill.

703
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,840
Where's Martin?

704
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,760
Where's Vigo?

705
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,480
Let's leave her bedroom.

706
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,479
Or she'll wake up.

707
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,000
Jules, why are you here?

708
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,000
Let her sleep.

709
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,720
12-06 HIM OR YOU

710
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,320
Please don't.

711
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,080
It's time.

712
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,000
Where's your husband?

713
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,240
Please.

714
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,360
Let me show you something.

715
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,999
I saw everything he did to you.

716
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,520
There are cameras in every room.

717
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,440
What I saw is unbearable.

718
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,440
Drop it.

719
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,400
Don't make it so difficult.

720
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,560
Ten minutes left.

721
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,440
Now it's Klara or Martin.

722
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,400
So, where is he?

723
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,439
Jules...

724
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,920
It's close to midnight.

725
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,120
I told you I'm leaving Martin.
Why does he have to die?

726
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,319
I just want to leave him
and take Amelie with me.

727
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,559
Why do you still
stand up for him?

728
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,480
You know he deserves it.

729
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,960
Jules, stop this madness.

730
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,000
The madness is what
you let him do to you.

731
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,560
Where is your husband?

732
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,959
Now it's your chance to take
back control of your life.

733
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,560
It's him or you.

734
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,560
Four more minutes.

735
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,280
You have to kill him.

736
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,200
Stay quiet.

737
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,560
And Fabienne?

738
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,520
What happened to Fabienne?

739
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,720
Fabienne is dead.
She didn't make it.

740
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,720
She died in the hospital.

741
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,120
You have to get this
bastard out of your life.

742
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,800
And then?

743
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,599
What happens then? You
can't just let me go.

744
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,760
Trust me.

745
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,720
I have a plan.

746
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,720
I'm on your side.

747
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,440
It's 11.57 p.m.

748
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,120
You will kill him.

749
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,160
Or I will kill you.

750
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,720
Three minutes.

751
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,040
Take it.

752
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,439
- I can't do it. Please.
- Come on.

753
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,600
Jules, please.

754
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,439
Think of everything
he did to you.

755
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,640
This man made your
life a living hell!

756
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,640
Do you even realize the
chance I'm giving you?

757
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,920
Two minutes.

758
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,920
Jules, please...

759
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,920
- What?
- Don't you...

760
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,640
Don't you understand?

761
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,120
Martin's death won't
bring Dajana back.

762
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,360
Well...

763
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,520
That's true.

764
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,800
You're smart.

765
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,320
So was Dajana.

766
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,479
But what she went through as
a child, her father's abuse,

767
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,719
a mother who kept quiet
and looked the other way...

768
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,800
It broke her.

769
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,080
And when she took her own life, she
took my children's lives with her.

770
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,480
And she took mine, too.

771
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,240
I do what I do to
give women like you

772
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,040
the chance to fight back.

773
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,080
One minute.

774
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,040
You can do it.

775
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,320
Think of Amelie.

776
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,280
She needs you.

777
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,040
But not a father like him.

778
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,200
I'm sorry.

779
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,120
Okay, please...

780
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,960
Be still.

781
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,880
How? Where?

782
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,240
The carotid artery.

783
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,880
Like this?

784
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,280
Yes.

785
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,400
Forgive me.

786
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,840
Klara!

787
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,360
You two deserve each other.

788
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,000
He's my son.

789
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,000
I'm sorry.

790
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,320
I wanted to protect
you from him.

791
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,520
But I was too late.

792
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,280
I was too late.

793
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:51,560
I recognized his
handwriting on TV.

794
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,360
- How did he survive that?
- A nightmare.

795
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,519
It must have been a nightmare.

796
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,759
Yes, you could say that.

797
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,200
My wife and I were
incredibly lucky.

798
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,520
It was unimaginable.

799
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,280
And our daughter
is still so young.

800
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

801
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,079
may I ask you to switch off
your phones and take your seats.

802
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:46,279
We will now begin with the award for
outstanding achievements in service.

803
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,600
I'm delighted to be representing

804
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:52,199
our Senator of the
Interior, Dr. Herrmann,

805
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,919
who, as you know,
is still recovering,

806
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,680
in presenting these
special medals of honor

807
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:02,320
to ten of our service officers.

808
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,640
Last year, we had...

809
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,520
<i>Hello. My name is Martin.
I'm 44 and I beat my wife.</i>

810
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,639
<i>You let it all happen, Klara.
Every punch, every kick.</i>

811
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,679
<i>Drag me to that perverted club?</i>

812
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:18,760
<i>Are you serious?</i>

813
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,240
<i>You won't leave me!</i>

814
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,920
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

815
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,479
<i>You see? I have no problem...</i>

816
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,360
In view of the fact that we...

817
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,240
<i>you make me angry so
often just by being there.</i>

818
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,880
<i>You just put up with it.</i>

819
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,839
<i>Hello. My name is Martin. I'm...</i>

820
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,959
What's going on?

821
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,039
<i>If you don't even
respect yourself?</i>

822
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,080
Mr. Vernet.

823
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,719
We are taking you into custody.

824
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,679
Criminal charges have been filed
against you for sexual assault,

825
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:49,720
serious bodily harm, coercion,
and insult on a sexual basis.

826
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:54,640
I would ask you, in your own interest,
to follow us without causing a scene.

827
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,800
<i>What are you doing?</i>

828
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,240
I'm checking if Vigo texted me.

829
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:27,520
{\an8}LATEST ISSUE 5 YEARS
FOR MARTIN VERNET

830
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,359
This story is fictional.

831
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,999
Nevertheless, intimate partner
violence is a cruel reality.

832
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,919
In Germany, one in four women
experiences physical or sexual violence

833
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,079
in their relationship at
least once in their life.

834
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,960
Women from all social
classes are affected.
