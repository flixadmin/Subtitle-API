1
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,891
Come in.

2
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,942
And?

3
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,607
Nothing?

4
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,063
She won't eat.

5
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,411
We'll try again at supper.

6
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,249
I think they're watching me.

7
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,545
- Who?
- Her soldiers.

8
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,838
Of course they are. That's their job.

9
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,265
What have I told you, Martha?

10
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,645
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

11
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,066
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

12
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,383
The Northern armies?

13
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,055
Just crossed the Trident.

14
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,850
They'll be at the walls
of King's Landing in two days.

15
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,515
How is she?

16
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,439
She hasn't seen anyone
since we returned.

17
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,438
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

18
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,653
She shouldn't be alone.

19
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,733
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

20
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,658
Aren't you worried for her?

21
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,987
I'm worried for all of us.

22
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,288
They say every time
a Targaryen is born,

23
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,538
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

24
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,335
We're not much for riddles
where I'm from.

25
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,709
We both know what she's about to do.

26
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,263
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

27
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,968
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

28
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,722
What do you want?

29
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,648
All I've ever wanted.

30
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,943
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.

31
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,941
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

32
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,277
But I'm quite certain about yours.

33
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,290
I don't want it.

34
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,666
I never have.

35
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,965
I have known more kings and queens
than any man living.

36
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,139
I've heard what they say to crowds,
and seen what they do in the shadows.

37
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,052
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

38
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,888
But what I tell you now is true:

39
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,065
You will rule wisely and well,
while she...

40
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,187
She...

41
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,231
is my queen.

42
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,049
Your Grace?

43
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,618
There's something you need to know.

44
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,205
Someone has betrayed me.

45
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,921
Yes.

46
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,427
Jon Snow.

47
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,728
Varys.

48
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,015
He knows the truth about Jon.

49
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,642
He does.

50
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,444
Because you told him.

51
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,823
You learned from Sansa.

52
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,747
And she learned from Jon,

53
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,916
though I begged him not to tell her.

54
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,998
As I said...

55
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,414
he betrayed me.

56
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,248
I'm glad Sansa told me.

57
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,709
I am your Hand.

58
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,465
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

59
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,468
And Varys?

60
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,016
Your Master of Whisperers
needs to be aware too.

61
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,095
You spoke to him first.

62
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,188
Without coming to me.

63
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,606
Without asking my permission.

64
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,065
It was a mistake.

65
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,816
Why do you think Sansa told you?

66
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,452
- What do you think she hoped to gain?
- She trusts me.

67
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,281
Yes, she trusts you.

68
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,586
She trusted you to spread secrets

69
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,210
that could destroy your own queen.

70
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,880
And you did not let her down.

71
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,634
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

72
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,846
Our intentions were good.

73
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,276
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

74
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,605
Varys as much as anyone.

75
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,123
But it doesn't matter now.

76
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,290
No.

77
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,213
It doesn't matter now.

78
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,085
It was me.

79
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,668
I hope I deserve this.

80
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,424
Truly, I do.

81
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,005
I hope I'm wrong.

82
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,188
Goodbye, old friend.

83
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,814
Lord Varys.

84
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,696
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
First of My Name,

85
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,398
Breaker of Chains
and Mother of Dragons...

86
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,364
...sentence you to die.

87
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,502
<i>Dracarys.</i>

88
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,186
This was all she brought with her
when we crossed the Narrow Sea.

89
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,930
Her only possession.

90
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,228
It's all right, Torgo Nudho.

91
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,314
Let me speak with him.

92
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,871
What did I say
would happen if you told your sister?

93
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,603
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

94
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,940
She betrayed your trust.

95
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,313
She killed Varys as much as I did.

96
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,192
This was a victory for her.

97
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,110
Now she knows what happens
when people hear the truth about you.

98
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,408
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

99
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,287
I don't have love here.

100
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,624
I only have fear.

101
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,296
I love you.

102
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,051
And you will always be my queen.

103
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,060
Is that all I am to you?

104
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,234
Your queen?

105
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,436
All right, then.

106
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,578
Let it be fear.

107
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,453
The people who live there,
they're not your enemies.

108
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,164
They're innocents, like the ones
you liberated in Meereen.

109
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,194
In Meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

110
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,086
and liberated the city themselves
the moment I arrived.

111
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,546
They're afraid.

112
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,131
Anyone who resists Cersei
will see his family butchered.

113
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,351
You can't expect them to be heroes.

114
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,645
- They're hostages.
- They are.

115
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,974
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

116
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,730
What does it matter whose fault it is?

117
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,654
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

118
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,074
Your sister knows how to use
her enemies' weaknesses against them.

119
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,698
That's what she thinks our mercy is:

120
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,823
weakness.

121
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,701
- I beg you, my queen...
- But she's wrong.

122
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,623
Mercy is our strength.

123
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,333
Our mercy towards future generations

124
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,789
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

125
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,888
Ready the Unsullied.

126
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,369
Tonight you sail for King's Landing
to join the Northern armies.

127
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,056
Cersei's followers will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

128
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,307
Give them that chance.

129
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,649
If the city surrenders, they will
ring the bells and raise the gates.

130
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,103
Please, if you hear them ringing
the bells, call off the attack.

131
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,768
Wait for me
outside the city.

132
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,374
You'll know when it's time.

133
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,487
Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

134
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,574
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

135
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,047
The next time you fail me...

136
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,843
will be the last time you fail me.

137
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,107
Let them pass.

138
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,375
Through the gate.

139
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,961
Get going.

140
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,625
The rearguard
should be here by daybreak.

141
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,581
She wants to attack now.

142
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,335
Daybreak at the earliest.

143
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,722
- Careful with that.
- My lord.

144
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,019
Davos.

145
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,813
I need to ask you a favor.

146
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,611
You're the greatest smuggler alive,
aren't you?

147
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,406
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

148
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,235
He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

149
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,249
Problem is
when he's got drink in him.

150
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,261
- See what he did the other week?
- Aye. Fighting as well.

151
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,913
Ay up. Where you going?

152
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,340
I'm Arya Stark.

153
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,589
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

154
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,303
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

155
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,605
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

156
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,141
I need to go talk to my captain.

157
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,775
Go ahead, talk to him.

158
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,900
Where's he going?

159
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,674
I drink to eat the skull keeper.

160
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,089
I want to eat the skull keeper.

161
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,348
I want to see the...

162
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,241
We speak the common tongue.

163
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,144
Ah. Good.

164
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,853
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

165
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,485
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

166
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,595
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

167
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,281
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

168
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,497
No.

169
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,447
Well, in that case,
as Hand of the Queen,

170
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,407
I outrank whomever gave your order.

171
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,118
Probably by quite a lot.

172
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,692
How did they find you?

173
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,449
Did you consider taking it off?

174
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,372
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

175
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,168
You're going back to her,
to die with her.

176
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,795
You've underestimated her before.

177
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,376
She's going to die.

178
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,714
Unless you can convince her
to change her course of action.

179
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,765
Difficult to do from here.

180
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,400
When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

181
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,566
Try.

182
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,570
If not for yourself, if not for her,

183
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,023
then for every one
of the million people in that city,

184
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,528
innocent or otherwise.

185
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,531
To be honest,
I never really cared much for them.

186
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,328
Innocent or otherwise.

187
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,665
You do care for one innocent.

188
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,160
I know you do.

189
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,745
And so does Cersei.

190
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,998
She has a reason now.

191
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,087
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

192
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,928
All the worst things she's ever done,
she's done for her children.

193
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,767
It's not impossible that she'll win.

194
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,186
She won't.

195
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,606
Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
as she said they would be.

196
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,309
Two of the three dragons are dead.

197
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,565
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

198
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,612
She has the Lannister army,
the Golden Company...

199
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,531
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

200
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,985
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

201
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,195
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow,
if not before.

202
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,405
Why?

203
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,746
Escape.

204
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,832
The two of you, together.

205
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,633
Remember where we met,

206
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,006
where they keep the dragon skulls,
beneath the Red Keep?

207
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,055
Take her down there.

208
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,179
Keep following the stairways down,
down as far as they'll go.

209
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,602
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

210
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,099
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

211
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,311
Sail out of the bay.

212
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,064
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to Pentos.

213
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,026
Start a new life.

214
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,787
Sail right past the Iron Fleet
and into a new life?

215
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,081
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war.

216
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,625
There won't be an Iron Fleet
for much longer.

217
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,415
Do it.

218
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:28,294
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

219
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,597
Swear to me.

220
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,889
You have my word.

221
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,517
If it works,

222
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,400
give the order to ring all the bells
in King's Landing and open the gates.

223
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,426
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

224
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,450
I'll try.

225
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,404
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

226
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,956
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

227
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,580
Your queen will execute you for this.

228
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,150
If Daenerys can make it to the throne

229
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,296
without wading through
a river of blood,

230
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,250
maybe she'll show mercy
to the person who made that possible.

231
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,599
Tens of thousands of innocent lives...

232
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,687
one not particularly innocent dwarf...

233
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,645
it seems like a fair trade.

234
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,571
If it weren't for you,

235
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,653
I never would've survived
my childhood.

236
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,160
You would have.

237
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,003
You were the only one

238
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,924
who didn't treat me like a monster.

239
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,307
You were all I had.

240
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,330
Eyes on the horizon!

241
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,796
Load the scorpion!

242
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,019
Archers, close up!

243
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,652
Up to the espringal!

244
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,445
To the back of it!

245
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,539
Archers, line up!

246
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,295
This way! Come on!

247
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,800
Clear the streets now!

248
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,178
- No!
- In, now.

249
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,430
- And you, come on.
- Inside, now!

250
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,307
Quickly.

251
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,231
Yes. Follow down there.
They're here. Get to the Red Keep.

252
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,859
- My son!
- Get inside!

253
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,240
Just ahead of you,
I can see it!

254
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,818
All right, move it!

255
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,653
- Come on!
- Keep moving!

256
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,266
- Keep going!
- Keep moving!

257
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,373
- Quickly!
- All the way!

258
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,700
- Come on!
- Come on!

259
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,636
Keep moving!

260
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,015
Make way
for the Golden Company!

261
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,362
Close the gate!

262
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,096
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

263
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,510
Call off your men.

264
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,104
Move along now, lads.

265
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,431
- That's it.
- Go on, move it.

266
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,359
Come on, move, move. Faster, faster.
Come on, move it.

267
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,357
- Keep going.
- Keep moving.

268
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,359
- Move.
- Stay with him.

269
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,328
- Hold on.
- Hold my hand.

270
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,495
Get behind her.

271
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,198
Close the gate!

272
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,922
- No.
- No, Mommy.

273
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,876
- Let me in! Please!
- No, please, sir!

274
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,086
- Open the gate!
- Close the gate!

275
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,217
- Open it!
- Open the gate!

276
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,051
- Get back.
- Look, go over there. Go. Go.

277
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,850
The gates are locked now!

278
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,528
Open! Open the gate!

279
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,982
Soldier! Soldier!

280
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,363
- Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!

281
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,944
Stay back! It's closed!

282
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,495
Soldier!

283
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,912
Move away! Stop!

284
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,492
Let us in!

285
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,084
We're not leaving!

286
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,367
Turn!

287
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,346
- Turn it around!
- Turn it around!

288
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,719
Get back! Back!

289
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,234
Fire!

290
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,962
Ready!

291
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,338
Move!

292
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,678
Fire!

293
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,885
- Reload!
- Reload!

294
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,642
Faster!

295
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,892
Hurry!

296
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,239
Fire!

297
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,814
Go!

298
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,906
Run!

299
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,044
Your Grace.

300
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,507
All we need is one good shot.

301
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:27,177
The scorpions have
all been destroyed, Your Grace.

302
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,848
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay.

303
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,678
Euron killed one of her dragons.

304
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:36,888
He can kill another.

305
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,439
Your Grace,
the Iron Fleet is burning.

306
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,309
The gates have been breached.

307
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,564
The Golden Company...

308
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,773
Our men will fight harder
than sellswords ever could.

309
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,069
They will defend their queen
to the last man.

310
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,494
Yes, Your Grace.

311
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,196
The Red Keep has never fallen.

312
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,872
It won't fall today.

313
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,945
No, no!

314
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,404
Move, move!

315
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,466
Run.

316
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,761
Run!

317
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,851
Come on!

318
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,230
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

319
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,149
The bells!

320
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,485
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

321
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,662
Ring the bloody bells!

322
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,491
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

323
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,481
- Tell the queen to ring the bells.
- Ring the bells!

324
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,666
Ring the bell!

325
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,631
This way.

326
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,603
Ring the bell!

327
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,056
Ring the bell!

328
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,562
Ring them!

329
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,772
Ring the bells!

330
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,864
Ring the bells!

331
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,244
- Ring the bells!
- Help us!

332
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,869
In the name of the...

333
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,762
- Ring the bells!
- Now! Come on!

334
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,938
Hurry up!

335
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,069
Ring the bells!

336
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,090
No!

337
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,422
Get back!

338
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,012
Stay! Stay!

339
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,445
Quickly. Quickly.

340
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,191
Stop!

341
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,718
- Come here!
- Get off him!

342
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,767
- Get off me! Get off, bitch!
- No, get off! Help! Help!

343
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,643
No!

344
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,751
Go!

345
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:10,637
Go!

346
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,713
Find somewhere to hide.

347
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,846
The Kingslayer.

348
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,810
We need to get the queen
out of King's Landing.

349
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:43,933
Listen.

350
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,683
That's the sound of a city dying.

351
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,436
It's over.

352
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,317
Well, maybe for you.

353
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,451
If you kill another king
before you die...

354
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,328
they'll sing about you forever.

355
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,035
You're no king.

356
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,582
Oh, but I am.

357
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,119
And I fucked the queen.

358
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,759
If I win...

359
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:18,589
I'll bring your head to Cersei
so you can kiss her one last time.

360
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,615
Your Grace, it isn't safe here
any longer.

361
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,788
The Red Keep is the safest place
in the city.

362
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,083
The Unsullied have breached
the gates of the Red Keep.

363
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:23,171
Maegor's Holdfast would be
a better place to wait out the storm.

364
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,093
You fought well...

365
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,921
for a cripple.

366
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,600
Another king for you.

367
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,820
But I got you!

368
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,116
I got you!

369
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,504
I'm the man
who killed Jaime Lannister.

370
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:45,981
Go home, girl.

371
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,527
The fire will get her,
or one of the Dothraki.

372
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,655
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

373
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,241
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

374
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,415
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

375
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,879
I'm going to kill her.

376
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,335
You think you wanted revenge
a long time?

377
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,044
I've been after it all my life.

378
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,300
It's all I care about.

379
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,427
And look at me. Look at me!

380
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,469
You wanna be like me?

381
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,318
You come with me, you die here.

382
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,791
Sandor.

383
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:50,966
Thank you.

384
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,027
Your Grace.

385
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,053
Hello, big brother.

386
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,645
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

387
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,323
Ser Gregor, I command you.

388
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,945
Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

389
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,964
Yeah, that's you.

390
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,052
That's what you've always been.

391
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,102
You're hurt.

392
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,363
It doesn't matter.

393
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,368
You're bleeding.

394
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,597
Alanna!

395
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,850
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

396
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,773
Have you seen my wife?

397
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,521
- Let go.
- Have you seen my wife?

398
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,579
Out of the way!

399
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:05,814
No!

400
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,521
Oh.

401
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,751
Take my hand.

402
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,006
Take my hand.

403
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,922
Get up. Get up.

404
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,145
- No. No.
- Wait! Wait!

405
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,271
No!

406
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,029
Fucking die!

407
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,251
We need to fall back!

408
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,795
Fall back behind the wall!

409
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,915
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

410
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,625
Get out of the city!

411
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,381
Fall back!

412
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,891
Fall back!

413
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,297
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

414
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,002
You can't stay here.

415
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,509
You have to keep moving.

416
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,261
We can't go out there.

417
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,432
You have to.

418
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,143
Everyone out there is dead.

419
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,772
If you stay here, you'll die.

420
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,354
Follow me.

421
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,357
Follow me!

422
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:26,490
- Come on, quickly. Come to me.
- It's safer up there.

423
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,445
Come on, quickly. All of you.

424
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:33,377
Run!

425
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,624
Run!

426
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,134
Mama!

427
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,432
Mama!

428
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,475
Mama! No.

429
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,518
Mama! Mama!

430
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:54,854
Mama!

431
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,311
Get up.

432
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,442
Get up!

433
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,027
We have to keep moving.

434
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,988
Take her.

435
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,414
Take her!

436
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,999
- Take her.
- Come on!

437
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,664
Come on!

438
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,811
This way.

439
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,525
I want our baby to live.

440
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,830
I want our baby to live.

441
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,752
I want our baby to live.

442
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:43,942
Don't let me die, Jaime.

443
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,835
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

444
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,090
I don't want to die.

445
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,674
Just look... Look at me.

446
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:55,805
- Look at me.
- Not like this.

447
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:59,229
- Not like this. Not like this.
- Look... Look... Look me in the eye.

448
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,726
Don't look away. Don't look...

449
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,025
Look at me! Just look at me.

450
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,740
Nothing else matters.

451
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,285
Nothing else matters.

452
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:15,738
Only us.
