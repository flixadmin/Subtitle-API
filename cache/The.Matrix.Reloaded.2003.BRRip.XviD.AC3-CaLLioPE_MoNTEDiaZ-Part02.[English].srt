1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,090
Get out.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,350
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,430
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,940
He was so different.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,320
He was like you.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,830
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,870
- What?
- A kiss.

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,370
Excuse me?

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,790
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,340
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

11
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
It's all over you both.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,720
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,810
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,900
Just a sample.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,070
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,240
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,580
Why should we trust you?

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,750
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,970
All right.

20
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,140
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

21
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,390
All right.

22
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,520
Terrible. Forget it.

23
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,950
Wait.

24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,450
Okay.

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,570
Yes.

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,660
That's it.

27
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,840
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

28
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,220
Come with me.

29
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,050
Not again.

30
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,090
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

31
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,140
These fellas work for my husband.

32
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,140
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

33
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,850
Aren't you, boys?

34
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,060
Yes, mistress.

35
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,940
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

36
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,280
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

37
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,030
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

38
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,250
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,170
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

40
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,920
...or you can stay there and die.

41
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,800
He's in the ladies' room!

42
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,810
Hurry.

43
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,550
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

44
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,630
I've been waiting for you.

45
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,140
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

46
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,360
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

47
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,490
There is no cause for this. What cause?

48
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,950
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

49
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,830
Lipstick? Lipstick.

50
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,830
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

51
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,210
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

52
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,800
Woman, this is nothing.

53
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,510
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

54
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Have fun.

55
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,900
All right.

56
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,780
All right.

57
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,820
Let us find out where this goes.

58
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,870
You two, get the Keymaker.

59
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,370
That's a nice trick.

60
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,830
I cannot go back.

61
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,380
I'll handle them.

62
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,010
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

63
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,440
Okay, you have some skill.

64
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,650
Kill him.

65
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,880
You see? He's just a man.

66
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,440
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

67
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,530
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

68
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,910
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

69
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,390
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

70
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,440
Close it, quick!

71
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,740
Could we move along?

72
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,870
Run!

73
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,130
Step away from the door.

74
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,520
We owe you for that.

75
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,980
Just like new.

76
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,690
Drop your weapon.

77
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,940
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

78
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,610
He can handle himself.

79
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,780
Get in back.

80
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,660
Shit.

81
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,620
- Operator.
- Link, where am I?

82
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,370
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

83
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,000
- Really?
- It'll take me a while to get an exit.

84
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,500
- Shit!
- What?

85
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,420
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

86
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,920
- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

87
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,320
- Operator.
- Get us out of here.

88
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,190
- Won't be easy.
- I know. We're inside the core network.

89
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,990
The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.

90
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,240
- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,160
- Fine, we'll make it.
- I should- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!

92
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,790
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

93
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,220
Hold on!

94
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,700
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

95
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,620
Are you watching this, Link?

96
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,410
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

97
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,410
Any suggestions?

98
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,250
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

99
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,590
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

100
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,430
- Got it.
- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

101
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,310
- In 14 years of operating, I've never seen-
- Link, what did I tell you?

102
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,940
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

103
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,560
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

104
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,940
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

105
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,690
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

106
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,820
Then let us hope...

107
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,410
...that I was wrong.

108
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,380
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

109
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,130
We've been sent to bring you in.

110
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,420
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

111
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,590
- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.

112
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,020
Repeat, they're approaching the-

113
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,400
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

114
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,050
Shots fired.

115
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,510
Move!

116
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,710
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

117
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Trinity.

118
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,300
Get him out of here.

119
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,060
Come on!

120
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,580
Crush him.

121
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
Morpheus.

122
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,770
He's okay. Keep moving.

123
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,530
Let's go.

124
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,450
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

125
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,950
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle-

126
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,540
Wait.

127
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,420
Cancel that.

128
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,750
You are handy.

129
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,840
Jump on.

130
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,150
She means nothing.

131
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,450
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

132
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,950
One-Adam- 12, please respond.

133
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,130
Get down.

134
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,760
Gotcha.

135
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,590
She's good.

136
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,230
You are no longer necessary.

137
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,610
We do only what we're meant to do.

138
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,820
Then you are meant for one more thing:
deletion.

139
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,660
Go kick his ass.

140
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,460
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

141
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,670
What is that?

142
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,410
Yes! Yes!

143
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,170
We have confirmation from the Icarus.

144
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,180
First two ships
are in position for counterattack.

145
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,430
Good.

146
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,470
Any change?

147
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,430
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

148
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,690
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

149
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,400
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

150
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,860
Yes, sir.

151
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,770
There is a building.

152
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:11,570
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

153
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,650
...and no stair can reach.

154
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,410
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.

155
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,950
Hidden places.

156
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,870
But one door is special.

157
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,290
One door leads to the source.

158
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,010
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

159
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,730
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

160
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,650
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

161
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,810
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

162
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,320
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

163
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,660
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

164
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,620
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

165
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,500
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

166
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,830
There is a power station.

167
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,210
It must be destroyed.

168
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,720
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

169
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,180
The core network of the grid
must be accessed.

170
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,180
The emergency system
must be deactivated.

171
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,730
What do you need us for?

172
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,060
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

173
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,980
- There's no time.
- Why?

174
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,320
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

175
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,780
But another connection
must first be made.

176
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,450
- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.

177
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,160
Just over five minutes.

178
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,620
That is the length and breadth
of the window.

179
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,040
Only the One can open the door...

180
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,170
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

181
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,040
How do you know all this?

182
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,340
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

183
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:07,060
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

184
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,570
Neo, I know something's wrong.

185
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,320
You don't have to tell me.

186
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,240
I just want you to know that I'm here.

187
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,250
All must be done as one.

188
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,670
Can't hurt.

189
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,260
If one fails...

190
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,800
...all fail.

191
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,970
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

192
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,560
At midnight, we will strike.

193
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,270
Hey!

194
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,400
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

195
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,790
Okay, they're inside.

196
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,460
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

197
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,300
Oh, shit.

198
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:29,100
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

199
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,770
Tonight is not an accident.

200
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
There are no accidents.

201
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,570
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

202
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,280
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

203
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,990
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

204
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,620
I see purpose.

205
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,670
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

206
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,840
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

207
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,390
...the very meaning of our lives.

208
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,690
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

209
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,230
I promise you, if I can, I will.

210
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,860
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

211
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,820
...no matter what...

212
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,360
...to stay out of the Matrix?

213
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,200
Why?

214
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,500
Please.

215
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,960
All right.

216
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,800
What is it, Niobe?

217
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,100
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

218
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,520
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

219
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,690
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

220
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,730
But how would that be different
from any other day?

221
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,750
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

222
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,920
Death can come for us at any time...

223
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,210
...in any place.

224
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,300
Incoming. Incoming!

225
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,930
Incoming!

226
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,270
Now consider the alternative.

227
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,070
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

228
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,610
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

229
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,580
Isn't that worth fighting for?

230
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,370
Isn't that worth dying for?

231
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,870
- Time?
- Three minutes.

232
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,210
Almost there.

233
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,650
It is done.

234
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,060
Find the others.

235
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,440
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

236
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,280
- What about Soren?
- There.

237
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,280
They're still inside, but...

238
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
They're not moving.

239
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,310
That's it, let's go.

240
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,270
Call Neo now.

241
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,030
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

242
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,700
Everything is operational.
The emergency system is rerouting power.

243
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,500
Jesus.

244
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,760
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

245
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,880
The hell it is.

246
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,970
What are you-? Trinity!

247
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,220
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

248
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,520
We're talking less than five minutes.

249
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,230
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

250
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,900
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

251
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,240
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

252
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,870
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

253
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,250
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

254
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,890
- Operator.
- I'm in.

255
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,190
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

256
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,980
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

257
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,490
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

258
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,570
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

259
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:46,290
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

260
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,120
I want exactly what you want.

261
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,380
I want everything.

262
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,340
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

263
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,300
Go ahead, shoot.

264
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:01,720
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

265
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,780
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

266
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,700
Hold it right there, little lady.

267
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,830
If you can't beat us...

268
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,840
Join us.

269
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,090
Morpheus!

270
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,770
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

271
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,580
One minute.

272
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,880
Come on.

273
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,970
Come on.

274
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,390
Please.

275
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,860
Kill them.

276
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,780
They're in.

277
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,910
I don't believe it.

278
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,630
It was meant to be.

279
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,140
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

280
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,240
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

281
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,950
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

282
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,590
Hello, Neo.

283
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,930
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

284
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,720
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

285
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,190
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

286
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,350
...you remain irrevocably human.

287
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,070
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

288
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,570
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

289
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,450
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

290
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,950
Why am I here?

291
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,000
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

292
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,540
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

293
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,800
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

294
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,800
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

295
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,390
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

296
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,100
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

297
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,690
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

298
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,820
...which has led you, inexorably...

299
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,070
...here.

300
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,320
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

301
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:34,280
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

302
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,040
Others? How many?
What others?

303
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,710
The Matrix is older than you know.

304
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:43,880
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

305
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,340
In which case, this is the sixth version.

306
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,920
Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.

307
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,680
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.

308
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,100
Either no one told me...

309
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,350
- ... or no one knows.
- Precisely.

310
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,860
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

311
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,400
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

312
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,860
You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!

313
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,820
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

314
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,160
You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!

315
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,950
Choice.

316
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,960
The problem is choice.

317
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,770
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

318
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,820
Flawless, sublime.

319
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,450
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

320
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,530
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

321
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,080
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

322
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,160
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

323
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,340
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

324
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,800
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

325
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,930
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

326
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,140
...because it required a lesser mind.

327
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:23,270
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

328
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:28,070
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

329
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:33,030
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

330
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,160
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

331
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,080
- The Oracle.
- Please.

332
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,830
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

333
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,880
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

334
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,170
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

335
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,760
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

336
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,930
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

337
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,770
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

338
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,310
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

339
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,530
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

340
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,530
This is about Zion.

341
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,620
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

342
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,250
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

343
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,540
Bullshit.

344
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,880
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

345
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,590
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

346
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,760
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

347
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,780
The function of the One...

348
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,570
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

349
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,450
...reinserting the prime program.

350
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,080
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

351
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,500
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

352
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,210
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

353
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,670
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

354
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,470
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

355
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,800
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

356
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,230
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

357
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,690
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

358
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,650
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

359
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,360
...to accept the responsibility for the
death of every human being in this world.

360
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,370
It is interesting reading your reactions.

361
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,250
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

362
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,920
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

363
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,630
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

364
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,180
While the others experience this
in a general way...

365
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,310
...your experience is far more specific...

366
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,520
...vis-à-vis love.

367
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,150
Trinity!

368
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,740
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

369
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,150
No.

370
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,990
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

371
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,250
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

372
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,420
...as both beginning and end.

373
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,250
There are two doors.

374
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,670
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

375
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:43,510
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

376
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,100
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

377
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,730
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

378
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,020
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

379
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:02,400
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

380
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:07,240
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

381
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,870
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

382
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,010
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

383
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,890
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

384
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:31,390
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

385
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,980
We won't.

386
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,610
We got a serious situation, sir.

387
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,200
Oh, no.

388
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,340
- What was that? - It's moving
faster than anything I've seen.

389
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,770
Holy shit, he caught her.

390
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,540
Neo, I had to.

391
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,500
I know.

392
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,050
The bullet is still inside.

393
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,770
Trinity...

394
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,690
...don't you quit on me now.

395
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,410
I'm sorry.

396
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,250
Trinity.

397
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,180
Trinity...

398
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,100
...I know you can hear me.

399
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,470
I'm not letting go.

400
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,230
I can't.

401
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,690
I love you too damn much.

402
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,630
I can't take this.

403
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,520
I guess this makes us even.

404
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,110
I don't understand it.

405
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,280
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

406
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,540
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

407
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,540
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

408
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:09,000
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

409
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,090
- What?
- How do you know that?

410
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,550
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

411
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,390
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

412
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:21,390
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us-
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

413
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,690
The prophecy was a lie.

414
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,940
The One was never meant
to end anything.

415
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,150
It was all another system of control.

416
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,410
I don't believe that.

417
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,070
But you said it yourself.

418
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,250
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

419
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,840
I'm sorry.

420
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,420
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

421
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,760
...I swear to you it's the truth.

422
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,680
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

423
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,060
Oh, no!

424
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,740
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

425
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,490
It's a bomb.

426
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,910
We have to get out of here. Now.

427
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,450
I have dreamed a dream...

428
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,920
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

429
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,220
Here they come.

430
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,180
Let's go, Morpheus.

431
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,600
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

432
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,360
- Come on!
- Something's different.

433
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,530
What?

434
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,700
I can feel them.

435
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,180
Neo!

436
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,990
- What happened?
- I don't know.

437
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,160
It's the Hammer.

438
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,550
He's in some kind of coma...

439
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,930
...but his vitals are stable.

440
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,050
What about you?

441
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,350
I'm fine.

442
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,930
You could use some rest.

443
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,940
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

444
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,610
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

445
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,660
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

446
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,580
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

447
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:13,290
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

448
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,170
...until someone screwed it up.

449
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,920
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

450
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:22,920
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

451
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,340
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

452
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:29,350
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

453
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,930
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

454
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,850
Who?

455
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,730
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

456
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,190
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

457
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,530
You found one?

458
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,990
Only one.

459
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,380
Everything that has a beginning...

460
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,250
...has an end.

461
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,550
I see the end coming.

462
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,510
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.

463
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,640
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

464
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,810
We missed you.

465
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,810
It ends tonight.

466
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:12,110
You are all that stands in his way.

467
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,290
If you cannot stop him tonight, then
I fear that tomorrow may never come.
