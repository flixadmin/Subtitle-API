1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,270
Yo, so, what's next?

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,750
We wait.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,830
We don't got like eight more

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,830
anal things we gotta do first?

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,390
The reaction has begun.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,790
Yeah, I know. So how long?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,310
Well, if we had a freezer, the condensed

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,310
liquid would cool more quickly

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,550
because, of course,

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,550
this is an exothermic reaction,

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,550
which means

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,870
"giving off heat."

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,110
And our desired product is...

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,510
Put me into a coma, why don't you?

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,070
What did you just say?

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,190
What? What? Nothing.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,510
Huh.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,390
No, no, no. Not in here.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,870
Duh. Like I'm an idiot.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,110
Yeah. Like you're an idiot.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,870
Dick.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,350
Aah.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,910
God. Jesus. God.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,150
Shut up.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,390
Oh, wow.

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,430
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm not

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,430
doing the receipts right.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,910
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,550
He's got a stick up his butt?

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,790
He's got a bug up his butt

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,790
about the receipts, anyways.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,470
So anyway, he's insisting that I--

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,950
He's demanding that I stay

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,350
and look over his system

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,990
and I cannot get out of it.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Yeah.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,670
Hello.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,670
Hi, honey. It's me.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,630
Hey, you. What's going on?

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,630
Nothing much.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,590
I was just calling

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,590
to say I'm sorry

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,070
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,430
Bogdan. He's got

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,430
a bug up his butt.

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,710
That's okay. I wasn't planning

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,710
anything special for dinner, so...

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,190
In fact, you could take pity on us

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,190
and bring a pizza home.

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,590
They're having a two-for-one

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,590
at Venezia's.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,310
At this point,

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,310
I could eat a whole one by myself.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,030
Yeah, yeah, sure.

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,030
I can pick up a pizza.

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,310
Hopefully Bogdan

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,310
won't keep me too late.

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,750
He better not. Trust me,

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,750
he does not want to piss off

60
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,750
a hungry pregnant woman.

61
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,080
Ooh, what's that sound?

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,080
I just sold your favorite piece.

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,870
The hideous crying clown.

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,870
Wow.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,510
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,510
more than I paid for it.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,710
Shows what I know about art.

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,470
Hey, what do you think about Holly?

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,070
For the baby's name.

70
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,830
Do you like it?

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,670
I think I really like it.

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,270
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,710
Let me think about it.

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,150
Just feels right, you know?

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,150
It's my new favorite.

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,670
Well, it's a front-runner, for sure.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,200
Listen, I was thinking, um, maybe we can

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,200
have a little family time this weekend.

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,390
Oh, yeah?

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,390
Yeah.

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,590
You know, just take a drive.

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,110
The almost four of us.

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,110
Ha-ha-ha.

84
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,510
Maybe we can head up

85
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,510
the Turquoise Trail,

86
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,870
stop at Tinkertown,

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,870
maybe grab some lunch in Madrid.

88
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,390
Oh, my God.

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,390
We haven't been there in forever.

90
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,670
I know.

91
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,670
Yeah.

92
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,600
So why don't we just do that?

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,600
Take a little break?

94
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,550
Sold. Sounds fun.

95
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,510
Holly. It's growing on me.

96
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,110
Yep. Me too.

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,910
All right, well, I had better go

98
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,910
and get this in the mail.

99
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,790
Why don't you call me

100
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,790
when you're on your way home?

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,270
Will do. Love you.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,270
Love you too.

103
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,070
Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,310
What the hell did we just walk into?

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,950
Hey, Uncle Jack,

106
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,950
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,990
He was right here before.

108
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,470
- Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?

109
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,470
- No.

110
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
What do you figure? He maybe

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
headed down that gully there?

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,150
That's the way I'd go.

113
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,270
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

114
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,110
Jack.

115
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,590
These guys are DEA.

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,150
No! Jack, no!

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,030
Jack! Jack! Jack!

118
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,990
No! No, don't!

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,350
Jack, don't. No.

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,190
No, Jack, Jack, Jack!

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,190
Jack, no!

122
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,550
Jack, no. Don't kill him.

123
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,550
Uh-uh-uh. Back it up.

124
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,750
Don't kill him, Jack.

125
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,750
Get back here.

126
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,230
The hell not? He's DEA.

127
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,910
No, he's family.

128
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,270
Say again?

129
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,030
He's my family.

130
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,230
He's my brother-in-law.

131
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,590
Didn't cross your mind

132
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,590
to maybe tell us

133
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,260
you had a DEA agent

134
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,260
for a brother-in-law?

135
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,670
Did you know about this?

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,670
I called you off, remember?

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,350
I told you not to come.

138
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,350
Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.

139
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,230
- You weren't supposed to be here.

140
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,230
- Too late now.

141
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,270
How's about you telling me

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,270
what was going down out here? Hm?

143
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,030
You and your brother-in-law

144
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,030
don't seem to be getting along too well.

145
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,150
It doesn't matter.

146
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,150
It doesn't concern you.

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,550
We just wasted his partner here,

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,550
and he's wearing a bullet,

149
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,400
so, yeah, I'd say

150
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,400
it does concern me.

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,320
This is between him and me.

152
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,030
No cavalry coming?

153
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,630
No.

154
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
You bet your ass the cavalry's coming.

155
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,270
No, no, no! Jack--

156
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,630
Jack! No, the DEA

157
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,630
doesn't know about this.

158
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,150
Not yet.

159
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,230
Hank.

160
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,190
Nothing can change

161
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,190
what just happened,

162
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,040
but you can walk out of here alive

163
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,910
if you just promise us

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,910
that you'll let this go.

165
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,910
Yeah, I thought as much.

166
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Sorry, man. Just no scenario

167
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
where this guy lives.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,950
No, no, no, listen! I have money!

169
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,240
I have money!

170
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,240
It's buried out here. It's...

171
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,840
It's $80 million.

172
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,360
Eighty million.

173
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,270
Hm. So that's what got

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,270
this party started, huh?

175
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,030
But this money of yours

176
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,030
won't do me much good in prison.

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,910
You can go anywhere.

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,910
You can do anything. Think about it.

179
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,430
You can have any future

180
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,430
that you want.

181
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,110
Jack.

182
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,470
Eighty million.

183
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,430
And all you've got to do

184
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,270
is let him go.

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,310
That's a hell of an offer.

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,550
What do you think, fed?

187
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,590
Would you take that deal?

188
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,550
It's Hank.

189
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,990
His name is Hank.

190
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,150
How about it, Hank?

191
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,750
Should I let you go?

192
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,790
My name is ASAC Schrader.

193
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,790
And you can go fuck yourself.

194
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,790
Hank, listen to me.

195
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,830
You gotta tell him.

196
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,600
You gotta tell him now

197
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,600
that we can work this out.

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,990
Please. Please.

199
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,950
What? You want me to beg?

200
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,390
You're the smartest guy I ever met.

201
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,430
And you're too stupid to see...

202
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,870
he made up his mind

203
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,870
10 minutes ago.

204
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,900
Do what you're gonna do.

205
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,950
Pretty specific directions.

206
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,550
Most people tell me to be somewhere,

207
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,550
they say, "West on the 40,

208
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,670
this or that exit, second gas station

209
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,670
on the left." You know?

210
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,350
This here? This is a whole other story.

211
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,070
That fancy phone of yours,

212
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,070
where does it say this is exactly?

213
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,270
Yeah.

214
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,990
Look at this.

215
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,990
They even brought a shovel.

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,510
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,990
All right.

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,550
Says this is it right here.

219
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,270
Dig.

220
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,870
What's that? A barrel?

221
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,870
Couple barrels?

222
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,550
- Oh, Jesus.

223
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,550
- Hell, yeah!

224
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,670
Oh, Jesus. Would you

225
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,670
look at that? Ha-ha-ha.

226
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,110
- Hell, yeah!

227
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,110
- Goddamn.

228
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,510
Whoo!

229
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,190
What are you waiting for?

230
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,630
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.

231
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,670
Let me get on this side.

232
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,670
Get that out of there, man.

233
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,270
Okay. Pull a barrel off the truck

234
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,270
and load it in the Chrysler.

235
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,590
Seriously?

236
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,590
Jack.

237
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,590
That's like 10 or 11 million right there.

238
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,590
You sure you wanna do that?

239
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,190
You gonna make me

240
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,190
say it again? Go, go.

241
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,750
Chop, chop.

242
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,670
Jesus, what's with

243
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,670
all the greed here?

244
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,670
It's unattractive.

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,350
Hey.

246
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,670
Hey.

247
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,550
I'm leaving you a barrel.

248
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,990
Boys are gonna load it for you.

249
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,150
You got the keys to these cuffs?

250
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,070
I'm sorry for your loss.

251
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,110
My nephew here, he respects you.

252
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,430
He would never forgive me

253
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,430
if things went another way.

254
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,430
Also you caught me in a good mood.

255
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,070
So here's what's gonna happen.

256
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,070
You're gonna get in your car,

257
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,670
and you're gonna drive out of here,

258
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,670
all right?

259
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,910
No hard feelings.

260
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,990
Understand me?

261
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,390
We square?

262
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,710
Hey, man, I gotta know

263
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,710
we're square, or we're gonna

264
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,710
have to go that other way.

265
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,830
Pinkman.

266
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,710
Pinkman.

267
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,750
You still owe me.

268
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,590
If you can find him,

269
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,590
we'll kill him.

270
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,840
Found him.

271
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,590
No!

272
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,830
Get off me!

273
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,070
Get off!

274
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,710
No, no.

275
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,870
Good to go?

276
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,790
Hey, Uncle Jack.

277
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,550
Well, he was out here

278
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,550
with those feds.

279
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,070
Right? Working with them.

280
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,070
Should we maybe find out

281
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,070
what he told them first?

282
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,110
Because, I mean, he had

283
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,110
to have told them some stuff

284
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,710
that might not be too good for us.

285
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,950
And I'll bet we could

286
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,680
get it out of him back home.

287
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,190
I mean, I can do it.

288
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,390
Me and him, we got history.

289
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,910
And then, you know, we'd

290
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,910
take care of the job after that.

291
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,070
Works for me. Work for you?

292
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,190
Let's go, pal.

293
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,190
No.

294
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,880
No!

295
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,590
No!

296
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,990
No!

297
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,710
Wait.

298
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,760
I watched Jane die.

299
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,310
I was there.

300
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,350
And I watched her die.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,390
I watched her overdose

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,390
and choke to death.

303
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,430
I could have saved her.

304
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,230

Hi.

332
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,790
Hello.

333
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,630
That truck belong to you?

334
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,240
It does.

335
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,590
I'd like to buy it.

336
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,190
It's not for sale.

337
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,510
Hey, Walt, it's me. Um,

338
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,390
just thought I'd try you again.

339
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,510
We were just wondering

340
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,510
when you thought you'd be back,

341
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,760
so just give us a call

342
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,760
whenever you can.

343
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,990
Bye.

344
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,230
Hey, Aunt Marie.

345
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,270
Hey, sweetie.

346
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,030
Haven't seen you for a while.

347
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,030
What have you been up to?

348
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,430
Oh, you know. This and that.

349
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,230
Your mom and I need to talk,

350
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,230
so thought I'd stop by.

351
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,470
Well, I, uh,

352
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,470
wish you'd called first.

353
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,070
This isn't the best time.

354
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,830
Well, Flynn looks like

355
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,830
he can hold down the fort.

356
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,070
Why don't we go into your office?

357
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,790
I got it.

358
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,950
Okay, honey. Thanks.

359
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,390
Marie, I have nothing to say.

360
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,390
Well, I do.

361
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,510
So you can just sit there

362
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,510
and listen.

363
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,150
I got a call from Hank.

364
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,150
He arrested Walt

365
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,720
three hours ago.

366
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,470
It's over.

367
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,470
"Dead to rights"

368
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,470
I believe is the expression.

369
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,310
Hank and Steve Gomez are working

370
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,310
with a former associate of Walt's,

371
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,670
Jesse Pinkman,

372
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,670
whom I know you know,

373
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,350
and Pinkman has supplied them

374
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,350
with everything they need.

375
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,430
Hank is booking Walt

376
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,430
as we speak.

377
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,230
And I, for one, could not be happier.

378
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,110
I almost didn't come here.

379
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,790
Christ, I barely even know

380
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,790
who you are,

381
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,470
and I sure as hell don't know

382
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,470
if I can ever trust you again.

383
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,390
And then I think about

384
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,390
how you were so upset with Walt

385
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,390
and how you wanted

386
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,390
the kids out of the house,

387
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,310
and all of this makes me believe

388
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,310
that there has got to be hope for you,

389
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,300
that whatever he did to you

390
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,300
can be undone.

391
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,870
All I know, all I have been

392
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,870
forcing myself to remember,

393
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,630
is that you are my sister.

394
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,230
And so I'm here.

395
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,790
Marie--

396
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,790
Everything changes now.

397
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,030
And you have got

398
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,030
to prepare yourself.

399
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,390
Hank will help you as much

400
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,390
as he can. I know he will.

401
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,430
And I will support you through this.

402
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,750
But I have conditions.

403
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,270
Give me every single copy

404
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,270
of that obscenity

405
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,880
that the two of you made

406
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,880
to discredit Hank.

407
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,950
That DVD. Every single copy.

408
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,390
You understand me?

409
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,990
Answer me.

410
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,990
Do you understand me?

411
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,630
Yes.

412
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,750
Good.

413
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,550
Now dry your eyes

414
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,550
and get Flynn in here.

415
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,830
You are going to tell him everything,

416
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,830
and I mean everything.

417
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,390
He deserves to know

418
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,390
the truth from his family.

419
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,550
Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.

420
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,510
No. No. No, he cannot know.

421
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,510
You tell him,

422
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,070
or I will.

423
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,670
There's no way around this.

424
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,710
He needs to know,

425
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,710
and he needs to know now.

426
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,080
No.

427
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,720
Look, I gave you what you wanted.

428
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,150
Come on, please.

429
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,710
Hey, please.

430
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,350
I told you where to find the tape, okay?

431
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,350
Yup.

432
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,870
Hey, just go.

433
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,590
Just go there.

434
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,590
Just go to his house and get it.

435
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,590
We're on it.

436
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,590
Get it!

437
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,270
No one else knows about it.

438
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,270
Just me and his partner.

439
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,430
Okay.

440
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,430
No one else knows, I swear!

441
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,350
Let's cook.

442
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,550
You're completely out of your mind.

443
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,630
It's the truth.

444
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,630
It is, Flynn.

445
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,110
Then both of you

446
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,110
are out of your minds.

447
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,990
You're full of shit,

448
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,990
is what you are. Both of you.

449
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,160
If this is true, then how could you

450
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,160
keep this a secret?

451
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,710
I mean, why?

452
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,710
Why would you go along?

453
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,230
I'll be asking myself that

454
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,230
for the rest of my life.

455
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,150
So you're saying all this time

456
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,150
you were lying about this?

457
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,710
I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.

458
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,870
You just admitted it.

459
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,670
So were you lying then,

460
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,670
or are you lying now?

461
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,280
Which lie is it?

462
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,590
Flynn, honey,

463
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,150
your mother

464
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,150
is telling you the truth.

465
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,110
Right here, right now. Believe it.

466
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,280
You know what? This is bullshit.

467
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,280
This is bullshit.

468
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,990
Baby--

469
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,990
I wanna talk to Dad.

470
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,230
Your dad's in custody.

471
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,230
You can't talk to him for a while.

472
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,430
I'm calling Uncle Hank.

473
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,430
I've tried. He's not answering.

474
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,590
He's probably in the thick of it

475
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,950
with your father. Honey, I know

476
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,950
this is a lot to process, Flynn,

477
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,070
but if you could just breathe,

478
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,070
just try to breathe

479
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,350
and just trust--

480
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,350
Really? Really? Try to breathe?

481
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,110
Oh, my God.

482
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,840
Go home.

483
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,710
Just take the kids home, okay?

484
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,710
Go home and regroup.

485
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,870
I'll stop by later.

486
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,280
Flynn?

487
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
Could you put

488
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
your seatbelt on, please?

489
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,710
Please. It's not safe.

490
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,590
You're shitting me, right?

491
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,760
If all this is true

492
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,760
and you knew about it,

493
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,230
then you're as bad as him.

494
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,870
Whose truck is that?

495
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,310
Dad?

496
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,350
Listen, I need you to come inside

497
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,350
and pack right now.

498
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,510
Mom, Aunt Marie,

499
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,310
they said that you were arrested?

500
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,310
No, just--

501
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,150
You're some kind of drug dealer?

502
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,350
No, just come inside,

503
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,350
please. Now.

504
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,710
Come inside. Come on.

505
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,750
Go, go, go.

506
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,700
Dad, stop. Just talk to me, please.

507
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,700
Our priority right now is to pack.

508
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,030
Uncle Hank, they said he arrested you?

509
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,030
I will discuss all of this later, okay?

510
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,350
Just tell me what--

511
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,710
Just listen to me!

512
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,590
Go into your bedroom now,

513
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,590
grab anything important.

514
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,950
You understand? Go. Now.

515
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,950
Both of you. Go.

516
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,270
Walt.

517
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,710
Why are you here?

518
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,790
Skyler, please,

519
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,790
will you just go get your things?

520
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,030
For you and the kids. Now.

521
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,030
This is our priority.

522
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,070
Hank had you in custody.

523
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,070
He wouldn't just let you go.

524
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,110
Where is he?

525
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,110
I--

526
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,190
Where's Hank?

527
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,190
I....

528
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,510
I negotiated--

529
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,390
Negotiated?

530
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,390
Yes.

531
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,470
What does that mean?

532
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,710
It means we're fine, okay?

533
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,590
We are. We're fine.

534
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,590
Everything is gonna be fine,

535
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,590
but we need to leave right now.

536
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,830
All right? Can we do that?

537
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,070
What happened?

538
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,350
Where is Hank?

539
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,960
Why do we need to leave?

540
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,670
I need both of you to trust me.

541
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,830
Right now, okay?

542
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,110
Please, just work with me here,

543
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,990
and I promise I will explain

544
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,990
everything later, okay?

545
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,790
Where is Hank?

546
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,030
Skyler.

547
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,720
I have $11 million in cash

548
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,720
right outside.

549
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,510
We can have a fresh start.

550
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,750
Whole new lives.

551
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,950
All we have to do is go.

552
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,470
We have to go right now.

553
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,070
That's all we have to do.

554
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,270
You killed him.

555
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,270
You killed Hank.

556
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,030
What?

557
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,030
No, no, no.

558
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,800
You killed him. Aah!

559
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,800
No, no, no!

560
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,710
I tried to save him.

561
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,150
Uncle Hank is dead? I--

562
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,830
Mom, it can't be true. It just can't be true.

563
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,830
Just stop, please.

564
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,990
Everything is gonna be okay.

565
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,910
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise,

566
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,910
but we need to leave right now.

567
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,580
Dad, what's going on? Talk to me.

568
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,150
Just stop for one second.

569
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,510
- Look, I told you to get your things.

570
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,510
- Stop walking away.

571
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,030
- There is no time.

572
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,030
- Tell me about Uncle Hank.

573
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,630
- No, just drop it!

574
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,630
- But what's wrong with you?

575
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,830
We're going.

576
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,830
We're going right now.

577
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,030
You have to tell me. Dad, wait.

578
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,670
What happened to Uncle Hank?

579
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,670
What--?

580
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,150
Get out.

581
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,740
Skyler, I promise you,

582
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,740
we will figure this out.

583
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,910
Enough.

584
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,910
Mom,

585
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,670
what are you doing?

586
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,070
Skyler, put the knife down, please.

587
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,950
I promise you, everything--

588
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,950
Don't say one more word.

589
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,790
Get out of here now.

590
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,710
Skyler--

591
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,710
Get out!

592
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,310
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!

593
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,270
Let go! Let go!

594
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,270
Get away from us!

595
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,310
Just stop! Stop!

596
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,430
Dad, stop it! Stop!

597
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,270
Mom, stop it.

598
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,070
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.

599
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,030
Stop! Just, please, stop!

600
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,990
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

601
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,140
What the hell is wrong with you?!

602
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,140
We're a family!

603
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,430
We're a family.

604
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,270
What are you doing?

605
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,960
What are you doing?

606
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,380
Yeah, I need the police.

607
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,110
My dad, he pulled a knife

608
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,110
on my mom.

609
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,880
He attacked her. He's dangerous.

610
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,150
I think he might have

611
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,150
killed somebody.

612
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,030
Yeah.

613
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,550
He's still here.

614
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,590
Yeah, he's still in the house.

615
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,760
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

616
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,430
308 Negra Arroyo Lane!

617
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,430
You've gotta come quick.

618
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,030
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!

619
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,790
Oh, my God. No.

620
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,230
Walt, no! Walt!

621
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,230
Mom!

622
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,110
Walt, please, no!

623
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,550
No! No! No!

624
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,630
Walt, no! Let her go!

625
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,470
You can't take her!

626
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,510
Let her go, please!

627
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,510
You can't take her!

628
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,830
Let her go! Walt!

629
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,310
Walt, please, no!

630
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,870
Walt, no! Walt, please!

631
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,830
Walt, no!

632
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,830
Walt, please, no!

633
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,910
Walt, please!

634
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,110
Please, stop! Walt!

635
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,510
Say, "Da-da."

636
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,030
Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?

637
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,070
There. Get rid of that

638
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,070
stinky old diaper, huh?

639
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,950
Don't be sad.

640
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,950
Where's your belly button?

641
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,590
Where's your belly button?

642
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,070
There. Now, don't you feel better?

643
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,270
You're all nice and dry. Huh?

644
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,310
That feels good? Oh, I know.

645
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,990
You were so wet and so cranky,

646
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,990
but now you feel better, don't you?

647
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,870
Next order of business

648
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,870
is to get you a brand-new car seat.

649
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,390
Won't that be nice, Holly?

650
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,190
Mama.

651
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,350
Mama.

652
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,950
Mama.

653
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,230
Mama.

654
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,110
Mama.

655
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,310
Mama.

656
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,350
Mama.

657
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,270
Confirming the abduction.

658
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,070
Amber Alert. Holly White.

659
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,350
Female, 18 months.

660
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,470
Blond hair, blue eyes.

661
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,700
Was last seen wearing

662
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,700
a pink and white jacket, pink pants.

663
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,510
Abductor is the father...

664
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,040
He was in handcuffs.

665
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,040
Hank had him in handcuffs.

666
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,630
Bald head, goatee,

667
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,630
gold, wire-framed glasses.

668
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,470
Are you expecting a call?

669
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,110
Hi, you've reached the White family.

670
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,110
Please leave a message.

671
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,550
Skyler, it's me. Pick up. Pick up.

672
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,150
That's him. That's my husband.

673
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,150
I need you to pick up the phone.

674
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,760
Start a trace on the landline.

675
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,430
The number's 505-177-8987.

676
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,430
I know you're there, so pick it up.

677
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,470
Skyler, you hear me?

678
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,960
Need the location of an incoming caller.

679
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,990
Answer the pho--

680
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,190
Walt, where's Holly?

681
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,990
Are you alone?

682
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,950
No police?

683
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,350
No. No police.

684
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,990
Where are you? Where's Holly?

685
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,350
Walt!

686
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,350
What the hell is wrong with you?

687
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,520
Why can't you do one thing I say?

688
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,230
What?

689
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,230
This is your fault.

690
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,190
This is what comes of your disrespect.

691
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,110
I told you, Skyler.

692
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,870
I warned you for a solid year.

693
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,630
You cross me,

694
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,630
there will be consequences.

695
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,910
What part of that

696
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,910
didn't you understand?

697
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,840
You took my child.

698
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,390
Because you need to learn.

699
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,470
You bring her back.

700
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,910
Maybe now you'll listen.

701
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,910
Maybe now you'll use your damn head.

702
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,430
You know, you never believed in me.

703
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,750
You were never grateful

704
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,750
for anything I did for this family.

705
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,670
"Oh, no. Walt. Walt, you have to stop.

706
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,710
You have to stop this.

707
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,710
It's immoral. It's illegal.

708
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,110
Someone might get hurt."

709
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,030
You're always whining and complaining

710
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,030
about how I make my money,

711
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,190
just dragging me down,

712
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,190
while I do everything.

713
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,830
And now--

714
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,190
Now you tell my son what I do,

715
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,110
after I've told you and told you

716
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,110
to keep your damn mouth shut.

717
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,230
You stupid bitch.

718
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,110
How dare you?

719
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,870
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,830
You have no right

721
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,350
to discuss anything about what I do.

722
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,830
What the hell do you know

723
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,830
about it anyway?

724
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,270
Nothing. I built this.

725
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,550
Me. Me alone. Nobody else!

726
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,350
You're right.

727
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,990
You're right.

728
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,670
You mark my words, Skyler.

729
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,670
Toe the line

730
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,630
or you will wind up just like Hank.

731
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,760
Walt.

732
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,910
Tell me what happened.

733
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,990
Where is Hank?

734
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,270
Please.

735
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,670
We need to know.

736
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,830
You're never gonna see Hank again.

737
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,190
He crossed me.

738
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,600
You think about that.

739
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,830
Family or no.

740
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,630
You let that sink in.

741
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,630
Walt.

742
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,870
I just want Holly back.

743
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,470
Please, Walt.

744
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,430
Just come home.

745
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,750
I've still got things left to do.

746
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,150
Hey.
