1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,671
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,256
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:09,051
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,429
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,890
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,850
But by night, I'm someone else.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,144
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,771
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,273
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,921
Before he was taken,
Cayden was working on a biometric tracker

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,087
that could recognize a heartbeat,
anywhere in the world.

12
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,111
Anywhere Adrian Chase is.

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,716
You're gonna help me free Cayden
from where A.R.G.U.S. is holding him.

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,301
We can think of another way to find him.

15
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:33,576
This is our only chance.

16
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,911
Don't do this.

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,038
Helix is about to extract Cayden James.

18
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,665
You're holding someone
with no lawyer, no trial.

19
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:44,003
The woman I love could never do this.
Lyla, this job has changed you.

20
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,212
You didn't back my play.

21
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,983
All of the times that I supported you,
you couldn't do the same for me.

22
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,007
What's that?

23
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,415
- Tracker's honing in on Chase's location.
- Where is he?

24
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,387
He's here.

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,117
Felicity?

26
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,748
No, Felicity. Hey.

27
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,083
Chase. He's here.

28
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,418
Don't move.

29
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,420
That's not gonna be a problem.

30
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,089
All right. If Chase is here,
he's not on this level.

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,302
It felt like an explosion,
but there was minimal damage.

32
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,012
It was an EMP.

33
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,139
A burst of electromagnetic radiation.

34
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,058
Everything in the bunker
with an electric circuit has been fried.

35
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,476
How do you know?

36
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,314
Because the spinal implant
that helps me walk isn't working.

37
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,984
I can't feel my legs.

38
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,994
You know, under different circumstances
these chemlights might seem festive.

39
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,999
No sign of Chase.

40
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,293
Looks like the EMP was his play.

41
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,004
Elevator and security doors offline.

42
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,818
- You check the emergency exit door?
- I did. It's welded shut.

43
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,167
If Chase wasn't so evil,
I might actually be impressed.

44
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,154
The air vents are gonna be down, too...

45
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,347
The air vents will last
a little while longer, but...

46
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,017
Yeah, we have to get a message out.

47
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,644
Other than standing at the door
and yelling really loudly,

48
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,688
I don't really know what our options are.

49
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,565
We're trapped.

50
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,173
Do you ever feel like we're trapped?

51
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,088
- What do you mean?
- Like, we're trapped

52
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,364
in this vicious cycle.

53
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,008
I mean, you put an arrow
in one crime lord,

54
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,672
- and another just, like...
- pops up...

55
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,346
Well, a lot of people are trying to fill
the vacuum left by Damien Darhk.

56
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,164
Yeah. This week's winner is Werner Zytle.

57
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:26,850
- Do you have a location on him?
- Not yet,

58
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,354
but Curtis is working on fixing a 20.

59
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,984
Sounds like you don't even need me.

60
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,891
Have you seen Curtis try to throw a punch?

61
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,216
I mean, we don't need you,
we need 10 of you.

62
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,384
Nice try...

63
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,846
If we had more boots on the ground
or masks on faces, or whatever,

64
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,855
we might actually have a real possibility
at catching one of these guys

65
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,976
that is auditioning to be
the new Damien Darhk.

66
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,187
I don't have the bandwidth

67
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:51,816
or, more importantly,
the temperament to train a new team.

68
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,819
Besides you're trying
to fix something that's working.

69
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,570
We are a good team.

70
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,199
Yeah, we are and we always have been.

71
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,368
Yeah.

72
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,954
Oh, my God. That's a nasty cut.

73
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,540
Oh. Well, it's not gonna scar
but I was thinking maybe...

74
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,708
Getting some Kevlar sleeves?

75
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,293
You know me too well.

76
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,717
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

77
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:19,927
Hi, Curtis.

78
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,222
Palmer Tech has been working on
an advanced thermal imaging prototype,

79
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,559
which I borrowed, tweaked,
and developed to find...

80
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:28,144
Boom.

81
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,770
- Bad guy on a yacht.
- Dang.

82
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:30,979
Thank you for the assist.

83
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,898
See? Help is good.

84
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,714
I will contact you when I'm on-site.

85
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,574
Call me back, will you?
Better yet, just show up.

86
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,243
Things are going
all kinds of hell around here.

87
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,995
Still no luck?

88
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,538
No.

89
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,169
It's like Oliver's
dropped off the face of the Earth. Again.

90
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,587
How's it going over here?

91
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,235
Well, every defense attorney in town

92
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,758
just found out that the DA
is a serial killer, so not good.

93
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,987
You think the court's gonna
overturn Chase's convictions?

94
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,889
If I didn't, I wouldn't have convened
this war room.

95
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,909
It'd be sure nice to have
a mayor heading it up, though.

96
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,613
- You heard from Felicity?
- Radio silence.

97
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,936
- But I got Curtis.
- And?

98
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,998
He's gonna check and see
if Oliver's at the bunker.

99
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,064
Get on it.

100
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:16,983
You find Oliver yet?

101
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,237
Hey, Rene. You do realize
that you called me,

102
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,781
literally 15 minutes ago, right?

103
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,070
Blame it on Lance.
Guy gets freaky when he's worried.

104
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,454
Yeah, well. Lucky for you, I can run fast.

105
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,501
- Weird.
- What's weird?

106
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,338
No power. Whole place.

107
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,816
What are the chances that
Oliver forgot to pay his electric bill?

108
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,968
Infinitesimal, considering I rigged
the place so that it'd be off the grid...

109
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,180
And a bomb just went off.

110
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,388
Not funny.

111
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:51,101
I'm not kidding.
I heard some kind of explosion.

112
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,525
How many is that?

113
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,194
Eleven. Hasn't made a dent yet.

114
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,671
What's that thing made of anyway?

115
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,532
Keltium. It's a proprietary alloy

116
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,868
developed by the US Government
to repel nuclear blasts.

117
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,555
So, you're saying even if we had
a nuke down here, it wouldn't work?

118
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,932
Seems like Cisco did such a good job

119
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,725
of turning this place
into an impenetrable fortress,

120
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,310
he turned it
into an impenetrable deathtrap.

121
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,545
Chase doesn't want to kill me, remember?

122
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,397
Yeah, he just locked you down here
for the fun of it.

123
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,131
He locked us down here

124
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,592
because he is up to something up there...

125
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,330
And I can't do anything about it.

126
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,323
Well, the good news is
there's not much left for him to do.

127
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,909
I mean, he's already gone after
Curtis, Lance, Evelyn, even Susan,

128
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,328
and Thea's away and Lyla and J.J.
have A.R.G.U.S. protection.

129
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,353
I mean, who's left?

130
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,648
William.

131
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,086
William's in a different town, with
a different name and a different address.

132
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,110
I'd be surprised
if Chase even knows about William.

133
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,615
When he was holding me captive...

134
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,660
He showed me a picture of him.

135
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,078
What?

136
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,789
- Does he...
- Doesn't know where he is.

137
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,457
Yet.

138
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,205
We have to get out of here.

139
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,173
Cisco's original blueprints
are in that cabinet.

140
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,115
If you're just gonna stand there,
you might as well say something.

141
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,519
I thought you were sleeping.

142
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,690
I couldn't sleep.

143
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,983
I know you're upset.

144
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,612
I know you think that I violated
some kind of trust between us, but...

145
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,821
Lyla...

146
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,729
When you said that
you wouldn't become like Amanda Waller,

147
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,826
I was worried about you.

148
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,328
I'm fine.

149
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,472
You're the one who seems to have a problem

150
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,296
with the way
that I've been running A.R.G.U.S.

151
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,378
Which is particularly interesting to me
since neither one of us has a job

152
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,381
that fits
the conventional definition of morality.

153
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,708
What's that supposed to mean?

154
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,639
You're upset because A.R.G.U.S.
is locking people up without due process

155
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,388
when you and Oliver and your team
of masked recruits

156
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,891
has been playing judge and jury
for years now.

157
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,852
Lyla, I can't believe you actually
compared Team Arrow

158
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:00,147
to this clandestine
government super-agency.

159
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,066
Well, I just did!

160
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,572
Hello?

161
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,034
Diggle family? Anybody home?

162
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,080
I definitely heard Lyla yell.

163
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,581
Knock... Knock again.

164
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,876
Didn't know we were having a party.

165
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,505
I'm sensing a lot of marital tension...

166
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,483
- What do you guys want?
- So sorry to interrupt.

167
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,787
There's a problem at the bunker.

168
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,864
I can get us out of here
by climbing up the elevator shaft.

169
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,240
If you can think about
going up the elevator,

170
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,575
Chase has already
thought of a way to stop you.

171
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,743
So you're saying it's booby-trapped.

172
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,703
I'd bet my copious Palmer Tech
severance pay on it.

173
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,807
I'm saying I can handle it.

174
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,700
Or we figure out a new plan.
Like, getting a signal out to the team.

175
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,917
You just said that everything

176
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,418
with an electrical circuit down here
has been fried.

177
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,212
Only because I haven't figured out
how to get power yet.

178
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:51,031
So, figure out how to get power,
and I will go up the elevator shaft.

179
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,117
Seriously? Are you still
not listening to me?

180
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,886
Did the EMP give you short-term amnesia

181
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,222
about what we were arguing about
down here in the first place?

182
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,956
This feels like the best choice right now.

183
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,918
Besides the one I just gave you.

184
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,184
I told you so. I told you so.
I told you so.

185
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,828
How many times do you think that is?

186
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,520
I was not keeping count.

187
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,523
Eleven, I think. But not nearly enough.

188
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,984
You ready?

189
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,821
Because your operating theater is now lit.

190
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,797
And of all the things that we need to do

191
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,676
to get ourselves out
of this hermetically sealed bunker,

192
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,953
stitching up a wound from a fall that
I totally predicted isn't one of them.

193
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,789
I think that counts as 12.

194
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,540
I... Okay, I'm ready.

195
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,170
- That hurt?
- Yes. Yes, it did.

196
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,549
I won't say, "Good."
But let the record show I was tempted.

197
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,609
Do you remember what we were discussing
before we got EMP-blasted?

198
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,721
Mmm-hmm.

199
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,643
The fact that I back your play,
even when I don't agree,

200
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,897
but you don't have
the same consideration for me.

201
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,983
You didn't listen to me
when I wanted to join Helix...

202
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,485
With good reason.

203
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,074
I could say the same thing about you
a million times over, but I support you.

204
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,326
Because I trust you.

205
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,829
Felicity, I trust you.

206
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,247
Really?

207
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,961
There's a hole in your back
that says otherwise.

208
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,255
Fair enough.

209
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,537
Is that the painkillers talking?

210
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,262
If you have a plan
that will get us out of here, fantastic.

211
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,766
Let's finish this up and let's try it.

212
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,561
Okay.

213
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,021
What's an EDM?

214
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,582
Something you might hear at a nightclub.

215
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,191
This was an EMP.

216
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,087
Actually, fun fact, the previous lair
used to be underneath the nightclub.

217
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,445
- Curtis...
- Right. Sorry.

218
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,212
And you said Felicity's down there, too.

219
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,054
According to the last position
logged by her tracking nanites.

220
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,678
What do we need to get them out?

221
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,246
Rappelling gear, acetylene torches,

222
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,791
wideband active field probes,
tungsten carbide drill bits.

223
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,043
I can cobble together
most of those things but...

224
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,087
Text me a list of whatever you need,

225
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,630
A.R.G.U.S. is at your disposal.

226
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,632
- Great.
- If that's okay with you.

227
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,974
I hate to ask this, but how much air
do they have left down there?

228
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,144
Well, if they don't exert themselves,

229
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,938
five, maybe six hours.

230
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,152
Okay. Well, we're here. Now what?

231
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,082
The mainframe
has a built in cellular chip,

232
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,157
but our rewire didn't generate
enough kilowatts to jumpstart it.

233
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,468
Right. Because everything
with an electronic circuit is fried.

234
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,244
Everything with an electronic circuit...

235
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,829
My old bike?

236
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,291
She's a beaut.
Good old-fashioned combustion engine.

237
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,294
So we can generate electricity
without an electronic starter.

238
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,504
- Oh, yeah.
- That is smart.

239
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,342
SCPD is happy
to have Zytle off the streets.

240
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,761
Or, more appropriately, off the docks.

241
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,763
- Great. So, mission accomplished.
- Yeah.

242
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,908
- What's next for my favorite power couple?
- Power couple?

243
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:45,932
Yeah.

244
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,328
I thought that you and Oliver...
You guys aren't hooking up again?

245
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,687
Oh, no. No. God, no.
Why would you even think that?

246
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,298
Well, because every time I come by

247
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,834
you guys are in the middle of
exchanging longing looks for each other.

248
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,109
No, we're not.

249
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,755
- Oh, Felicity.
- We look nothing like that. I don't know...

250
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,459
"I wish I didn't
break up with him. Aww..."

251
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,530
What? What?

252
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,343
- "You know, we were so happy together..."
- Were?

253
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,118
- Yeah.
- Past tense. Yes.

254
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,972
Look, I know that he hurt you by
not telling you about his son, but...

255
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,475
Look, it's not just about William.
It's about what William represents.

256
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,042
Oliver having sex with another woman.

257
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,003
No, but thank you for that visual.

258
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,007
William is symptomatic of a larger problem
between Oliver and I.

259
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,217
That being?

260
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,135
Oliver doesn't trust me.

261
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,724
Right, your man who has put his life
in your hands a couple thousand times.

262
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,495
Trusting me as Overwatch is one thing,

263
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,354
but we're talking about his son,
Curtis, his child.

264
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:36,066
Oliver doesn't trust me enough
to share important information

265
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,485
and crucial information with me.

266
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,361
What's the point
of being in a relationship at all?

267
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm not gonna say that
Oliver Queen plays great with others.

268
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,409
But?

269
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,256
But he can still
change that about himself.

270
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,237
You know what he can't change?

271
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,749
What?

272
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,334
That way he looks at you.

273
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,338
You both owe it
to each other to see, Felicity.

274
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,882
- Tonight.
- Tonight? No. Why tonight?

275
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,260
- Well...
- Don't say...

276
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,594
Curtis.

277
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,430
Next time...

278
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,891
Pick up your own Chinese food.

279
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,577
Um, you know, I just thought
we'd all be hungry

280
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,937
- from the crime-fighting.
- Yeah.

281
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,397
Oh!

282
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,691
Oh, man! I...

283
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,019
You know, I just remembered.

284
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,404
I have a date night with Paul, my husband.

285
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,948
I have a date with my husband,
so I have to go to that.

286
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,410
You guys enjoy that though.
You enjoy that.

287
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,124
Also, there is
wine in the garage, so... Bye.

288
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,835
What?

289
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,087
I'll get the wine.

290
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,593
Okay, gentlemen. Eyes are up.

291
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,262
Gotta say, this team is never boring.

292
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,452
Didn't think I'd be doing this
when I woke up this morning.

293
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,520
Oliver and Felicity might suffocate.
How can you be so glib?

294
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,771
You've met me, right?

295
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:00,108
And how come your toy balls
can't float down here and do this for us?

296
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,944
For the thousandth time, Rene,
they're called T-Spheres.

297
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,114
But if you want,
call them by their proper name.

298
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,824
You named them?

299
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,159
Kodo and Podo.

300
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,662
You know Dar's thieving little ferrets
on The Beastmaster.

301
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,997
Let's just say, uh...

302
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,169
A young Marc Singer was quite helpful
in me discovering my homosexuality.

303
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,169
And my heterosexuality.

304
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,838
You're on an open channel, by the way.

305
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,006
Open line...

306
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,777
Well, look, I can't get my T-Spheres
because they are in the bunker

307
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,470
and, therefore, fried. So, whatever.

308
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,517
I swear those two are going to make
the cutest couple one day.

309
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,312
John?

310
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,689
- John?
- Yeah.

311
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,194
Anything in particular you're looking for
with that 1,000-yard stare?

312
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,740
It's that obvious, huh?

313
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,744
Rene wasn't the only one who could
clock tension between you and the missus,

314
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,995
if that's what you mean.

315
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:55,914
Right.

316
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,418
Let me guess.

317
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,338
You confronted Lyla

318
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,675
about the A.R.G.U.S. black site
and it didn't go too good.

319
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,676
Something like that.

320
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:09,845
You wanna talk about it?

321
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,054
Not really.

322
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,931
Okay.

323
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,891
Well, if you did...

324
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,019
I'd tell you about Vinnie and me.

325
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,104
Vinnie?

326
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,691
My undercover partner.

327
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,735
On and off the job.

328
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,533
Working UC, we had to keep
certain things from each other.

329
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,787
And we didn't do it because we wanted to.

330
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,915
We did it because we had to.

331
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,628
Okay.

332
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,631
It took some horse-trading
but I got everything Curtis asked for.

333
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,592
- Great.
- What's the status here?

334
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,564
He and Rene are getting a lay of the land.

335
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,888
Kodo and Podo. Any updates?

336
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,265
No good ones.
The EMP fried the hydraulics system.

337
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,552
We have to cut through the magnetic seal
in order to reach the manual override.

338
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,771
- We'll need the acetylene torch.
- And the wideband active field probe.

339
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,939
Without my T-Spheres,

340
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,084
there's no telling
what's on the other side of this thing

341
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,109
after the EMP blast.

342
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,492
- Is it working?
- Give it a second.

343
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,976
Thanks again, for trying things my way.

344
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,462
A first time for everything.

345
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,843
Regarding Helix...

346
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,971
You know why I didn't back your play

347
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,935
and you know, or you should, that it had
nothing to do with a lack of trust.

348
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,519
If you're going to start saying,

349
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,482
yet again, that it's because
you don't want me to be like you,

350
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,108
you can hold your breath.

351
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,527
Particularly since
we are running out of oxygen.

352
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,947
Cayden James is a criminal.

353
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,949
Cayden James is a hacker.

354
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,327
As in, so much less worse than the Bratva.

355
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,514
I made the exact same trade-off
you did to get Chase.

356
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,682
I picked the lesser of two evils.

357
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,309
The fact that I didn't want you to do that

358
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,311
- doesn't make me a hypocrite.
- What does it make you, then?

359
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:09,297
It makes me someone
who doesn't want you to be like me.

360
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,841
Yeah.

361
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,514
Bam! That's what I'm talking about.

362
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,689
- You okay?
- Yeah, depending on what that sound is.

363
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,732
That's not good.

364
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,353
One of the pipes is damaged.

365
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,903
I just hope it's not the highly toxic
and flammable gas pipe...

366
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,575
So much for doing things my way.

367
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,668
Careful. Don't breathe.
Well, breathe but don't inhale.

368
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,382
- Done.
- You okay?

369
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,843
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm a little...

370
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,512
A little light-headed.

371
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,056
Hold on.

372
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,624
How much more duct tape do we have?

373
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,233
That's the last of it.

374
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,361
Um, we have the epoxy spray
that Cisco gave us to fix our suits.

375
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,715
If it's upstairs,
then that's definitely flooded by now.

376
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,865
How much time do we have?

377
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,075
Twenty minutes. Max. Before we asphyxiate.

378
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,284
Good times, right?

379
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,370
Oliver, we've already gone over that.

380
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,699
It's just full of dead ends,

381
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,249
which is an unfortunate
but accurate choice of words.

382
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,752
- Wait a second.
- Yeah, we can wait.

383
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,438
We only have 20 minutes, but we can wait.

384
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,214
There's a steam tunnel underneath
this part of the bunker.

385
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,032
Do we have anything to pry this open?

386
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,283
I don't know. It doesn't look pry-able.

387
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,059
Felicity, this is it.

388
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,979
Okay. This could be the fumes talking
but I think I have a slightly insane idea.

389
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,509
How insane is "slightly insane"?

390
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,958
Well, that depends on how you feel

391
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,943
about setting off an explosive arrow
in a room full of flammable gas?

392
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,281
Careful, Rene.

393
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,949
That seal is pure titanium.

394
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,661
It has a melting point of between 1,600
and 1,700 degrees Celsius.

395
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,289
Just let me do my thing, hoss.

396
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,509
That's weird.

397
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,971
No, no, no, Rene, stop!

398
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,145
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow!

399
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,915
I'm gonna need you
to stop making that noise.

400
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,274
I'm sorry my agonizing pain
is bothering you.

401
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,397
I mean, thank you very much
for helping me with this.

402
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,031
These are
just second degree burns, Curtis.

403
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,867
You should be just fine
in a couple of weeks.

404
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,512
Do we know what caused the explosion?

405
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,306
High levels of methane. Am I the only one
that thinks this is Prometheus?

406
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,500
No. But we need to find a way of saving
our friends without blowing them up.

407
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,794
- What about acid?
- No.

408
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,082
- No, I don't think that would...
- Wait, wait, wait.

409
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,965
You said the hatch was titanium, right?

410
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,299
Yeah.

411
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,844
Hydrochloric acid
will turn it into Swiss cheese.

412
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,322
I used to work undercover
with a gang of safe crackers.

413
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,681
That's good. Let's get cooking.

414
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,566
Careful!

415
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,016
If the powder is one gram under,
the grating won't blow.

416
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,273
What if it's one gram over?

417
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,041
Well, it'll increase the breaching radius,

418
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,174
igniting the gas,
filling this entire place with fire...

419
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,238
It'll kill us both,
is what you're gonna say, right?

420
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,743
Yeah.

421
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,537
No pressure. Careful.

422
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,705
Yup.

423
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,540
- Wait.
- What?

424
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,001
My math is probably right,
but what if it's wrong?

425
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,669
Are you still Felicity Smoak?

426
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:35,878
Yeah.

427
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,380
Your math is always right.

428
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,840
Right.

429
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,261
Okay, um, the arrow needs to go in
at exactly a 45-degree angle.

430
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,721
Okay.

431
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,598
By exactly, do you mean exactly?

432
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,326
Well, one centimeter off
and the blast will force the grate off,

433
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,602
igniting the gas and...

434
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,438
Please don't miss.

435
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,613
You didn't miss.

436
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,455
Looks like about a two-story drop.

437
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,748
Drop?

438
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,124
I'll get the climbing gear.

439
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,982
Remind me again, why I thought
this was gonna be a fun idea?

440
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,090
I don't know.

441
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,843
Hop down. Hop down. Hop down. Excuse me.

442
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,094
Ow...

443
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,514
Right. Okay, so...

444
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,849
- This is just a chin-up.
- Okay.

445
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,139
Everybody knows a chin-up.

446
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,309
- Well...
- All right?

447
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,522
It's a chin-up with a flourish at the end.

448
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,610
Yeah.

449
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:41,986
I can't do a chin-up.

450
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,031
- Come here.
- Okay. Um...

451
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,368
I don't flourish well.

452
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,620
- I believe in you. Ready?
- Oh. Whoa.

453
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,331
Oh, my God. Hey! I'm chinning and upping.

454
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,208
- Okay. Kind of.
- Whoo!

455
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
- Ow.
- Okay.

456
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:57,669
- Yeah.
- All right.

457
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,997
- Okay. Mmm-hmm.
- You ready?

458
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,880
- One... Two, three.
- Yeah.

459
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,632
- Go!
- No, no, no.

460
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,610
- Help. Help. It's too high.
- Yep. All right. I got you.

461
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,220
- Good. Higher than it was before.
- I got you.

462
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:11,975
Um...

463
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,810
Yeah. I kind of did it.

464
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,018
- I think.
- Sure.

465
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,266
There was the chin-up part,
I think we could work on.

466
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
You did a half of one.

467
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,292
Half. I'll take the half.
It's exhilarating.

468
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,651
I don't think that's really my...

469
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,321
In fairness,
you've had a little bit to drink.

470
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,489
Yeah...

471
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,158
I've had a lot to drink.

472
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,054
You should just... Thank you.

473
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,696
What happened? Did the acid work?

474
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,297
Yeah. It's just, it's gonna take
10 seasons of The Bachelor

475
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,382
before it melts those hinges down.

476
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,959
What? I don't judge your DVR.

477
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,654
Okay, how much time do they have left?

478
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:30,803
Ten minutes, give or take.

479
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,694
Yeah. Somebody better order up a miracle.

480
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,891
I don't know if this counts
but it could help.

481
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,846
Where the hell did you get this?

482
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,236
A.R.G.U.S. likes to keep tabs
on interesting tech.

483
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,241
You copied my T-Sphere?

484
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,243
No, we improved them.

485
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,287
No. You're both wrong.

486
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,582
Lyla, if you stole this,

487
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,836
what other surprises
can I be expecting from you?

488
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,344
It's okay. Just hang on. Hang on tight.

489
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,429
- Not that tight. Not that tight.
- Sorry.

490
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,306
That's okay.

491
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,684
- Almost there.
- Okay.

492
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,811
I got you. I got you.

493
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,480
- Okay.
- All right.

494
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,357
- Right here.
- Yeah, I know.

495
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,192
Thanks.

496
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,320
Are you okay?

497
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,782
- Hey. We made it. We made it.
- Yeah. I'm fine.

498
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,701
Yeah.

499
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,046
It's another dead end.

500
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,673
Okay, stop using that term.

501
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,926
We bought ourselves some time
away from the gas, at least.

502
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,137
Hey. Oliver?

503
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,056
Oliver?

504
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,809
Oliver? Oliver?

505
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:07,650
Oliver? Oliver? Oliver?

506
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,153
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

507
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,612
You gotta stay awake, okay?

508
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,239
I think I'm losing a lot of blood.

509
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,158
Tell me something I don't know.

510
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,368
I'm so sorry.

511
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,624
Normally I would relish
an Oliver Queen apology,

512
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,473
but this sudden admission
is making me nervous.

513
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,458
You were right. I didn't have your back.

514
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,311
But it wasn't because I didn't want you
to end up like me, Felicity.

515
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,420
It was much more than that.

516
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,965
Okay. Lots of blood loss with
exposure to toxic gas makes you go crazy.

517
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,974
- Now we know that.
- I need you to hear this.

518
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,803
- I will. Later. Right...
- Might not have a later.

519
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,054
Do not talk like that.

520
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,265
I need you to know the truth.

521
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,517
About what?

522
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,312
I didn't have your back.

523
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:51,027
It was not because of you
or a lack of trust, it was because of me.

524
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,362
It was because of me.

525
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,948
I'm not the man you think I am.

526
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,075
I'm not the man you fell in love with.

527
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,703
I put the hood on
to right my father's wrongs.

528
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:06,167
But the basis of it, the foundation of it

529
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:11,047
and what you did and what Digg did
and what the team did in my name...

530
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,091
It was all based on a lie.

531
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,468
What are you talking about?

532
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,554
Chase, he showed me
when he held me hostage,

533
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,183
that I didn't do what I did to be a hero.

534
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,810
I did what I did...

535
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:30,900
Because there was a part of me,
a bigger part than I would like to admit.

536
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,487
I enjoyed it.

537
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,406
I enjoyed killing.

538
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,577
It's not about not trusting you.

539
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,788
I will always trust you.

540
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,626
I don't trust myself.

541
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:49,919
Oliver?

542
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,755
Oliver, don't... Oliver?

543
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,799
Oliver. Hey.

544
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,968
Hey! Oliver, come back!

545
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,053
Come back. Oliver!

546
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,346
Come back.

547
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:11,065
Just promise me you're not gonna
tell anyone that we had bunker sex.

548
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,192
And by anyone, I mean Curtis.

549
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,987
Because he'd never look at me the same.

550
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,613
Are you sure?

551
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,533
Because he had me pick up Chinese food
and then he suggested wine.

552
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,786
I'm pretty sure
that he was rooting for exactly this.

553
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,414
So...

554
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,126
Maybe he saw something that we didn't see.

555
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,510
I think Curtis watches
too many rom-come with Paul.

556
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,433
You okay?

557
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,393
Yeah. I'm fine.

558
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,478
It's just...

559
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,316
Talk to me. What's going on?

560
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,236
This was nice. You know?
It was really nice. It just...

561
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,657
It doesn't change things between us.

562
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:02,950
We still have our problems.

563
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,039
It's because we never talked
about our problems.

564
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,430
We never talked about William.

565
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:10,499
Even if there was no William,
there still wouldn't be an "us."

566
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,670
Because you don't trust me.

567
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,507
I was hoping that you'd change.

568
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,638
But you don't trust anyone.

569
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,390
And I don't know why.

570
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,519
You know, maybe if I knew why
things would be different.

571
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,607
I don't even think you know why.

572
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,652
I love you.

573
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,990
But that is why I can't settle
for anything less than your full trust.

574
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,340
I know I should be mad that
you stole my tech

575
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,343
but the modification designs
you guys put on here are ridiculous.

576
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,791
Hey. How about less geeking out

577
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,890
and more figuring out how to use
that thing to get to Felicity and Oliver?

578
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,557
They ran out of time 10 minutes ago.

579
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:14,855
What is this?

580
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,399
It's an audit

581
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,236
of every black op I've signed off on
as Director of A.R.G.U.S.

582
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,442
Why are you giving me this?

583
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,241
I don't want there to be
any more secrets between us, John.

584
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,053
But there is one thing
I need to know from you.

585
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,077
Name it.

586
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:34,166
No matter what Oliver Queen does,
no matter how morally compromising,

587
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,253
- you stand behind him no matter what.
- Lyla.

588
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,922
Why can't you do that for me?

589
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,822
Well, I guess I never really
thought of it like that.

590
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,180
Well, maybe you should start.

591
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,183
Because I'm not Oliver, Johnnie.

592
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,144
I'm your wife.

593
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,898
And even though I disagree with many
of your choices, I trusted those choices.

594
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,901
I trusted you.

595
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,113
I think I deserve the same consideration.

596
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,615
I figured it out!

597
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,052
Oh, sorry. Were you guys
in the middle of something?

598
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,929
It looks like you were
probably in the middle of something.

599
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,081
But I did figure it out.
So, let's chop, chop, chop.

600
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,666
It's okay, Curtis.

601
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,293
We're fine.

602
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,379
Let's go get Oliver
and Felicity out of there.

603
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,218
Oliver?

604
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,387
Oliver? Damn it. Wake up.

605
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:29,638
- Hey!
- Hey.

606
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,617
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God. You're okay.

607
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,351
I think the wound re-clotted.

608
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,231
Careful. Hey.

609
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,695
Felicity, I don't...

610
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,281
I don't know
that I can get us out of here.

611
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,610
Well, it'll give us some time
to talk about something.

612
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,830
Like this crazy idea
that you enjoy killing.

613
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,503
It's why you disbanded the team, isn't it?

614
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,671
Yeah.

615
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:06,133
Oliver, you said that I don't know
the kind of man that you are.

616
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,863
I wouldn't have fallen in love with you,
or wanted to marry you

617
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,098
if I didn't know
exactly the kind of man that you are.

618
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:15,976
Chase tortured you for a week.

619
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,022
You're the toughest person I know
but anyone,

620
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,271
anyone would have admitted

621
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,838
to being a tap-dancing flamingo
after what he put you through.

622
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:29,490
Adrian Chase didn't make me a killer.

623
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,700
No. Five years in hell did that.

624
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,409
Five years dealing
with this city's worst did that.

625
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:38,249
You've spent a decade dealing with horrors
that most people don't even realize exist.

626
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,143
And the fact that,
that didn't turn you into a monster

627
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,962
proves exactly the kind of person
that you are.

628
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,507
I don't know what kind of person I am.

629
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,311
- Curtis?
- Not just Curtis.

630
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,521
Are you guys okay?

631
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,731
Oliver is a little hurt.
We could use your help.

632
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,775
About that. We got a new problem.

633
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:08,821
The bunker's generators
have a doomsday scenario fail-safe.

634
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,269
Assuming a catastrophic attack,

635
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,409
they're tamper-proof so no one
can stop them from turning back on.

636
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,244
Wait, why would you want to stop them?

637
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,492
The methane.
The power coming back on will spark it.

638
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:21,083
If we don't get the air-vents
back online first somehow...

639
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:25,462
You guys are sitting
underneath a four-story bomb.

640
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,929
How long do we have
before the generator kicks back on?

641
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,182
And blow you up?
Twelve minutes. But don't worry.

642
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,390
Too late.

643
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,767
We have a plan.

644
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:40,936
Careful.

645
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,605
We gotta be getting close.

646
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,776
Think we're there, D.

647
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:57,703
Talk to me, Curtis.

648
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,932
I'm trying to hack the city grid to
re-route power to the ventilation system.

649
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,268
Can you blow the gas
before the generators come back online?

650
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,372
Well, we'll know if we hear

651
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,303
an earth-shattering ka-boom
beneath our feet.

652
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,300
- Slow down. Slow down.
- We don't have time to slow down.

653
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,612
And we don't have time
for you to bleed to death, either.

654
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,639
It's a good point. It's good. It's...

655
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,975
Oliver! Oh, my God. Oliver?

656
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,311
Oliver? Oliver?

657
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,980
Hey, Curtis!
Oliver's down, we need your help!

658
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:26,649
Oliver.

659
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,817
Hang on. Coming to you.

660
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,138
This looks like
the Death Star interrogation droid.

661
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,997
I loaded it with 20 CC's of adrenaline.

662
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,848
You're gonna have to inject that into...

663
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,918
Whoa.

664
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,698
- I'm okay!
- You're nowhere close.

665
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,998
But we gave you enough adrenaline
to get us out of here.

666
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,844
Good.

667
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,805
Okay. All right.

668
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,139
Okay. Yeah.

669
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,143
Are you really gonna climb down there?

670
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,854
Somebody has to meet them halfway.

671
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,360
Nice jump, Digg.

672
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,612
John!

673
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,030
Are you okay?

674
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,032
I'm good.

675
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,784
We are running out of time.

676
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,873
I've almost got
the ventilation systems back up.

677
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,498
Oliver!

678
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,333
Oliver!

679
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,876
- Yeah!
- Hey!

680
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,044
Hey, you guys all right?

681
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,212
No, not really.

682
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,550
John!

683
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,342
You okay?

684
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,821
Stay there. We'll figure something out.

685
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,054
John, we don't have time.

686
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,515
Look, do you have enough cable
to meet us halfway?

687
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:42,808
- Yes.
- That's optimistic.

688
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,393
We only have 30 feet.

689
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,645
It's not helping. Throw him the line.

690
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,735
This is crazy.

691
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,221
You don't hear me arguing, do you?

692
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,739
All right. Hang on, tight.

693
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,972
I always appreciated you
doing the salmon ladder,

694
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,873
but never as much as in this moment.

695
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,003
It's all right. It's all right.

696
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,051
I've got about five feet of slack.

697
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,845
- I can make it.
- Oliver, if you don't...

698
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,430
I will.

699
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,448
You have to let me go.

700
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,802
You have to let me go! You have to go!

701
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,744
Curtis, cut the vents!

702
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,287
- Now he tells me?
- Do it!

703
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:48,957
Sorry, Felicity.

704
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,095
I know you hate it
when I don't listen to you.

705
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,471
Rene, pull us up.

706
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:16,902
Hey, Lyla.

707
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,824
Thanks for letting us come here.

708
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:25,160
See? A. R.G.U.S.
isn't always used for evil.

709
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,662
I know. You're right.

710
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,665
I should have trusted you. I do trust you.

711
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,002
We just work
in morally gray areas, Lyla, and I...

712
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,046
I let that cloud my perspective a bit.

713
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,338
Or a lot.

714
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,674
Or a lot.

715
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:42,344
I'm sorry.

716
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:46,014
I promise, we will get through this.

717
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,691
Hey. Any word on Oliver?

718
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,192
Lyla's checking now.

719
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,212
Gotta say, it's good to see you up
and walking again.

720
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,071
Yeah. Thank Curtis.
He's the miracle worker.

721
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,008
It's just a temporary fix. I have to run
a more comprehensive diagnostics.

722
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,344
You guys are gonna have to explain to me
how all this works one day.

723
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,871
You really don't want him to do that.
Nerd-a-palooza.

724
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,540
Oliver just got out of surgery.

725
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,972
- He's going to be fine.
- Can we see him?

726
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,836
Actually, he asked to see you.

727
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,213
Ooh!

728
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,049
We were all thinking it.

729
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,393
Would it help if I didn't ask for lessons
on a particular piece of equipment?

730
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:36,708
I know you're probably a little upset
about what I said last night still...

731
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,192
I'm not mad.

732
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,904
- You were right.
- So were you.

733
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,699
You know, we never really did talk about
anything and...

734
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:49,912
I walked.

735
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,623
That was wrong.

736
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,250
I'm sorry.

737
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,421
Thank you.

738
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:06,303
I'm not saying never about the talk.

739
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:07,763
I just...

740
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,432
Maybe not quite yet.

741
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:13,977
I'm not ready yet.

742
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,105
I'm not going anywhere.

743
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:19,942
Okay.

744
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,789
- Hey.
- Hey.

745
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,127
- You're walking.
- I am.

746
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:42,595
More importantly, you're living.
You really gave us a scare back there.

747
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,968
Well, I'd figured you'd be used to seeing
me close to death by now.

748
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,428
Never gonna get used to it. Ever.

749
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,975
But, speaking of being close to death,

750
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,854
I said a few things back there.

751
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,859
I really, really appreciate what you said.

752
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,820
Any of it stick?

753
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:06,780
Hopefully.

754
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:10,617
I'm sorry.

755
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,829
- For what?
- For being a hypocrite.

756
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:17,666
You were right.
I was starting to become like you.

757
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,670
And not in the heroic, you know,
honorable, muscular way.

758
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:26,633
It's just, after I lost Billy,
I was willing to do whatever to get Chase.

759
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,678
It drove me to work with Helix
and I was willing to break any rule,

760
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,681
do anything to get payback and,

761
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,809
you know, what I'm trying to say is

762
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,562
I think I got the tiniest taste
of what you've been through.

763
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,858
Tiniest, and I get it now.

764
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:52,159
I understand
why you lied to me about William.

765
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:53,910
Why you had to.

766
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,413
I get it.

767
00:40:57,414 --> 00:41:01,752
And for the extent that I judged you
and I did judge you, I am sorry.

768
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,175
You know, you said you didn't know
what kind of person you are.

769
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,766
I think you should figure that out.

770
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:39,498
William.

771
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,166
My name is Matthew.

772
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,737
But it used to be William, right?

773
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,629
Before you and your mom left Central City?

774
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,589
You know my mom?

775
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:49,800
Actually, I knew your father.

776
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,844
And he knew mine.

777
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:26,628
