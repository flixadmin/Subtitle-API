1
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,064
Oracle, it's Huntress. Come in.

2
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,708
<i>Huntress,
the comms are barely functional.</i>

3
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,732
Barbara, can you hear me?

4
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:24,733
<i>I need more time.</i>

5
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,129
The wave's coming too quickly.
You're gonna have to evac right now.

6
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,381
<i>I'm sending Alfred relevant data</i>

7
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,405
<i>before the wave hits.</i>

8
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:33,118
Oracle? Oracle, please answer me.

9
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,328
<i>Sending all relevant data...</i>

10
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,183
We've only located four

11
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,853
of the seven Paragons
needed to save the multi-verse.

12
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:02,021
We could find the last three if...

13
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:05,900
It's repairing a Paragon detector, okay?
It's complex stuff.

14
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:08,903
Did someone call for backup?

15
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:10,787
- Iris.
- Cisco, thank goodness.

16
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,699
I need another genius intellect, stat.

17
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:14,200
That's why I'm here.

18
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:17,495
And that is a Super doppelganger,
which is super weird.

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,331
Holy All-Star Squadron.

20
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,373
Hi. Hi, how are you?

21
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:22,834
Ralph Dibny. Elongated Man.

22
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,335
Ready to help kick butt.

23
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,212
Ignore him. It's his first crossover.

24
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:27,922
Listen, the anti-matter wave

25
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:29,886
is still ripping its way
across the multi-verse.

26
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,527
We have to get everyone we can
to safety.

27
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,136
Calculations still show that Earth-1

28
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,697
will be the last place
for the wave to hit.

29
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,323
I just heard from
Alex and Brainy on Earth-1.

30
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,725
Everyone we saved from Earth-38
is still accounted for.

31
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,579
Then we should bring as many people
to Earth-1 as we can in the time being.

32
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:42,788
Let's get a rescue team together,

33
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,372
save who we can across the multi-verse.

34
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,107
I can use my psychic abilities

35
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,626
to stay in connection
with the <i>Waverider.</i>

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,568
And I'll go as well.

37
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,403
Parallel Earth Rory still has Jonathan,

38
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,781
so I'll run comms and keep
everyone updated.

39
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,468
- Supergirl?
- I'll stay here.

40
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,212
We have to find a way
to get our world back.

41
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,330
Wait. I think we did it.

42
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:01,705
I think we fixed it.

43
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:08,129
Guys, we already know all this.

44
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,632
It's buffering.
So, maybe a little patience.

45
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,053
Huh, why am I not surprised?

46
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,263
That's new.

47
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,725
Uh, who the hell is that guy?

48
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:25,104
Dr. Ryan Choi, physics professor
at Ivy Town University on our Earth.

49
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,628
Well, I guess we know our next stop.

50
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,565
Ray? Ralph?

51
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,528
Ivy Town, it's my old stomping grounds.
Let's go.

52
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,403
With all the Paragons identified,

53
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:36,241
our next priority is determining
how to stop the anti-matter wave.

54
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,010
Sorry to interrupt,

55
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,285
but Mr. Diggle has arrived.

56
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,663
How could you let
this happen, Sara?

57
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,747
You of all people!

58
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,871
- It's complicated.
- It's not complicated.

59
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,585
I wasn't there when he needed me.

60
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,796
Digg, we are working on
bringing him back,

61
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,756
the same way
that he brought me back. Remember?

62
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,484
You're talking about
a trip to Purgatory?

63
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,424
Yes.

64
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,469
Fine, count me in.

65
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:58,721
And there's...
There's something else.

66
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,307
Digg, it's Lyla. She's...

67
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:02,934
She's gone missing.

68
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,271
- What?
- Nobody saw her leave.

69
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,314
She was there one minute
and gone the next.

70
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:12,277
Well, she has the ability
to teleport. So...

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,613
So there are now infinite possibilities
for Lyla's location.

72
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,575
You... Listen to me.

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,785
I am not losing Oliver...

74
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:22,453
and Lyla.

75
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,791
So cut the crap and tell me
how the hell do I find my wife.

76
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,919
You heard him. Where is she?

77
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,464
Harbinger could very well be
with my adversary.

78
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,176
The Anti-Monitor.

79
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:48,021
"The Anti-Monitor."
Is that set in stone,

80
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,689
or can we workshop that a little bit?

81
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,983
This is why I have been
preparing all of you.

82
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,319
Testing and pushing you to your limits.

83
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,697
I needed your courage,
your honor, your strength of will...

84
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,908
even the truth of your convictions.

85
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,118
Everything that makes you
the greatest heroes

86
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,828
on this Earth or any other,

87
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,539
because that's what it will take
to defeat our opponent.

88
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,541
And what exactly does this guy want?

89
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,878
To eliminate the multi-verse
and replace it with another universe.

90
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,839
One that he can control,
just like every other megalomaniac.

91
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:17,717
I should have foreseen
my connection with Harbinger

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,344
could be perverted to his ends.

93
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,428
"Should have"?

94
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:22,680
Just tell us how to get her back.

95
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,058
I want to find her
just as much as the rest of you.

96
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,810
But I cannot rewrite
what has already been written.

97
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:30,188
I can only attempt to save what remains.

98
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,805
You know what to do
to get Oliver's soul back.

99
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,373
I'll watch over his body.

100
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,875
And I promise you, I will keep you
updated on Harbinger.

101
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,959
Copy that.

102
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,727
Cisco, maybe you should
call Kamilla back?

103
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,632
No, no, no. That wasn't a phone call.

104
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,842
I'm triangulating
anti-matter wave particles

105
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:01,803
- on the Earths that are left.
- Why?

106
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:04,263
I'm trying to locate
the source of the wave.

107
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,431
And according to this,

108
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,851
it's hidden in a subterranean region
right in our own backyard.

109
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,479
Meet me in the cargo bay in five.

110
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,085
Cisco Ramon.

111
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:20,612
Didn't I just leave you?

112
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,700
You are not a Paragon,
but you do have a purpose.

113
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,995
Vibe must live again.

114
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,663
No.

115
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,083
No, my powers are gone.

116
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,668
And there's a reason for that.

117
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,629
You must answer the call
whether you wish to or not.

118
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,631
Okay. Maybe you didn't hear me

119
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:41,134
under those voluminous
muttonchops of yours...

120
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,262
Now, go.

121
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,639
Serve your higher purpose.

122
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,275
Are you still sure you want me to go?

123
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,401
Yeah.

124
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:01,612
Go find Ryan Choi.

125
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,281
And hurry back.

126
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:21,132
- Where did Barry race off to?
- Perimeter search.

127
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,843
Make sure this isn't a trap
set up by the Anti-Monitor.

128
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,428
Ugh, that name makes me want to barf.

129
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,929
Nice to have you back, Vibe.

130
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,017
- Let's just get to Nash's work site.
- Right this way.

131
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,645
Huh, that's new.

132
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,439
We gotta get in there.

133
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,233
Who's there?

134
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,862
Nash? Is that you?

135
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:48,659
I am no longer Nash. I am... Pariah.

136
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,078
And I'm here to bear witness.

137
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,122
- To what?
- Tragedy.

138
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,170
Uh-huh.

139
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,338
New name.

140
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,256
New suit.

141
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,801
Guess no one's consulting me
anymore, huh?

142
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,719
Wait, what exactly happened?

143
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:09,847
I searched these tunnels
as Nash for Mar Novu.

144
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,599
To kill him...

145
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,436
expose him as a false god, and now,
I'm being controlled by another god.

146
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,189
And that's the...
Anti-Monitor?

147
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,941
He laid a perfect trail
for me to follow,

148
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,652
but all along he was manipulating me

149
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,655
so that he could gain a foothold
in this universe.

150
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:26,989
Why didn't you resist him?

151
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,450
His will was too strong,
and now I am forced...

152
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,371
to bear witness
as he destroys world after world.

153
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,624
That's why we're gonna stop him.
Now, can you open that door?

154
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:38,917
I cannot.

155
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,963
My memories as Nash
are somehow lost to me

156
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,089
as Pariah, but you can.

157
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,925
- By vibing those memories?
- Yes.

158
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,112
What did you see?

159
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,697
The way in.

160
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,118
You think the book can bring back
the destroyed Earths?

161
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,957
- Oh, too good.
- I don't have time for this.

162
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,547
Tell us how to use the book
or lose an arm, your choice.

163
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,841
Did the strong-arm tactics work
in Gotham City?

164
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:32,638
The book channels ancient
and endless power.

165
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,808
It takes immense willpower
and focus to make it work.

166
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,644
- What did you focus on?
- His hatred.

167
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,021
For Superman.

168
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,189
Got it in one.

169
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,709
But that was easy
for the book to provide.

170
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,627
You try to use it on the scale
that you're talking about,

171
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,403
and it could drive you mad.

172
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,197
Like Deegan.

173
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,331
Kara, there's no telling
what kind of ripple effect

174
00:08:58,414 --> 00:08:59,414
this could have.

175
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,250
I'm supposed to be
the Paragon of Hope, right?

176
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,002
Maybe this is my role,

177
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,547
to bring back my Earth,
and Argo, and all the others.

178
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:08,451
I have to find a way to fix this.

179
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:13,429
See you soon.

180
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:22,480
So why did we take a detour
to another parallel Earth?

181
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,650
With so many Earths already gone,
the pillars of magic are crumbling,

182
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,109
leaving me the worse for wear.

183
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,736
So, I can't get us into Purgatory.

184
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,864
But don't worry, squire.
Luckily, I know a guy.

185
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,929
Oh, you're gonna love her.
She's pretty much up for everything.

186
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,247
Always a pleasure to see you, Luci.

187
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,749
It's time.

188
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,668
Excuse me, ladies.

189
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,687
Seems like you're not the only ones
who want a piece of me.

190
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,129
I'll see you later.

191
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,422
Johnny!

192
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:53,052
Ah, I'd like to say it's a pleasure
to see you on my Earth,

193
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,012
outside my club, but it's not.

194
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:57,807
Hello.

195
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,810
Don't believe we've met.
Lucifer Morningstar.

196
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,020
"Lucifer Morningstar," as in...

197
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,563
The Devil. Yes, exactly.

198
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,192
So tell me, what is it you desire?

199
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,653
I...

200
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,697
I, um...

201
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,450
I desire to get my father back.

202
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:17,952
Oh.

203
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,621
Daddy issues. Why didn't you say so?

204
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,874
Look, I don't know if you have
an Oliver Queen on your world,

205
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,169
but ours has shuffled off
this mortal coil.

206
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,755
A soul retrieval, blah, blah, blah.

207
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,466
The worlds are ending.
It's all very biblical, John.

208
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:34,342
Okay.

209
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,555
Okay, I'm only doing this
'cause I owe you for Maze.

210
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,639
Yeah, you do.

211
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,324
You remind me of my brother, by the way.

212
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,227
Tall, dark, annoyed by me.

213
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,812
You gonna help us or not?

214
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,895
Oh... Flirt.

215
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,649
The Devil always sees through on a deal.

216
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,109
Take this card.

217
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,945
You'll have a limited time
once inside Purgatory,

218
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,697
and once the picture completely fades...

219
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,491
Our souls will be decimated,
blah, blah, blah.

220
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,328
And trapped in eternity forever,
so I don't recommend it.

221
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,247
Consider us even, John Constantine.

222
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,376
- "Constantine."
- Is it? I don't care.

223
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,338
Always a pleasure doing
business with mortals.

224
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,218
He forgot to tell us what to do.

225
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,302
Did he now?

226
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,273
Huh.

227
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:30,775
Welcome to Purgatory.

228
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,194
Looks a lot like Lian Yu.

229
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,237
Which is Mandarin for "purgatory."

230
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,864
Lovely little coincidence, eh?

231
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,284
Any idea why Dad's soul
would choose to come here?

232
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,968
Souls choose their prisons.

233
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,638
This place must be
what Oliver thinks about

234
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,164
when being trapped for all eternity.

235
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,393
It's a funny thing, too, considering
his memories are probably missing.

236
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,497
What are you talking about?

237
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,521
The second that
Oliver's soul landed here,

238
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,922
his memories would've been...

239
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,382
How can I put it?

240
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,133
Squeegeed.

241
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,569
So, we'll have to make him remember us.

242
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,180
Bollocks. We'll have to get
a move on as well.

243
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,224
This card is already beginning to fade.

244
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,309
When you work with the Devil,

245
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:06,993
you never know quite
what you're getting.

246
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,687
No pressure there, right?

247
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,689
Perimeter's clear.

248
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,902
There's no sign of any
quantum tower on Earth-1.

249
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,932
What are you doin' here, Pariah?

250
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,155
Behind this wall, his domain.

251
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,991
What Mr. Green Jeans is trying to say

252
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,118
is once we get inside,

253
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,161
we can actually stop
the anti-matter wave

254
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,204
right at the source.

255
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:26,215
All right. Let's do it.

256
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,239
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

257
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,183
Whoa.

258
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,229
This place has some crazy
vibrational frequency

259
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,313
surging through it.

260
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:54,191
This place is the nexus
between the anti-matter universe

261
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,275
and your own.

262
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,028
Behold, anti-matter cannon.

263
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,655
This is the source of the wave.

264
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,366
Guys, I think this blur is alive.

265
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,287
- I'll check it out.
- No!

266
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,259
- Barry!
- What happened?

267
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,650
It's a forcefield.
I couldn't get through.

268
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,675
It's the Flash.

269
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,801
From Earth-90.

270
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,720
He's trapped on that treadmill.

271
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,187
That's Barry Allen from Earth-90?

272
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,605
How did he get there?

273
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,023
The Monitor sent him away.

274
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,359
You will not do to this Earth
what you did to mine.

275
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,923
He wound up in a netherverse
where the Anti-Monitor found him,

276
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:45,701
corralled his speed, used it
to build his anti-matter cannon.

277
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,535
Test-fired it...

278
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,792
destroying Earth-2.

279
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,836
Harry's gone?

280
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,506
- Jesse...
- Pariah, how do we stop the cannon?

281
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,550
The forcefield that contains this
is anti-matter-based.

282
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:06,180
As such, anything made
of positive matter cannot penetrate it.

283
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,224
We have to get the Flash
off that treadmill.

284
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,061
The Monitor said, "Vibe had to live."

285
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,564
That he had a purpose. Maybe this is it.

286
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,863
Here goes nothing.

287
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,377
Thank you for the reprieve...

288
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,046
but you gotta put me back on it.

289
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,966
Guys.

290
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:46,470
The Anti-Monitor designed
that treadmill with a fail-safe,

291
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,847
so that if I ever got off of it,
it would erupt,

292
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,725
destroying all remaining Earths at once.

293
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,019
We only have a few minutes.

294
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,146
Pariah, how... Pariah?

295
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,857
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

296
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,571
Amanda, please.

297
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,282
I know the red skies are freaky, honey,

298
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,952
but I'm sure it's just atmospheric...

299
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,246
Dr. Ryan Choi?

300
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,664
...disturbance.

301
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,290
Babe, I gotta go.

302
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,793
Wow, is that really you?

303
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,589
Dr. Ray Palmer.

304
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,507
O-M-gosh.

305
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,093
I'm Ryan Choi.
It's so wonderful to meet you.

306
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,929
Your second paper
on subatomic density manipulation

307
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:31,265
was the foundation for my work
on miniaturization.

308
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,058
Wow. Thank you. You know...

309
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:35,120
Okay. Dr. Choi, we need you
to come with us right now.

310
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,955
Look, you've seen
the red skies outside?

311
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,647
The world is ending.

312
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,401
Dr. Palmer,
who are these people?

313
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,488
We are superheroes
and, Ryan, we need your help.

314
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,867
Sure, Dr. Palmer.
Good one.

315
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,511
Next, you're gonna tell me
I've been nominated

316
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,179
for the Breakthrough Prize
in Fundamental Physics?

317
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,472
Okay, we don't have time for this.

318
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,956
Seeing is believing, right?

319
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,714
- Tissue?
- You're... Elongated Man?

320
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:08,719
Are you superheroes, too?

321
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,179
I know this sounds cuckoo, pal,

322
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,264
but you're what's called a Paragon,

323
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,975
which is a fancy word for saying
we need your help

324
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:16,101
to save the universe.

325
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,937
Dr. Choi.

326
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:25,110
If the world's ending,
I need to go home.

327
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,863
Please, Ryan, we really need your help.

328
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,658
No, you don't. I'm no hero.

329
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,117
I'm a husband.

330
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,245
And if this is the end,
I have to be with my wife and kid.

331
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:36,997
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,096
Another Earth is gone.

333
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,224
There's only seven left
in the multi-verse.

334
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,101
It's ironic.

335
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,145
I'm watching the biggest
event in history,

336
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,731
the destruction of every Earth,

337
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,150
and no one will ever read the story.

338
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,987
These Earths are not
the only worlds destroyed.

339
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,906
My world died.

340
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,324
My family.

341
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,787
What were they like?

342
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,455
Hmm.

343
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,043
So full of life.

344
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,506
They were everything to me.

345
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,052
If only I cared as much for them...

346
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,139
as I did my work.

347
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,482
I now understand why
you're such a good reporter, Ms. Lane.

348
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,154
Clark?

349
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,199
Couldn't save them.

350
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,808
You wanna take a minute?
Looks like you could use a breather.

351
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,623
When I put this on, this crest,

352
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,084
I made a promise.

353
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,671
To keep fighting, no matter what.

354
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,924
Hey, why did you add black to it?

355
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,636
Because, Lois,

356
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,722
even in the darkest times,

357
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,932
hope cuts through.

358
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,686
Hope is the light that lifts us
out of darkness.

359
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,188
I must go back.

360
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,903
He never quits, no matter
what Earth he's from, huh?

361
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,555
Now you're just talking to yourself.

362
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,870
It's getting worse.

363
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,600
- Put me back on that treadmill.
- No. All right, we'll find another way.

364
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,592
- Where am I?
- Who are you?

365
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,636
Send me back to Freeland! Now!

366
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,597
Calm down, Electric Guy.

367
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,474
The name is Black Lightning.

368
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,565
Enough!

369
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,194
I did not bring you here,
Jefferson, to fight.

370
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,279
I brought you here to save lives.

371
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,739
Who the hell are you people?

372
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:18,242
I am Pariah. This is Jefferson Pierce.

373
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:22,329
On his Earth, an educator,
a father, and a hero.

374
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,457
- What do you mean, my Earth?
- There are multiple Earths, Jefferson.

375
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,959
Many Earths, like this one.

376
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,417
Your Earth...

377
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,299
has just been destroyed
by a wave of anti-matter.

378
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,469
So... So, Lynn, my girls?

379
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,137
They're gone.

380
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,559
I transported you here
to help us save humanity.

381
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,437
You should have saved my family, not me!

382
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,147
- Not me!
- Jefferson!

383
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,858
I'm so sorry.

384
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,653
Right now we need your help
to stop this anti-matter wave.

385
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,406
I can't imagine how you're feeling.

386
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,366
But I do know how it feels
to lose your family.

387
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,203
What would they
want you to do right now?

388
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,374
Please. All worlds could die.

389
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,923
What do you need from me?

390
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,509
That machine behind you
is the source of the anti-matter wave.

391
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:18,886
We have to disable it,

392
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,012
but we can't get near it.

393
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,930
Can you contain that much energy?

394
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,187
Let's find out.

395
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,205
Don't. You open that book
and you do not know what will happen.

396
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,208
To you, to all of the Earths
you're trying to save.

397
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,794
I have to, Kate.
Those people, they need help.

398
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,172
And we are doing our best
to help who we can.

399
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,549
- That is not the answer.
- Then what am I supposed to do?

400
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,178
Just be okay with
all those people dying? Like Bruce?

401
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,306
Believe that if life's supposed to end,
just let it?

402
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,809
No, of course not. But if you open
that book, it will destroy you.

403
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,853
I have to do this.

404
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,064
Then I have to stop you.

405
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,900
You won't be able to.

406
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:19,738
You'd be surprised.

407
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,409
I wish things were different...

408
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:26,745
Kara.

409
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,206
I wish I was hopeful, like you.

410
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:33,752
But one thing I do know
is if you take a chance on that book,

411
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,714
and it doesn't work,
and something happens to you,

412
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,467
we're all doomed.

413
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,233
Tick-tock, people.

414
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,419
Black Lightning is gonna kill himself
if we don't solve this soon.

415
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,987
And we need more time.

416
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,867
Every second that we waste here,
another Earth dies.

417
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,661
And that wave gets closer to my wife.

418
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,371
I was married once, too.

419
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,750
Tina always said that keeping me running
was her purpose in life.

420
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,420
So, as someone who's been running
for 30 years,

421
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,341
let me tell you, sometimes,
in order to find your purpose as a hero,

422
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,427
you gotta take a couple steps back.

423
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,015
Reverse the way you see the situation,
and see a bigger picture.

424
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,059
That's it.

425
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,187
I know how to stop the cannon.

426
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,552
This is what the Monitor meant
that day in the time vault.

427
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,225
This is what I've been running towards
all these years.

428
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,029
It's time for Flash to vanish in Crisis.

429
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,748
Reversing the treadmill's
directional velocity

430
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:56,626
could make the anti-matter wave recede
and funnel back into the speed cannon.

431
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,712
Destroying the machine and the wave.

432
00:22:58,795 --> 00:22:59,963
Ending this once and for all.

433
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,049
Freeing me from
the Anti-Monitor's control.

434
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,429
Where is the future? Right here.

435
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,432
And whose life is this? Mine.

436
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,520
What are you gonna do with it?
Live it. By any means necessary.

437
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,067
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna find him.

438
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,778
You don't know that.
Dad's soul could be lost forever.

439
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,881
Family is everything to Oliver.
He'll come back to us.

440
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,832
Oliver, wait, man.
Listen to me. I see you, man.

441
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,584
And I'm so sorry that I wasn't there

442
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,627
to have your back during Crisis,
but I'm here now.

443
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,464
And I need you to come back to us.
You're my brother.

444
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,425
I can't lose you, man.

445
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:49,346
I can't lose you.

446
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,898
Hey, John.

447
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,323
- Mia, you came.
- Of course, I did.

448
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,835
They're beautiful.

449
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,839
I didn't get to introduce myself
earlier, Dr. Choi.

450
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,674
I'm Iris West-Allen from Central City.

451
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,384
Are you a superhero, too?

452
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,220
No. I'm just like you.

453
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,974
Look, I know this is a lot to ask,
and you're right

454
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,185
to want to be with your family
when things go bad.

455
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:43,608
What about you? You clearly have someone
in your life you care about.

456
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,111
Don't you want to die holding them
when the world ends?

457
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,696
My husband is not like us.

458
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,574
He goes out there as a superhero
day after day

459
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,243
and faces whatever he has to
to keep his city safe.

460
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,580
That's really brave, Iris,
but that's not me.

461
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:01,126
- See, I'm nothing like your husband.
- No, no, you're not.

462
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,378
You're human.

463
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,505
And we have a purpose, too.

464
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,675
We remind superheroes
what they're fighting for.

465
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,345
My wife, Amanda and I,

466
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,432
just had a baby six months ago.

467
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,433
Simone.

468
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,063
I might not get to see her grow up.

469
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,395
Don't you want to hold her

470
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,693
knowing that you had a hand
in making the world safer?

471
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,043
I need to go tell my wife
I'm gonna be late for dinner.

472
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,758
Just got word from Lois.
Six more Earths are gone.

473
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,551
This is the only Earth left.

474
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,679
- At least now we have Ryan.
- Yeah.

475
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,431
How'd you know what to say to him?

476
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,851
<i>Iris.</i>

477
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,145
Hey. What is it?

478
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,649
What if this is it?

479
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,109
What if...

480
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,696
stopping the wave
is my purpose as a Paragon?

481
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,491
I mean, what if it's the sacrifice
I have to make?

482
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,470
Well, if this is it, then I don't want
you to die without me, Barry.

483
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,013
I don't want you to be alone.
I'll come with you.

484
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,039
No, you can't come, Iris.

485
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,833
I may be the one with superpowers,

486
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:27,879
but your intelligence,
your resourcefulness, your heart...

487
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,091
That's your superpower
and that's what's gonna help you

488
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,385
convince Ryan Choi to be the hero
he needs to be.

489
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,805
Barry, I don't want to live
this life without you.

490
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,431
I don't want to say goodbye.

491
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,394
When I put this ring on your finger,

492
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:46,189
I promised that I'd always
come running home to you.

493
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,694
And if we're apart, for however long...

494
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:56,116
know that wherever I go,
I will be running home to you.

495
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,128
Are you still sure you want me to go?

496
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,506
Yeah. Go find Ryan Choi...

497
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,174
and hurry back.

498
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,428
I'll see you soon.

499
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,782
- Caitlin.
- I don't wanna say goodbye.

500
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,661
You two were there the first time
I opened my eyes as the Flash.

501
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,582
I couldn't be the hero I am
without you guys.

502
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,220
- Tell Joe and Iris I love them.
- We will.

503
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,892
Sorry, kid, but this has to happen.

504
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:10,023
- Barry, what are you doing?
- I'm momentarily stealing your speed.

505
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,150
You play this speedster game
long enough,

506
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,735
you learn some neat tricks.

507
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:14,962
Wait, why are you doing this?

508
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,238
Novu said the Flash must die in Crisis.

509
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,823
He never said which one.

510
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,632
You're a true hero, Jefferson.

511
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,550
I can't thank you enough.

512
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,971
Open the breach.
I need to get in that forcefield.

513
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,433
- No.
- Do you want your friend to die?

514
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,894
Let me do this. Let me save you all.

515
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,312
Cisco, don't.

516
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,401
Cisco, come on.

517
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:58,905
Thank you.

518
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,491
Keep riding the lightning, son.

519
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,535
I know you'll make us all proud.

520
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,294
Barry! He's gonna die, Cisco.

521
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,838
You made me team leader.

522
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,132
And sometimes, the leader
has to make the tough choices.

523
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:21,719
We can't stay here.

524
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,847
- Let's go.
- No.

525
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:25,514
Let's go.

526
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,035
- No, I'm not going.
- Barry, let's go.

527
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,476
- I'm not going.
- Come on!

528
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,933
<i>I have faith in you, Tina.</i>

529
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,708
Well, the truth is,
I have faith in you, too.

530
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,678
I hate to break up
the reunion,

531
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,502
but this really is our cue
to make like a tree

532
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,097
and get Oliver's soul back to his body.

533
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,374
- Let's go.
- Oliver Queen!

534
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,878
- Who are you?
- Jim Corrigan.

535
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,964
- Ah, not the one I know.
- But I'm also someone else.

536
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,174
I'm something else.

537
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:43,760
A Spectre.

538
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,430
Take a hike, crazy eyes.

539
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,807
In another life,
I was a decorated police officer,

540
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,476
a hero in my own right.

541
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,811
But then I was called
to a higher purpose.

542
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,772
It's your turn now, Oliver.

543
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:01,819
Only you can light the spark, Oliver.
It is your destiny.

544
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,656
- What is my destiny?
- To save everyone.

545
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,911
Otherwise, all universes,
all the people you love, will perish.

546
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,715
I'm sorry, but I have to.

547
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,301
- Dad, no...
- It's gonna be okay.

548
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,847
It's going to be okay.

549
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,234
- What now?
- Dad, wait.

550
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,112
I love you...

551
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,375
What happened?

552
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,461
Dad wouldn't come back with us.

553
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,672
I'm sorry, Sara.

554
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,716
The others fare any better?

555
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,277
Barry's team stopped
the anti-matter wave

556
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,427
with one Earth left.

557
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,263
I need a drink.

558
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,975
I appreciate you helping us, Jefferson.

559
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,227
I know what you've lost.

560
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:20,732
My world.

561
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,028
I lost the love of my life.

562
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:27,864
My two daughters.

563
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:36,956
Nothing will ever be okay again.

564
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
I know.

565
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,670
That Flash, the Flash from Earth-90,

566
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:46,090
he looked just like my dad, Henry Allen.

567
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,968
He was a resilient man.

568
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:53,806
He spent years in prison
for the murder of my mom.

569
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:58,144
A crime one of my enemies committed
and framed him for.

570
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:01,814
Through all that,
he never lost his light.

571
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,068
Times like this...

572
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:07,820
I try and do the same.

573
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:13,034
My father, uh, Alvin Pierce,

574
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,286
he was a good man, too.

575
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,871
Reporter.

576
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,584
Spent his life giving a voice
to the voiceless.

577
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,048
He was murdered when I was 12.

578
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:34,222
But I still carry the lessons
he taught me to this day.

579
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:35,807
I passed them along to my girls.

580
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:42,230
My girls.

581
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:49,987
Anyway, I get it.

582
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:59,455
Look, I don't think Henry or Alvin
raised any quitters.

583
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:03,167
So, we should honor their memory,

584
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,461
and rage...

585
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,340
against the dying of the light.

586
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,384
Dylan Thomas.

587
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,929
Well, all right then, Flash.

588
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,765
It's Barry.

589
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:19,934
Barry Allen.

590
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,606
Jefferson Pierce.

591
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,614
Hey, Kara, listen.

592
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,617
I get you wanted to bring
those people back.

593
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,955
You have the biggest heart
of anyone that I've ever met.

594
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,125
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

595
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,627
You know, I gotta say,
for someone who's unsure

596
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,588
that they were the Paragon of Courage...

597
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,758
Took a lot of guts to do what you did.

598
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,595
Maybe. But I have hope
that there's a better way.

599
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,767
Which is why...
Which is why I wanted to give you this.

600
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,105
Kryptonite. Why do you have that?

601
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:08,900
It was Bruce Wayne's. He lost hope.

602
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:10,860
And I never will.

603
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:14,613
Keep it.

604
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,825
I have the courage
that you'll never have to use it.

605
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,457
Attention.
Iris, Ralph and Raymond

606
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,250
have returned with Dr. Choi.

607
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:31,672
Iris. I told you
I'd come running home to you.

608
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,680
- If it wasn't you, then...
- It was the Barry Allen from Earth-90.

609
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,022
Everyone, this is Jefferson Pierce.

610
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,785
We wouldn't have been able to stop
the anti-matter wave without him.

611
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:52,485
Wait. So, the Superman thing is real?

612
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,612
Oh, damn. After all these years.

613
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:57,615
And this is your Paragon of Humanity,
Ryan Choi.

614
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:00,993
Scientist, super brain,
and ready to help save the universe.

615
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,663
How do you guys plan on doing
that exactly?

616
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,165
Well, Kara decided not to use
the Book of Destiny.

617
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:07,165
It was too risky.

618
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,794
The Harbinger, unlike me,
can travel anywhere she wants.

619
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,003
So, how do we find her?

620
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,380
By whatever means necessary.

621
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:18,010
Well, we can start by trying to re-task
the <i>Waverider's</i> satellite search grid.

622
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,144
- Lyla.
- Johnny.

623
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:28,812
Are you okay?

624
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:33,192
I'm sorry, I tried to get word to you
that I was doing recon on Earth-1,

625
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,820
but the deaths of the other Earths
is affecting my abilities.

626
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,238
Where were you on Earth-1?

627
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,321
I...

628
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,701
- I can't remember.
- It's okay.

629
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,537
- I thought I lost you, Lyla.
- Not that easy.

630
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,082
I just wish I could remember
what happened.

631
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,545
We'll figure this out.

632
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,423
What if the Anti-Monitor
wanted Harbinger back on the ship?

633
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,717
He's been controlling her
the entire Crisis.

634
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,758
And controlling you.

635
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,597
Only allowing you to appear
when he wants you to see...

636
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,097
A great tragedy.

637
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,559
- Lyla?
- Lyla?

638
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,354
No!

639
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,778
It is time to end
the age of heroes.

640
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,240
And everything you hold close.

641
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,212
Lyla.

642
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,758
That is no longer your wife,
John Diggle.

643
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:41,260
- She has been taken by...
- The Anti-Monitor.

644
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:42,345
Murderer!

645
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,807
This is for my girls.

646
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,777
Lyla.
You have to fight him, Lyla!

647
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,738
The fate of all humanity lies
with you now, Pariah.

648
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,574
- What can I do?
- You will know when the moment arrives.

649
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:30,476
Pathetic. It was foolish
to try to stop me, Novu.

650
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,103
No, Mobius.

651
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:37,149
It was foolish to allow your creation
in the first place.

652
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,651
Goodbye.

653
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:11,851
Alert. Earth-1 is gone.

654
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:14,770
We're all that's left.

655
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,644
It is done.

656
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,650
The infinite Earths are gone.

657
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:23,320
Soon, only the anti-matter universe
will remain.

658
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,708
Warning.
The anti-matter wave

659
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,117
will hit the ship in 28 seconds.

660
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,285
I know what I must do.

661
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,463
What's happening?

662
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:43,049
Iris.

663
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,470
Everyone
to the bridge. Now!

664
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:56,520
- Where did you send them?
- Somewhere you can't touch them.

665
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,397
Wherever they are,
they're gonna fight you.

666
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,149
By any means necessary.

667
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,567
To their very last breath.

668
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:23,047
- What the hell just happened?
- Where are we?

669
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,009
This is The Vanishing Point.

670
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,970
What does that mean?

671
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:32,890
It's a point outside of time and space.

672
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,892
What happened to the <i>Waverider</i>
and the others?

673
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:37,853
The Anti-Monitor.
He used Harbinger to attack us.

674
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,313
Pariah must have sent us here

675
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,398
knowing that the Anti-Monitor
couldn't follow.

676
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:43,085
Well, we have to go back.

677
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,862
- We have to go back right now!
- Barry, we can't. They're gone.

678
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,658
No...

679
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,370
Something's wrong.

680
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,872
- Kal. Kal.
- Something's wrong.

681
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,835
- Hey, Kal, hey.
- I can't...

682
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:03,838
- Come on.
- Please, fix...

683
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,047
Fix it.

684
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,884
What do I do?

685
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,177
No! No!

686
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:27,528
Oh, I am so happy that worked.

687
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,905
Lex, what did you do?

688
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,161
Well, I held the Book of Destiny
and I saw you seven Paragons

689
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,163
due to be stranded
at The Vanishing Point.

690
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,793
And I thought
destiny could use a little re-write.

691
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:50,467
So, uh...

692
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:54,263
What do we do now?

693
00:41:54,287 --> 00:42:02,287
