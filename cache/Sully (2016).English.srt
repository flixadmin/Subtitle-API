1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,606
"Cactus 1549. Runway four.
Cleared for takeoff."

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,508
"Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff."

3
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,661
Mayday, mayday. Cactus 1549.

4
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,063
We've lost both engines. Both engines.

5
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,270
No relight on one or two.

6
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,373
"Cactus 1549, if we can get it for you,
do you want to try to land runway 1-3?"

7
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,809
Departure control, we can make it.
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

8
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,296
LaGuardia Tower, Cactus 1549,
trying to make 1-3.

9
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,931
Sully, we're too low.

10
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,767
- Sully, we're too low!
- Come on.

11
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:18,879
Just a little farther.

12
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,715
Come on.

13
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,456
Sully!

14
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,557
Lorrie, I love you.

15
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,448
(SULLY)

16
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,349
What the hell's the matter with you?

17
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,164
"The onboard count, 150 passengers"

18
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:20,367
"three flight attendants and two pilots,
one of whom the senior pilot"

19
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,869
"drew on all of his experience and skill"

20
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,372
"which combined with
near-miraculous good luck"

21
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,307
"and a result that was,
frankly, astounding."

22
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,975
"There were some non-critical injuries"

23
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,745
"but everyone, everyone, survived."

24
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,815
"The first pictures
of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal--"

25
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,851
"You think that you're going to die.
That's what you think."

26
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,188
"And then, miraculously, you don't."

27
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,923
"Thank you, Captain."

28
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,059
"Thank you, thank you."

29
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,603
Thank you, sir.

30
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,239
Okay, thank you, everybody, thank you.

31
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,441
Thank you, Captain Sullenberger,
for being here today.

32
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,610
We also wanna welcome
First Officer Skiles.

33
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,845
I'm glad you could make it in
this morning.

34
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,647
Not as glad as we are.

35
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,617
For the record, we had
an Aircraft Systems Team

36
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,518
on this investigation.

37
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:15,388
Also Aircraft Structures, MRT,
Aircraft Performance, ATC

38
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,725
Wildlife Factors, Survival Factors
and Emergency Response.

39
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,395
Today, we begin with our operation
and human performance investigation

40
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,865
on the crash of US Airways Flight 1549.

41
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,600
- Water landing.
- Captain?

42
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,035
This was not a crash
and it wasn't a ditching.

43
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,405
We knew what we were
trying to execute here.

44
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,607
It was not a--

45
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,909
It was not a crash.
It was a forced water landing.

46
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,545
Why didn't you attempt
to return to LaGuardia?

47
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,282
There simply was not enough altitude.

48
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,752
The Hudson was the only place
that was long enough and smooth enough

49
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,088
and wide enough to even attempt
to land the airplane safely.

50
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,291
Air Traffic testified that you stated
you were returning to LaGuardia

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,492
but you did not.

52
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,930
As I began the left turn

53
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,566
I realized I couldn't make it back

54
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,334
and it would have eliminated
all the other options.

55
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,303
Returning to LaGuardia
would have been a mistake.

56
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,939
Okay, well, let's get into how you
calculated all those parameters.

57
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,507
There was no time for calculating.

58
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,677
I had to rely on my experience
of managing the altitude

59
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,180
and speed of 1,000 of flights
over four decades.

60
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,016
- You're saying you didn't do any--
- I eyeballed it.

61
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,351
You eyeballed it?

62
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes.

63
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,157
The best chance those passengers had
was on that river.

64
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,494
And I'd bet my life on it. In fact, I did.

65
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,995
And I would do it again.

66
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,198
Aviation engineers are theorizing

67
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,667
you had enough energy
to make it back to a runway.

68
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,137
Well, engineers are not pilots.

69
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,672
They're wrong.

70
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,740
And they weren't there.

71
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,343
Regardless, we have to follow up
on all implications

72
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,178
as part of our investigation.

73
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,714
Our computers will run
return scenario algorithms.

74
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,383
It'll generate simulations
with your exact parameters.

75
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,652
The dual engine loss, the altitude.

76
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,688
Everything you faced
when you made your decision.

77
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,324
I would like to oversee
those computer simulations.

78
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,192
Not possible during an investigation.

79
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,895
You stated that it was
a dual engine failure

80
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,364
due to multiple bird strikes?

81
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,466
That would be unprecedented.

82
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,704
Well, everything is unprecedented
until it happens for the first time.

83
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,909
How much sleep did you get
the night before?

84
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,477
Eight hours. Enough.

85
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,312
Is it possible your blood sugar was low?

86
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,349
I was rested, alert and completely
aware of my surroundings.

87
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,684
When was your last drink,
Captain Sullenberger?

88
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,885
Nine days ago.

89
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,854
- Drugs?
- No. Never.

90
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,756
First Officer Skiles?

91
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,759
Don't drink. Never have.

92
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,062
Captain...

93
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,698
Have you had any troubles at home lately?

94
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,269
Well, no more than anyone else.

95
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,070
And nothing that affected my work.

96
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,910
It's bullshit.

97
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,381
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong when it all turned out right?

98
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,949
It didn't turn out all right
for the airline

99
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,617
and their insurance company.

100
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,352
We should expect some blowback.

101
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,920
Come on, Mike. What are they going to say?

102
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,355
That he shouldn't have saved everybody?

103
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,058
It's not personal.
NTSB's just doing its job.

104
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,461
Once they have all the facts,
it'll calm down.

105
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,766
Sully, they should pin on the medal
and send you back to work.

106
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,234
"Sorry. This mailbox is full."

107
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,737
I didn't call Lorrie since this morning.
Apparently everyone else did.

108
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,076
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say,
it is an honor driving you today.

109
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,278
Thank you.

110
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,746
What has it been this year so far?

111
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,982
Bernie Madoff, two wars without end.

112
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,884
Many million new people with no work.

113
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,086
And that's just the first
two weeks of January.

114
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,221
Friday's headline?

115
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,990
This is beautiful.

116
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,929
Hey, Mike. How about we add
the driver as a character witness?

117
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,344
- Finally!
- Yeah, finally.

118
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,979
The NTSB had us tied up all day.

119
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,815
I know. I just...

120
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,983
I needed to hear your voice.

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,685
I've been hearing everybody else's.

122
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,288
"You'd be amazed
how many cousins you have."

123
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,491
It doesn't feel much like family here.

124
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,131
Pretty quiet here, too.

125
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:23,169
The reporters want me to give an update
inside the mind of Sully.

126
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,304
"What should I tell them?"

127
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,005
"Lorrie, tell them you're not
allowed to talk to anybody."

128
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,841
- Look, I can't hear you.
- Lorrie, I--

129
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,808
"I really I can't hear you."

130
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,276
- "Just call me back."
- I'm trying to tell you

131
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,611
"You do not have to talk to anybody."

132
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,712
Hold on, I can't hear you.

133
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,281
- Call me back.
- "Lorrie, I'm trying to tell--"

134
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,055
Hey, Captain Sully!

135
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,057
- Captain Sully!
- Sully!

136
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,295
How does it feel to be a miracle maker?

137
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,563
Sully, one question!

138
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,565
How did you pull off the impossible?

139
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,567
- Sully!
- Captain Sully! Sully!

140
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,570
Pardon me.

141
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,341
Captain Sully!

142
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,883
I'm thinking about running over
the press with the car.

143
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,985
Self-defense. You think
a jury would convict?

144
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,253
"Just do what you have to do."

145
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,921
You know, I'm taking that as permission.

146
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,589
The cops'll be coming after you.

147
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,591
"Sullenberger couldn't be here."

148
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,560
"He is not able to speak to the media"

149
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,330
"while the NTSB is conducting
its investigation."

150
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,900
Sully, are you listening to me?

151
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,169
Maybe we should talk later.

152
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,704
Honey, it is later.

153
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,673
I've been waiting all day.

154
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,741
"Are you okay?"

155
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,843
Yeah, just tired, that's all.

156
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,745
How are the girls?

157
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,180
"Well, they're--"

158
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,949
They're a little overwhelmed.

159
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,684
It sounds like you are, too.

160
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,786
Yeah...

161
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,255
Yeah, well, they'll be all right.

162
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,424
- "It is a lot."
- Yes, it is.

163
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,094
"Those missing engines were definitely not
what investigators wanted..."

164
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,897
The whole world is talking about you.

165
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,098
My Sully.

166
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,368
God, I just can't believe this.

167
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,472
"Lorrie, I have to stay here longer"

168
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,373
for the NTSB investigation.

169
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,409
Did I tell you that already?

170
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,911
I apologize if I didn't tell you.

171
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,247
"There is no need for you to apologize."

172
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,749
"You are right where you need to be."

173
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,988
I want you to know,
I did the best I could.

174
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,424
Of course you did.

175
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,060
You saved everyone.

176
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,464
Maybe we should just talk in the morning.

177
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,732
I'm tired.

178
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,169
I'm overwhelmed
by all this attention, so...

179
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,173
"I'm going to be on TV in the morning."

180
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,141
"What are they going to ask me?
What am I going to say?"

181
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,344
Sully, do you want me to come be with you?

182
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,446
No, no, Lorrie.

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,982
Thanks, but the girls need you.

184
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,684
Tell them I love them.

185
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,154
I love you. Get some sleep.

186
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,789
Yeah.

187
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,592
Hey, maybe when I wake up,
it'll be January 14th.

188
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,994
Wouldn't that be good?

189
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,796
I love you.

190
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,206
"Why Captain Sullenberger
made that fateful decision"

191
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,009
"to turn the Hudson into a runway?"

192
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,844
"Well, only he can answer."

193
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,848
"But we now know it was the wrong choice."

194
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,985
"A choice that endangered the lives
of all of those onboard."

195
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,689
"So, while much of the country
hails him as a hero"

196
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,860
"this new information will certainly
change everyone's understanding"

197
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,664
"of the so-called
"Miracle on the Hudson.""

198
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:42,335
"Sully Sullenberger,
are you a hero or a fraud?"

199
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,323
- Hello?
- "Jeff?"

200
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,058
I'm sorry to call so late.

201
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,727
"It's okay. There's no sleep
in this room either."

202
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,365
Can you believe they charge
five dollars for a Snickers?

203
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,501
I could bankrupt the airline
in about four bites.

204
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,205
Just thought maybe
you would want to...

205
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,673
"Talk?"

206
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,008
Absolutely.

207
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,777
Let's get some air.

208
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,180
Great.

209
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,582
I'll be down there in five minutes.

210
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,056
You enjoying the shakes?

211
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,560
- The nightmares, rapid heartbeat.
- A little bit.

212
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,862
Union's offering us counseling.

213
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,264
Yeah. What are they going to say?

214
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,300
"You were in a plane crash and lived."

215
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,069
"It may have a minor impact
on your day-to-day."

216
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,939
I don't like not being
in controlof the process.

217
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,141
- I want my self back.
- Yeah.

218
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,543
I'm hoping six months from now,
we'll just be laughing

219
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,946
about how we got to meet David Letterman.

220
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,250
We're doing David Letterman?

221
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,986
Yeah. Right after the next NTSB interview.

222
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,121
Letterman.

223
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,490
I'm guessing Dave
is going to be slightly funnier.

224
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,625
This is so surreal.

225
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,261
I guess I'm having a little trouble
separating reality

226
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,296
from whatever the hell this is.

227
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,464
Yeah.

228
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,067
This is two men freezing their asses off.

229
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,504
Sully.

230
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,007
Don't worry. You did a great thing.

231
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,176
It's going to be remembered
for a very long time.

232
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,678
Here's the funny thing.

233
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:36,115
I've delivered a million passengers
over 40 years in the air

234
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,453
but in the end, I'm going
to be judged on 208 seconds.

235
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,491
Come on. Tomorrow's going
to be a good day.

236
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,827
Computer sims will prove you were right.

237
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,796
We can all put our wings back on.

238
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,030
You want to run?

239
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,298
Yeah, let's run.

240
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,171
Fucking cold out here.

241
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,772
It was obvious.

242
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,507
It was a critical situation

243
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:06,379
losing thrust in both engines
at a low altitude

244
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,683
over one of the most densely
populated areas of the planet.

245
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,122
But choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big "if."

246
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,691
I was sure I could do it.

247
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,461
- You were?
- Yes.

248
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,865
How do you feel
when people call you a hero?

249
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,968
I don't feel like a hero.

250
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,538
I'm just a man who was doing his job.

251
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,641
The right man for the job
at the right time.

252
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:40,346
You've been flying for what,
nearly 40 years?

253
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,814
42.

254
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,349
It's been my life.

255
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,752
My whole life.

256
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,196
Your aircraft.

257
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,832
My aircraft.

258
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,748
I'll be busy crop dusting
in the Super Cub rest of the summer.

259
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,851
So, you can take the plane up,
I guess, when you please.

260
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,521
Still six bucks an hour.
I'll consider it lesson time.

261
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:25,057
A pilot never stops acquiring knowledge.

262
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,760
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.
Just learn from them.

263
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,961
Yes, sir.

264
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,398
And never forget,
no matter what's happening

265
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,966
to fly the airplane.

266
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,601
Absolutely, sir.

267
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,705
One other thing, and this is important.

268
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,573
Sir?

269
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,141
You can go ahead and smile.

270
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,744
All right.

271
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,288
I apologize for the perspiration.

272
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,489
Oh, no. After what you did

273
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,058
I'd think that Katie
couldn't be too intimidating.

274
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,226
Oh, it wasn't Katie.

275
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,930
It was the lights and the camera
that she brought with her.

276
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,898
Okay. All done.

277
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,435
That was from my mom.

278
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,004
Her name is Brenda,
she says to say "thank you"

279
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,739
and that she's single.

280
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,176
Well, you tell Brenda thank you,
but I've got a girl at home.

281
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,145
Lucky-- Lucky woman.

282
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,847
Thank you.

283
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,117
Sully.

284
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,987
Sully. Sully!

285
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,723
Sully, where are you?

286
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,459
I'm standing here calling your name.

287
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,794
What's up with you?

288
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,233
You need to get focused.

289
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,670
Because the media request
avalanche continues.

290
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,372
Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,376
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in
and ride shotgun with you

292
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,744
the rest of the way.

293
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,146
Thought you might need a friend.

294
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,482
He'll take you to today's NTSB meeting.

295
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,752
Airbus completed their
computer simulations as well.

296
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,520
Good. Good, that'll help.

297
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,022
There's something else.

298
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,524
Arnie Gentile called.

299
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,326
He has the ACARS data.

300
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,929
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

301
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,330
Not possible.

302
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,831
I felt it go.

303
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,700
It was like we were stopped in midair.

304
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,369
Arnie said there was a chance
it was sub-idle

305
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,204
that it still could've had thrust.

306
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,375
I'm just letting you know
since the NTSB already does.

307
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,920
Is retirement next?

308
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,557
What's next for you? What's next?

309
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,225
Some room, please.

310
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,061
Sully! Over here!

311
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,631
Hey, Larry. Good to see a friendly face.

312
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,701
Might be the last one you see today.

313
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,439
You've got to be kidding me.
We've been through all this before.

314
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,608
Look, I'm sorry if you're frustrated,
but our job is to investigate

315
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,544
how a plane ended up in the Hudson River.

316
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,713
On the Hudson River.

317
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,252
Isn't it a little early in the year
to go fishing?

318
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,922
Seeking the facts is hardly
"fishing," Mr. Skiles.

319
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,924
Okay, then here's
the most important fact.

320
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,126
There's only two people who know
what happened in the cockpit that day

321
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,962
- and I'm one of them.
- And we appreciate your perspective.

322
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,798
Why do you even think we're here today?

323
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,269
It's because Captain Sullenberger
did not head back to LaGuardia.

324
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,340
Look, I just finished training on the A320

325
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,176
and I can tell you, the only reason
the plane operated as well as it did

326
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,845
that the aircraft could land anywhere

327
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,681
is because Captain Sullenberger
turned on the Auxiliary Power Unit.

328
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,950
He was simply following the QRH.

329
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,752
No. No, he wasn't.

330
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,353
He wasn't following
proper procedure at all.

331
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,156
And I know, because
I had the QRH in my hands.

332
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,793
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine rollback.

333
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,796
According to Airbus,
that's the 15th thing on the list to do.

334
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:24,864
15.

335
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,200
If he had followed the damn rules,
we'd all be dead.

336
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,304
Maybe that's the part you don't like.

337
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,373
You're not used to having
answers to your guesses.

338
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,878
Look, look, what Jeff is saying
is that I know the A320

339
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,781
what it does and what it doesn't do.

340
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,518
I have read countless CVR transcripts
of deceased pilots

341
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,621
and I have significant
accident investigation experience.

342
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,389
There is no question

343
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:55,227
that you are a talented, dedicated,
experienced professional.

344
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,997
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th

345
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,567
and every crash you investigated
are not the purview of this investigation.

346
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,503
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

347
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,640
Your union has been advised.

348
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,543
ACARS data relayed that the left engine

349
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,711
continued to turn throughout the flight.

350
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,547
Then the ACARS data is wrong.

351
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,217
The evidence shows that the left engine
was at idle or sub-idle

352
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,718
immediately following the bird strike.

353
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,255
You show me the left engine,
I'll show you dead birds and no power.

354
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,827
The left engine was lost in the crash
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

355
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,096
But we can circle back to that later.

356
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,199
Let's just assume that it was, as you say

357
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,868
a dual engine loss due to bird strike.

358
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,238
Your weight was 151,510 pounds

359
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,074
wind and temperature
north, northwest, 21 degrees.

360
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:46,178
Speed and altitude
200 knots at 2,818 feet.

361
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,713
- Agree?
- Correct.

362
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,015
We were able to run
all the algorithms concurrently.

363
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:54,587
And the resulting computer simulations
of US Airways Flight 1549

364
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,923
show that the aviation engineers
were correct.

365
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,759
There was enough altitude
and speed after the bird strike

366
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,629
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

367
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,364
Successful?

368
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,234
The plane landed at LaGuardia.

369
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,468
Intact.

370
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,403
Undamaged.

371
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,706
You got that from one computer simulation?

372
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:14,974
No.

373
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,208
From 20.

374
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,712
Including attempts made
for Teterboro runways 1-9

375
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,915
and LaGuardia runways 2-2 and 1-3.

376
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,819
Every computer simulation
with the exact flight parameters

377
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,623
demonstrated that a return
to LaGuardia was possible.

378
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,925
And not just possible, probable.

379
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:40,132
Does anyone need to hear
further computer evidence?

380
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,836
Captain Sullenberger?

381
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,572
First Officer Skiles?

382
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,174
Not at this time.

383
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:53,145
I would like to go over
the parameters that were used.

384
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,981
We will make them available to the union.

385
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,118
- Thank you.
- And Once the investigation is complete

386
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,787
we'll be able to share
the actual computer simulations.

387
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,822
For now, they remain confidential.

388
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,659
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

389
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,296
There's been far too much talk
in the press already.

390
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,002
When the complete cockpit
voice recording is compiled

391
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,973
along with ATC
and all onboard transcripts combined

392
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,474
we will call you back.

393
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,945
Thank you, gentlemen. Good day.

394
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,448
Thank you.

395
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,190
They're playing Pacman.

396
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,626
You were flying a plane
full of human beings.

397
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,064
Somehow, that's not how I remember it.

398
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,701
- It just doesn't seem right.
- It's because it's not right.

399
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,538
Sully, you did everything you could
and it was more than enough.

400
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,139
Ask the passengers.

401
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,575
Ask your wife and kids. Ask mine.

402
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,502
So, what was the first thing
you heard from the cockpit?

403
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,038
- "Brace for impact." Yes.
- "Brace for impact."

404
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,774
Now, ever hear that before
coming out of a cockpit?

405
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,843
No, not ever.

406
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,949
Ever hear that in any other
aspect of your lives?

407
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,420
I don't know.

408
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,122
I don't know.

409
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,429
They could take this show away from me.

410
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,366
Jeff was relaxed and funny.

411
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,468
He should be getting
all of our interview requests.

412
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,970
"Are they paying you"

413
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,605
for all this media stuff at least?

414
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,206
"It's news, Lorr."

415
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,808
"No payment is necessary."

416
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,044
I wish the bank felt the same way.

417
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,612
Why? What do you mean?

418
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,147
"Well, it's just..."

419
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,951
We got another notice
about the space in Butte County.

420
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,755
We'll find a tenant.

421
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,990
"It just takes time."

422
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,125
Yeah, you've been saying that
for nine months, Sully.

423
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,327
It's still vacant.

424
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,095
"Well, the economy has to take a turn."

425
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,964
It just, it feels like
if we lose that space

426
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,167
the next domino to fall is the house.

427
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,437
Lorr, we're not going to lose the house.

428
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,604
"I'm sorry."

429
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,508
I'm sorry. I'm just anxious and...

430
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,812
I'm alone and not enough sleep.

431
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,679
"Yeah, I know."

432
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,115
Not a lot of sleep going on here either.

433
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,950
"I'm sorry if I'm adding to your stress."

434
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,586
"But just tell me
you'll be back in the air soon."

435
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,824
Well, not until the NTSB
is finished with their investigation.

436
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,258
We need you flying.

437
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:58,097
"Lorr, if this goes badly
my career as a safety expert"

438
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:01,500
will end as a website and a business card.

439
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,036
I'm more worried
about your career as a pilot.

440
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,442
What if I did blow this?

441
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,111
"What are you saying?"

442
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,715
What if I did get this wrong,
so close to the end of my career?

443
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,986
If I endangered the lives
of all those passengers?

444
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,156
Sully, watch the news.

445
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,657
You're a hero.

446
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,226
Everyone's going to have
to get used to it

447
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,194
including the NTSB.

448
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,497
Worst case scenario

449
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,700
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

450
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,403
That's immediate retirement. No pension.

451
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,371
My life's work gone.

452
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,906
Okay, you're scaring me now, Sully.

453
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,474
What is going on?

454
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,478
The left engine might have
still been idling.

455
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,348
And the Airbus simulations say

456
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:52,184
I could've made it back
to LaGuardia safely.

457
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,420
"But that doesn't make sense."

458
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,924
Doesn't jibe with everything
I felt in the cockpit.

459
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,161
Then why did you do it, Sully?

460
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,230
What, land in the water?

461
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,667
Wasn't that the most dangerous thing
you could have done?

462
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,177
Good afternoon, Gursimran.

463
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,745
The--

464
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,281
Tuna basil or the ham and cheddar?

465
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,384
Tuna basil, Mr. Sully. Very fresh.

466
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,689
- Thank you.
- Be careful up there.

467
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,758
Too cold today. Too much cold.

468
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,527
When are you going to come fly with me?

469
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,464
When US Air starts flights to Hyderabad.

470
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,234
I will talk to the chairman,
see what we can work out.

471
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,104
- Oh, for heaven's sakes, Diane!
- No!

472
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,739
- It's his birthday!
- Come on! No, Mom!

473
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,308
Just a little something.

474
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,710
The suitcase is already overstuffed
with gifts for Will.

475
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,379
It's always fun to get
something from the airport.

476
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,048
Feels like you've traveled, too.

477
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,983
Ma, he's turning one.

478
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,419
Don't think he'll be discerning
what gift came from where.

479
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,120
But I will.

480
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,590
Maybe a snow globe.

481
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,059
Something he'll remember.
Something "New York."

482
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,394
Were you this generous when we were kids?

483
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,796
Okay, sweetheart.

484
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,131
I'll get you a snow globe, too.

485
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,401
Fine. Come on.

486
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,516
- Good afternoon, Sheila.
- Captain.

487
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,752
- Hello, Donna.
- Captain.

488
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,188
- Jeff.
- Hey, Sully. How are you?

489
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,994
Hey, guys! Jeff!

490
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:42,961
We're not going to make it!

491
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,263
I've been waiting for a year
for this trip, Dad.

492
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,865
I'm not going to miss this flight.
Just meet us at the gate, okay?

493
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,934
We'll see you there, Uncle Robbie.

494
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,272
Altimeter is verified. 3-0-2-3.

495
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,941
3-0-2-3.

496
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,846
Start checklist complete.

497
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,485
You really think they'll release us?

498
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,155
I've checked the latest reports.
We're clear all the way to Charlotte.

499
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,958
Then steaks.

500
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,993
Del Frisco's. On me.

501
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,528
Never been.

502
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,796
And I hear good things.

503
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,700
The rib eye'll break your heart.

504
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,170
I'm more of a porterhouse man.

505
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,738
The porterhouse will stop your heart.

506
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,475
"We are now closed
for US Airways flight 1549"

507
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,343
"service to Charlotte..."

508
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,645
- Wait, wait!
- You got it.

509
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,547
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Hi. I'm sorry.

510
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,149
Spirit sent us.

511
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,318
We got canceled and they said
that we were re-routed.

512
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,752
That you guys had some seats?

513
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,920
Flight is closed.

514
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,723
Wait, see that old guy
limping up right there?

515
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,992
That's my dad. It's an emergency.
He's got to be on this flight.

516
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,827
What kind of emergency?

517
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,730
- Golf emergency.
- This flight canceled?

518
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,365
Ought to be.

519
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,767
- ID's please.
- Oh, my God!

520
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,337
- How many people are traveling?
- Three. Thank you.

521
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,871
Nothing together.

522
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,941
That's all right.
Hell, I'll fly on the wing.

523
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,209
Here we go.

524
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:08,513
22A, 6A and 6C.

525
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,449
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

526
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,917
- Thank you.
- Yes!

527
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,785
- Happy ending.
- What?

528
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,355
- She gave me the eye.
- You charming bastard!

529
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:17,589
- Ahoy.
- Welcome aboard.

530
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,890
- How's it going?
- Lucky you made it.

531
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,292
- Yeah, no kidding.
- All right.

532
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,194
- Thank you. Sorry.
- Thank you!

533
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,229
- We're in six, Jeff.
- Oh, no. That's all Jimmy.

534
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,897
I was up till 3:00.
I got to get some sleep.

535
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,199
Well, you can sleep here.

536
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,134
I don't-- Not with you verbally running
the course the whole time.

537
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,136
"I think I'll play
the seven iron on the 9th."

538
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,071
No. Good night.

539
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,409
Sorry. Excuse me.

540
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,280
Here. There you go.

541
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,116
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

542
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,953
Hey, guys, I'm in here.

543
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,388
I'm so sorry.

544
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,123
- He likes to throw everything.
- That's perfect.

545
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,258
I like to catch everything.

546
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,127
Hey, little man.

547
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,995
I googled you last night.

548
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:01,266
Read all about your company
on your website.

549
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,802
It's impressive.

550
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,170
Thanks.

551
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,975
I thought I was a good bullshitter,
but you?

552
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,610
You could go pro.

553
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,679
- Hey.
- I'm only teasing.

554
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,349
But the site does make it sound
like your air safety consulting business

555
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:21,186
has got about 100 employees
and headquarters in three states.

556
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,158
Then when I dug a little deeper,
I realized it's only you.

557
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,926
Go easy.

558
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,928
I'm just getting it going.

559
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,831
I'm not usually accused
of being a bullshitter.

560
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,333
Don't get me wrong.
Actually, it's a compliment.

561
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,270
Off that website? I'd hire you.

562
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,938
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen."

563
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:44,109
"Welcome onboard US Airways Flight 1549
with service to Charlotte."

564
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:47,646
Please review the safety instruction card
in the seatback pocket in front of you.

565
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,948
"It explains the safety features
of this aircraft"

566
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,819
"as well as the location and operation
of the exit and flotation devices."

567
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,321
"Your seat cushion serves
as a flotation device."

568
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,524
LaGuardia ramp, Cactus 1549.
Ready for pushback at gate 21.

569
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,794
"Cactus 1549, gate 21 cleared to push.
Spot 28, ground for taxi."

570
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,537
Be sure you turn that off.

571
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,674
Tray table up.

572
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,061
Just once I'd like to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

573
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,530
Well, you know the only way to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

574
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,998
Yeah, what's that?

575
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,334
Fly out of JFK.

576
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,602
Funny.

577
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,880
Take off minimum fuel quantity verify.

578
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,616
579
00:19,00, po --> 00:requi,ed.
We got 21.8 onboard.

580
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:00,719
19,000 pounds required. 21.8 onboard.

581
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:04,356
"Runway 4. Cleared for takeoff."

582
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,758
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

583
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,734
- TO/GA.
- TO/GA set.

584
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,826
Positive rate.

585
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,260
Gear up, please.

586
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,130
Gear up.

587
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,576
Nice view of the Hudson.

588
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,579
I'll never get over
how beautiful it is up here.

589
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,748
Life's easier in the air.

590
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,084
I guess it is.

591
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,120
Birds!

592
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,197
Oh, shit.

593
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,666
Oh, yeah.

594
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,874
It's just turbulence, probably.

595
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,475
I'll check the cabin.

596
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,944
What do you think's going on?

597
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,213
It's okay.

598
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,950
Everyone, might be a good idea
just to keep your seat belts on.

599
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,622
We got one rolling back.

600
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,659
We have both of them rolling back.

601
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,531
Ignition start.

602
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,474
Oh, my God.

603
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,377
I'm starting the APU.

604
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,882
Just double-check your seat belts, please.

605
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,883
Seat belt.
- Can I make sure

606
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,751
- Relax.
- your seatbelts are fastened?

607
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,886
Make sure your seat belts
are fastened.

608
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,690
Seat belts.

609
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,397
- What do you think that was?
- I think it was a bird strike.

610
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,934
- Then we're going back to LaGuardia.
- Yeah.

611
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,902
Get out the QRH.

612
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,570
Loss of thrust on both engines.

613
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,040
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

614
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,074
"We hit birds."

615
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,176
Maintain 1-5000, Delta 3-3-1.

616
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,846
" We've lost thrust on both engines.
We are turning back towards LaGuardia."

617
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,115
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

618
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,284
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- "2-2-0."

619
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,852
Which engine did you lose?

620
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,354
Both. Both engines.

621
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,355
- Supe?
- Yeah?

622
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,856
I have an emergency.

623
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,394
- What's the report?
- Both engines.

624
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,797
- What?
- Both engines gone. No thrust.

625
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,103
All right. LaGuardia
says go to runway 1-3.

626
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,539
Tower, stop your departure.
Got an emergency returning.

627
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,474
1549, bird strike.

628
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,443
He lost both engines.
Returning immediately.

629
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,410
"Which engine?"

630
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,613
He lost thrust in both engines, he said.

631
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,084
Cactus 1549, if we can get it for you,
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

632
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,655
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

633
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,825
I got an A320 diving for the river.

634
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,893
Al, stack all the inbounds to LaGuardia.

635
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,628
Let's put a hold on the tower, please.

636
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,896
Come on, guys, stay on point.

637
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,098
"What about over to our right?"

638
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,734
"Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?"

639
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:36,935
Teterboro tower, I need a runway.

640
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,104
Cactus 1549 needs to go
to the airport right now.

641
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:40,238
Newark tower, what have you got?

642
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,907
"You have runway 2-9 cleared and ready.
You need emergency landing?"

643
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,242
Yes. Okay, yeah.

644
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,678
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

645
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,183
Shit.

646
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,986
"This is the Captain."

647
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,254
"Brace for impact."

648
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,922
Oh, my God.

649
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,126
- What?
- Brace, brace, brace!

650
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,962
Heads down, stay down!

651
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,297
Brace, brace, brace!

652
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,800
Heads down, stay down!

653
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,835
"Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0."

654
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,837
"You can land runway one Teterboro."

655
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,139
We can't make it.

656
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,840
"We're going to end up in the Hudson."

657
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,109
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

658
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,483
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

659
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,352
660
00:0KC, ,ome --> 00:ver h,re.

661
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,789
You also got Newark off your 02:00 o'clock
in about seven miles.

662
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,658
Don't go in the river.

663
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,326
- Sir?
- Plug in.

664
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:43,001
Cactus 1549, if you can,
you got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

665
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,570
It'll be 02:00 o'clock in seven miles.

666
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,539
Come on.

667
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,174
Please, God.

668
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,312
I'm sorry, Patrick.

669
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,815
He's inbound to Newark, I know it.
He just went off the box to focus.

670
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:57,749
Patty.

671
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,517
He'll come back up.

672
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,352
He's heading to Teterboro.

673
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,188
We need other eyes and ears.

674
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,191
Attention, all aircraft
in the vicinity of the GW.

675
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,061
When we come up
around this bend up here

676
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,197
we'll see the USS Intrepid.

677
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,399
"We got an A320 on emergency descent."

678
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:18,002
"Cactus 1549 is low level
above the Hudson."

679
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,739
This is helicopter 1-6-7, Mike Tango.
I've got eyes on him.

680
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,043
Okay. I got a chopper with visuals.
I'm staying on this.

681
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,512
He's out there.

682
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:31,916
He's headed to Newark, seven miles.
It's only seven miles.

683
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:36,087
Cactus 1549, this is departure control.

684
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,123
On guard, do you read?

685
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,758
He's going down.

686
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,595
Cactus 1549, do you read me?

687
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,964
"Shit! He's going down!"

688
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,966
"He's going to hit the water."

689
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,736
- KC, take his seat.
- Sure.

690
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,276
Tester's going to come down.

691
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,046
Breathalyzer, urine samples,
it's standard.

692
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,048
His voice was so calm.

693
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,385
When he said the Hudson,
I didn't believe it.

694
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,555
This isn't happening.

695
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,825
People don't survive
water landings, Henry.

696
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,500
"Pull up. Pull up."

697
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,969
We're going to brace.

698
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,173
- Pull up! Pull up!
- Thirty.

699
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,141
Twenty.

700
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,276
Ten.

701
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,981
I'd better go.

702
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,853
I am so sorry. I love you.

703
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,023
Yeah. I got to go.

704
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,036
"It had just taken off
from New York's LaGuardia Airport"

705
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,305
"bound for Charlotte, North Carolina"

706
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,140
"and then a mid-air disaster"

707
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,443
"struck US Airways Flight 1549."

708
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:09,447
"It's possible that birds flew into
both of the aircraft engines."

709
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:13,218
"The pilot quickly realized he could not
return to the airport and land."

710
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,186
"His options severely limited"

711
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,389
"the only place he could go down
was the Hudson River."

712
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:34,505
"Choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was a big "if.""

713
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,407
"Have you had any troubles
at home lately?"

714
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:39,177
"Why'd you do it, Sully?
Land in the water?"

715
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,412
"Sully, you did everything you could.
It was more than enough."

716
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:45,350
" Every computer simulation
demonstrated that a return was possible."

717
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,385
"The left engine
was still operating at idle."

718
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,422
"There was enough altitude and speed
for a successful return to LaGuardia."

719
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,392
"Wasn't that the most
dangerous thing you could have done?"

720
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,751
"This is Tasty 1-1.
Abort test bombing run."

721
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,719
"I have an emergency
flight control malfunction."

722
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,021
"Two, join on me."

723
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,290
"Roger that. Two joining on you."

724
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,860
- Feels like hydraulics.
- Sir, do we need to punch out?

725
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,863
No, I can still fly.
I'm running a control test.

726
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,264
Get the checklist.

727
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,599
We have the checklist, sir.

728
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,701
Increasing thrust. We need altitude.

729
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,736
Hold on, we're going to climb.

730
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,641
Nellis Tower, this is Tasty 1-1

731
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,909
with an emergency
flight control malfunction.

732
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,078
We need a straight-in approach.

733
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,980
"Roger, Tasty 1-1."

734
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,748
"Turn left 2-0-0 to runway 3."

735
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,551
"Unable. I repeat,
I need a straight-in approach."

736
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,154
"Okay. Proceed straight
ahead to runway 2-1."

737
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,456
2-1, Tasty 1-1.

738
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,427
Two, I'm decreasing speed.

739
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:05,096
Clear the board for a damage check.

740
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,272
One, you look clean and dry,
but you're still trailing smoke.

741
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,941
Roger that, Two.
Approach runway 2-1.

742
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,445
One, I'll maintain chase
and follow you in.

743
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,154
I have visual on the runway.
What's our heading?

744
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,324
Heading 0-2-0. Five miles out, sir.

745
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,760
All right. Gear in three.

746
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,632
Tasty 1-1, check air speed.

747
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,334
Looks like you're coming in hot.

748
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,536
Nellis Tower, I need speed
to maintain control.

749
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,438
Avoiding a stall.

750
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,344
One, check your heading.
You're not going to make the runway.

751
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,879
I got it.

752
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,848
I'm bringing her back.

753
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,701
That was a hell of a landing, sir.

754
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,636
I didn't think we were going to make it.

755
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,867
I'm going to start charging you
for this stuff, all right?

756
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:50,735
Get out of here.

757
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:51,669
- You hear me?
- Thanks, Pete.

758
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,671
- Thanks, Pete.
- You got any nuts?

759
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,274
- Hey.
- Hey.

760
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,042
Let me know if you need anything.

761
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,711
"But what still seems so hard to believe"

762
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,581
"is that everyone
aboard the plane survived"

763
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,084
"including two shivering babies
who were found in a life raft..."

764
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,352
Hey--

765
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:12,290
Is that you? Are you the pilot?

766
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,758
- Sully?
- Yeah.

767
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,893
- That is you, right?
- Yeah.

768
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,929
Hey, it's a pleasure to meet you.

769
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,397
That was a...

770
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,098
That was unreal,
what you did the other day.

771
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,568
- That was really something.
- Yeah, he's a hero.

772
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:27,438
A real pleasure to meet you and
you know, we invented a drink after you

773
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,574
as soon as that happened.
Ain't that right, Johnny?

774
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,776
Yeah, you did. In fact, I'll take one.

775
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,481
The Sully! It's a shot of Grey Goose

776
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:39,750
with a splash of water.

777
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,552
Splash of water.

778
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:45,990
Hey, listen.

779
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,893
To January 15th.

780
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,761
Best day of the year.

781
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,231
- To Sully.
- Sully.

782
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,336
Hey, Pete.

783
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,505
Sully's here, and he's there!

784
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,907
Damn, Pete. He's everywhere!

785
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:04,675
Yeah!

786
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,077
Sully!

787
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:10,681
You're like a real hero, man.
You know that?

788
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,526
Keep it coming, Paulie.
I'll see you on One.

789
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,827
Agreed.

790
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,634
791
00:21 pe,ple --> 00:ard, ,ap.

792
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,036
Last report says
there's ice out by the GW.

793
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,971
- All right, thanks. Roger that.
- All right.

794
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,008
21 on the TJ, departing Midtown,
slip Seven.

795
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,521
Unbelievable.

796
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,290
I cannot believe
you have the sack to say that.

797
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,358
That's literally like giving
the entire city the finger.

798
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,226
I'll say it again.

799
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,861
Dennis Eckersley is without question

800
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,030
the greatest relief pitcher
in the history of baseball.

801
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,398
Are you blinded by the leg kick?

802
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,700
Is that what it is? Or is it the mustache?

803
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,902
You're just jealous he was never a Yankee.

804
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,470
Jealous? Oh please.

805
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,638
Yeah.

806
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,995
"Now, let's turn to page seven..."

807
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:45,876
Brace, brace, brace!

808
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,512
- Heads down, stay down!
- Let me hold him.

809
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,780
- Brace, brace, brace!
- It's okay. Let me hold him.

810
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,715
Okay.

811
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:54,118
Heads down, stay down!

812
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,454
Brace, brace, brace!
Heads down, stay down!

813
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,122
We're not going to make it, Uncle Robbie.

814
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,023
It's okay.

815
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:01,292
- Brace, brace, brace!
- I love you, Mom.

816
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:04,695
- Heads down, stay down!
-To the moon and the stars

817
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,030
- and all the way back.
- And all the way back.

818
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,266
Heads down, stay down!

819
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:35,626
What do we do, darling?

820
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:51,976
Oh, my God.

821
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,615
Evacuate.

822
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,851
Evacuate.

823
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,120
Grab your life vests, please.

824
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,322
Opening forward door.

825
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,299
It's flooding back here!

826
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,767
Rob Kolodjay!

827
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,970
- Dad!
- Go, go, go!

828
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,841
Everyone! The aft exits are unusable.

829
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,477
Move forward to the overwing exits!

830
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,879
And don life vests now!

831
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:42,359
Go! Exit! Go, go!

832
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,328
Move forward. Move forward
to the right or left exit door.

833
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,629
Jeff!

834
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,298
He's back there, can you see him?

835
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,899
Dad!

836
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,711
- Everyone, come forward.
- Jump!

837
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,082
Sir, evacuate the plane right now! Go!

838
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,489
Sheila, the raft didn't deploy.

839
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,095
Sir! Come back, sir!

840
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:22,833
Calm down. You'll be fine.
The rafts are waiting.

841
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,172
Come on, come on, come on.

842
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:30,274
- Hurry up!
- It's going to be bitter out there.

843
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:31,375
Here you go.

844
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,445
Here. going to be bitter out there.

845
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,048
- Slowly.
- You need to get off this plane now.

846
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,850
Feet first. Slide slowly and gently.

847
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,753
- Plenty of room.
- Come on, people.

848
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,394
Okay. It's good now. Jump! Jump!

849
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,479
Oh, my God. Is that gas?

850
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,314
We have to jump.

851
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,983
No, no, no, wait!

852
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:23,327
You seeing this?

853
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,830
Yeah. Holy Christ, that's a plane.

854
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,065
Deploy that man overboard
ladder right away.

855
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,633
All right, I'm on it.

856
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,835
Shit.

857
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:32,803
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

858
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,940
Coast Guard sector New York,
channel 1-6, Thomas Jefferson.

859
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,976
We have a passenger airliner
in the north river.

860
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,745
We're en route. We will advise.

861
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,415
Let's go, let's go!

862
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,250
Let's go find out.

863
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:02,132
Jimmy, Jeff's still on that plane!

864
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,134
We can't leave him there!

865
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,803
Robbie, Robbie. Robbie!

866
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:07,705
Robbie! The crew will grab him, okay?

867
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,106
- The crew will get him, okay?
- He's in there!

868
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:12,276
He'll be okay. He'll be okay.

869
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:18,816
I'm okay, Mom. I'm okay.

870
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:20,351
- Ma!
- Just leave me.

871
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,119
Keep moving forward!

872
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,554
Follow your instructions.

873
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,823
- It's all right.
- There's water in the back.

874
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:27,358
- We're doing fine.
- Come on. Let's get out!

875
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,660
One after another. Keep moving forward.
Keep moving forward.

876
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,228
This way. I'll help you out.

877
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,130
You go ahead, sweetheart.

878
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,031
Come on. She can't move.

879
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,699
- Sir! Can you come help us?
- Yes, ma'am?

880
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,336
- Right there.
- Here's a floatation device. Take that.

881
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:42,206
Everyone, keep moving forward.

882
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,475
Over the wings.

883
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,645
If you have a life vest, put it on!

884
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,514
"All series near the Intrepid,
plane down."

885
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:54,151
"We got passengers on the wings.
Approach with caution."

886
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,024
Stay calm and you'll all get out.

887
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:01,392
Thank you sir.

888
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:07,264
Move forward, move forward.

889
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,538
Come on!

890
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,440
Come on!

891
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,282
Put a blanket on her leg.

892
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,084
She needs a tourniquet.

893
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,955
You're going to be fine, honey. Go slow.
Go slowly. Blanket.

894
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:34,091
Wrap this around her leg. Make it tight.

895
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,962
It's so cold out here.

896
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,466
"Get those first-aid kits up to the bow"

897
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,735
"and get some extra
life jackets out there."

898
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:47,538
We're here! We're here!

899
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:48,973
Hey!

900
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:51,809
It's all right. We're here.

901
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,582
Give me a countdown, Victor.

902
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,150
All right.

903
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,953
Three

904
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,755
two...

905
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:07,391
We're good. We're good.

906
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,294
Come on, buddy.

907
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,732
Hold it right there, baby. Come on.

908
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,900
Easy. Go easy.

909
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,572
Come on. One at a time.

910
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,242
We're going to get everybody, guys.

911
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:00,110
"This is Yogi Berra.
We're 30 seconds out."

912
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:04,148
With a water temperature of 36 degrees
and a wind chill of minus five

913
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:07,151
the surviving passengers of Flight 1549

914
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,553
literally have minutes to live.

915
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,156
"We're five out.
We have visual on aircraft."

916
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:20,064
- All right, give me your hand.
- If anybody's got any problems

917
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:21,131
just wait down there.

918
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,301
We got some really good people
coming on their way, all right?

919
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,482
Stand by.

920
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,858
50 yards, go!

921
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,040
You okay?

922
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,409
I got you. You're going to be okay.
All right?

923
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,743
Got you.

924
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,714
Is anyone still here? Come forward.

925
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,583
Captain! Come back!

926
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,017
Come forward!

927
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,592
We need to get off the plane now.

928
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,368
Captain!

929
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,971
Captain! We have to go!

930
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,740
It's time to get off the plane, right now!

931
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:50,654
All right, you guys go. Go.
I'll be right behind you.

932
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,003
Sully, we got to go.

933
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,144
Thank you.

934
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:27,991
Everybody's okay. Help is on the way.

935
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,163
"26 passengers going to Port Imperial."

936
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,865
"19 headed to Pier 81."

937
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:38,535
"We got 24 passengers onboard
headed to Port Imperial."

938
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,004
Whoever has miraculously
survived this plummet

939
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,806
from the skies into the icy Hudson

940
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:46,109
has about 300 of New York's finest
ready to help them.

941
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,546
The only question remaining
is will it be too late?

942
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,316
In Manhattan, Bobby Cuza, New York One.

943
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:54,017
- Come on, sir. Give me your hand.
- Come on, grab on.

944
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,719
Give me your hand, sir. It's okay.

945
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,956
We got you. We got you

946
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,692
- My hands.
- Got to warm them up.

947
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,527
Get him a blanket, fast.

948
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:12,469
I was sure I was going to die.

949
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,339
Hey, no one dies today.

950
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,511
Give me your hand.

951
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,320
Here you go, Captain. This way.

952
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:31,888
Give us your hand, sir.

953
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,358
Sully, wrap it around your arms.

954
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:37,394
- Climb out now.
- Give me your hand.

955
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,735
Can we get a couple
more blankets over here?

956
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,003
Thank you.

957
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:48,038
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

958
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:49,539
Give him some room.

959
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,907
You're welcome.

960
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:13,630
Hello?

961
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,465
"I wanted to call to say I'm okay."

962
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,734
Oh, good. Are you still on the 5:50 home?

963
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,369
"There's been an incident."

964
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:22,539
I'm okay, not a scratch somehow.

965
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,141
Turn on the television.

966
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:26,276
What do you mean "Turn on the television"?

967
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:27,878
Lorrie, I can't talk right now.

968
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:31,048
I will call you from the pier
when things quiet down.

969
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,818
I had to land in the Hudson.

970
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,155
Sully, I don't understand.

971
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:42,125
I love you, and I'm okay.
Tell the girls I am okay.

972
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,629
But I have to go.

973
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,399
Girls, turn on the TV.

974
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:53,737
"An extensive rescue effort is underway"

975
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:57,307
"after a US Airways Flight
crashes into the Hudson River"

976
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,644
"sending passengers
scrambling for safety--"

977
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,667
If you have any wet clothing on,
take it off and wrap up in a blanket

978
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,335
from the Red Cross.

979
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,280
You're going to be okay. Okay, Lucille?

980
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,484
I'm going to take you right
to the ambulance, all right?

981
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,355
Maybe he's here.
Maybe he beat us somehow.

982
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:49,526
There's lots of boats! Jeff!

983
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,997
- Sully!
- Dan!

984
00:58:57,401 --> 00:59:00,837
Dan, I need to know who's hurt
and how badly, and I need a count.

985
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:04,174
155, that's my number.
That's passengers and crew.

986
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:05,642
Okay. How are you?

987
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,311
I'll answer that question
when we've counted 155.

988
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,713
All right.

989
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,248
Honey, it's me.

990
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,885
Sort of. I won't be home tonight.

991
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:19,389
Sherri, I cannot believe
I am talking to you.

992
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,598
Captain. I'm here to escort you
to meet with Mayor Bloomberg

993
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,267
and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

994
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,169
If the Mayor wants to say hello,
he'll have to come down here.

995
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,203
We're still working.

996
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:35,872
Sully, I can keep assembling the count.

997
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:37,507
Jeff.

998
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,342
Jeff, I need a count.
We've got to have a count.

999
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,411
There's no way to get
a real count out here, Sully.

1000
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,579
Sully, Jeff's right.

1001
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,347
Let's get you in some dry clothes
before you freeze to death.

1002
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,250
Captain, what if the Mayor and Chief Kelly
come down here to meet with you?

1003
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,352
Dan, because it was a domestic flight--

1004
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,620
Yeah, we got no manifest.

1005
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,857
We're going to have to track
the passenger information down one by one.

1006
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,091
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

1007
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,360
I'm going to call John Carey.
We're going to get you a count.

1008
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,397
But, Sully, listen. You've done enough.
Let me take it from here.

1009
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,944
- Jeff?
- Pop!

1010
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:17,414
I'm okay. I was on the other wing.
They brought us to Jersey.

1011
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:20,817
I couldn't see you. I couldn't find you.

1012
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:23,320
I could hear you shouting
my name the whole time.

1013
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,289
I shouted back. I guess the river--

1014
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,226
- Are you okay?
- I love you, son.

1015
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,928
I love you, too.

1016
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,664
Can you believe we made it?

1017
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,902
I mean, the plane crashed

1018
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:40,170
on the river!

1019
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:42,806
Are you kidding me?

1020
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,245
So unbelievable.

1021
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:09,032
I've never been so happy
to be in New York in my life.

1022
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,711
Hey, Patty.

1023
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:24,481
Supe sent me looking for you.
Everyone's going nuts up top.

1024
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:26,883
- Aren't you coming?
- I guess you didn't hear.

1025
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,352
I lost Cactus 1549 in the Hudson.

1026
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,857
I guess you haven't heard.
He landed the son of a bitch!

1027
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,293
- What?
- Everyone's been pulled off.

1028
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:37,661
It's a miracle!

1029
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:39,362
I thought I lost them all.

1030
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,365
- They've got to get a TV in here.
- Yeah. Seriously.

1031
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:47,070
What is my pulse rate?

1032
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,306
It's 110.

1033
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:51,508
My normal resting is 55.

1034
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:53,076
110...

1035
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:54,978
That's not good.

1036
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,547
You are right. 110 is not good.

1037
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:01,184
After what you just went through,
110 is extraordinary.

1038
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,186
How is Doreen?

1039
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,487
Fairly severe laceration.

1040
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,356
But we'll keep her a day or two
to stem the infection.

1041
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:07,557
But she'll be okay?

1042
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,327
She'll have a scar
and a hell of a story to tell.

1043
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:11,227
Although no one'll believe her.

1044
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,530
Hell, I'm standing here with you right now
and I don't believe it.

1045
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,532
You landed a plane on the Hudson.
Not a scratch on you.

1046
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:16,733
Arnie.

1047
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:21,237
The union is pulling out
all the big guns today, huh?

1048
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,541
Talked to Dan Britt, Sully.

1049
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,443
Got a count.

1050
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,712
155.

1051
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:32,582
155.

1052
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,050
It's official.

1053
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,286
- 155.
- 155.

1054
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:41,625
155.

1055
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:43,927
Thank you, Arnie.

1056
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:17,560
- Hey, Carl.
- Jeff.

1057
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,296
- Sully.
- Carl.

1058
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,765
Hell of a thing you pulled off
out there today.

1059
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:23,400
Well, we're here.

1060
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,468
It's about all I know at the moment.

1061
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,637
Oh, this is Ms. May, with the hotel.

1062
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,838
Wanted to have a quick word with you.

1063
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,140
I won't take your time, gentlemen.

1064
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,243
This is only to say that my staff and I
are committed to protecting your privacy.

1065
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,645
So, if there's anything I can do at all--

1066
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,149
If it's possible, I'd love to have
my uniform dry-cleaned overnight.

1067
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,684
It's the only clothing that I have.

1068
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:41,685
Dry-cleaning?

1069
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:43,586
If it's too much-- If it's too late--

1070
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:44,754
Are you kidding?

1071
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:48,258
Captain Sullenberger,
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could.

1072
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,661
Oh, okay.

1073
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:55,165
Well, thank you, Evelyn.
Thank you very much.

1074
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,800
- Anything for Sully.
- Okay.

1075
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,635
Have a blessed day.

1076
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:02,172
What just happened?

1077
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,507
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

1078
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,677
Come on, Sully.

1079
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:11,815
When's the last time you heard of someone
landing a jet plane on the water

1080
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,983
and everybody lived?

1081
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,554
Exactly.

1082
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:21,524
I got shaving cream,
razor blades, toothpaste.

1083
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:25,161
And new clothes.

1084
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,897
What, did you think we were ninjas?

1085
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,899
Kmart was the only store open.

1086
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,301
It's Queens. It's 10:00 in the evening.

1087
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:33,636
- You find a Brooks Brothers.
- Yeah.

1088
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,306
Sully.

1089
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,842
What are you even still doing in uniform?

1090
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:40,677
You know, I don't know.

1091
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:44,748
Look, guys. It's been a long day.
Why don't you get some rest?

1092
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:48,818
Mike Cleary will be over in the a.m.
and make sure you're both doing okay.

1093
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,588
- Thank you, Carl.
- Yeah, thank you, Captain.

1094
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,358
You know, it's been a while since
New York had news this good.

1095
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,094
Especially with an airplane in it.

1096
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:09,372
I'll see you later, Sully.

1097
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:35,064
"The word city officials
keep repeating is "timing.""

1098
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:38,201
"The perfect timing
of the NYPD scuba units"

1099
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,303
"and of the ferry boat captains"

1100
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:44,474
"and of course, the inexplicably
precise timing of the pilot."

1101
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,411
"Captain "Sully" Sullenberger,
who, with almost no time"

1102
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,814
"became a man for all time."

1103
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:52,315
- "This is Kristine Johnson..."
- The timing.

1104
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,717
"...reporting live from the Hudson River."

1105

on the Hudson."

1108

"Meanwhile, the search is launched
for the engine of the aircraft."

1109
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,764
Hey, Sully. Let me--

1110
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,339
Come on. Answer.

1111
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,474
Answer!

1112
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:23,346
Larry, the CVR is in two days.
How fast can you arrange a favor?

1113
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,781
- Sully?
- "I know that Airbus"

1114
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:27,917
"has simulations scheduled
for the S22 sim at the factory."

1115
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:31,521
"But that's next week in Toulouse.
Can you get them to reschedule?"

1116
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,289
It's 1:30 in the morning.

1117
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,457
"I need you to make it happen"

1118
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,825
before we listen to the CVR.

1119
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,994
Before our testimony is complete.

1120
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,095
"Why?"

1121
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:41,764
I have a right to see the simulations

1122
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,367
and I have a feeling that
with human pilots and not a computer

1123
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,369
"the results are going to be different."

1124
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,105
What if they show the exact same result?

1125
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,508
If they do, then I'll hand you
my wings myself.

1126
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,676
It's all about the timing, Larry.

1127
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,179
You can accomplish anything
if you're never in a hurry.

1128
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,214
I sure as hell agree with that.

1129
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,649
"The CVR is on Wednesday."

1130
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:02,018
That's 36 hours.
Can you make it happen?

1131
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,654
"I'll try. It's a lot
of phone calls to make."

1132
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:06,789
I know, it's already 7:30
in the morning in France

1133
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:09,959
so, you better get started,
thank you, Larry. Thank you.

(DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION)
(FEDERAL AVITATION ADMINISTRATION)

1135
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:29,746
Hey, Lorrie.

1136
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:33,016
"Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
before the hearing."

1137
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:35,485
Sweetheart, what happened?

1138
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:39,989
I realized just now

1139
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:43,059
for the first time, that there were...

1140
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:47,530
There were 155 people on that plane
and you were one of them.

1141
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:50,733
We almost lost you.

1142
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,504
Yeah, but you didn't. I'm right here.

1143
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,840
How are you holding up?

1144
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,709
I'm holding up.

1145
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,577
Please tell me this is almost over.

1146
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,914
- It's almost over.
- "Okay."

1147
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,183
- I love you.
- "I love you, too."

1148
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,919
I'll call you when they're done with me.

(NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD)

1150
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,550
- Sully.
- Let's go, Larry.

1151
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,796
- Good morning, Sully.
- Jeff.

1152
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,965
All right good morning,
ladies and gentlemen and welcome.

1153
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,266
My name is Charles Porter.

1154
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,569
I've been assigned by the
National Transportation Safety Board

1155
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:02,472
to conduct this public hearing here today.

1156
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,574
We have a lot of material to cover.

1157
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,577
But before we listen to
the cockpit voice recording...

1158
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,679
And we will be listening to it
for the first time

1159
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,347
along with you, gentlemen.

1160
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,851
Per the request of
Captain Sullenberger and the union,

1161
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:17,120
Airbus has agreed to link us via satellite

1162
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,455
to today's piloted simulations.

1163
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,124
Upload link, please.

1164
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,860
They're just simulations, Sully.

1165
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,362
Won't change my mind
about what happened up there.

1166
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,598
Might change theirs.

1167
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,308
Birds.

1168
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:42,779
Number one's rolling back. And number two.

1169
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,380
Auto pilot's off.

1170
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,681
Pilot off.

1171
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,717
- Flight Director's off.
- Flight Director is off.

1172
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:51,020
All right. LaGuardia, Cactus 1549,
dual engine failure.

1173
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,488
We have to return to the field.

1174
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:54,891
Okay. I'm going to left turn
back to LaGuardia 1-3.

1175
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:57,860
I'll activate the approach for you.

1176
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,829
It's activated.

1177
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,464
Runway 1-3.

1178
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,201
Glide slopes coming in nicely.

1179
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,970
- Flaps two.
- Flaps two.

1180
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,074
Sink Rate 900.

1181
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,578
Too low, flaps.

1182
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,713
Flight slow.

1183
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,248
Too low, flaps.

1184
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:23,152
40, 30, 20...

1185
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:33,696
Successful landing
at LaGuardia, runway 1-3.

1186
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:35,765
For the record

1187
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:39,235
the pilots and the computer
sims bear the same result.

1188
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:42,205
Let's try for Teterboro now, please.

1189
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:45,174
Upload the second run.

1190
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:50,713
Birds.

1191
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:57,253
Give me a heading 3-1-0.

1192
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,088
Heading 3-1-0.

1193
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,592
I'm going to give you direct to Teterboro.

1194
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,293
Direct Teterboro.

1195
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,102
1,000.

1196
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,303
Flaps two.

1197
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:15,605
Flaps two.

1198
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,112
Too low, terrain.

1199
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,947
Too low, terrain.

1200
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,716
Too low, terrain.

1201
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:31,721
50, 40, 30, 20...

1202
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,427
Successful landing
at Teterboro, runway 1-9.

1203
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:46,335
Multiple airports, runways,
two successful landings.

1204
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:50,239
We are simply mimicking
what the computer already told us.

1205
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:54,343
A lot of toes were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

1206
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,013
And frankly...

1207
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,249
I really don't know what
you gentlemen plan to gain by it.

1208
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,518
Can we get serious now?

1209
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,688
Captain?

1210
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,823
We've all heard about
the computer simulations

1211
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,159
and now we are watching actual sims.

1212
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,628
But I can't quite believe

1213
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:17,667
you still have not taken
into account the human factor.

1214
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:19,468
Human piloted simulations

1215
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,704
showed that you could
make it back to the airport.

1216
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,139
No, they don't.

1217
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,442
These pilots were not behaving
like human beings

1218
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,011
like people who are experiencing this
for the first time.

1219
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,680
8Well, they may not be reacting
like you did.

1220
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,050
Immediately after the bird strike
they are turning back for the airport.

1221
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,352
Just as in the computer sims, correct?

1222
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,620
That is correct.

1223
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,290
They obviously knew the turn
and exactly what heading to fly.

1224
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,558
They did not run a check.

1225
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,126
They did not switch on the APU.

1226
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,729
They had all the same
parameters that you faced.

1227
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,297
No one warned us.

1228
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:53,135
No one said, "You are going
to lose both engines at a lower altitude"

1229
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,971
"than any jet in history."

1230
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:57,540
"But be cool just..."

1231
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,408
"make a left turn for LaGuardia"

1232
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,978
"like you're going back
to pick up the milk."

1233
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,381
This was dual engine loss at 2,800 feet

1234
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,683
followed by an immediate water landing

1235
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,653
with 155 souls onboard.

1236
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:14,190
No one has ever trained
for an incident like that.

1237
01:13:14,657 --> 01:13:15,891
No one.

1238
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:20,229
The Teterboro landing,
with its unrealistic bank angle

1239
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,431
we were not the Thunderbirds up there.

1240
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:25,901
I'd like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver

1241
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,104
before he actually pulled it off.

1242
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:30,539
I'm not questioning the pilots.

1243
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:31,841
They're good pilots.

1244
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:35,745
But they've clearly been instructed
to head for the airport

1245
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,780
immediately after the bird strike.

1246
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,417
You've allowed no time for analysis
or decision-making.

1247
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:45,588
In these simulations, you've taken
all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

1248
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:49,625
How much time did the pilots
spend planning...

1249
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,060
for this event?

1250
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,695
For these simulations?

1251
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:58,534
You are looking for human error.

1252
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,304
Then make it human.

1253
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,311
This wasn't a video game.

1254
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,446
It was life and death.

1255
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,316
Sully's right. That's worth a few seconds.

1256
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:15,251
Please ask how many
practice runs they had.

1257
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:18,721
17.

1258
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,661
17?

1259
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:29,965
The pilot who landed at Teterboro

1260
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,902
had 17 practice attempts

1261
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:35,438
before the simulation we just witnessed.

1262
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:43,479
Your reaction decision time
will be set at 35 seconds.

1263
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,982
35 seconds.
That's not enough time.

1264
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,619
We only had 208 seconds total so...

1265
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,421
I'll take it.

1266
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:54,190
Upload the link.

1267
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,658
Return to LaGuardia.

1268
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,761
Now with an added
35-second delay in response time.

1269
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:04,667
Birds.

1270
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:05,601
Okay, I saw them.

1271
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,803
- Give me 35 seconds.
- 35 seconds.

1272
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,479
Time's up.

1273
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:17,646
Here we go.

1274
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,616
Flight path vector.

1275
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:27,857
- Going for 1-3.
- Okay.

1276
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:32,461
- Activate confirm.
- All right. You are confirmed.

1277
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:36,132
We're heading right for the airport.

1278
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,242
"Caution, obstacle."

1279
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,644
"Caution, obstacle."

1280
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,380
We're about seven miles from the runway.

1281
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,217
" Caution, obstacle."

1282
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,852
"Terrain, terrain."

1283
01:15:57,987 --> 01:15:59,321
"Pull up."

1284
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:01,857
"Pull up."

1285
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,226
"Pull up."

1286
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:07,096
"Pull up."

1287
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:08,697
"Too low, terrain."

1288
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,033
- "Too low, terrain."
- We got a little extra speed.

1289
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,935
- You want some flaps?
- "Too low, terrain."

1290
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,904
- "Too low, terrain."
- No, leave the flaps up.

1291
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,605
"Too low, terrain."

1292
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,275
"Too low, terrain."

1293
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:21,110
"Too low, terrain."

1294
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,778
"Too low, terrain."

1295
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,583
50, 40, 30, 20...

1296
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:42,965
Let's try Teterboro.

1297
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,469
Upload the link, please.

1298
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,140
Birds.

1299
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,909
Auto pilot off. Flight Director off.
Hack the time.

1300
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,945
- 35 seconds.
- 35 seconds.

1301
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,748
Engine one and two fail.

1302
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,087
"Turn."

1303
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,222
Okay.

1304
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:10,459
Let's see if we can make it.

1305
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,397
"Heading sub 2-9-8."

1306
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,132
You seeing Teterboro out there?

1307
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,834
I do.

1308
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,273
Way too low.

1309
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:29,144
"Obstacle, obstacle."

1310
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,113
"Pull up."

1311
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:33,482
"Pull up."

1312
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,484
"Pull up."

1313
01:17:36,519 --> 01:17:37,920
"Pull up."

1314
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,022
"Pull up."

1315
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,791
Not going to work, not going to work.

1316
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:44,927
"Pull up."

1317
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,129
"Pull up."

1318
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,198
"Pull up."

1319
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,181
Does anyone need to see more simulations?

1320
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:12,955
Now that we've seen
what could have happened

1321
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:15,524
can we listen to what actually did?

1322
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:19,361
We will look at all
the results at a later date.

1323
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,530
Elizabeth.

1324
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:27,069
For the record, this is
the CVR of US Airways Flight 1549

1325
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:29,638
January 15th, 2009.

1326
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:32,074
Gentlemen, headsets.

1327
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,669
Birds!

1328
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,578
Shit.

1329
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,679
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,550
We got one rolling back.

1331
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,288
We have both of them rolling back.

1332
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:25,127
Ignition start.

1333
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,768
I'm starting the APU.

1334
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,976
- My aircraft.
- Your aircraft.

1335
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,645
Get out the QRH.

1336
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:44,046
Priority left.

1337
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:45,714
Loss of thrust on both engines.

1338
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,117
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

1339
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:50,085
Hit birds.
We've lost thrust on both engines.

1340
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,954
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

1341
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,622
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

1342
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,724
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

1343
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,394
- Which engine did you lose?
- Both. Both engines.

1344
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:09,805
"If fuel remaining, engine mode,
select your ignition."

1345
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,240
- Ignition.
- Ignition.

1346
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,609
- Thrust levers, confirm idle.
- Idle.

1347
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:16,478
Airspeed. Optimum relight, 300 knots.

1348
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,847
- We don't have that.
- No, we don't.

1349
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:24,086
"Cactus 1549, if we can get it for you,
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?"

1350
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,590
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

1351
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:32,594
Emergency electrical power,
emergency generator not online.

1352
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,629
Online.

1353
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:36,699
ATC notified. Squawk 7700.

1354
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:39,034
Distress message transmit. We did that.

1355
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:42,771
"Cactus 1549, it's going
to be left traffic, runway 3-1."

1356
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,274
- Unable.
- Okay. What do you need to land?

1357
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:46,341
Wind shear.

1358
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,677
FAC 1 off, then on.

1359
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:04,226
Been 10 seconds, Captain. Come on.

1360
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,794
Talk to me.

1361
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:07,896
Cactus 1549, runway 4's available

1362
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:09,798
if you wanna make
left traffic to runway 4.

1363
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:11,867
I don't think we can make any runway.

1364
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:15,070
What about over to our right?
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?

1365
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,873
Okay, yeah. Off your right side
is Teterboro airport.

1366
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,909
LaGuardia Departure,
got an emergency inbound.

1367
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,478
"This is Teterboro tower. Go ahead."

1368
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,813
Cactus 1549 over the GW Bridge.

1369
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:25,981
Needs to go to the airport right now.

1370
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,249
"Check. Does he need assistance?"

1371
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,985
Yes. Bird strike.
Can I get him in for runway 1?

1372
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,394
"Cactus 1549, you wanna
try and go to Teterboro?"

1373
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:42,164
"Obstacle. Obstacle."

1374
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,102
"Obstacle. Obstacle."

1375
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,738
"Pull up."

1376
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,006
"Clear of conflict."

1377
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:53,776
No relight after 30 seconds,
engine master one and two, confirm off.

1378
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:54,877
Off.

1379
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:57,279
Wait 30 seconds.

1380
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:59,248
"Too low, terrain."

1381
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,016
"Too low, terrain."

1382
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,285
"Too low, terrain."

1383
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,087
"Too low, terrain."

1384
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:13,562
This is the captain.

1385
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:15,697
Brace for impact.

1386
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:20,435
"500."

1387
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:29,711
"Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0."

1388
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:31,547
"You can land runway one Teterboro."

1389
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:32,748
We can't make it.

1390
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:34,883
"Okay. Which runway
would you like at Teterboro?"

1391
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,218
Go ahead. Try number one.

1392
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:37,386
Number one.

1393
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,288
No relight.

1394
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:41,657
We're going to end up in the Hudson.

1395
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:42,724
"Too low, terrain."

1396
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:45,227
- "I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?"
- "Too low, terrain."

1397
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:47,296
"Too low, terrain."

1398
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,576
All right, let's put the flaps out.
Put the flaps out.

1399
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:03,345
- Flaps out.
- "Cactus 1549, radar contact lost."

1400
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:06,248
"You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles."

1401
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:09,117
- Got flaps out.
- 2,050 feet in the air.

1402
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:17,492
170 knots. Got no power on either one.
Try the other one.

1403
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,329
- Try the other one.
- "1549? Still up?"

1404
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,297
150 knots.

1405
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:24,433
- Got flaps two. You want more?
- No. Let's stay at two.

1406
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:27,369
You got runway 2-9 available at Newark.
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

1407
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,837
You got any ideas?

1408
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,440
Actually not.

1409
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,307
"Terrain, terrain."

1410
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,042
"Pull up. Pull up."

1411
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,645
"Pull up."

1412
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:38,146
"Pull up."

1413
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,715
"Pull up."

1414
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:41,683
"Pull up."

1415
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:43,819
"Pull up."

1416
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,957
We're going to brace.

1417
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:50,125
"Pull up."

1418
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,526
30...

1419
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:56,999
20...

1420
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:58,066
"Pull up."

1421
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:38,206
I need to take a quick break.

1422
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,723
What did you think?

1423
01:24:55,724 --> 01:24:58,894
Hearing the CVR just now?

1424
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,764
Let me tell you what I think.

1425
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:07,135
I'm just so damn proud.

1426
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:11,239
And you, you were right there,
through all that distraction.

1427
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,108
With so much at stake.

1428
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:18,246
We did this together. We were a team.

1429
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:21,717
Thanks, Sully.

1430
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:24,286
- We did our job.
- We did our job.

1431
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,840
Hey, you did good.

1432
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:48,076
All right, folks. I'd like to call
this hearing back to order.

1433
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:49,678
If we could settle, please.

1434
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:53,248
Take your seats.

1435
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:01,857
That is honestly the first time

1436
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:05,093
that I have listened to a crash recording

1437
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:06,695
while actually sitting

1438
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:09,164
with the captain and the first officer.

1439
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:12,601
It's extraordinary.

1440
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:16,805
That was no simulation.

1441
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:19,107
No, it wasn't.

1442
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:22,010
Gentlemen..

1443
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:26,481
I want to inform you that
the left engine has been recovered.

1444
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:30,285
We just received a comprehensive report.

1445
01:26:32,454 --> 01:26:34,790
There was extensive damage
to both the guide vanes

1446
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,992
and fan blades of the engine.

1447
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:39,661
Five compressor blades were fractured

1448
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:43,865
and eight variable guide vanes missing.

1449
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,234
So, no thrust?

1450
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:48,236
As you testified

1451
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,405
it was completely destroyed.

1452
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,641
The ACARS data was wrong.

1453
01:26:57,646 --> 01:27:01,016
I'd like to add something
on a personal note.

1454
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:03,018
I can say with absolute confidence

1455
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:05,854
that after speaking
with the rest of the flight crew

1456
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:09,825
with bird experts, aviation engineers

1457
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:12,527
after running through every scenario

1458
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,330
after interviewing each player

1459
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,699
there is still an "X" in this result

1460
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,436
and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

1461
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:26,208
Remove you from the equation,
and the math just fails.

1462
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:29,678
I disagree.

1463
01:27:31,513 --> 01:27:34,416
It wasn't just me. It was all of us.

1464
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,519
It was Jeff and Donna
and Sheila and Doreen and...

1465
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:41,756
all of the passengers,
the rescue workers

1466
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,425
air traffic control

1467
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,761
ferry boat crews and the scuba cops.

1468
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:50,232
We all did it.

1469
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,934
We survived.

1470
01:27:57,139 --> 01:28:00,942
First Officer Skiles, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1471
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:04,146
Anything you would have done differently

1472
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:07,549
if you had to do it again?

1473
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:09,818
Yes.

1474
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,420
I would have done it in July.

1475
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,270
(ON JANUARY 15, 2009)
(MORE THAN 1,200 FIRST RESPONDERS)

1476
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:31,907
(AND 2 FERRY BOATS CARRYING ITS COMMUTERS)
(RESCUED THE PASSENGERS AND CREW OF FLIGHT 1549)

1477
01:28:31,907 --> 01:28:37,145
(THE BESTY OF NEW YORK CAME TOGETHER)
(IT TOOK THEM 24 MINUTES)

1478
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,584
7F. 11F.

1479
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:50,719
9D.

1480
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:51,853
1C.

1481
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:54,222
- 25B.
- 26B.

1482
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,391
- 10B.
- 9A.

1483
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:59,861
- 13C.
- 21A and B.

1484
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:05,267
155 is a number,
but when you can put faces to it

1485
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:10,071
and not just 155 faces,
but the other faces

1486
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:14,576
the wives, the daughters, the sons,
the fathers, the mothers, the brothers

1487
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:17,045
it gets to be a pretty big
number pretty quickly.

1488
01:30:17,045 --> 01:30:18,880
This is your captain speaking.

1489
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:28,857
I think today was as much and as good
for me and my crew as it was for you.

1490
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:33,128
And because of the events
of January 15, 2009

1491
01:30:33,128 --> 01:30:38,900
I'm convinced that we will be joined
in our hearts and in our minds forever.

1492
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:37,158
I am the keeper of the mail.

1493
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,795
So I read when people
from across the country write to us.

1494
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:44,666
And I open the letters
that come to our house from your families.

1495
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,301
And I open the Christmas cards.

1496
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:47,469
So, thank you so much

1497
01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:51,439
for the gratitude that you've
expressed to our families

1498
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:53,942
and the letters and the cards

1499
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:57,545
because they really do make
a difference to us as well.

1500
01:31:57,545 --> 01:31:59,314
So, thank you.
