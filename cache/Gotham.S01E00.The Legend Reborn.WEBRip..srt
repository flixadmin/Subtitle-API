1
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:04,991
Listen, kid.

2
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,359
You seem like a nice guy,

3
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:08,494
but this is not a city
or a job for nice guys.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,899
"Gotham's" a show very much
about the origin stories

5
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:15,935
of some of the great super
villains of the DC mythology.

6
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:18,071
So you see a young Catwoman,

7
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,605
you see a young Poison Ivy,

8
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:22,643
a young Penguin, Riddler,
possibly the Joker.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,745
You see all of these legendary characters,

10
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:27,545
but you're seeing them
at a point in their lives

11
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,829
which has not really been explored before.

12
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,164
Part of this fun is that

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,165
we don't want to just
regurgitate a comic book.

14
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,599
We need to elevate it.

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,035
We need to make it something
it's never been before

16
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,737
while still staying true to the DNA.

17
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,338
It really pays due homage

18
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,241
to everything anyone knows
about Gotham in the past

19
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,843
and gets crazier and crazier.

20
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,457
The idea for this show

21
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:58,608
came from trying to find a fresh
way into the D.C. mythology,

22
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:00,758
and it seemed like the perfect place

23
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,726
to start was the city of Gotham.

24
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:05,529
What the show looks at
is why a town like that

25
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,297
will eventually need a
vigilante to help them.

26
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,966
What makes a town so crazy,

27
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:12,234
what makes a town so out of control

28
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:14,571
that villains begin to wear costumes?

29
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:17,206
The basic premise of the
series is a "what if?" Really.

30
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:21,077
It's what if James Gordon
was the rookie detective

31
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:24,614
that investigated the death
of Bruce Wayne's parents?

32
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:27,850
And once you make that connection

33
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:29,752
between those two iconic characters,

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,753
the story kind of rolls on from there.

35
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:33,488
So, you meet this young detective

36
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:35,757
who is out to uncover
corruption and do the right thing

37
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:37,059
in a city that doesn't

38
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:38,694
necessarily want you to do the right thing

39
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,128
or need you to do the right thing.

40
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:41,597
When we start the series,

41
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,832
James is more or less
straight out of the military.

42
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,102
Has not been in Gotham in a decade or more.

43
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,604
He left when he was a kid.

44
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:50,839
He's a little bit of a fish out of water.

45
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:53,441
He doesn't exactly know
what's going on in Gotham,

46
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,776
and he's figuring it out moment to moment.

47
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:58,178
Everybody down!

48
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,549
Hold your fire! I got this!

49
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:05,552
He'll make mistakes, he'll
trust the wrong people,

50
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:07,688
follow his heart, and at times

51
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,825
that will lead him into
dangerous situations.

52
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:14,461
As an actor, that's a very
relatable place to start.

53
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:17,297
Ben McKenzie is perfect
for the role of Gordon

54
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:20,767
because he has a kind of
natural integrity and strength...

55
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,669
an old-fashioned set of values

56
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:25,305
that really shines through his performance.

57
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:27,207
Sir, look at me.

58
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:28,575
Not at them, look at me.

59
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:30,544
My name's Jim.

60
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:31,778
Jim Gordon.

61
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:34,481
This is one of the iconic figures

62
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,916
in comic-book law enforcement.

63
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:40,719
It's daunting to play
him, to be honest with you.

64
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,221
It's a little bit scary.

65
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,657
And yet it's thrilling.

66
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,027
In this telling
of the Gotham story,

67
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:49,962
James Gordon is partnered
with Harvey bullock.

68
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,964
Harvey bullock's
a detective in the comics.

69
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,666
He's never been realized in live action,

70
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,801
and donal logue is the first
person to ever play him,

71
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:57,537
and he's absolutely perfect for the role.

72
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:58,971
What the hell are you doing?

73
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,272
We had the drop on him.

74
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,807
Yeah, well, he's dropped, isn't he?

75
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,842
You could've gotten hurt. Rookie mistake.

76
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,844
Somebody takes a cop's gun, you shoot him.

77
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:07,379
That's basic.

78
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:11,083
He's been around Gotham for
just years and years and years,

79
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:13,285
and so, in order to survive in this city

80
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:16,521
he's had to kind of develop
his own brand of morality.

81
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:17,389
Hey!

82
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,457
Huh?

83
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,125
How you doing?

84
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,763
James' relationship with
Harvey bullock is very complex.

85
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:30,068
Harvey's been whittled down to
expect very little of the city.

86
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,770
The case is closed. Forget about it.

87
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,471
Even if the real killers
are still out there?

88
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,240
Yes.

89
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:38,609
This is very perilous
stuff you're messing with.

90
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,813
He's introducing Gordon to Gotham,

91
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,616
and Gotham is nothing like
Gordon's ever seen before.

92
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,350
When I started work on the show

93
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:49,552
and started digging into the origin stories

94
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,854
of these great villains,

95
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,756
one of the things I realized was

96
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:55,992
there really is not a lot
known about the early history.

97
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,461
We've never really seen
where the penguin comes from

98
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,930
or why he does what he does,

99
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:01,732
or the Riddler, or even Catwoman.

100
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,533
Who were the
super villains in this city

101
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:04,935
and how did they become that way?

102
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,436
Maybe they were just like me and you.

103
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,471
Why on earth would that real person

104
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,306
turn into this crazy psychopath?

105
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,775
These quintessential characters

106
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,143
that we've all grown up with,

107
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,778
you finally get to see and understand

108
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:17,847
how they ended up where they ended up.

109
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,782
Anyone ever tell you when you walk,

110
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,483
you look just like a penguin?

111
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:23,018
No. Nobody's ever told me that.

112
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:25,020
I love origin stories.

113
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:26,889
I love origin stories.

114
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:30,659
Being able to see how
these wonderful characters

115
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,561
that we've all grown up with started

116
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,797
is so interesting and so much fun.

117
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:36,397
Boy?

118
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:38,867
Sorry.

119
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,469
If you let this hair
go frizzy, you will be.

120
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:43,204
The great thing about
Jada Pinkett's character,

121
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:44,572
Fish Mooney,

122
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,440
is that it's created
completely for this show.

123
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,276
It's a brand-new character.

124
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:50,645
Fish Mooney is an up and comer

125
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:53,781
in the criminal world of Gotham,

126
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:57,285
and she has a mind to take over Gotham,

127
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,387
so we'll see how that goes.

128
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:03,491
There used to be some discipline.

129
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:06,093
Falcone is getting old and soft.

130
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,995
It's time.

131
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:10,498
Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.

132
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:14,168
She has a kind of ferocity
that's natural to her...

133
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:18,472
a sharpness and an intelligence
and a way of looking at people

134
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,275
that is both seductive and devouring.

135
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:23,677
You don't get a lot of opportunity

136
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:26,613
to have a playground for your shadow.

137
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:29,549
That is what makes this character so fun.

138
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:30,717
Harvey.

139
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:31,718
Fish.

140
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,687
Jada Pinkett Smith is creating

141
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:35,022
a brand-new character

142
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:37,057
in this beautifully nuanced

143
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,659
and complicated and sexy and dark way.

144
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:40,894
Who's the friend?

145
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:42,562
Detective James Gordon, ma'am.

146
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,130
Hmm.

147
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:46,366
Well, aren't you a cool glass of milk?

148
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:49,235
The first time that
fish meets James Gordon,

149
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:51,304
she knows right away he's a problem,

150
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:54,374
and so there's this
very interesting tension

151
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:56,008
between the two of them.

152
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:58,645
You have a little danger in your eye.

153
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:00,714
I wonder what you plan to do with that.

154
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,148
You'll have to wait and see.

155
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,850
I hate surprises.

156
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,387
From episode to episode,

157
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:08,888
we'll be introducing characters

158
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,956
that are sort of legends in this universe,

159
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:12,858
so you really have to tune in each week

160
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,526
to watch who's gonna show up next.

161
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:15,961
We might meet a character

162
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:17,996
who we think is the nicest
character in the world,

163
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,931
and they turn out to be the worst villain

164
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,500
in all of Gotham city or vice versa.

165
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:22,968
You know, we might meet somebody

166
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:24,570
that's completely corrupted,
and by the end of this,

167
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,071
but they're one of the most heroic people,

168
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,239
and you can never tell in Gotham.

169
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:28,640
It changes people.

170
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:40,105
The acting was
fine, the music was lovely.

171
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,907
I agree with that. It was kinda lame.

172
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,542
There's no such word as "kinda."

173
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:44,676
It was totally lame.

174
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:46,311
You two are so judgment...

175
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:47,446
give me your money!

176
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:48,847
Stay calm, Bruce.

177
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:58,056
I think one of the things

178
00:06:58,123 --> 00:06:59,791
that's interesting about "Gotham"

179
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:02,393
is you're taking the same
scene that you've seen before

180
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:05,096
that starts off the movies
with the murder of the waynes,

181
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:08,265
but instead of jumping forward
to when Bruce is now a man,

182
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,534
and he takes on the cape and the mask,

183
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,502
instead, you stay in the present.

184
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,871
It begins with the
murder of Bruce Wayne's parents,

185
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,473
finding these bodies in an alley,

186
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,541
and then saying, "where
do we go from here?"

187
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,377
The ramifications are deep and wide.

188
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,612
It's interesting
to watch a young Bruce

189
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,747
and a young Jim Gordon connect so early on.

190
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,984
It's something we've
never really seen before,

191
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:29,052
and that will be explored in "Gotham."

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,654
I promise you, I will
find the man who did this.

193
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,690
He's also making a promise to himself.

194
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,592
"I will navigate my way through this

195
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,894
and I will do it honorably
and with dignity."

196
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,229
I think audiences always seem to gravitate

197
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,632
towards characters with
incredible integrity.

198
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,369
One of the most interesting
things about James Gordon

199
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:49,772
is really in his
relationship with Bruce Wayne.

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,408
The cool thing about the show
is it's all the psychology

201
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:54,243
that goes on behind Bruce Wayne's mind

202
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:55,945
to become this awesome character,

203
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,747
to become this vigilante
that fights crime for Gotham.

204
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,582
Why were you up on the roof?

205
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,051
I'm learning to conquer fear.

206
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,685
Fear doesn't need conquering.

207
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,054
Fear tells you where the edge is.

208
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:06,588
Fear is a good thing.

209
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,224
And you think I haven't
told him that, do you?

210
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,960
Bruce Wayne's relationship
with Alfred is very unique.

211
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,929
Even though Alfred is his subordinate,

212
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:17,599
he has to help guide him
into manhood carefully

213
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,101
because he does work for him,

214
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,103
and not only that, but he
has such respect for him.

215
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:25,040
It's really a story of a young boy

216
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,642
willing himself to become a superhero.

217
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,776
How does he do that?

218
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:30,645
He's not really sure why he's doing that,

219
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,080
but he is compelled to do it.

220
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:34,516
I'm going to find out who
killed your parents, and why.

221
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,184
I'm glad he's still alive.

222
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:37,652
I want to see him again.

223
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,288
When we begin the series,
Gotham city is struggling.

224
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,157
It's in the midst of a crime wave.

225
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:43,624
It's battling corruption.

226
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,794
The Waynes were very important
people in Gotham city,

227
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,995
so their death creates a power vacuum

228
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:51,031
that is filled by various people

229
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:54,535
with rather less philanthropic
notions of how to run Gotham.

230
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,303
With the murder of the Waynes,

231
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,837
they were like the mama, papa bear

232
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,139
that kept everything together,

233
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:01,075
and now Gotham is in danger

234
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:04,578
of falling into this abyss
of pure chaotic anarchy.

235
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,980
Citizens of Gotham, we will not,

236
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,749
we cannot let these
killers and these robbers

237
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,018
and these rapists and these thugs win.

238
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,252
Not on my watch.

239
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,955
There's a lot of tension throughout Gotham.

240
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:18,324
You've got tension between the
Falcone family and the maronis.

241
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,160
You got tension between
fish Mooney and the cops.

242
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,863
You've got tension between
the Major Crimes Unit

243
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,332
and the Homicide Division
in the Gotham P.D.

244
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,734
Well, well, well,

245
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:30,704
if it isn't Montoya and
Allen, Major Crimes Unit.

246
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:31,805
Any leads?

247
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,438
Just getting started.

248
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,673
I'll be straight.

249
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,475
You want us to take it off your hands?

250
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,644
Come on, bullock. You know
you're scared of this case.

251
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,646
There's tension kind of all across the city

252
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,615
and between every
character that's involved.

253
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,750
Gotham is on a knife edge.

254
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,252
What do you suppose bringing down city hall

255
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,055
and the police force will
do, even if you could?

256
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,858
The Falcone
crime family runs the city.

257
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,994
They have relationships with everyone

258
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,429
from law enforcement to the judicial branch

259
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,865
to the mayor's office and all the way down.

260
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,001
It's a world in which
everyone is on the take,

261
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:06,971
and the only man who can kind
of break that downward spiral

262
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,041
is the last good man
in Gotham, James Gordon.

263
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,777
I made a promise to Bruce
Wayne, and I can't deliver.

264
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,812
But you will. Maybe I'm out of my depth.

265
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,449
Hey.

266
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,452
I very much doubt you're out of your depth.

267
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,521
James and Barbara have a natural

268
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,089
sort of emotional and sexual chemistry.

269
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,559
Seemingly everything is
going very, very well.

270
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,761
She's a beautiful woman
with a lot of means.

271
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,329
Her father is very wealthy.

272
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,898
He's one of the members
of Gotham high society.

273
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,034
But Barbara's hiding things from James,

274
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,969
including secrets about her past.

275
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:42,139
James Gordon is not a good
guy. You deserve better.

276
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:45,342
James Gordon is the most
honest man I've ever met.

277
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,110
You sure you know what he's capable of?

278
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,479
Yes, thank you. I know him.

279
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,982
Does he know you like I know you?

280
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,485
Their relationship gets
compromised very quickly

281
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,087
when Renee Montoya accuses
James of being corrupt

282
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,222
and creates a rift in their relationship

283
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,692
that will only widen as
the series goes forward.

284
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,727
B., I know when you're lying.

285
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,295
Gotham is a corrupt place.

286
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,764
It's a place where you can't trust anyone.

287
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,132
You can't trust the mayor,

288
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,901
you can't trust the police force.

289
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,769
Gotham law enforcement

290
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:16,173
is pretty much under the thumb
of the underworld right now,

291
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,110
which is basically run by
Falcone at this point in time.

292
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:24,380
That might change. I'm working hard at it.

293
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,516
There is a split in the underworld

294
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:30,052
between the Maroni family
and the Falcone family,

295
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,655
so a character like Penguin, for instance,

296
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:35,891
is able to come in and play
both sides against each other.

297
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,594
Why snitch on your own boss?

298
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:39,748
I confess that...

299
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:42,428
that poor orphan boy pricked my conscience.

300
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,154
I've done my civic duty.

301
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:46,522
Good day to you both.

302
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,293
Oswald starts off as a
grunt for Fish Mooney,

303
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:53,896
and when Bruce Wayne's
parents are murdered,

304
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,833
he sees that as an
opportunity to make his move,

305
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:01,437
to finally become someone
of power and of status.

306
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,906
He's learned to play good people

307
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,743
off of bad people off of good people.

308
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,943
It's fascinating.

309
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:10,479
It was Gilzean. He's the snitch.

310
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,282
No.

311
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:15,684
Gilzean is loyal. So am I.

312
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,620
I would open a vein right here
and now if you asked me to.

313
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,656
Go on, then.

314
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,257
Open one.

315
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,059
I think Robin lord
Taylor's portrayal of Penguin

316
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,362
is going to be a real revelation to people

317
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,298
because what he's doing is not

318
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:32,367
just playing sort of a
villainous, evil mastermind,

319
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,202
but he's sort of sympathetic.

320
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,737
He's sort of likeable in his sad, pathetic,

321
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,106
sort of henchman way.

322
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,875
Falcone is losing his grip,
and his rivals are hungry.

323
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:42,677
I-I can see it coming.

324
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:45,313
I'm clever that way, and I can help you.

325
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,714
Shut up!

326
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,649
I think that these characters

327
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,319
explore different aspects of humanity.

328
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:53,387
You have the Gordon character

329
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:56,457
who is, you know, I
call him the white night.

330
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,092
And then you have Bullock,

331
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,195
who's kind of walking that line,

332
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:03,263
that gray area of what is
right and what is wrong.

333
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:07,535
And then you just have your just
straight out psychotic villains

334
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:09,303
like myself and Penguin.

335
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:21,049
Gotham in this series is more vibrant

336
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:22,417
and crowded and archaic

337
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,219
than people will be expecting

338
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,855
if they're used to the
Gotham of the movies.

339
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:29,523
We talked about
a city out of control,

340
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,626
and our fantasy of 1970s New York

341
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:34,061
in the films of Sidney
Lumet and William Friedkin...

342
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,097
graffiti everywhere, cops
everywhere, corruption.

343
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:40,000
New York in the '70s just
kept getting worse and worse

344
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,469
and crazier and crazier.

345
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:44,071
That's the Gotham that
we're looking at today.

346
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:46,039
We're not saying that the show

347
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,675
takes place at any particular time.

348
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,877
We're trying to make it sort
of a little bit timeless.

349
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:51,411
You sort of see these cars,

350
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,613
and you imagine a chase
scene from "Bullitt"

351
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,149
or from "French connection."

352
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:57,151
And yet, at the same
time, it's present day.

353
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:58,652
You know, there are cellphones.

354
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,988
It's of our world, but
it's still beyond our world.

355
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:03,824
The audience has
an image of Gotham already,

356
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,859
so we want to make them feel at home,

357
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:08,128
but we also want to take a fresh approach.

358
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:09,496
We do a lot of research.

359
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:10,963
We look at the comic books,

360
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,399
we look at films together.

361
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:13,667
Things like "Blade Runner,"

362
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,302
some of the classic film noir stuff,

363
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,837
just because they're beautifully
designed and they're dark.

364
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,072
And out of that come my sketches,

365
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,240
my models,

366
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,276
and eventually my working drawings

367
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:26,379
that get developed into
actual sets or locations

368
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:27,513
that we choose

369
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,848
because they fit within the framework

370
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,384
of that world that
we're now, at that point,

371
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:34,052
describing to each other.

372
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,488
I think what I'm most
excited for viewers to see

373
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,923
is the police precinct set.

374
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,325
It's very rich and layered,

375
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:41,259
and I think that's a very exciting set.

376
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:42,994
It's sometimes a long road

377
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:45,531
from initial conception to completion.

378
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:48,032
That happened today with our main set...

379
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,367
the precinct set.

380
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:52,069
We started on that about 10 weeks ago,

381
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:54,571
and here today, the lights come on

382
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,474
and the smoke rolls in and it looks great.

383
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:00,176
The biggest challenge is
really the amount of work to do

384
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:01,445
in the time we're given.

385
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:02,679
It's a two-story set.

386
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:04,381
There's a lot of rigging involved

387
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,915
when you get above one story,

388
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,184
so there's a little more
engineering going on.

389
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:09,886
We're also shooting on rooftops.

390
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:13,122
That is a certain amount of
engineering and safety involved,

391
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,423
as well as the look.

392
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:17,259
Gotham, to a degree, really is New York,

393
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,896
and New York is Gotham, so
we had to shoot in New York.

394
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:22,431
And the energy of the city,

395
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:24,633
I think it's feeding into the production.

396
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,869
I think it's feeding into our show.

397
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:28,738
The scenes play out very gritty

398
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:30,539
and very real on the rooftops.

399
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:32,007
Stop!

400
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:34,609
I can't imagine shooting
the show anywhere else.

401
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:36,745
The vibrancy of New York City street life

402
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,413
infuses everything that we do,

403
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,182
and you really feel it when
you're out on the streets.

404
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,886
I think the alley fight is gonna
be one of my favorites on this.

405
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:45,887
Ben did a great job.

406
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:47,422
He picks things up really quick.

407
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,956
He's a great athlete,

408
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:51,192
and I'm just looking forward
to seeing the final product.

409
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,660
Now, it may be 20 degrees

410
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:54,562
and it may be raining and sleeting,

411
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,265
and wind may be almost
literally knocking you over,

412
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,367
but that's the kind
of in-your-face world

413
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,868
that we're portraying onscreen,

414
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:03,037
so we want to take
advantage of New York City

415
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:04,538
and everything it has to offer,

416
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:05,873
and then we want to enjoy

417
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,909
being inside a
temperature-controlled studio,

418
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,310
as well.

419
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:13,047
Danny Cannon loves to
shoot as much as possible,

420
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,748
as we call it, in camera.

421
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:16,984
It's for real, so visual effects

422
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:20,153
we're using to extend
the world that we create.

423
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,155
Visual effects
should always be invisible.

424
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:23,557
Emotionally, they take a lot away

425
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,592
because people know what
they're watching isn't real.

426
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,595
One of the things I insisted on
at the beginning of this project

427
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,431
was to do our own helicopter shoot

428
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,499
so that we could create the city of Gotham

429
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,535
from something that I shot specifically.

430
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,537
Visual effects then really helped me

431
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,003
by putting foreground in

432
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:40,740
so it looked like I was
coming in between things.

433
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,975
We don't want it to
look like New York City,

434
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,377
so what we're doing is
we're taking those aerials

435
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:48,080
and we're adding elements to
make it feel like it's Gotham,

436
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,515
so we're adding Gothic spires,

437
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,216
some art deco buildings,

438
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:52,718
and we're adding a great
deal of atmosphere to them.

439
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,656
The pilot episode opens

440
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:59,724
with a young girl on the rooftop

441
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:03,028
of a building in downtown Gotham.

442
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,864
We built parts of that roof... gargoyles,

443
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:09,768
things that are fantasy...
that probably wouldn't be there.

444
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:12,604
It would be extended by visual effects

445
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:15,174
to create the rest of Gotham around it.

446
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:17,443
A common misperception among people

447
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,045
is that special effects is visual effects.

448
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:22,881
Visual effects is anything
you treat visually.

449
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,584
Special effects is anything
that's done on set practically.

450
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:29,621
Some of the effects we have
every day are some rain effects,

451
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:32,457
a lot of smoke and
atmosphere and some gunfire,

452
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:35,293
some gun squibs, hits, sparks, water.

453
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:39,197
We actually had a barge on the water

454
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:41,932
with a little mini bag
to catch the stunt double,

455
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,067
and then now we're gonna be over here

456
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:45,703
doing that underwater scene.

457
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,206
I have to match the
color of the river water,

458
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,876
so I'm getting crystal
clear pool water delivered,

459
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:55,078
and I have to make this clear water murky,

460
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:56,647
but not too murky.

461
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,382
They set up the tank,
we set up our green screen,

462
00:17:58,449 --> 00:17:59,683
and it looks great.

463
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:00,950
We've got some temp versions of it already,

464
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:01,885
and it worked really well.

465
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:05,989
C.G. and special effects are used

466
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,258
just to help us tell the story.

467
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:10,027
We're shooting in New York,

468
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,829
so we have the beauty
and grandeur of New York

469
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,864
as an integral part of the show,

470
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:17,334
and we just turn that notch up to 11.

471
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:20,003
It doesn't look like
we're just in another city.

472
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,204
It feels like Gotham.

473
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:22,872
There's a slight twist to it all.

474
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,507
The reality's, like, heightened.

475
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:26,042
There's a timelessness to it

476
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,444
that Bruno and Danny created
that's really magical.

477
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,241
The great thing about Gotham

478
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,077
is it encompasses so many different worlds.

479
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:42,246
So the tone is both fun and dark.

480
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:43,813
It's sexy but dangerous.

481
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:45,415
It's brutal but sensual.

482
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:48,385
It's a world of craziness
and a world of beauty,

483
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,888
and the show encapsulates all of that.

484
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:54,992
Gotham has always been a city
with the dial turned up to 11.

485
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:56,893
Every city's got its dark side.

486
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,194
That's what Gotham is,

487
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,729
and we're gonna explore it

488
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:02,198
through the eyes of detective Jim Gordon,

489
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,368
who becomes a legend in the
Gotham city police department.

490
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,303
But this is when he just starts out,

491
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:08,872
before he realizes the nature

492
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,374
and the weight of the
adversary he's up against.

493
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,612
Watching Gotham just tip
ever so slightly over the edge

494
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,614
into absolute chaos will be
a really fascinating journey.

495
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,915
You've killed people before.

496
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:21,417
That was war.

497
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:23,051
This is war! We're at war!

498
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,353
Sometimes in war, you got to do
a bad thing to do good, right?

499
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:27,989
The series is
gonna mix the elements

500
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:29,458
of a police procedural

501
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:31,827
with a much more serialized narrative

502
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:34,563
about the creation of
the great DC villains.

503
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,331
It's not just about the cops,

504
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,900
it's not just about Jim Gordon,

505
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,534
but about the madness that springs

506
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,002
from this horrible crime.

507
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,371
People are starting to
lose faith in law and order.

508
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,740
Criminals are starting to run the streets.

509
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,609
The craziness and the kind
of theatrical projection

510
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:50,611
that villains have in the DC world

511
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,880
are just starting to show their faces.

512
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:56,217
I love the mythology of characters,

513
00:19:56,285 --> 00:20:00,922
and so, to be able to see
how Penguin and the Riddler

514
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:03,891
and all these characters got their start

515
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,726
is just really exciting.

516
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:08,162
We're trying to find the balance

517
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:12,032
between the fantastic
world of the comic books

518
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,470
along with the actual real human pathos.

519
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:18,339
However dark and scary the
world might be right now,

520
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:20,140
there will be light.

521
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,043
As you continue to peel back the layers,

522
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:25,279
there's so much mystery there.

523
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:27,914
You can never be sure who's
a friend and who's an enemy.

524
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,217
There's romance, there's action,

525
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:32,987
there's kind of battle
between good and evil.

526
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:34,455
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

527
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,159
It's not a comic-book
world. It's a mythic world.

528
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:40,494
It's a dramatic world

529
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,863
full of adventure and
sex and violence and fun.

530
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,398
How you doing?

531
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:45,764
I been better.

532
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,702
There's a war coming... a terrible war.

533
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:51,270
There... there will be chaos.

534
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,373
Rivers of blood in the streets.

535
00:20:54,434 --> 00:21:02,262
