Marie Laveau.

Cheers, love, you saved me
the trouble of finding you.

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,671
It was a little bit theatrical
to be honest with you,

171

This medallion honors Saint Marron,

This thing that's after me,

it's no ordinary demon.

187
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,478
This medallion has been in my family
for generations.

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,557
It's imbued with a protection spell.

189
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,476
Take it, Johnny.

190

As long as you promise to leave town.

191

My great-great-grandson,

he must have loved you

Gideon, we can't find John
and he's not on comms.

Mr. Constantine has refused
to wear his communications device.

Just go ahead and curse me,
'cause I bloody deserve it.

Why would I curse the man
who could save the last of my line?

You don't understand, Des is gone.

Now, to our business.

I've sensed a spirit. A Dybbuk.

And like you, from another time.

What's a Dybbuk?

240
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,272
It's a dislocated soul
of a dead person.

Someone so wicked that their spirit
never crossed over.

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,599
All right, Charlie-O.

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,070
Good luck.

318
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,877
- John? As I live and breathe.
- Amaya.

319
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,074
- Nice barnet, love.
- Thanks.

320
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,991
Last I heard, you were in Zambesi.
Where's Nate and the rest of the crew?

321
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,877
Nate, my boyfriend, and my crazy gang
of best friends.

322
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,558
- Oh, it is such a long story.
- Right

323
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
But a really good one.
How about I tell you all about it

324
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,154
- over a glass of Chardonnay?
- Chardonnay.

325
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,631
- Barkeep...
- No, no, not here.

326
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,396
I know a better place.

327
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,915
All right, well, you owe me dinner.

328
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,151
- That is a fair price.
- All right, got it.

329
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Order up!

330
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,870
[door opens]

331
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,712
Hey, Mona!
How's life like in the Time Bureau?

332
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,632
Settling in? Dating anyone?

333
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,233
Good. Great. Yes, I mean,

334
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,229
there is someone.

335
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,630
Lay it on Nate.

336
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,519
I think it might be inappropriate
'cause I work here.

337
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,673
And he's here, too.

338
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,830
Wow!

339
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,036
Exactly.

340
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,555
I think I know who you're talking
about and trust me,

341
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,720
he has a crush on you, too.

342
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,871
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.

343
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,550
I swear, I was just imagining it.

344
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,395
We don't even, like, speak
the same language.

345
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,077
Well, he does have a unique way
of expressing himself.

346
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,432
I'm afraid people would think
it was weird. I mean, that hair...

347
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,520
Maybe he just needs
the right product.

348
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,920
What about the man meat?

349
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,317
Um, what about it?

350
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,954
I think he's, you know,

351
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,236
had some.

352
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,992
It wouldn't surprise me. I mean,
it's 2018. I don't judge.

353
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,193
I should probably forget about it.

354
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,033
No. <i>Carpe datum.</i>

355
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,033
- What have you got to lose?
- My job.

356
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,835
I will make sure you're not fired
for following your heart.

357
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,837
Okay. I'll do it.

358
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,273
I'm gonna let him know
how I feel. [laughs]

359
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,176
[Sara] One thing I learned
from the Chucky movies

360
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,795
is the doll always comes back.

361
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,520
Gideon, how's the timeline?

362
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,071
History is on track and Marie Laveau
lived a long and celebrated life,

363
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,834
inspiring an Emmy-nominated portrayal
by Angela Bassett.

364
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,149
See, Rory killed the Dybbuk.

365
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,560
Which is unfortunate because
now I have to explain to Mr. Heywood

366
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,479
why I'm bringing him a seared doll
instead of a magical creature.

367
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,876
Well, at least we get to find out
why they call it the Big Easy.

368
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,400
Did you happen to notice
that Rory robbed that party blind?

369
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,880
- I believe it.
- I don't understand

370
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,553
why you enable his bad behavior.

371
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,160
At the Bureau, we would fire
people for lesser offenses.

372
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,031
At the Bureau, you don't have to eat,
drink and sleep with your team.

373
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,272
Point taken. It's just that this is
supposed to be a professional

374
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,875
- operation, babe.
- Look, deep down, Rory's a good guy.

375
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,471
- And honestly, a friend.
- I get it.

376
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,271
- You run your team, I'll run mine.
- Thank you.

377
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,397
Speaking of, I should get back
to the Bureau.

378
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,756
How about you stay for dinner?

379
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,676
I could use a shower.

380
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,630
[scoffs softly]

381
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,640
It's not like that thing's
going anywhere.

382
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,190
[grunts]

383
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,556
So, when are these changes to history
going to set in?

384
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,080
'Cause now I've got some big plans.

385
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,719
I'm actually thinking of Vegas first.

386
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,550
Time takes a moment to cement,
or so I'm told enough by Sara.

387
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,230
But, don't worry, love, we'll have
you shapeshifting again in no time.

388
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,759
John-O, you all good?

389
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,576
We stopped me from meeting Des
tonight, but now, I meet him

390
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,910
a few days later instead.
We have to go back.

391
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,096
[Gideon] I'm afraid
returning to New Orleans

392
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,474
is impossible, Mr. Constantine.

393
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,755
And why is that?

394
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,472
<i>Because I know
you two are up to something.</i>

395
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,391
<i>And as much as I hate babysitting,
I hate being played even more.</i>

396
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
<i>Gideon, bring them back
to the</i> Waverider.

397
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,677
<i>They have some serious explaining
to do.</i>

398
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,236
[sighs]

399
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
There's one thing
you need to understand,

400
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,469
is that I don't go in for all
that love crap.

401
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,155
Romance is for little girls,
crying into their pillows,

402
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,596
not for a devious tosser like me
who knows the score.

403
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,071
Then six months ago, I met him.

404
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Desmond.

405
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,594
Our first night was like
a second liner marched

406
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,479
into my useless heart and breathed
some life into it again.

407
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,954
Desmond knew who I was,
exactly what I had done,

408
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,760
and he didn't care. So I was all-in,
rented an apartment.

409
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
And then, this demon shows up.

410
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,916
Neron.

411
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,797
Wanted me to help him usurp
the triumvirate ruling hell.

412
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,976
Well, he must have had something
on you to expect that.

413
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,480
The deed to my soul.

414
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,430
When I die, the bastard owns me.

415
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,676
And he's already worked out lots
of excruciating torments

416
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,479
for yours truly in the inferno.

417
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,997
So, naturally,
I told Neron to piss off.

418
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Naturally.

419
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,235
I begged Des to run.

420
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,072
I knew that Neron would use him
against me.

421
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,510
Johnny!

422
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,197
[screaming]

423
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,714
The bloody fool didn't listen.

424
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,076
Till Neron dragged Des to hell
because of me.

425
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,920
I didn't think there was a way
I could save him.

426
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,272
That's the thing about
time travel, right?

427
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,750
There's always a way.

428
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,680
[scoffs]

429
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,355
I joined the Legends thinking I could
outrun my guilt,

430
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,233
but being back in New Orleans,
I realized,

431
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,798
I was just taking
the coward's way out.

432
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,000
So I had to save him.

433
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,071
So now that you know
what we were up to,

434
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,958
do you mind explaining
why it didn't work?

435
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,839
[Zari] Some points in history are fixed.

436
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,356
Maybe John and Desmond
were supposed to meet.

437
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,230
Look, I'm sorry,

438
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,279
I'm going to do everything I can
to find a loophole to save Desmond

439
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,589
and keep history intact.

440
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
You do that, love.

00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,195
Still, you're hardly the kind of guy
to open up,

475
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,120
unless, of course, you were stalling.

476
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,550
Well, you see,

477
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,391
magic has rules just like time travel

478
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,194
and I just so happen to write
the book on breaking them.

479
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,190
So if meeting Desmond
is a fixed point in time,

480
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,954
then I need to go back to
after I met him, stop him

481
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,595
from falling for me.
That's how I save Desmond's life.

482
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,400
History be bloody damned.

483
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,515
[scoffs]

484
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,472
[chuckles]

485
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,790
[exclaims] You went all out.

486
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,311
- The hell is he doing here?
- Leaving.

487
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,555
Wait, wait, both of you.

488
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,713
Please, look.

489
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,913
I roasted a roast.

490
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,656
[Gideon]
Technically, Captain, I fabricated...

491
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,796
Shut up, Gideon.

492
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,679
Ava.

493
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,032
You are my love.

494
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,599
And, Mick, you are my family.

495
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,473
And it would mean the world to me

496
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,758
if both of you would try
to get along.

497
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,070
Please.

498
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,673
So, I was thinking

499
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,756
maybe you two
could find some common ground.

500
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,629
- [laughs]
- For example, Ava, you love to read.

501
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,195
Mick, here, is an author.

502
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,834
Oh, that's something.

503
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,433
I would be shocked if his novel
wasn't sexist and derivative.

504
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,876
It is.

505
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,354
Okay. Well, Mick, you love to eat.

506
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,230
Ava is a fantastic baker,
she makes one mean snickerdoodle.

507
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,159
Fancy sugar cookies.

508
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,336
Snickerdoodles are actually
completely different.

509
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,760
It's a cream of tartar base, but...

510
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,876
Garbage cookies.

511
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,840
That's rich, coming from a man who's
so lacking in personal hygiene

512
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,833
that he had to resort to sleeping
with a three-breasted alien sex toy.

513
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,236
Well, at least, Garima isn't a clone.

514
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,560
Only I get to use the C word.

515
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,719
Too far, Mick, too far. [sighs]

516
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,232
Why do you get to have
a fake girlfriend and I don't?

517
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,756
- Clone.
- Dick.

518
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,916
Hey.

519
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,998
- Any luck?
- I'm sorry, John,

520
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,317
sometimes with history
if you change one thing

521
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,312
it creates a whole domino effect.

522
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,392
- It's all right.
- Listen, I...

523
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,191
I get being tempted
to save someone you love.

524
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,354
The anger and frustration, it's...

525
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,630
John?

526
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,190
Yeah?

527
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,760
- Turn around.
- I'd rather not. [clears throat]

528
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,274
[gasping]

529
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,874
That is the last time I try that.

530
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,669
I thought you couldn't...

531
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,549
You know what, it doesn't matter.
Where is John?

532
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,176
The last time we did something
like this, we almost destroyed

533
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,237
- the entire world.
- All right. Okay. Enough.

534
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,034
How are you planning to find John?

535
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,795
Well, his tracker...
Which you told him about.

536
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,914
Yeah. Ol' John-O's changing
history commando.

537
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,595
You know, I understand why John's
being so colossally stupid,

538
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,194
but what's your excuse?

539
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,236
I'm dying.

540
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,635
What?

541
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,833
Look, every time that I shapeshift,
it's like I'm born all over again.

542
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,155
But stuck in this body
for the first time in centuries,

543
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,278
I'm getting older.
But if John saves Desmond,

544
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,680
then he never joins the Legends.

545
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,595
And I'm immortal again.

546
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,038
Let me get this straight,
you helped John risk a catastrophic

547
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,511
rupture to history,
because you're afraid of aging?

548
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,472
Okay, maybe John succeeds and you
go on your immortal merry way,

549
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,756
but if he fails,
I will personally make sure

550
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,431
you spend the rest of your short,
dreary human life

551
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,196
in the deepest, darkest prison cell
the Bureau has to offer.

552
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,031
- [alarm beeping]
- [roaring]

553
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,996
[growling]

554
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,556
Let's move.

555
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,073
- [roars]
- [door beeps]

556
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,630
Look, I'm sorry, this is my fault,

557
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,473
I shouldn't have forced it
on you and Mick.

558
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,840
He was just stating a fact, you know,
I am a clone.

559
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,876
Oh, it's okay. [sniffles]

560
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,320
Sometimes I just wish I could
be more like you and the Legends.

561
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,760
You know? Loosen up.

562
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,240
When did that happen?

563
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,030
What?

564
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,554
Oh, no, I'll get a broom.

565
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Ava, wait.

566
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,640
[Agent Sharpe]
Are those tiny little footprints?

567
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,120
The Dybbuk is alive.

568
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,429
[trimmer whirring]

569
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,676
[Ray exclaims]

570
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,720
Okay, we shouldn't split up.
Classic horror movie mistake.

571
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,519
Well, we're not exactly helpless.

572
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,673
Fine, I'll go fix Gideon.

573
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,599
And I'm gonna go catch
a serial killer.

574
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,751
You are way too excited about this.

575
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,230
[blues music playing]

576
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,233
[notification chiming]

577
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,474
What the hell?

578
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,560
[cell phone ringing]

579
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,429
[Zari] <i>John.</i>

580
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,360
How the bloody hell did you find me?

581
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,840
John, you have to stop this.

582
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,635
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell,
and you don't join the Legends,

583
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,896
the effects could be cataclysmic.

584
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,912
Neron didn't drag Des to hell.

585
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,836
<i>I did.</i>

586
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,896
- What do you mean?
- When I told Des to run,

587
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,435
he went behind my back,
made a deal to protect me.

588
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,799
In exchange for sparing my life,
Des had to bind his soul to Neron's.

589
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,914
I couldn't send Neron to hell
without sending Des down with him.

590
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,116
Johnny?

591
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,550
Johnny!

592
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,518

[panting]

596
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,959
I killed the man I loved,
and for what,

597
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,872
to buy New Orleans
a little more time.

598
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,679
Neron needs souls to take over hell,

599
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,309
and mark my words, he's coming back
to Earth to get them.

600
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,509
John, we can help you.

601
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,195
Yes, spare the team bit, all right?
I work alone.

602
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,120
- [Desmond] You back already?
- Yeah.

603
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,796
Des, I'm back already.

604
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,236
Hey, Johnny.

605
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,550
Hey, Des.

606
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,958
I'm gonna get some clothes on.

The Dybbuk must have found
another vessel.

610
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,760
Is there another doll
on the ship somewhere, Rory?

611
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,870
What the hell was that?

612
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,116
Block the exit.

613
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,840
Okay, so whatever it is, it has tiny
little feet, so it's not that big.

[groans]

it's not size that matters,

00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,638
it's how you use it.

- Where are you taking him?
- You.

I am the Assistant Coordinator
of Creature Upkeep.

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,280
[roaring]

636
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,720
Konane, no!

637
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,429
[groans]

638
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
[man] No!

639
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,154
[man screaming]

640
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,990
You have to go.

641
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,509
They'll kill you.

642
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,434
[wheezing]

643
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
[grunts]

644
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,957
- You okay?
- Mike's up there.

645
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,715
- Mike the Spike?
- And he's found a new vessel.

646
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,917
- Much, much worse.
- Hold on.

647
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,793
[system powering on]

648
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,037
What could be worse than a creepy
antebellum doll?

649
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,151
[Mike laughing evilly]

650
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,720
Where are the eggs? I thought
you said you were gonna cook?

651
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,235
Yeah, I changed my mind.

652
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,920
I'll finish getting dressed,
then we can go out to eat.

653
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,837
You know,
it's not about the breakfast, Des.

654
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,115
Hmm.

655
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,396
Okay. I see what you're doing.

656
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,278
You know what
your problem is, Johnny?

657
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,713
You don't think
you deserve to be happy.

658
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,474
Des, your feelings for me
are a bloody lie, all right?

659
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,552
See, I just wanted to get you
into my bed.

660
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,232
But I couldn't be bothered
to put the work in

661
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,713
so I used a love spell on you.

662
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Is this a joke?

663
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,430
Afraid not, mate.

664
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,151
Hey, I really care about you.

665
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,960
If there's something going on
in your life, just be honest with me.

666
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,032
Yeah, do you know what,
this thing between us,

667
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,271
it isn't real, it never was,
it doesn't exist.

668
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,354
[sighs]

669
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,995
I put myself out there like this,
and you're playing games?

670
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
You should go.

671
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,119
Yeah, you're right. I should.

672
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,076
But this...

673
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,240
This thing between us,

674
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,158
this was real, Johnny.

675
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,555
[door closes]

676
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,199
[sighs]

677
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,155
Sara, do you read me?
John's done something awful.

678
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,795
He hasn't done anything yet.
I'm still stuck in this form.

679
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,590
- [rumbling]
- Uh...

680
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,510
What's that?

681
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,515
[gasping]

682
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,279
[Mike laughing evilly]

683
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,915
Guys, guys, guys,
I have a real emergency here.

684
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,714
[laughs evilly]

685
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Marty!

686
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,315
[groaning]

687
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,555
[laughs evilly] Die, you putz.

688
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,510
I hate puppets!

689
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,110
Suck my...

690
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,755
[Charlie] At last...

691
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,514
[sighs]

692
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,234
Oi, Z, check this out.

693
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
I got my powers back.

694
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,959
Don't be mad, I'm myself again.

695
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,992
Whoa! [laughs]

696
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,197
[meows]

697
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,710
Where's Zari?

698
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,190
Zari?

699
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Oh, blimey!
