1
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,286
Supermoon events occur
when the full moon

2
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,038
is at its closest orbit
to the Earth,

3
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,957
roughly 223,000 miles away.

4
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,628
This can happen
multiple times a year, but...

5
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,214
...last year was different.

6
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,510
I'm speaking
with Dr. James Aranda.

7
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,055
So tell me, Doctor, why hasn't
this happened before?

8
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,015
Why now?
Is it genetically modified food

9
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,352
-or a weaponized virus?
-All right, let's just, uh...

10
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,897
Let's focus on what we do know.

11
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,442
No one, and I mean no one

12
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,362
should be exposed to moonlight
tonight. That's number one.

13
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,698
Number two is fear.

14
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,160
Fear makes bad decisions.

15
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,080
Have a plan,

16
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,373
stick to it,

17
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,166
and stay safe.

18
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,752
Number three, number three...

19
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,712
Everyone should know
that we are working

20
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,632
around the clock
to find a solution.

21
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,969
We will survive this.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,282
We got you your favorite, Sean.

23
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,409
Chocolate cupcake.

24
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,164
We know you loved these
on your birthday.

25
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,166
I wish you were here with us.

26
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,836
I miss you.

27
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,839
We love you, Dad.

28
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,185
Come on, let's go!

29
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,556
No time. Keep moving.

30
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:47,120
My team and I
have spent our entire careers,

31
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,872
fighting against some
of nature's worst creations.

32
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,209
Found a way before,

33
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,295
and we will again.

34
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,424
It's important to remember
that this is not just

35
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,467
a global effort.

36
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,928
This is a human effort.

37
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,182
A way of life,
what we stand for,

38
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,601
the people that we love.

39
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,772
This is what
we're fighting for tonight.

40
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,985
Hey.

41
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,903
My mom thought
these might cheer Emma up.

42
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,156
Tell her I said thank you.
I have something for you.

43
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,657
Emma.

44
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,411
-Hey, kiddo.
-Hi, Reagan.

45
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,996
When the curfew starts,

46
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,957
please don't go outside.
Please find shelter...

47
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,209
Spare batteries,
in case the power goes out.

48
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,879
Make sure your phone is charged.

49
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,380
Pepper spray.

50
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,007
Just in case.

51
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,844
Thank you so much,
Mrs. Marshall.

52
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,637
Come on.

53
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,352
Cody!

54
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,772
Cody! Cody!

55
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,649
Wesley.

56
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,651
What are you doing, man?
You're shooting your gun

57
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,987
right at Lucy's house.
My niece is inside.

58
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,239
There's kids all over the place.
You can kill somebody.

59
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,992
I'm just trying to get ready
for tonight, Captain.

60
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,286
I'm not in the military
anymore, Cody.

61
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,330
We are all soldiers now.

62
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,500
You see what's happening
in Tokyo right now? Or Sydney?

63
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,294
Hell's coming our way, Wesley.

64
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,505
-Hell.
-Is that right?

65
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,673
You know,
I don't understand you, sir.

66
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,384
You're here to protect
your brother's family,

67
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,676
and this is how you do it,

68
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,178
with plywood
and chain-link fencing?

69
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,097
You don't worry
about my brother's family.

70
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,181
I got it covered.

71
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,891
I pray to God you do.

72
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,936
Because tonight,
when that sun sets,

73
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,438
it's gonna be
every man for himself.

74
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,025
Good luck tonight, Cody.

75
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,027
I don't need luck.

76
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,372
Hey, Lucy bear.
Repeat after me, okay?

77
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,542
-My home is a sacred ground.
-My home is a sacred ground.

78
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,960
I will protect myself

79
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,046
and the ones I love
at all costs.

80
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,632
-I am a survivor.
-I'm a survivor.

81
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,176
I am strong. I am capable...

82
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,719
All right.
I double and triple-checked

83
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,556
all the windows and locks.

84
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,016
The house is good.

85
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,935
What?

86
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,896
The house, it's all locked up.

87
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,565
All right,
just like we practiced

88
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,774
at the range a thousand times.

89
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,318
You chamber the round,
you aim...

90
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,820
and fire.

91
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,948
-Okay. -You're not gonna
have to use this.

92
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,117
Let's go over the rules.

93
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,995
Wes, I remember the rules.

94
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,038
Are you sure?

95
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,749
-Don't open the door for anyone.
-Yeah.

96
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,751
Don't make any noise.
Don't draw attention.

97
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,173
Don't hesitate for a second.
I don't care who it is.

98
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,924
-Okay?
-Okay.

99
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,968
All right. You call me
if there's an emergency.

100
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,471
If not, I'll...
I'll reach out to you.

101
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,973
We got this.

102
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,559
-Good.
-We're good. We're good.

103
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,768
We're good. Okay.

104
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,650
What's wrong, kiddo?

105
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,737
-Uncle Wes?
-Yeah.

106
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,447
Why can't you stay?

107
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,073
I want to stay.

108
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,783
I want to stay
more than anything,

109
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,621
but they need me to help them
try and stop this.

110
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,081
I don't want to die.

111
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,044
Hey. Look at me.

112
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,756
You're not gonna die.

113
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,676
Nothing is going
to happen to you, okay?

114
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,055
Do you remember when Daddy
used to tell you that story

115
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,058
about the three little pigs
and the big bad wolf?

116
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,726
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

117
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,978
Do you remember why the big bad
wolf couldn't get in the house?

118
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,813
Because it was made of bricks?

119
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:47,818
It was made of bricks,
just like your house.

120
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,532
Nothing is going to get in.
I made sure of it.

121
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,035
I promise.

122
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,687
It's getting late.

123
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,566
You should get going.

124
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,653
I don't think I can do this.

125
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,321
Wesley...

126
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,159
We're the only family
we have left.

127
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,871
They'll figure it out.
They'll understand.

128
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,874
They can't do this without you.

129
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,378
And Sean...

130
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,839
he would want you to go.

131
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,095
"Always ready."

132
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,576
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

133
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,454
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Drive on. This way.

134
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,165
Transportation
to the underground is limited.

135
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,959
Bring only what you need
to survive the night.

136
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,004
Thank you for your cooperation.

137
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,050
Curfew is
in place for your protection.

138
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,260
Please return
to your homes immediately.

139
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,056
One second, sir.

140
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,811
Transportation
to the underground is limited.

141
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,479
Bring only what you need
to survive the night.

142
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,856
All right.
Go ahead, Dr. Marshall.

143
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,943
Thank you.

144
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,071
Curfew is
in place for your protection.

145
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,466
Yeah, okay.

146
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,379
They don't
care about our rights.

147
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,672
That's right. Our right

148
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,215
is to kill these motherfuckers.

149
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,508
Yeah, yeah.
It's up to us tonight

150
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,843
to fight these things.

151
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,970
It's up to us
to keep America safe.

152
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,388
We are supposed to keep

153
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,015
our people safe.

154
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,767
That's right.
They're not gonna do it for us.

155
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,602
We have to do it for ourselves.

156
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,981
I trust that everyone
made plans for your loved ones.

157
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,734
I know it's not easy.

158
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,153
We have a nine-hour window

159
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,240
to assess, test,
and report our findings.

160
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,827
I would like to introduce
Wesley Marshall,

161
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,038
Global Rapid Response
team leader

162
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,956
and lead molecular biologist.

163
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,918
Evan Radcliffe
is second in command.

164
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,503
And Amy Chen,

165
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,298
chief Canis lupus biologist
and behavioralist.

166
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,302
They have been spearheading
our work here tonight.

167
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,058
Now we know that the supermoon

168
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,851
triggers rapid DNA mutation,

169
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,603
and is photosensitive
to moonlight.

170
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,607
We hope to see
if this mutation can be blocked.

171
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,443
This team standing behind me
has developed a liquid

172
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,822
we call "Moonscreen."

173
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,406
It is our hope

174
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,117
that this Moonscreen
acts as a barrier

175
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,079
between the moonlight
and human DNA.

176
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:58,254
What we discover tonight could
go a long way to finding a cure.

177
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,673
It is not hyperbole to say

178
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:05,845
that our discoveries
could save millions of lives.

179
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,267
Emergency services
will be suspended

180
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,894
from sunset to sunrise.

181
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,398
Please stay out
of the moonlight.

182
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,861
Good luck tonight.

183
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,036
Please
be advised, for your safety,

184
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,038
we are now in full lockdown.

185
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,665
No one will be permitted
to enter

186
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,959
or leave the facility
until daybreak.

187
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,045
All exit points
have been sealed.

188
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,242
Subject
number three entering facility.

189
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,539
Subject number three
entering facility.

190
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,006
Amy...

191
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:30,930
Whatever happens tonight,
remember, it is my choice.

192
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,266
I know.

193
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,521
I love you, Dr. Chen.

194
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,257
Don't worry, Dr. Chen.

195
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,718
We've taken
every safety precaution.

196
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,012
He's gonna be okay.

197
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,442
Myles can feel the supermoon
is about to rise.

198
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,487
All the Year Oners
know it's close.

199
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,323
They can feel it.

200
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:37,246
Whatever turned him last year
left a compulsive craving.

201
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,748
He's an addict without a fix.

202
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,919
Until tonight.

203
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,929
We are now entering

204
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,472
the final hour of daylight.

205
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,767
Our prayers are with everyone,

206
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,477
and the team at Aranda Corp.

207
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,646
Let us hope they find us a cure.

208
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,067
Stay safe out there, everyone,
and Godspeed.

209
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,449
Scoot over, kiddo.
Mama needs in on this game.

210
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,659
You know
I always beat you, right?

211
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,328
Oh, it's like, it's like that?
Is it like that?

212
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,247
Is it really like that?

213
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,666
But who wins the tickling?

214
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,670
Who-who-who? Who wins at
tickling, Emma? Tell me.

215
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,760
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

216
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,095
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

217
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,265
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

218
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,523
Hey. You okay?

219
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,028
We're in it together. Yeah?

220
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,449
Breathe. Just breathe.

221
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,749
Three, two, one...

222
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,589
Go time.

223
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,724
All staff to stations.

224
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,393
Hey, Phil,
we're over here on Subject One.

225
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,271
Copy. Moving in.

226
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,818
Sir. Step forward.

227
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,696
Good luck tonight, sir.

228
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,783
Whoa, whoa, ma'am, ma'am.

229
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,911
Ma'am, I need you to stay calm.

230
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,955
Your heart rate
is incredibly elevated.

231
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,540
Good.

232
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,917
Hey, hey, you sure this guy

233
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,627
passed the psych eval?

234
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,421
It's not like
we had a lot of volunteers.

235
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,298
How come
I always get the crazy ones?

236
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,592
Right?

237
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,595
Moonscreen
temperature... stable.

238
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,514
I really don't like
the name "Moonscreen."

239
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,517
We commence in ten minutes.
Ten-minute warning.

240
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,729
Ten-minute warning.

241
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,398
Ten-minute warning.

242
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,275
I can't believe
they volunteered for this.

243
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,277
-Let me get in there.
-Go ahead.

244
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,820
Excuse me, sir.

245
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,280
You don't even know
if the Moonscreen will work.

246
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,991
It'll work. It has to work.

247
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,910
Subject Three,
step forward, please.

248
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,037
Don't worry,
it's just a liquid nanotech

249
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,205
to protect your eyes.

250
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,540
It won't hurt.

251
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,338
All right.
Liquid lens team out.

252
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,383
-Formula team in.
-Vitals out.

253
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,219
God, I hope this works.
Good luck tonight, guys.

254
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,679
Keep moving.

255
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,848
Good luck.

256
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,017
Five minutes
to canopy retraction.

257
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,935
Five minutes

258
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,812
to canopy retraction.

259
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,319
Spray him down.
Make sure you get all of it.

260
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,281
Start the clock.

261
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,909
Notate how long
the screen lasts.

262
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,494
Starting the clock.

263
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,829
All right, spray down.

264
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,331
Security, be ready.

265
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,540
Screen them up, guys.
Screen them up.

266
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,833
Good over here.

267
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,757
Chin up, chin up.

268
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,805
Three minutes
to canopy retraction.

269
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,183
Three minutes
to canopy retraction.

270
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,518
Three minutes to
canopy retraction.

271
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,146
What happens if one of them
decides to moon the sky

272
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,357
once we open up this roof?

273
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,068
The formula penetrates
the thin fibers, Evan.

274
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,737
No one's showing their ass
and turning tonight.

275
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,535
I changed my mind.

276
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,123
Hey. Hey.

277
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,541
Hey. Are you listening to me?

278
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,085
We're losing Subject One.

279
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,796
Two minutes
to canopy retraction.

280
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,880
Help me!

281
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,049
Two minutes
to canopy retraction.

282
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,594
Wait, wait, where are you going?

283
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,180
Please, let me out of here!

284
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,015
-Should we sedate her?
-No.

285
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,978
Sedatives could interfere
with the test results.

286
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,357
She knew what
she was getting into.

287
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,734
I don't want to turn. No.

288
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,363
Please open this gate!

289
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,657
Hey! It's gonna be okay.

290
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,825
No.

291
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,913
-Just relax. It's gonna work.
-Hey!

292
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,293
30 seconds
to canopy retraction.

293
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,335
Get me the fuck out of here!

294
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,462
30 seconds to canopy retraction.

295
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,798
30 seconds
to canopy retraction.

296
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,935
-Canopy retraction commencing.
-Oh, it's coming.

297
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:58,400
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

298
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,777
five, four,

299
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,363
-three, two, one...
-Ambrosia!

300
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,949
Oh, my God.
Please, don't do this to me.

301
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,410
Canopy retraction commencing.

302
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,747
Canopy retraction commencing.

303
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,501
Canopy retraction commencing.

304
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,472
Yeah!

305
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,452
What's happening?!

306
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,914
He's fine. It fucking worked.

307
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,832
I think we're through.

308
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,959
I think we did it.

309
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,472
Dr. Aranda,
I think it's holding.

310
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,394
Start pulling fluid
and tissue biopsies.

311
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,020
Let's get everything
analyzed ASAP.

312
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,231
Subjects Two
and Three are Year Oners.

313
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,649
I want a comparison test

314
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,609
to see if they exhibit
any abnormalities

315
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,861
relative to our test group.

316
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,530
Dr. Chen,

317
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,532
I need you to analyze
those blood samples

318
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,742
from our Canis lupus.

319
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,536
Yes, sir.

320
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,893
Hey, I'll be right outside.

321
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,770
I just wanna go
check on things, okay?

322
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,523
Stay here.

323
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,027
Mom?

324
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,709
Stepping in now.

325
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,921
Congratulations, Doctor.

326
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,839
Stable.

327
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,424
Blood's looking good.

328
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,260
-Let's relay positive results.
-Very nice. Looks good.

329
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,972
Mitosis seems
to be holding, no mutations.

330
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,224
How are the samples
looking, Wes?

331
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,895
You seeing this?

332
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,194
Is it parasitic?

333
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,737
I don't know.
It looks like it

334
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,448
might be kind of
an immunological defense system.

335
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,992
Whatever this mutation is,

336
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,326
it looks like the supermoon's

337
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,870
triggering
a dormant defense response.

338
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,831
But why is it only now reactive?

339
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,500
Could it be viral
or pathological?

340
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,127
I don't know yet.

341
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:31,089
Evan, bring me
a different tissue sample.

342
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,887
Subject Three is turning.

343
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,389
Moonscreen stability
at one hour.

344
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,602
Stay back.
Everybody, stay back.

345
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,987
Fuck.

346
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,947
Get that formula spraying now.

347
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,784
Yes!

348
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,953
Where the fuck
is the Moonscreen?

349
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,584
Oh, fuck!

350
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,918
Dr. Aranda, what's the status?

351
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,836
-Look out! Look out!
-Move back!

352
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,212
Get back now!

353
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,215
Dr. Aranda!

354
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,636
Spray the formula, now.

355
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,888
Yeah, yeah, all right.

356
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,147
Watch out!

357
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,233
Move, move!

358
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,487
Oh, shit.

359
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:39,532
Close the roof!
Close the roof!

360
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,825
Go!

361
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,789
The roof isn't closing.

362
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,874
Canopy malfunctioning.

363
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,794
Canopy malfunctioning.

364
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,108
Everyone get to an exit.

365
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,943
Now!

366
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,945
James! James, are you okay?

367
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,198
My suit... my suit ripped.

368
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,992
You're gonna be okay.
You hear me?

369
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,038
He's been exposed.
He's been exposed.

370
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,790
Wes, what the fuck
did you just say?

371
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,375
I need a tranquilizer now.

372
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,752
Evan, hurry up.

373
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,425
-Wes, go.
-James, stay with me.

374
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,594
Fuck, he's turning.

375
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,181
Where is the tranquilizer?

376
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,684
I'm coming!

377
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,145
James, stay with me.
James! You can fight this.

378
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:54,858
Get away from me! Get away!

379
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,744
Hit him with the tranquilizer!

380
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,717
-I can't breathe.
-Fuck.

381
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,761
Go! Let's go, let's go!

382
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,731
Go!

383
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,445
I can't breathe.

384
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,491
I'm living.
I can't... I can't breathe.

385
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,244
Attention. All staff,

386
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,163
please move to emergency exits.

387
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,167
Finish gathering
the blood samples.

388
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,252
Then I want you
moving to an exit.

389
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,587
Attention. All staff,

390
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,671
please move to emergency exits.

391
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,758
I got you. You're okay.

392
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,009
Attention. All staff,

393
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,803
please move to emergency exits.

394
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,180
It's okay.

395
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,932
Attention. All staff,

396
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,099
please move to emergency exits.

397
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,392
Is everyone okay?

398
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,770
I gotta get out of here.

399
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,771
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

400
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,815
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet.

401
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,443
-Where the fuck are you?
-I can't...

402
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,447
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna fucking die.

403
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,950
No, okay.
Everyone just stay calm.

404
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,369
We're gonna get out of here.

405
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,834
No!

406
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,922
Got you,
you wolf piece of shit!

407
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,597
Die, you fucking bastard!

408
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,939
Just go, just go.

409
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,651
Get out! Go, go!

410
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,236
-What's happening?
-Sorry.

411
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,154
Keep going.
To your right. Keep going.

412
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,868
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

413
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,538
Stay with me. Come on.

414
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,548
No, no, no! Go! Go, go!

415
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,102
Wes.

416
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,480
Oh, my God, Evan! Infirmary.

417
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,277
Out of the hall.

418
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,529
Go!

419
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,574
Wes, it's not working.

420
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,621
Wes...

421
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,256
Go!

422
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,644
Go! Go!

423
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,861
Shoot it! Shoot it!

424
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,041
Jesus Christ!

425
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,374
All right. You're all right.

426
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,459
We have to stop the bleeding.

427
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,377
Move, move, move, move, move!

428
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,837
-Okay.
-Okay, hold it down. Pressure!

429
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,465
Pressure. Evan?
Evan, stick with us, okay?

430
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,592
You just breathe slowly. We're
gonna get you patched up, okay?

431
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,385
-Breathe, Evan, breathe.
-Hold both hands. Both...

432
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,179
-I got it. I got it.
-Both hands. Hold it down.

433
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,682
Evan, just stay with us.
Evan? Evan?

434
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,437
Evan?

435
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,778
-Evan. No! Evan...
-He's gone. He's gone.

436
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,032
What...
This wasn't supposed to happen.

437
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,658
This isn't... this isn't...

438
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,827
Okay.

439
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,205
I need... Myles.

440
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,539
-No, no, no, no.
-No, no, no, no!

441
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,208
-I have to get to Myles.
-Amy, Amy.

442
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,210
-Look at me! He turned.
-No! Let me go.

443
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,253
-No, the formula was working.
-Amy! Amy!

444
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,214
It didn't!
It didn't last for him.

445
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,216
-No!
-He turned. I'm sorry.

446
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,051
We were too late with Myles.

447
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,803
-I'm sorry.
-No.

448
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,264
I'm sorry.

449
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,862
I think we should just
stay here and wait for help.

450
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,531
We're not staying here,
we can't stay here.

451
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,824
We're not staying here.
There's no more time.

452
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,575
No, if we leave here,
we are gonna die.

453
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,661
If we stay, we die. Listen.

454
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:25,039
No more guns, no more guards.
There's nothing left.

455
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,083
Those things are coming for us.

456
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,751
That door's not gonna stop them.

457
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,920
Wes, think about
what you are saying.

458
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,465
If we make it past those walls,
we're gonna face the moonlight.

459
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,926
We got the formula. It works.

460
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,512
We need more than the formula,
Wes. We need...

461
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,763
Guns.

462
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,434
-A plan.
-That is the plan.

463
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,817
Fuck.

464
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,321
-Get the weapons.
-Here, cover up.

465
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,304
The formula will last
about an hour.

466
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,016
Close your eyes.

467
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,393
I'm gonna set my watch.
You set yours.

468
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,811
If one of us turns...

469
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,731
I'm not shooting you, Wes.

470
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,358
If one of us turns,
we lose the other, yeah?

471
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,777
-Yeah.
-Say it.

472
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,903
Yes.

473
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,241
When's the last time
you used one of these?

474
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,911
Outside a paper target,
when you and I were in Malaysia.

475
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,581
Well, let's pretend
they're paper targets

476
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,833
that are gonna eat us.

477
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,968
No.

478
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,392
It's Myles.

479
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,686
Go.

480
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,402
Don't slow down.

481
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,865
I won't.

482
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,829
-Wes.
-You guys okay?

483
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,790
Yes, we're okay,
but there was gunfire.

484
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,291
They got inside the houses.

485
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,667
I know they're still out there.

486
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,252
I know they are.
I just can't see them. I can't--

487
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,587
What? What happened?

488
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,172
I think they attacked Cody.
I saw them

489
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,757
getting into his house.
And if they can get into his,

490
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,717
-I just...
-Lucy, this is Dr. Chen.

491
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,387
Just stay calm.
The noise will attract them.

492
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,846
Okay. Okay.

493
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,849
Mrs. Marshall!

494
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,520
-Luce?
-Mrs. Marshall,

495
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,064
Mrs. Marshall, it's me!

496
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,200
There's someone at the gate.

497
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,785
Don't answer it, okay?

498
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,454
Mrs. Marshall, it's me, Reagan.

499
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,543
Oh, my God, it's-it's Reagan.
She's outside.

500
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,545
I don't care who it is!
Don't answer it.

501
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,672
-I need help!
-But...

502
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,258
It killed my mom.
Please, Mrs. Marshall!

503
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:31,720
I can go get her.
I can cover up and go get her.

504
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,389
Lucy, listen to me.

505
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,224
It's Reagan, Wes.

506
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,144
Don't answer it.
She could have turned. Lucy!

507
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,897
-Hey, Reagan, hold on.
-Lucy!

508
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,024
I'm gonna come get you,
all right? I'm gonna...

509
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,569
No! No!

510
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,571
-Don't answer the door.
-Wes.

511
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,117
Wes?

512
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,757
Oh, God.

513
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,845
My home is a sacred ground. I...

514
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:20,269
I will protect myself
and the ones I love.

515
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,397
I am a survivor.
I am a strong...

516
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,194
Oh, my God!

517
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:45,503
Fuck you, Sean. Fuck you,
you selfless hero prick! I...

518
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,133
How could you?

519
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,761
How could you leave us alone?
I... I...

520
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,596
Oh, come here.

521
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,478
-I miss Daddy.
-I know you do.

522
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,896
I know you do.

523
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,525
I know, baby.

524
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,420
Go! Go!

525
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,463
Move!

526
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,848
-My phone.
-No, come on. Wes.

527
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,226
-My phone.
-Get up! Get up!

528
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,895
Get up!

529
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,856
Come on, Wes. Come on.

530
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,049
Hey, I need you to stay
in your fort

531
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,052
and keep your headphones on.
Can you do that for me?

532
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,763
Go.

533
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,370
There you are.

534
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,303
This is for Reagan.

535
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,372
Hey, listen.

536
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:30,250
At this point,
all we are is prey.

537
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,545
Wolves are predators, and they
hunt their prey on the run.

538
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,674
What are you saying?
We shouldn't run?

539
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:44,473
I'm saying, a wolf or two,
we can run, confuse them.

540
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,185
But a big pack...
we got to stand our ground.

541
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,146
In a wolf fight,

542
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:55,192
you either dominate,
run, or die.

543
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,779
No more options.

544
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,531
In that case,
you stay as close to me

545
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,199
as humanly possible. Yeah?

546
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,799
Fuck.

547
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,430
I think we should backtrack
and cross over Fifth.

548
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:28,475
No, it's too far.
We don't have that kind of time.

549
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,396
Our only shot
is around these wolves.

550
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,858
If we cross behind the
parked cars, they won't see us.

551
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,901
Okay.

552
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,529
And if we make it through,
what next?

553
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,614
Let's cross that bridge
when we get to it.

554
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,450
Stay close to me.

555
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,476
Where's the third one?
Where's the other one?

556
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,423
Oh, shit.

557
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,259
The formula's gonna wear off.

558
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,054
-Wes.
-Fuck.

559
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,430
I think we should run.

560
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,394
Go, go, go, go.

561
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,312
-We have to get inside.
-How much time do we have?

562
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,481
There's no time.

563
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,789
-There.
-Go.

564
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,796
The gates are closing.

565
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,548
Go, get in! Go!

566
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,101
Hey, guys.

567
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,021
-Follow me.
-Hey!

568
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:15,781
-What is this place?
-It's a market.

569
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,783
Its tunnels
run underneath there.

570
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,327
We could use them
to bypass this shit.

571
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,040
No!

572
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,250
We don't want any trouble.

573
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,546
I will shoot you in your face.

574
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:36,218
We're scientists. There was
an accident at the lab.

575
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,011
We're working on a cure.

576
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,429
There is no cure.

577
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,187
Your kind don't belong here.

578
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,900
Give me a reason why I shouldn't
feed you to the wolves.

579
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,236
We're just trying
to get to my family,

580
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,238
make sure they're safe.
That's it.

581
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,448
We just want to use the tunnels.

582
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,793
I'll take you
to the tunnel entrance.

583
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,797
Then...
you're on your own.

584
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,149
Oh, my God.

585
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,739
-Stand back.
-It's gonna be loud.

586
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,324
Hold your ears.

587
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,050
Now!

588
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,298
Die, you fuck.

589
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,983
Wes, come on, let's go. Get up.

590
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,626
Stop!

591
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,299
We need to reapply.

592
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,845
-What does that mean?
-It's too hot.

593
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,474
Bodega.

594
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,024
Cover up.

595
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,826
I don't care what you hear
or what you see,

596
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,704
do not look up,
do not drop that tarp. Okay?

597
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,623
My count.

598
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,586
One, two, go!

599
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,519
It's like a dinner bell.

600
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,146
We need to shut it off.

601
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,668
-We good?
-It's close.

602
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,053
You remember
when a full moon meant...

603
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,015
...something cool and magical?

604
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,272
God, we gotta find a way
back to that again.

605
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,235
It's the only way
to go on with life.

606
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,907
I don't even know
what that looks like anymore.

607
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,576
"Go on with life."

608
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,664
You know, I've been around
this planet five times over

609
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,541
chasing pandemics?

610
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,797
I never had time for a family.
I didn't want one.

611
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,175
Give me a crisis...

612
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,928
I can handle that.

613
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,518
Now I have my brother's family,

614
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,228
and I don't know
how to take care of 'em.

615
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,107
You're giving them your best.

616
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,361
That's the problem.

617
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,155
I don't think
my best is good enough.

618
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,078
It's ready.

619
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,872
All right.

620
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,084
We just need to find
something to keep it cold.

621
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,921
-I'll go check the back.
-Mm.

622
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,788
Hey.

623
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,627
Hey. How did you get in here?

624
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,801
Oh, fuck.

625
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,641
Stop.

626
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,270
Stop.

627
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,733
I'm not gonna tell you again.

628
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,194
Don't make me shoot you.

629
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,738
Stop!

630
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,703
Jesus.

631
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:07,789
I almost...

632
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,834
Just a kid.

633
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,212
I know.

634
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,258
Let's get out of here.

635
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,705
Stay here, baby.

636
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,307
My home is a sacred ground.

637
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:12,603
I will protect myself and
the ones I love at all costs.

638
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,689
I am a survivor.

639
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,734
I am strong. I am capable.

640
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,237
I bend, but I do not break.

641
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,414
Cody Walker, get the hell
off my property!

642
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,002
You hear that?

643
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,503
That's a 12-gauge shotgun,

644
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,797
and I swear to God,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

645
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,924
Yeah!

646
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,261
Come here.

647
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,947
I'm here.

648
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,459
Oh, shit.

649
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,268
Goddamn it!

650
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,438
Come on. Come on. Stay with me.

651
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,301
Emma, get over here.

652
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,852
Damn it.

653
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,483
Light this up
like we practiced, okay?

654
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,505
Where are you?
I am not gonna warn you again.

655
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,090
You leave now,
or I will shoot anyone

656
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,593
that tries
to get inside my house.

657
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,733
Fuck.

658
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:17,121
Nails... it'll hold them.

659
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,253
Hot, down.

660
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,800
-Check your six!
-On it.

661
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,135
Move.

662
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,386
Got one coming from northbound.

663
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,888
Shoot, motherfucker, shoot!

664
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,015
Good. Looks good.

665
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,650
Move in!

666
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:51,405
-On your left!
-He's running! Get him!

667
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,243
Yeah!

668
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,422
Move up! Move up!

669
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,760
-Who are these guys?
-Get him now!

670
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,471
I don't know, but they're gonna
get us the hell out of here.

671
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,642
Forward!

672
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,401
Ceasefire. Ceasefire.

673
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,486
Yeah, boys, they're gone.

674
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,071
Got 'em on the run.

675
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,614
Think we got 'em.

676
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,699
Yeah, motherfucker.

677
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,201
Good shooting, men.

678
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,452
-Hey!
-Stay right there!

679
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,413
-Hey!
-Don't move.

680
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,289
-No, no, no! We're friendlies.
-Don't move, motherfucker!

681
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,874
Don't shoot.

682
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,085
Did you hear? Don't move!

683
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,336
-We're the CDC.
-We're friendlies.

684
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,796
-We're with the CDC.
-Don't shoot!

685
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,381
Stop talking.

686
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,049
-Look, look. We're not turning.
-No, we're protected!

687
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,843
-Look, look, look, look. We're
protected. -We're protected.

688
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,512
-It blocks the light. It works.
-That's bullshit, man!

689
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,139
-No, we're friendlies.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

690
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,099
Don't shoot.

691
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,183
Fuck!

692
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,229
Go forward.

693
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,500
Mommy!

694
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,591
Fuck.

695
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,684
Four left.

696
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,251
They're forming a kill circle.

697
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,961
If we stay here,
we're gonna die.

698
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,924
We get to the Bronco.
It's our only shot.

699
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,427
You get to that gun,
I'll be a distraction.

700
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,429
-What?
-I have a theory.

701
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,056
I'm going to test it.

702
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,767
-No.
-You want to get to Lucy?

703
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,310
Trust me.

704
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,147
Don't die.

705
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:13,858
Go.

706
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,025
Hey!

707
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:18,320
Hey, you forgot one!

708
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,656
Look at me.

709
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,367
Hey!

710
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,288
Bite me.

711
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,187
Amy! Now!

712
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,530
Come on, come on, come on!

713
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:49,828
No! No!

714
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,410
Come on. Come on!

715
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,037
I will kill every one
of you motherfuckers!

716
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,800
Get behind the couch.

717
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:26,675
Fuck!

718
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,811
Emma.

719
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,483
They're gonna get in, okay?

720
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:46,153
If you see something,
you point and you spray.

721
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,279
Can you do that?

722
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,114
-I'm scared, Mom.
-I know.

723
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:53,327
I know, but you're brave, too.
You point and you spray.

724
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,661
Mm.

725
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:18,537
All right,
you hairy motherfuckers.

726
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,622
Come fetch.

727
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,142
Whoo! You motherfucker!

728
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,611
Oh, shit.

729
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,030
Motherfucker.

730
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,908
It's okay. It's over, okay?

731
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,875
Here.

732
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,249
Lucy? Emma?

733
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:15,005
Lucy? Emma?

734
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,689
Hey. Come here.

735
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:35,609
Uncle Wes, I missed you so much.

736
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,819
You okay?

737
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,322
Come on.

738
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,701
-What happened at the lab?
-It's a long story.

739
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:45,952
I should have never left.

740
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,748
Are you... are you okay?
Let me see.

741
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:53,001
Yeah, yeah. It's not my blood.
Most of it anyway. We're good.

742
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,128
Okay. Okay. We're okay.

743
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,963
We're okay.
It's gonna be daylight soon.

744
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,965
Just go get me the shotgun.

745
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,759
No more shells.

746
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,636
No more shells? What did you do?

747
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,971
It's been a busy night.

748
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:08,850
He's not dead.

749
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,104
Go.

750
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,202
What are we gonna do?

751
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,188
It's okay.

752
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,024
Come over here.

753
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,239
I want you to make me a promise.

754
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,909
No matter what happens,

755
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:12,205
when you grow up,
I want you to be brave,

756
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:16,376
and I want you to be strong,
just like your daddy.

757
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,837
Okay? You know why?

758
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:22,174
Because you have a heart
just like your daddy.

759
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:24,801
You promise me?

760
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,221
Good girl.

761
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,432
What's going on?

762
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,227
This house isn't gonna
last much longer.

763
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,563
Wait. What are you
talking about?

764
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:39,191
No, no, no, no.
You can't go out there. Look,

765
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,234
we-we can stick together.
We can fight this. We...

766
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,404
If we wait it out until sunrise,
we can survive this.

767
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:48,450
This watch is set for sunrise.
You have 15 minutes.

768
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:07,052
Always ready.

769
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:09,095
No, Wes.

770
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,933
I love you guys.

771
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,170
I never liked you, Cody.

772
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:47,634
And I'm gonna fucking bury you.

773
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,639
Come on. Come on, come on.

774
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:01,267
Is Uncle Wes okay?
What's going on?

775
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:03,311
Look, this is what
we're gonna do, okay?

776
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,773
You're gonna hide in here
with your eyes closed.

777
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:10,819
No matter what you hear,
you do not come out.

778
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,488
-You do not make a sound.
-Okay.

779
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,742
Get in, get in, get in.

780
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:19,119
Listen, listen...

781
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,788
if something happens, okay,

782
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,290
I want you to wait
until you hear sirens,

783
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,585
and then you run to the
neighbors for help, okay? Okay.

784
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,297
I love you.

785
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,425
-I love you, too, Mom.
-Okay.

786
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,604
Wes... Wesley!
Wesley, please. Please.

787
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:30,648
Please, I know you can hear me.
I know you can hear me.

788
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,195
Please don't do this.

789
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:49,125
Oh, God.

790
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:07,644
No...

791
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,854
Wes!

792
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:15,235
Wes, Wes, we're your...

793
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:18,071
we're your family,
and we love you. We...

794
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,532
Please don't do this
to us. Please.

795
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,450
Oh, God!

796
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:45,431
Oh. Oh, God!

797
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:49,060
Think of your...
think of your brother.

798
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,979
Think of Sean.

799
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,652
Remember...
remember your brother, Sean.

800
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:02,657
Think of... think of Emma.
Think of Emma, your niece.

801
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,868
Think of how much you love her.

802
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:06,703
And we love you so much.

803
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:09,956
Wes, it's me.

804
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,125
It's Sean.

805
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,219
I'm sorry.

806
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,023
Always ready.
