00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,539
THANK YOU, ILLEGAL
RUSSIAN SATELLITES.

472
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,792
GREAT. WELL,
LET'S GO SAVE DAY.

473
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,838
ARE YOU OK?

474
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,632
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
ABLE TO DO IT.

475
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,176
OH, I SHOULD HAVE
ENOUGH SLACK NOW.

476
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,263
TO DO WHAT?

477
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,389
[CRACK]
AAH! UH!

478
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,723
WHAT THE HELL?

479
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,976
I CAN DISLOCATE
MY THUMBS.

480
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,812
IT'S A USEFUL TECHNIQUE
IF GETTING TIED TO A CHAIR

481
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,772
IS GONNA BECOME
A HABIT.

482
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,941
YOU HAVE GOT TO TEACH ME
HOW TO DO THAT.

483
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,070
[CANARY CRY]

484
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,417
SO YOU NOT RING BELL.

485
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:06,213
STILL, VERY IMPRESSIVE
TO, UH, NOT DIE.

486
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,342
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD
THEM WHAT WAS ON THE DRIVE.

487
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,427
THEY WOULD'VE
KILLED YOU
IF I DIDN'T.

488
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,762
OR WE WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE
TO ESCAPE WITHOUT YOU

489
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,931
-GIVING UP THE INFORMATION.
-MIA.

490
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,225
LAUREL: OK, CAN WE PLEASE
JUST SAVE THE FAMILY SQUABBLING

491
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,227
TILL AFTER WE HAVE
THE PLANS?

492
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,062
OLEG'S BOUND
TO FIGURE OUT HOW
MUCH THEY'RE WORTH.

493
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,563
WELL, HE'S SMART BUSINESSMAN.

494
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,523
HE WILL FIGURE OUT
WAY TO SELL IT.

495
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,151
OLIVER: WE NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHEN AND WHERE

496
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,152
THE SALE IS HAPPENING,

497
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,778
AND THEN WE GO
RECOVER THE DRIVE.

498
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,988
LET ME GUESS.

499
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,573
ME AND WILLIAM GET TO
STAY AT THE BAR, RIGHT?

500
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,370
YOU'RE GOING HOME,
BOTH OF YOU.

501
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,871
NO.

502
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,914
I HAVE A FEELING THERE'S
LESS DRAMA OUT HERE.

503
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,083
YEAH.

504
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,715
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO"?

505
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,800
I'M SORRY, DAD, BUT WE
JUST SAVED YOU

506
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,593
FROM BEING MURDERED BY
A BUNCH OF GANGSTERS.

507
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,179
I'M ON TEAM MIA HERE.

508
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,764
YEAH, BUT MIA JUST GOT
KIDNAPPED BY THE BRATVA.

509
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,101
-SO DID YOU.
-I'M YOUR FATHER, ALL RIGHT?

510
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,355
IT IS MY PRIMARY
JOB IN THE WORLD

511
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,898
TO PROTECT YOU.

512
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,733
WE DON'T NEED THAT.

513
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,902
IN THE FUTURE,
WE'RE THE ONES THAT
ARE SAVING THE CITY.

514
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,695
WELL, THIS ISN'T
THE FUTURE!

515
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,324
THIS IS MONTHS AFTER

516
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,410
I WAS HEARTBROKEN
RIGHT BEFORE I LEFT...

517
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,161
THAT I COULDN'T GET YOU
ON THE PHONE

518
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,788
AT YOUR GRANDPARENTS'.

519
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,543
SO I WALKED INTO YOUR
ROOM TO LOOK AT
YOU ONE LAST TIME,

520
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,003
AND YOU LOOKED BACK
AT ME FROM YOUR CRIB.

521
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,130
AND BECAUSE YOU MADE
THE CHOICE TO PROTECT US,

522
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,007
I HAD TO SPEND
MY WHOLE LIFE ALONE.

523
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,051
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET TO KNOW MY BROTHER,

524
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,593
TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

525
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,679
I'M SORRY THAT
IT WORKED OUT THAT WAY.

526
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:42,600
AND BOTH OF YOU
CAN DECIDE ON
YOUR OWN HOW MUCH...

527
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,644
HOW MUCH
YOU WANT
TO HATE ME

528
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,646
AND HOW MUCH BLAME
YOU WANT TO ASSIGN.

529
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,942
BUT I MADE A PROMISE
TO YOUR MOTHER
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

530
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,777
AND THERE...THERE IS
NO WORLD,

531
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,737
THERE IS NO UNIVERSE,
THERE'S NO PAST,

532
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,865
PRESENT, OR FUTURE
WHERE I BREAK IT.

533
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,410
FINE.

534
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,050
YOU READY?

535
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,760
AS I'LL EVER BE.

536
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,640
LET'S GO!

537
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,980
[ALARM]

538
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,689
MUST BE SOME KIND OF
TAMPER ALARM.

539
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,900
-I'LL GET THE PAYLOAD.
-I'LL KEEP WATCH.

00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,458

541
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,043
HEY, ROY.
ROY, LOOK AT ME, MAN.

542
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,504
LOOK AT ME!

543
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:55,174
ROY, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

544
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,176
Y...YOU GOT IT?

545
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,178
LOOK. IT'S RIGHT HERE.

546
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,180
LET'S GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

547
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,894
-ANY WORD FROM YOUR CONTACT?
-NYET.

548
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,938
OH, THESE THINGS
TAKE TIME.

549
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,193
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I COULD HANDLE DRINK
WITHOUT UMBRELLA.

550
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,529
I'M GOOD, THANK YOU.

551
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,073
IF BY GOOD, YOU MEAN...
HOW YOU SAY...MOODY,

552
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,159
YES, YOU ARE.

553
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,953
IS THIS BECAUSE YOU
RUIN FAMILY VACATION?

554
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,164
I HAVE TO SEND THEM HOME
FOR THEIR PROTECTION.

555
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,749
DO YOU NOT THINK
THEY CAN HANDLE IT?

556
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,794
THEY CAN HANDLE IT.
I JUST...

557
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,589
I WANT TO KEEP THEM
AWAY FROM THE BRATVA.

558
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,425
YOU MEAN KEEP THEM AWAY
FROM YOUR BRATVA PAST.

559
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,302
DARK TIME FOR ME.

560
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,096
THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.

561
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,474
YOU ARE ASHAMED.

562
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,352
YOU HAVE TRULY DONE
SOME TERRIBLE THINGS.

563
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,437
THANK YOU FOR
THE REMINDER.

564
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,482
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE DONE
SOME GOOD THINGS.

565
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,651
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
THE KIDS SEE BOTH.

566
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,611
RIGHT, BUT WHY WOULD I
WANT TO SHARE

567
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:01,781
SOME OF THE WORST MISTAKES
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE
WITH MY CHILDREN?

568
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,784
THAT IS THE THING
ABOUT TEACHING.

569
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,787
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT
YOU WANT TO SAY.

570
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,291
IT'S ABOUT WHAT THEY
NEED TO HEAR.

571
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,711
REMEMBER FIRST THING
I TAUGHT YOU?

572
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,713
LIVING IS NOT FOR THE WEAK.

573
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,341
YOUR CHILDREN ARE NOT
WEAK, OLIVER.

574
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,218
THEY'RE ALSO NOT CHILDREN.

575
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,512
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU HAVE TO SAY,

576
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,473
THEY CAN HANDLE IT.

577
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,436
IF YOU DO NOT, THEY
WILL NEVER LEARN
TO BE HEROES.

578
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,995
OOF. IT WOULD SUCK
TO BE THAT DOOR.

579
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,664
[SCOFFS]

580
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,541
IF YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE ME
A PEP TALK OR WHATEVER,

581
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,042
JUST DON'T.

582
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,169
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

583
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,505
I JUST COULDN'T STAND
THE SMELL OF THAT
STALE BAR ANYMORE.

584
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,675
IT SMELLS LIKE CABBAGE.

585
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,344
THAT'S ONE MORE THING I
WON'T MISS ABOUT THIS PLACE.

586
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,221
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GOING HOME.

587
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,558
WHY WOULDN'T I?
DAD DOESN'T WANT ME HERE.

588
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,977
OH, GOD. I CAN'T STAND
PITY PARTIES.

589
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,062
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

590
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,440
AND WHY IS THAT?

591
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,693
YOU'RE THE BLACK CANARY.

592
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,113
ALL I'VE EVER HEARD
ARE STORIES ABOUT
HOW GREAT YOU ARE.

593
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,658
IN THE FUTURE, YOU EVEN
SAVE ME ONCE

594
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,743
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

595
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:30,120
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S ACTUALLY ME
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

596
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,956
OK, YOU CAN CUT
THE FALSE MODESTY.

597
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,834
SOME PEOPLE ARE
CUT OUT TO BE HEROES,

598
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,837
OTHERS NOT SO MUCH.

599
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,382
IS THIS REALLY ALL
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T RING
SOME STUPID BELL?

600
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,510
WELL, I COULDN'T SAVE
ZOE EITHER.

601
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:54,561
EVERY TIME I TRY
AND LIVE UP TO MY DAD

602
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,315
OR TO PROVE THAT I CAN
DO WHAT IT IS YOU ALL DO,

603
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,151
I...I FAIL.

604
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:05,531
DO YOU THINK YOUR
FATHER IS ANY BETTER?

605
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:11,745
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO
LIVE UP TO US, DON'T.

606
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,332
WE ARE JUST AS FLAWED
AS ANYONE,

607
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,916
ESPECIALLY ME.

608
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,839
ALL YOU CAN DO IS
LIVE UP TO YOURSELF.

609
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,841
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

610
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,426
ARE YOU REALLY
THE TYPE OF PERSON
THAT JUST GIVES UP?

611
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,143
OH, GOOD. DO WE HAVE
TIME FOR ONE MORE FIGHT
BEFORE WE LEAVE?

612
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,812
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A FIGHT.

613
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,104
THEN STOP TRYING TO
SEND US HOME.

614
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,356
WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

615
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,568
GOOD BECAUSE I NEED
YOUR HELP.

616
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,740
OLEG IS SELLING DRIVE
DURING BLOODBATH TONIGHT.

617
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,366
AND HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO GET IN?

618
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,159
THEY KNOW OUR FACES.

619
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,036
RIGHT. WE USE THAT
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

620
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,752
YOU AND I ARE GOING IN
THE RING TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

621
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,003
YOU WOULD BE
HELPING US GET IN.

622
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,840
ANATOLY: SORRY. I DID NOT HAVE
TIME TO GET IT DRY CLEANED.

623
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,634
I'M REALLY MORE OF
A BEHIND THE SCREEN
KIND OF GUY,

624
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,053
