00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:17,053
Stark!

5
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,187
He doesn't seem happy.

6
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,355
Hello, Hank.

7
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:22,925
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

8
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,728
I took a detour...

9
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,864
Through your defense lab.

10
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,266
Tell me that isn't<br>what I think it is.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,371
That depends if you think it's<br>a poor attempt to replicate my work.

12
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:38,540
Even for this group,<br>that takes nerve.

13
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,343
You were<br>instructed to go to Russia.

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,210
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,<br>that you're a soldier...

15
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,411
I'm a scientist.

16
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,481
Then act like one.

17
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,950
The Pym Particle is the most<br>revolutionary science ever developed.

18
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,218
Help us put it to good use.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,487
I let you turn me<br>into your errand boy,

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,890
and now you try to<br>steal my research?

21
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:57,793
If only you'd protected Janet<br>with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

22
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,329
Ah...

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,299
Easy, Hank.

24
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,570
You mention my wife again

25
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:10,906
and I'll show you ferocity.

26
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,308
Don't look at me. You said it.

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,977
I formally<br>tender my resignation.

28
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,147
We don't accept it. Formally.

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,515
Hank,

30
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,316
we need you.

31
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,953
The Pym Particle is a miracle.<br>Please.

32
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:26,121
Don't let your past<br>determine the future.

33
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:29,325
As long as I am alive,

34
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:32,462
nobody will ever<br>get that formula.

35
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,603
We shouldn't let him<br>leave the building.

36
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:43,840
You've already lied to him.<br>Now you want to go to war with him?

37
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:45,540
Yes.

38
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,343
Our scientists haven't come close<br>to replicating his work.

39
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,879
He just kicked<br>your ass, full-size.

40
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:53,793
You really want to find out what it's like<br>when you can't see him coming?

41
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:55,951
I've known Hank<br>Pym for a long time.

42
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,219
He's no security risk.

43
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,156
Unless we make him one.

44
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,497
You like that?

45
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,899
You like that?

46
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,167
Come get you some now.

47
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:56,978
You didn't even move.

48
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,314
Nah.

49
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:01,016
What if I come in on the left side, right?<br>Just down here.

50
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,217
You see this right here?

51
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:12,427
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

52
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,097
I'm gonna miss you,<br>too, Peachy.

53
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:18,199
Man, you guys got<br>the weirdest goodbye rituals.

54
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,235
All right, break it up.

55
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,372
Break it up!<br>Break it up!

56
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:40,990
Scotty!

57
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,625
What's up, man!

58
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,193
Damn! Hey.

59
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,496
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

60
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:50,231
Hey, what's up with your eye?

61
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:53,068
Oh. Well,<br>what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

62
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:55,003
Oh, yeah.<br>I still got my scar from a year ago.

63
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:56,338
Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,639
Yeah.

65
00:03:57,673 --> 00:04:00,276
You know what? I'm still the<br>only one who knocked him out.

66
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:03,145
Well, I definitely didn't.

67
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,980
Thanks for<br>picking me up, brother.

68
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:07,149
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss<br>my celly getting out?

69
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,317
Hey, how's your girl, man?

70
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,519
Oh, she left me.

71
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,219
Oh.

72
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,455
Yeah, my ma died, too.

73
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,590
And my dad got deported.

74
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:17,459
But I got the van!

75
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,593
It's nice.

76
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:19,694
Yeah, right?

77
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,331
Thanks for the hook-up, too.<br>I needed a place to stay.

78
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,500
You wait till you see this couch.<br>You're gonna be really happy.

79
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,035
You're gonna be on your feet<br>in no time. Watch.

80
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,603
- I hope so.<br>- Yeah.

81
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,004
And I gotta<br>introduce you to some

82
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,271
people.<br>Some really skilled people.

83
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,774
- Not interested.<br>- Yeah, right.

84
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,142
No, I'm serious, man.<br>I'm not going back.

85
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,146
I got a daughter<br>to take care of.

86
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,216
You know that jobs don't<br>come easy for ex-cons, right?

87
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,985
Look, man, I got a master's<br>in electrical engineering, all right?

88
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,286
I'm gonna be fine.

89
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:49,791
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

90
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,660
Would you like to try our<br>Mango Fruit Blast?

91
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,228
Uh, no, thanks.

92
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:56,464
Um, I will have...<br>I'll have a burger, please.

93
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,267
Oh, we don't...<br>We don't make that.

94
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,071
Pretzel.<br>Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

95
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:04,139
It's ice cream.<br>Baskin-Robbins.

96
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,343
I'll just do, like,<br>whatever's hot and fresh.

97
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,310
Dude.

98
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,112
Can I see you in the back,<br>chief? Pronto.

99
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,682
Sure thing, Dale.

100
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,386
Darby, could you just, uh,<br>take care of this idiot? Thanks.

101
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:20,740
Hey, Dale.

102
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,824
Come on in.

103
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:23,158
Pull up some chair.

104
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,064
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

105
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,331
You found out.

106
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,466
Baskin-Robbins<br>always finds out.

107
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,336
Look, I'm sorry, all right?<br>But I...

108
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,603
No one would hire me.

109
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,307
Breaking and entering.<br>Grand larceny.

110
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,576
Look, I'm sorry.

111
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,110
I don't do it anymore.<br>I just...

112
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,144
Respect.

113
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,281
I couldn't be happier about it.

114
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:46,781
- Really?<br>- Yeah.

115
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,817
Thank you. Thank you.

116
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,687
You really stuck it<br>to those billionaire SOBs.

117
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,255
The more I read about<br>what you did and stuff...

118
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,625
I'm like,<br>"Wow, I know this guy?

119
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:58,827
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,463
Well,<br>I'm very happy in this job,

121
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:03,632
and I really just appreciate<br>the opportunity to...

122
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,134
Well, you're fired, of course.

123
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,170
I can't really keep you on.

124
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,738
Wait, what? Fired?

125
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,740
Yeah.

126
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:14,442
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.<br>I mean, I'm a good worker.

127
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,146
No, it wasn't a violent crime.<br>It was a cool crime.

128
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,747
I'll tell you what, though.

129
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,783
This will be totally off the books,<br>off the records,

130
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,653
but if you want to grab<br>one of those Mango Fruit Blasts

131
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,254
on your way out the door,

132
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:28,524
I'll just pretend<br>I didn't see it.

133
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:08,930
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

134
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,733
I thought you were<br>supposed to be at work.

135
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,634
I was. I got fired.

136
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,470
Damn.<br>They find out who you are?

137
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:15,838
Yeah.

138
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,605
Baskin-Robbins<br>always finds out, bro.

139
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,408
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

140
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,276
You want some waffles?

141
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,745
Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

142
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:24,547
Oh. That's Kurt.

143
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,899
He was Folsom for five years.<br>He's a wizard on that laptop.

144
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:28,750
Nice meet you.

145
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:29,903
Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

146
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:31,819
Who are you?

147
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:33,255
Dave.

148
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,158
Nice work on the Vista job.

149
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,661
Vista job, yes.

150
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:41,396
No, no.<br>I have heard of this robbery.

151
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,666
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.<br>Robbery involves threat.

152
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,435
I hate violence.<br>I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

153
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,771
You mean you're a pussy.

154
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,338
Yeah.

155
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,839
They were overcharging<br>the customers, right?

156
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,576
And it added up to millions.

157
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,810
He blows<br>the whistle and he gets fired.

158
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,379
And what does he do?

159
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,415
He hacks into<br>the security system

160
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:02,350
and transfers millions<br>back to the people that they stole it from.

161
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:04,319
Posts all the bank records online.

162
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,512
And he drove the dude's Bentley<br>into his swimming pool.

163
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,658
What are you doing?

164
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,728
Hmm?

165
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,862
Why are you telling my<br>life story to these guys?

166
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:15,997
What do you want?

167
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:17,533
Okay.

168
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,802
My cousin talked to this guy<br>two weeks ago

169
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,002
about this little perfect job.

170
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:22,771
No way.

171
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,607
No, no, no. Wait!<br>This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

172
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,975
No!

173
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,444
I'm finished, man.<br>I'm not going back to jail.

174
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:30,379
It's some retired millionaire<br>living off his golden parachute.

175
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,413
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

176
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,317
I don't care. I'm out.

177
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,436
Dr. Pym?

178
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:56,905
Yes. I'm still alive.

179
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:04,945
ID?

180
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:08,551
Perhaps that will suffice.

181
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,754
Very sorry, sir.<br>Please come in.

182
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,859
Is that Hank Pym?

183
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,431
Good morning, Hank.

184
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,799
Hope.

185
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:28,070
Would it kill<br>you to call me Dad?

186
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,837
Dr.<br>Cross will be so pleased that

187
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,572
you could find<br>the time to join us today.

188
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,509
More like "thrilled."

189
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:38,413
I was surprised to receive<br>any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

190
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,682
What's the occasion?

191
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:41,616
Oh, you'll see.<br>Won't he, Hope?

192
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,822
We're ready for you inside.

193
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:49,823
Ouch.

194
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:54,797
I guess some old wounds<br>never heal, huh?

195
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,398
Don't worry,<br>she's in good hands.

196
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:00,035
You're in for a treat.

197
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:06,676
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.<br>How's retirement?

198
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:08,943
How's your face?

199
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,716
After you.

200
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,793
Now, before we start,<br>I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

201
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,961
This company's<br>founder and my mentor,

202
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:28,663
Dr. Hank Pym.

203
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,514
When I took over this company<br>for Dr. Pym,

204
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,783
I immediately started<br>researching a particle

205
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:51,653
that could change<br>the distance between atoms,

206
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,990
while increasing<br>density and strength.

207
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,926
Why this revolutionary idea<br>remained buried

208
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,162
beneath<br>the dust and cobwebs of

209
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,498
Hank's research,<br>I couldn't tell you.

210
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,500
But just imagine,

211
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:08,571
a soldier<br>the size of an insect.

212
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,576
The ultimate secret weapon.

213
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:27,623
An Ant-Man.

214
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,893
That's what they called you.<br>Right, Hank?

215
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,731
Silly, I know.

216
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,667
Propaganda.

217
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,403
Tales to astonish!

218
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,105
Trumped-up BS to<br>scare the USSR.

219
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,842
Hank, will you tell our guests<br>what you told me

220
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,147
every single time I asked you,

221
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:55,517
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

222
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,219
Just a tall tale.

223
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,086
Right.

224
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,456
Because how could anything<br>so miraculous possibly be real?

225
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,736
Well, I was inspired by the legend<br>of the Ant-Man.

226
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,639
And with my breakthrough<br>shrinking inorganic material,

227
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:21,509
I thought, could it be possible<br>to shrink a person?

228
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,013
Could that be done?

229
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,817
Well,<br>it's not a legend anymore.

230
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:32,687
Distinguished guests,

231
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:36,591
I am proud to present<br>the end of warfare as we know it.

232
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,259
The Yellowjacket!

233
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,868
Oh, no.

234
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,203
The Yellowjacket<br>is an all-purpose weapon of war

235
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,840
capable of altering<br>the size of the wearer

236
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,975
for the ultimate<br>combat advantage.

237
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,879
We live in an era

238
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,813
in which the weapons<br>we use to protect ourselves

239
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,750
are undermined<br>by constant surveillance.

240
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:04,552
It's time to<br>return to a simpler age.

241
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,288
One where the powers of freedom<br>can once again operate openly

242
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,524
to protect their interests.

243
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,793
An all-purpose<br>peace-keeping vessel,

244
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,995
the Yellowjacket<br>can manage any conflict

245
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,663
on the geopolitical landscape

246
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:18,267
completely unseen.

247
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,270
Efficient in both preventative<br>measures and tactical assault.

248
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,139
Practical applications<br>include surveillance,

249
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:26,524
industrial sabotage,

250
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:31,879
and the elimination of obstructions<br>on the road to peace.

251
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:33,749
A single Yellowjacket

252
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:35,551
offers the user<br>unlimited influence

253
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,019
to carry out protective actions.

254
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:40,788
And, one day soon,<br>an army of Yellowjackets

255
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:43,258
will create<br>a sustainable environment

256
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,894
of well-being<br>around the world.

257
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,830
The Yellowjacket.

258
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,264
So, it's a suit?

259
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:55,671
Don't be crude, Frank.

260
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:59,206
It's not a suit,<br>it's a vessel.

261
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,841
What's the matter?<br>You're not impressed?

262
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,778
No, I'm impressed.<br>I'm also concerned.

263
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:06,847
Imagine what our enemies<br>could do with this tech.

264
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,317
We should have a longer<br>conversation about that, Frank.

265
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,086
I really value your opinion.

266
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,623
Thank you for coming. Hope?

267
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:17,091
Thank you very much, everybody.<br>I will escort you out now.

268
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,125
Thank you.

269
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:23,365
You seem a bit shocked.

270
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:27,668
Darren, there's a reason<br>that I buried these secrets.

271
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,639
So you finally admit it!

272
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:34,809
We could have done this together, Hank.<br>But you ruined that.

273
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,110
That's why you're the past<br>and I'm the future.

274
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:39,114
Don't do this.

275
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:40,816
Dr. Cross?

276
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:45,086
You sell to me first,<br>20% over your asking price,

277
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,855
I can have the cash<br>here in two weeks.

278
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,356
Deal.

279
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:59,033
We have to<br>make our move, Hank.

280
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,302
How close is he?

281
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:03,105
He still can't<br>shrink a live subject.

282
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:05,340
Just give me the suit and let me<br>finish this once and for all.

283
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:07,075
No.

284
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,744
I have Cross' complete trust.

285
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:09,878
It's too dangerous.

286
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,647
We don't have a choice.

287
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,381
Well,<br>that's not entirely true.

288
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,186
I think I found a guy.

289
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,389
Who?

290
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,094
Daddy!

291
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,663
Peanut! Oh!

292
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,931
Happy birthday!

293
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,265
I'm so sorry I'm late.

294
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,868
I didn't know<br>what time your party started.

295
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,269
It was on the invitation.

296
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,104
He didn't get an invitation.

297
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,972
But he came anyway!

298
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,942
Well, I'm not gonna miss<br>my little girl's birthday party.

299
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,778
I'm gonna go tell<br>Mommy you're here.

300
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:43,845
Oh, you don't...

301
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,179
What are you doing here, Lang?

302
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,014
You haven't paid<br>a dime of child support.

303
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,216
You know, right now, if I wanted to,<br>I could arrest you.

304
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,951
It's good to see<br>you too, Paxton.

305
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:52,854
Mommy's so happy you're here,<br>she choked on her drink.

306
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,924
Hey, look what I have for you.

307
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,360
Can I open it now?

308
00:15:58,393 --> 00:16:00,129
Of course, sweetheart.<br>It's your birthday.

309
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,134
You're my bestest friend.

310
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,369
What is that thing?

311
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,104
He's so ugly!

312
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,907
I love him!

313
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,341
Can I go show my friends?

314
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:16,110
Of course, sweetheart.<br>Go ahead.

315
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,783
You're my bestest friend.

316
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:20,014
Look, the child support<br>is coming, all right?

317
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,116
It's just hard finding a job<br>when you have a record.

318
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,919
I'm sure you'll figure it out.<br>But for now, I want you out of my house.

319
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:26,321
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.<br>- It's my house!

320
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:27,913
- So what? It's my kid!<br>- Scott!

321
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:31,326
You can't just show up here.<br>You know that. Come on.

322
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,827
It's a birthday party.

323
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,196
Yeah, I know,<br>but you can't just show up.

324
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,897
She's my daughter.

325
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,131
You don't know the first thing<br>about being a father.

326
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,100
Maggie,<br>I tell you this as a friend,

327
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,936
and as the first<br>love of my life.

328
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,971
Your fiance is an asshat.

329
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,306
He's not an asshat.

330
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,841
Hey, watch your language.<br>Okay?

331
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,075
What language? I said "hat."

332
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,277
Stop it.

333
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,047
Really, Maggie? That guy?

334
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,749
Come on! You could marry<br>anyone you want,

335
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:54,950
and you have to<br>get engaged to a cop?

336
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:56,418
At least he's not a crook.

337
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,288
I'm trying, okay?<br>I've changed. I'm straight.

338
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:03,458
I had a job and...

339
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:06,994
I wanna provide.

340
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,930
I had a lot of time to think about it<br>and I love her.

341
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,865
So much.

342
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,401
I've missed so much time<br>and I wanna be a part of her life.

343
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,433
What do I do?

344
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:17,038
Get an apartment,

345
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,540
get a job, pay child support.

346
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:23,278
And then we will talk about visitation,<br>I promise.

347
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,413
You're her hero, Scott.

348
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:30,251
Just be the person<br>that she already thinks you are.

349
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,756
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns<br>about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

350
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,914
Yeah. Well, uh...

351
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:04,185
Unfortunately,<br>we can't just do whatever we want.

352
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,520
It'd be nice though, right?

353
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,088
But there are laws.

354
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,326
What laws? Of man?

355
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,862
The laws of nature<br>transcend the laws of man.

356
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,830
And I've transcended<br>the laws of nature.

357
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:22,203
Darren, I don't<br>think you understand...

358
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,208
Hmm.

359
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,546
We still haven't<br>worked out all the bugs.

360
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,318
Goodbye, Frank.

361
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:52,500
Thank you.

362
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,441
You know, I've been thinking a lot<br>about gratitude lately.

363
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,042
And today,<br>during my morning meditation,

364
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,411
an interesting<br>thought occurred to me,

365
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,880
and I think it<br>might apply to you, too.

366
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,248
How's that?

367
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,083
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

368
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:13,121
I've spent years carrying around<br>my anger for Hank Pym.

369
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,990
I devoted my genius to him.

370
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,459
I could have worked anywhere.

371
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,994
I chose my mentor poorly.

372
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,431
You didn't even have a choice.

373
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,433
He never believed in you.

374
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,170
It's a shame<br>what we had to do,

375
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,640
but he forced us<br>to do it, didn't he?

376
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:35,410
But we shouldn't be angry,<br>we should be grateful.

377
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,380
Because his<br>failures as a mentor,

378
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:41,282
as a father,

379
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:44,185
forced us to spread our wings.

380
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,958
You're a success, Darren.

381
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,126
You deserve everything<br>coming your way.

382
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:13,414
Ooh.

383
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:15,083
Stop cheating.

384
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,419
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

385
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:20,721
Maybe he didn't hear you.

386
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:21,755
How was the party?

387
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:29,698
Tell me about that tip.

388
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,333
What?

389
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,367
I wanna know about that tip.

390
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:36,270
Oh, baby, it's on!<br>It's so on, right now.

391
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,339
Calm down, all right?<br>I just need to know where it came from.

392
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:39,473
It's gotta be airtight.

393
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,742
Okay.

394
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:44,144
I was at a wine tasting<br>with my cousin Ernesto.

395
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,513
Which was mainly reds,<br>and you know I don't like reds, man.

396
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,750
But there was a rose that saved the day.<br>It was delightful.

397
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,617
And then he tells<br>me about this girl,

398
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:53,020
Emily,<br>that we used to kick it with.

399
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:53,755
It was actually the first pair of boobs<br>I ever touched.

400
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,390
It's the wrong details.

401
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,025
It has nothing to<br>do with the story.

402
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,727
Go.

403
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,996
So,<br>uh, he tells me that she's

404
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,630
working as<br>a housekeeper now, right?

405
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,566
And she's dating<br>this dude, Carlos,

406
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,768
who's a shot caller<br>from across the bay.

407
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,170
And she tells him about the dude<br>that she's cleaning for.

408
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,638
Right? That he's<br>like this big-shot CEO

409
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,741
that is all retired now,<br>but he's loaded.

410
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:17,378
And so, Carlos and Ernesto<br>are on the same softball team,

411
00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:19,513
and they get to talking,<br>right?

412
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:22,616
And here comes the good part.<br>Carlos says, "Yo, man.

413
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,752
"This guy's got<br>a big-ass safe just

414
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,788
"sitting in the basement,<br>just chilling."

415
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,288
Of course Ernesto<br>comes to me because

416
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,356
he knows I got<br>mad thieving skills.

417
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,192
Of course, I ask him...

418
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,127
"Did Emily tell<br>Carlos to tell you

419
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,194
"to get to me what<br>kind of safe it was?"

420
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,096
And he says, "Nah, dawg.

421
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,066
"All she said is<br>that it's super-legit

422
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,778
"and whatever's in it,<br>it's gotta be good."

423
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,671
What?

424
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,240
Old man have safe.

425
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,777
And he's gone for a week.

426
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,478
All right.<br>There's an old man,
he's got a safe,

427
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,613
and he's gone for a week.

428
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,780
Let's just work with that.

429
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:54,281
You know what I'm saying?

430
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:46,500
Landline's cut,<br>cell signal's jammed.

431
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,702
No one will be making<br>for distress call tonight.

432
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:49,770
Comm check.

433
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:51,705
- Check.<br>- Check.

434
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:53,240
Hey, if the job goes bad,<br>you know I got your back, right?

435
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:54,576
Don't worry.

436
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:56,611
It's not gonna happen.

437
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,039
I love it when he gets cocky.

438
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,155
Damn!

439
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,218
Alarm is dead.

440
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,250
Nice.

441
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,790
All right,<br>I'm moving through the house.

442
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,285
There's a fingerprint<br>lock on the door.

443
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,557
It's got what?<br>Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

444
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,721
Aw, man, are we screwed?

445
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,691
Not necessarily.

446
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:06,374
I'm in.

447
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,809
No alarms have been triggered.<br>He's in like the Flynn.

448
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,715
Oh, man.

449
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:16,851
What is it?

450
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:19,721
Well, they weren't kidding.<br>This safe is serious.

451
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:21,788
How serious<br>are we talking, Scotty?

452
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,557
It's a Carbondale.

453
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,259
It's from 1910.

454
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,894
Made from the same<br>steel as the Titanic.

455
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,430
Wow.

456
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,432
Can you crack it?

457
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:34,402
Well, here's the thing.<br>It doesn't do so well in the cold.

458
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:35,569
Remember what that iceberg did?

459
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,372
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

460
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:38,640
Killed everybody.

461
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:40,275
Did not kill the old lady.

462
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,277
She still throw<br>the jewel into the oceans.

463
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,730
What are you doing?

464
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,403
I poured water in the locking mechanism<br>and froze it with nitrogen.

465
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:42,103
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

466
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:44,471
- What are you doing now?<br>- Waiting.

467
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:46,708
Waiting.

468
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:55,950
Nice.

469
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:01,855
What is it?<br>Cash? Jewels?

470
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,992
- There's nothing here.<br>- What did you say?

471
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:07,878
It's a suit.

472
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,063
What?

473
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,999
It's an old motorcycle suit.

474
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,968
There's no cash,<br>no jewelry, nothing?

475
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,436
No.

476
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:17,538
It's a bust.

477
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,906
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

478
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,710
I know you needed to score.

479
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,869
I thought we were using mice.

480
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,814
What's the difference?

481
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:06,520
Commence Experiment 34-C.<br>Organic atomic reduction.

482
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:08,522
Darren, maybe we should think...

483
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,758
Shrinking organic tissue<br>is the centerpiece of this technology.

484
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,750
I can't go to the buyers<br>with half a breakthrough.

485
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:41,622
Experiment 34-C results,

486
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:42,654
negative.

487
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,464
Sanitize the work station.<br>Bring in subject 35-C.

488
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,195
Why would you lock this up?

489
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:27,000
This is so weird.

490
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,567
Scotty, what's up, man?

491
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,009
I wonder...<br>What is this?

492
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,575
The world<br>sure seems different

493
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:42,175
from down here,<br>doesn't it, Scott?

494
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,878
What? Who said that?

495
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,787
Luis, down here!

496
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:56,624
It's a trial by fire, Scott.<br>Or, in this case,

497
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:57,656
water.

498
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:24,218
Guess you're tougher<br>than you thought.

499
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,453
Oh, I don't want to see this!

500
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,124
Luis!

501
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,329
Son of a...

502
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,776
What the hell?

503
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,412
Not bad for a test drive.

504
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,780
Keep the suit.<br>I'll be in touch.

505
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:02,784
No! No! No, thank you!

506
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,030
Get down on the ground!

507
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:19,032
You are under arrest!

508
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,367
No, I didn't steal anything!<br>I was returning something I stole.

509
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:22,401
Oh...

510
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:26,339
Don't move.

511
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:31,979
You know,<br>you almost had us convinced

512
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,381
that you were<br>gonna change your ways.

513
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,384
They were really<br>rooting for you.

514
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,221
It's gonna break their hearts.

515
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:44,224
You got a visitor.

516
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:45,759
Who?

517
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:46,794
Your lawyer.

518
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:48,930
My lawyer?

519
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:55,435
I told you I'd<br>be in touch, Scott.

520
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:58,972
I'm starting to think that<br>you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

521
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:00,807
Oh, man.

522
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Sit down.

523
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:09,416
Sir,<br>I'm sorry I stole the suit.

524
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,152
I don't even wanna know<br>why you have it.

525
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:13,153
Maggie was right about you.

526
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:16,422
How do you know about...

527
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:18,496
No wonder she's trying<br>to keep you away from Cassie.

528
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:21,094
The moment things get hard,

529
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,362
you turn right back to crime.

530
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,300
The way I see it,<br>you have a choice.

531
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,536
You can either spend<br>the rest of your life in prison,

532
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:33,206
or go back to your cell

533
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,543
and await further instructions.

534
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,077
I don't understand.

535
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,480
No, I don't expect you to.

536
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:42,416
But you don't have many options<br>right now, and quite frankly,

537
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,052
neither do I.

538
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,556
Why do you think I let you<br>steal that suit in the first place?

539
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:49,588
What?

540
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,304
Second chances<br>don't come around all that much.

541
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:06,606
So, next time you think<br>you might see one,

542
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,911
I suggest you take<br>a real close look at it.

543
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,391
You're my bestest friend!

544
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,260
Are you sure you<br>don't want a different toy?

545
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,030
No, I love this one.

546
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:32,365
Okay. Well,<br>get some sleep. I love you.

547
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,869
- Mommy?<br>- Hmm?

548
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:37,570
Is Daddy a bad man?

549
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,440
I heard some<br>grownups say he's bad.

550
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,577
No.

551
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,447
Daddy just gets<br>confused sometimes, you know?

552
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:40,668
Smart choice.<br>You actually listened, for once.

553
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:43,135
Under the door.

554
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,710
Okay, where to now?

555
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,512
- Hang tight.<br>- Oh, God.

556
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,615
What, what?

557
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,050
Where the hell did he go?

558
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,284
I have no idea.<br>He just vanished.

559
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:00,286
Set up a five-block perimeter.<br>Now!

560
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,056
Get back! Get back!

561
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:04,425
Scott,<br>these are my associates.

562
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,159
Is that a camera on an ant?

563
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:08,128
Yeah, sure. Why not?

564
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:09,362
Where's the car?

565
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,731
No car. We've got wings.

566
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:12,032
Incoming!

567
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:25,278
Put your foot on the central<br>node and mount the thorax.

568
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,311
- How safe is...<br>- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

569
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,195
Why am I on a police car?

570
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:43,764
Shouldn't I not<br>be on a police car?

571
00:37:43,797 --> 00:37:45,565
So they can give you a lift

572
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,432
past their<br>five-block perimeter.

573
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,168
All right.

574
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:50,204
- Now, what's the next move?<br>- Hang on tight.

575
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:52,039
Oh, this is easy!<br>I'm getting the hang of this.

576
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:53,773
Yank up to go up.<br>It's like a horse.

577
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:55,675
You're<br>throwing 247 off balance.

578
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,543
Wait, his name is 247?

579
00:37:57,577 --> 00:37:59,346
He doesn't have a name,<br>he has a number, Scott.

580
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,648
Do you have any idea<br>how many ants there are?

581
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,650
Whoa!

582
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,385
Maybe it's...<br>Maybe it's 248.

583
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:07,153
No, no!<br>Vertigo, vertigo!

584
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:08,021
No, I think it's 247.

585
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:09,289
Wait.

586
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,157
Hang on tight!

587
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,293
I think<br>I'm getting the hang of this.

588
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:16,130
I am controlling 247.<br>He is not listening to you.

589
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,563
What?

590
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,166
- Can I make one little request?<br>- No.

591
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,302
Stop, 247!<br>Time out, time out.

592
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:24,338
Time out.

593
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:25,505
All right, hold on.

594
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:28,141
Just wait! Whoa!

595
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:30,143
What happens<br>if I throw up in this helmet?

596
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:33,313
It's my helmet, Scott.<br>You do not throw up.

597
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:34,815
Let's set<br>her down, all right?

598
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:36,083
I'm getting light-headed.

599
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:37,650
Hang on, Scott.

600
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:39,686
I'm getting a little light...

601
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,322
I need a snooze button.

602
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,525
Hit me in 5 minutes.

603
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,378
Hello.

604
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
Who are you?

605
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:13,820
Have you been standing there,<br>watching me sleep, this whole time?

606
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:14,822
Yes.

607
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,324
Why?

608
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,597
Because the last time you were here,<br>you stole something.

609
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:22,228
Oh. Oh.

610
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:23,896
Hey, look...

611
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:26,164
Whoa!

612
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:32,371
Paraponera clavata.

613
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:34,141
Giant tropical bullet ants,

614
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:35,775
ranked highest<br>on the Schmidt pain index.

615
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,688
They're here to<br>keep an eye on you when I can't.

616
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:41,347
Dr. Pym's waiting<br>for you downstairs.

617
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:43,148
Who?

618
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:46,385
Hey!

619
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,090
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

620
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,431
How am I supposed to do this?

621
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:06,706
All right,<br>just one step at a time.

622
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:09,842
Ugh!

623
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,815
You don't bite me,<br>I don't step on you. Deal?

624
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,221
I could take down the servers

625
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,356
and Cross<br>wouldn't even know it.

626
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,856
We don't need this guy.

627
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:26,193
I assume that you've already<br>met my daughter, Hope.

628
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,661
I did. She's great.

629
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:31,164
She doesn't think<br>that we need you.

630
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:32,632
We don't.<br>We can do this ourselves.

631
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,702
I go to all this effort<br>to let you steal my suit,

632
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:38,572
and then Hope<br>has you arrested.

633
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,474
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,<br>I'll do it myself.

634
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:43,643
She's a little bit anxious.

635
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,545
It has to do with this job,

636
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:47,748
which, judging by the fact<br>that you're sitting opposite me,

637
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,317
I take it that<br>you're interested in.

638
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:51,485
What job?

639
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:52,518
Would you like some tea?

640
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,788
Uh... Sure.

641
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,657
I was very impressed with

642
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,260
how you managed to get<br>past my security system.

643
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,563
Freezing that metal<br>was particularly clever.

644
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,264
Were you watching me?

645
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:08,568
Scott, I've been<br>watching you for a while.

646
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:10,771
Ever since you<br>robbed Vista Corp.

647
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:14,273
Oh! Excuse me.

648
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,876
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

649
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,746
Vista's security<br>system was one of

650
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,715
the most advanced<br>in the business.

651
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,516
It was supposed<br>to be unbeatable.

652
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,518
But you beat it.

653
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:26,920
Would you like some sugar?

654
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,521
Yeah, thanks.

655
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:33,661
You know what? I'm okay.

656
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:40,867
How do you make them do that?

657
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,769
Ants can lift objects<br>50 times their weight.

658
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:47,474
They build, farm,<br>they cooperate with each other.

659
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,476
Right. But how do you<br>make them do that?

660
00:41:51,644 --> 00:41:56,817
I use electromagnetic waves<br>to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

661
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,387
I speak to them.

662
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,623
I can go anywhere,<br>hear anything,

663
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:04,324
and see everything.

664
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,826
And still know<br>absolutely nothing.

665
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:07,661
I'm late to meet Cross.

666
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:13,500
Uh... Dr. Pym?

667
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:16,369
You don't need to<br>raise your hand, Scott.

668
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:19,338
Sorry,<br>I just have one question.

669
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,307
Who are you, who is she,<br>what the hell's going on,

670
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,876
and can I go back to jail now?

671
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:24,911
Come with me.

672
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,014
40 years ago,<br>I created a formula

673
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,282
that altered atomic<br>relative distance.

674
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:30,751
Huh?

675
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:32,719
I learned how to change<br>the distance between atoms.

676
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,487
That's what powers the suit.

677
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:35,989
That's why it works.

678
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:38,425
Wow.

679
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:45,398
- Whoa!<br>- But it was dangerous.

680
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,967
It was too dangerous.

681
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,572
So I hid it from the world.

682
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:55,045
And that's when I switched gears<br>and I started my own company.

683
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:57,043
Pym Tech.

684
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,512
Yes.

685
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:03,382
I took on a young protege<br>called Darren Cross.

686
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,518
Darren Cross.

687
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,985
He's a big deal.

688
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:08,588
But before he was a big deal,<br>he was my assistant.

689
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:12,826
I thought I saw something in him.<br>The son I never had, perhaps.

690
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:15,394
He was brilliant,<br>but as we became close,

691
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:18,864
he began to suspect<br>that I wasn't telling him everything.

692
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:22,635
He heard rumors about<br>what was called the Pym Particle,

693
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:26,340
and he became obsessed<br>with recreating my formula.

694
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,342
But I wouldn't help him.

695
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,378
So he conspired against me and<br>he voted me out of my own company.

696
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:32,978
How could he do that?

697
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:35,648
The board's chairman<br>is my daughter, Hope.

698
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:36,817
She was the deciding vote.

699
00:43:39,385 --> 00:43:41,021
But she came back to me

700
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:43,856
when she saw how close<br>Cross was to cracking my formula.

701
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,594
The process is highly volatile.

702
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,530
If one isn't protected<br>by a specialized helmet,

703
00:43:50,563 --> 00:43:54,034
it can affect<br>the brain's chemistry.

704
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,536
I don't think<br>Darren realizes this,

705
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,840
and, you know, he's not<br>the most stable guy to begin with.

706
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:01,842
So, what do you want from me?

707
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,847
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves<br>a shot at redemption.

708
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,914
Do you?

709
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,416
I do.

710
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,786
If you can help me,

711
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:16,356
I promise I can help you be<br>with your daughter again.

712
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,760
Now, are you ready<br>to redeem yourself?

713
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,161
Absolutely.

714
00:44:22,195 --> 00:44:25,065
My days of breaking into places<br>and stealing shit are done.

715
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:28,101
What do you want me to do?

716
00:44:28,134 --> 00:44:30,971
I want you to break into a place<br>and steal some shit.

717
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,773
Are you gonna be home<br>for dinner tonight?

718
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:39,945
Uh, yeah.<br>I'll pick something up.
Text me.

719
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:41,815
Okay. Good news?

720
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,849
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

721
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:46,420
Are you trying<br>to find my daddy?

722
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:50,023
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

723
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:52,793
I just want your<br>daddy to be safe.

724
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,961
Hope you don't catch him.

725
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,009
This isn't<br>the first time these guys

726
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,878
have tried to get their hands<br>on game-changing weaponry.

727
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:50,016
That's Mitchell Carson,<br>Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

728
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:52,751
Presently in the business<br>of toppling governments.

729
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,887
He always wanted my tech.

730
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,090
And now, unless we break in<br>and steal the Yellowjacket

731
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:01,061
and destroy all the data,

732
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:06,099
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos<br>upon the world.

733
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:12,806
I think our first move should be<br>calling the Avengers.

734
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:16,076
I spent half my life

735
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:19,545
trying to keep this technology<br>out of the hands of a Stark.

736
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:23,182
I'm sure as hell not gonna<br>hand-deliver it to one now.

737
00:46:23,215 --> 00:46:26,619
This is not some cute technology<br>like the Iron Man suit.

738
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:29,021
This could change<br>the texture of reality.

739
00:46:31,157 --> 00:46:32,992
Besides,<br>they're probably too busy

740
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:35,795
dropping cities<br>out of the sky.

741
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,563
Okay, then why don't you<br>just send the ants?

742
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:40,800
Scott, they are ants.

743
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:44,170
Ants, they can do a lot of things,<br>but they still need a leader.

744
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:48,108
Somebody that could<br>infiltrate a place

745
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,543
that's designed to<br>prevent infiltration.

746
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:52,211
Hank, I'm a thief, all right?<br>I mean,

747
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:54,213
I'm a good thief,<br>but this is insane.

748
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:56,583
He's right, Hank.<br>And you know it.

749
00:46:56,615 --> 00:46:59,552
You've seen the footage,<br>you know what Cross is capable of.

750
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:00,987
I was against using him<br>when we had months,

751
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,023
and now we have days.

752
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:04,090
I'm wearing the suit.

753
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:06,025
Absolutely not!

754
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,762
I know the facility inside and out.<br>I know how Cross thinks.

755
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:10,730
I know this mission<br>better than anybody here.

756
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:13,199
We need you close to Cross.<br>Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

757
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,333
We don't have<br>time to screw around!

758
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:15,802
Hope, please<br>listen to me...

759
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:17,103
He is a criminal!<br>I'm your daughter.

760
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,271
No!

761
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:58,677
She's right, Hank.

762
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,947
I'm not your guy.

763
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,181
Why don't you wear the suit?

764
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:05,652
You think I don't want to?

765
00:48:05,684 --> 00:48:06,887
I can't.

766
00:48:08,788 --> 00:48:10,190
I spent years wearing it,

767
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:13,260
and it took a toll on me.

768
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:21,969
You're our only option.

769
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,710
Before Hope lost her mother,

770
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:34,280
she used to look at me like<br>I was the greatest man in the world.

771
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:39,219
And now she looks at me<br>and there's just disappointment.

772
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,757
It's too late for me,

773
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:47,793
but not for you.

774
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:49,996
This is your chance.

775
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:53,699
The chance to earn that look<br>in your daughter's eyes.

776
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:58,304
To become the hero<br>that she already thinks you are.

777
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:00,407
It's not about<br>saving our world.

778
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,143
It's about saving theirs.

779
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,115
Damn. That was a good speech.

780
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:10,784
Scott,

781
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,655
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

782
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,726
In the right hands,

783
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,697
the relationship<br>between man and suit is symbiotic.

784
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,333
The suit has power.<br>The man harnesses that power.

785
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:30,235
You need to be skillful,<br>agile, and above all,

786
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:31,737
you need to be fast.

787
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,739
You should be able<br>to shrink and grow

788
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,340
on a dime.

789
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:38,445
So your size<br>always suits your needs.

790
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,847
Now dive through the keyhole,<br>Scott.

791
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,418
You charge big, you dive small,<br>then you emerge big.

792
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,056
Ow!

793
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:51,958
Ahhh!

794
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,726
Ow!

795
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,760
Useless.

796
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:58,498
When you're small,<br>energy's compressed,

797
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,900
so you have the force<br>of a 200-pound man

798
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:04,070
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.<br>You're like a bullet.

799
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:07,474
You punch too hard, you kill someone.<br>Too soft, it's a love tap.

800
00:50:07,507 --> 00:50:09,275
In other words,<br>you have to know how to punch.

801
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:10,510
I was in prison for three years.<br>I know how to punch.

802
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:12,512
Show me.

803
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:14,304
- Terrible.<br>- You wanna show me how to punch?

804
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,882
Show me...

805
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:19,318
That's how you punch.

806
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:20,753
She's been<br>looking forward to this.

807
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:22,222
No kidding.

808
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:24,891
Hope trained in martial arts<br>at a difficult time.

809
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:27,025
Oh, by "difficult time,"<br>he means when my mother died.

810
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,161
We lost her in a plane crash.

811
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,963
It's bad enough<br>you won't tell me how she died.

812
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:32,398
Could you please stop<br>telling me that lie?

813
00:50:32,431 --> 00:50:34,233
We're working, here.

814
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,123
All right, princess.<br>Let's get back to work.

815
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:42,108
Were you going for the hand?

816
00:50:48,847 --> 00:50:50,817
You know, I think this regulator<br>is holding me back.

817
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:53,385
Do not screw<br>with the regulator.

818
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:55,221
If that<br>regulator is compromised,

819
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:57,023
you would go subatomic.

820
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:59,492
What does that mean?

821
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:01,561
It means that you would enter<br>a quantum realm.

822
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:03,262
What does that mean?

823
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,398
It means that you<br>would enter a reality

824
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:07,833
where all concepts<br>of time and space

825
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:08,967
become irrelevant

826
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:11,438
as you shrink<br>for all eternity.

827
00:51:12,371 --> 00:51:15,007
Everything that you know

828
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:16,342
and love,

829
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:18,844
gone forever.

830
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:23,115
Cool.<br>Yeah, if it ain't broke...

831
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:24,583
You've learned about the suit,

832
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:27,286
but you've yet to learn<br>about your greatest allies,

833
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:29,621
the ants.

834
00:51:30,222 --> 00:51:31,590
Loyal, brave,

835
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:33,393
and your partners on this job.

836
00:51:39,865 --> 00:51:42,601
Paratrechina longicornis.<br>Commonly known as crazy ants.

837
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,971
They're lightning fast<br>and can conduct electricity,

838
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:47,206
which makes them useful<br>to fry out enemy electronics.

839
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:49,141
You're not so crazy.

840
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:51,376
Hey!

841
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:52,512
You're cute.

842
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:03,889
That was a lot<br>scarier a second ago.

843
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:16,603
It looks like the Futures Lab<br>has its own isolated power supply.

844
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:18,605
There's a security<br>guard posted around the clock.

845
00:52:18,637 --> 00:52:21,074
We'll need you to take him out<br>to deactivate the security systems.

846
00:52:21,106 --> 00:52:23,443
Okay, who's next?

847
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:27,547
Paraponera clavata.

848
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,014
I know.<br>Bullet ants, right?

849
00:52:29,047 --> 00:52:30,483
Number 1 on<br>the Schmidt pain index?

850
00:52:30,516 --> 00:52:32,318
Hey, guys.<br>Remember me from the bedroom?

851
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,289
The Yellowjacket pod<br>is hermetically sealed,

852
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:38,958
and the only<br>access point is a tube

853
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,527
we estimate to be about<br>5 millimeters in diameter.

854
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,463
Why do I have a sick feeling<br>in my stomach?

855
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:45,931
The tube is protected<br>by a laser grid,

856
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:47,666
and we can only<br>power that down for 15 seconds.

857
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:50,235
You're gonna need to signal<br>the crazy ants to blow the servers,

858
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:52,371
retrieve the suit,<br>and exit the vaults

859
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:54,407
before<br>the backup power comes on.

860
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,277
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

861
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,911
Alternatively known<br>as a carpenter ant.

862
00:52:58,945 --> 00:53:01,581
Ideal for ground<br>and air transport.

863
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:03,282
Wait a minute,<br>I know this guy.

864
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,119
I'm gonna call<br>him "Ant-thony."

865
00:53:07,152 --> 00:53:08,454
That's good. That's very good.

866
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:10,657
Because this time,<br>you're really gonna

867
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,159
have to learn<br>how to control him.

868
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:16,061
Tell them to put<br>the sugar in the teacup.

869
00:53:18,664 --> 00:53:19,965
Aw! You okay? Did I hurt...

870
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,112
Hank wants you outside<br>for target practice.

871
00:53:34,146 --> 00:53:36,385
The suit has no weapons,<br>so I made you these discs.

872
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:37,449
Red shrinks.

873
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:40,219
Blue enlarges.

874
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:44,990
Solenopsis mandibularis.

875
00:53:45,023 --> 00:53:47,159
Known for their bite,

876
00:53:47,193 --> 00:53:49,661
the fire ants have evolved<br>into remarkable architects.

877
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,132
They are handy to<br>get you in and out of difficult places.

878
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:03,443
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

879
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,380
They're not listening to me.

880
00:54:08,414 --> 00:54:11,150
You have to commit.<br>You have to mean it.

881
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:13,219
No shortcuts, no lies.

882
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,420
Throwing<br>insults into the mix

883
00:54:15,454 --> 00:54:17,757
will not do<br>anyone any good, Hope.

884
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:19,525
We don't have time for coddling.

885
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:21,594
Our focus should<br>be on helping Scott!

886
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:22,996
Really?

887
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:25,682
Is that where our<br>focus should be?

888
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:51,224
Hope!

889
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:02,568
I don't know why I came to you<br>in the first place.

890
00:55:11,577 --> 00:55:13,679
We can't do this without her.

891
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:19,385
Oh, God.

892
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:21,420
You gotta lock your doors.

893
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:24,389
I mean, really, there's some weird folks<br>in this neighborhood.

894
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:27,092
Do you think this is a joke?

895
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:29,494
Do you have any idea what<br>he's asking you to risk?

896
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:30,797
You have a daughter.

897
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:32,764
I'm doing this for her.

898
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:35,237
You know, when my mother died,<br>I didn't see him for two weeks.

899
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:37,302
He was in grief.

900
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:38,838
Yeah,<br>so was I, and I was seven.

901
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:42,175
And he never came back.<br>Not in any way that counted.

902
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,728
He just sent me off<br>to boarding school.

903
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:46,376
You know, I thought,

904
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:48,681
with all that's at stake,

905
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:51,684
just maybe we might have<br>a chance of making peace.

906
00:55:51,717 --> 00:55:53,686
But, even now,<br>he still wants to shut me out.

907
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:56,621
He doesn't wanna shut you out.<br>He trusts you.

908
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,291
Then why are you here?

909
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:00,126
It proves that he loves you.

910
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,596
Hope. Look at me.

911
00:56:05,297 --> 00:56:06,733
I'm expendable.

912
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,601
That's why I'm here.

913
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:12,838
You must have<br>realized that by now.

914
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:14,751
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit<br>and you're not.

915
00:56:17,175 --> 00:56:19,112
He would rather<br>lose this fight than lose you.

916
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:22,213
Anyway...

917
00:56:23,615 --> 00:56:26,619
You know, I didn't know<br>you had a daughter

918
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:28,655
when I called the cops on you.

919
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:33,891
What's her name?

920
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:36,429
Cassie.

921
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:38,731
It's a pretty name.

922
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:43,802
You have to clear<br>your mind, Scott.

923
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:45,403
You have to make<br>your thoughts precise.

924
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:47,206
That's how it works.

925
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,208
Think about Cassie.

926
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:53,746
About how badly you want to see her.<br>And use that to focus.

927
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:04,523
Open your eyes

928
00:57:04,556 --> 00:57:06,726
and just think about<br>what you want the ants to do.

929
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:30,782
That's good!

930
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:51,637
Your mother convinced me

931
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:55,407
to let her join<br>me on my missions.

932
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,476
They called her the Wasp.

933
00:57:57,509 --> 00:57:59,711
She was born to it.

934
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,315
And there's not<br>a day that goes by

935
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:07,219
that I don't<br>regret having said yes.

936
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:14,327
It was 1987.

937
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,630
Separatists had hijacked<br>a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

938
00:58:20,365 --> 00:58:22,936
and launched an ICBM<br>at the United States.

939
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:33,778
The only way to<br>the internal mechanics

940
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,748
was through solid titanium.

941
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:49,996
I knew I had to shrink between<br>the molecules to disarm the missile.

942
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:52,898
But my regulator had sustained<br>too much damage.

943
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,469
Your mother,

944
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:57,670
she didn't hesitate.

945
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:01,440
Janet! No!

946
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,682
She turned off her regulator

947
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:12,952
and went subatomic

948
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,722
to deactivate the bomb.

949
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,360
And she was gone.

950
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:26,898
Your mom died a hero.

951
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:32,003
And I spent the next 10 years

952
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:36,342
trying to learn all I could<br>about the quantum realm.

953
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:41,847
You were trying<br>to bring her back.

954
00:59:43,882 --> 00:59:47,286
But all I learned<br>was we know nothing.

955
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,893
It's not your fault.

956
00:59:56,494 --> 00:59:57,929
She made her choice.

957
01:00:03,635 --> 01:00:07,373
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

958
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:09,976
I was trying to protect you.

959
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,612
I lost your mother.

960
01:00:15,847 --> 01:00:18,518
I didn't mean<br>to lose you, too.

961
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,719
I'm sorry.

962
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:25,358
This is awesome.

963
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,561
It's awesome, you know?

964
01:00:28,594 --> 01:00:30,514
You guys are breaking down walls,<br>you're healing.

965
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:32,798
It's important.

966
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,436
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

967
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:38,971
Yes, you did. Yes.

968
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:41,873
I'm going to make some tea.

969
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:48,780
Nailed it!

970
01:00:58,056 --> 01:00:59,891
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

971
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:32,891
The final phase of your training<br>will be a stealth incursion.

972
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:34,460
It's freezing!

973
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:37,496
You couldn't make a suit<br>with a flannel lining?

974
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:40,532
You must retrieve this prototype<br>of a signal decoy.

975
01:01:40,565 --> 01:01:43,135
It's a device that I invented<br>during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

976
01:01:43,168 --> 01:01:44,903
We need it to counteract<br>the transmission blockers

977
01:01:44,936 --> 01:01:46,606
that Cross installed<br>in the Futures vault.

978
01:01:48,106 --> 01:01:50,141
It's currently collecting dust

979
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:52,878
in one of Howard Stark's old<br>storage facilities in upstate New York.

980
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,914
Should be a piece of cake.

981
01:01:54,947 --> 01:01:56,882
You're over the target area.

982
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:59,452
Disengage now, Scott!

983
01:01:59,485 --> 01:02:00,485
Squadron A, go!

984
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:01,820
B, go!

985
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:06,458
C, go!

986
01:02:06,492 --> 01:02:09,829
All right, Ant-thony,<br>please don't drop me this time.

987
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:13,065
Oh, it feels like a big leap<br>from sugar cubes to this!

988
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,097
Stay calm.

989
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:18,103
Guys?<br>We might have a problem.

990
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:21,606
Hank, didn't you say<br>this was some old warehouse?

991
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:22,639
It's not!

992
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,777
You son of a bitch!

993
01:02:28,146 --> 01:02:30,014
- Scott, get out of there.<br>- Abort!

994
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:31,750
Abort now!

995
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,985
No, it's okay. It doesn't look<br>like anyone's home.

996
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:36,054
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

997
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:38,090
He's gonna lose the suit.

998
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:39,625
He's gonna lose his life.

999
01:02:45,697 --> 01:02:47,657
All right, I'm on the roof<br>of the target building.

1000
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,101
Somebody's home, Scott.

1001
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:54,806
What's going on<br>down there, Sam?

1002
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,809
It's the Falcon!

1003
01:02:56,842 --> 01:02:58,744
I had a sensor trip<br>but I'm not seeing anything.

1004
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:00,579
Wait a second.

1005
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:02,648
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1006
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:04,048
It's okay. He can't see me.

1007
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:05,184
I can see you.

1008
01:03:05,217 --> 01:03:06,217
He can see me.

1009
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,889
Hi. I'm Scott.

1010
01:03:10,922 --> 01:03:12,590
Did he just say,<br>"Hi, I'm Scott"?

1011
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,126
What are you doing here?

1012
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,994
First off, I'm a big fan.

1013
01:03:16,027 --> 01:03:17,588
Appreciate it.<br>So, who the hell are you?

1014
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:19,297
I'm Ant-Man.

1015
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:20,833
"Ant-Man"?

1016
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:23,001
What? You haven't heard of me?

1017
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:25,170
No, you wouldn't<br>have heard of me.

1018
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:26,905
You wanna tell<br>me what you want?

1019
01:03:26,938 --> 01:03:29,208
I was hoping I could grab<br>a piece of technology.

1020
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,210
Just for a few days.<br>I'm gonna return it.

1021
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:33,913
I need it to save the world.<br>You know how that is.

1022
01:03:33,945 --> 01:03:35,181
I know exactly how that is.

1023
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:37,248
Located the breach.

1024
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:38,762
- Bringing him in.<br>- Sorry about this!

1025
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,690
What the hell are you doing?

1026
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:49,161
Breach is an adult male,

1027
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:50,594
who has some sort<br>of shrinking tech.

1028
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:04,976
Sorry!

1029
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,329
Look, I'm sorry about this.<br>Sorry.

1030
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,079
That's enough!

1031
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:32,804
Ant-thony! A little help!

1032
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:46,650
I've lost visual.

1033
01:04:55,827 --> 01:04:57,128
He's inside my pack!

1034
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:58,197
Sorry!

1035
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:01,277
You seem like<br>a really great guy.

1036
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:29,961
It's really important to me<br>that Cap never finds out about this.

1037
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:36,735
That was completely irresponsible<br>and dangerous!

1038
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:39,672
You jeopardized everything!

1039
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,222
You got it.

1040
01:06:00,224 --> 01:06:01,260
Well done.

1041
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:02,327
Wait a minute.

1042
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,829
Did you just compliment me?

1043
01:06:03,862 --> 01:06:05,097
He did, didn't he?

1044
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,965
Kind of sounded like he did.

1045
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:09,768
I was good, wasn't I?

1046
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:15,074
Hey, how about the fact that<br>I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1047
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:17,443
Let us not dwell on the past.

1048
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:19,378
We gotta finish our planning.

1049
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:23,416
Don't mind him.

1050
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:25,184
You did good.

1051
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:33,291
Darren.

1052
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:37,963
How the hell did<br>you get in here?

1053
01:06:39,164 --> 01:06:41,800
You left<br>the front door open, Hank.

1054
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:42,867
It's official.

1055
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,003
You're old.

1056
01:06:44,802 --> 01:06:45,802
The plans.

1057
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:48,773
He will kill him.

1058
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:54,480
Well, to what do I<br>owe this pleasure?

1059
01:06:55,914 --> 01:06:57,248
I have good news.

1060
01:06:57,282 --> 01:06:58,349
Really?

1061
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:01,119
What's that?

1062
01:07:01,152 --> 01:07:05,824
Pym Tech,<br>the company you created,

1063
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:07,826
is about to<br>become one of the most

1064
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:09,927
profitable<br>operations in the world.

1065
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,298
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,<br>tomorrow alone.

1066
01:07:19,938 --> 01:07:21,072
You're welcome.

1067
01:07:25,577 --> 01:07:28,547
I know this is odd,<br>but I'd like you to be there.

1068
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:30,349
This is my moment.<br>I want you to see it.

1069
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:33,418
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1070
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,753
I'll be there.

1071
01:07:52,003 --> 01:07:53,239
What did you see in me?

1072
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:56,942
I don't know what you mean.

1073
01:07:56,974 --> 01:07:59,378
All those years ago,<br>you picked me.

1074
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:00,945
What did you see?

1075
01:08:03,081 --> 01:08:05,449
I saw myself.

1076
01:08:05,483 --> 01:08:07,887
Then why did you push me away?

1077
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,791
Because I saw<br>too much of myself.

1078
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,103
He knows.<br>He's baiting you.

1079
01:08:25,136 --> 01:08:27,072
We have to call it off.

1080
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,140
We're all taking risks.

1081
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:29,507
What if he saw me here?

1082
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:31,143
He didn't. There's no way.

1083
01:08:31,176 --> 01:08:32,176
How do you know that?

1084
01:08:40,985 --> 01:08:42,154
Darren, hi.

1085
01:08:42,186 --> 01:08:45,024
Hope, where are you right now?

1086
01:08:45,657 --> 01:08:46,891
I'm at home. Why?

1087
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,926
I just saw Hank.

1088
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,029
I still get nothing<br>but contempt from him.

1089
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:54,432
Don't let him rile you up.<br>He's just a senile old man.

1090
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:57,002
We need to start<br>everyone working around the clock.

1091
01:08:57,034 --> 01:08:58,904
Get the assembly<br>line up and running.

1092
01:08:58,936 --> 01:09:00,238
And I'm tripling security.

1093
01:09:00,271 --> 01:09:02,341
Full sensors at all entrances

1094
01:09:02,373 --> 01:09:05,644
and exterior air vents<br>fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1095
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:08,279
Great. Good idea.

1096
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:11,483
Thank you, Hope.<br>I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1097
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,657
He's tripling security.<br>He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1098
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:20,893
But he is not onto you.

1099
01:09:20,926 --> 01:09:23,127
He's adding full body scanners<br>to all entrances

1100
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:25,162
and closing exterior vents.

1101
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:26,931
How are we gonna<br>get Scott inside?

1102
01:09:28,432 --> 01:09:29,969
The water main.

1103
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:33,238
You can't add<br>security to a water main.

1104
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,439
The pressure is too strong,<br>but if we can decrease it,

1105
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:37,242
that's how I get in.

1106
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,211
Somebody would have to reach<br>the building's control center

1107
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:40,444
to change the water pressure.

1108
01:09:40,478 --> 01:09:42,079
Hank and I will<br>be beside Cross.

1109
01:09:42,113 --> 01:09:43,247
How are we<br>supposed to do that?

1110
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,582
So we expand our team.

1111
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:46,652
What do we need?

1112
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:48,420
A fake security<br>guard on the inside

1113
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:50,122
to de-pressurize<br>the water system,

1114
01:09:50,154 --> 01:09:52,024
somebody else to hack in<br>to the power supply

1115
01:09:52,056 --> 01:09:53,358
and kill the laser grid,

1116
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:56,127
and a getaway guy.

1117
01:09:56,161 --> 01:10:00,498
No, no. No, no, no.<br>Not those three wombats.
No way.

1118
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:02,533
Thank you for<br>the coffee, ma'am.

1119
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:05,537
It's not too often that you rob a place<br>and then get welcomed back.

1120
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,439
Because we just robbed you.

1121
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:12,610
You know that he was arrested<br>for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1122
01:10:12,644 --> 01:10:14,179
Two smoothie machines.

1123
01:10:14,212 --> 01:10:15,646
Are you sure they<br>can handle this?

1124
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,448
Oh, we can handle it.<br>We're professionals.

1125
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:21,219
You'll forgive us if we're not<br>instilled with confidence.

1126
01:10:21,252 --> 01:10:23,587
Well, hey, everybody just kick back<br>and relax a little bit, man.

1127
01:10:23,621 --> 01:10:25,289
We know our business.

1128
01:10:25,323 --> 01:10:27,426
We broke into this<br>spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1129
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:29,127
I let you.

1130
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:32,497
Well, one could say<br>that I let you let me.

1131
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,231
Look, it's okay.<br>They can handle this.

1132
01:10:34,265 --> 01:10:36,068
Yeah, we can handle it.

1133
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,502
- You got their credentials?<br>- He's in the system.

1134
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,037
I'm in the system?

1135
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,104
You're in the system.

1136
01:10:40,137 --> 01:10:41,340
The system?

1137
01:10:41,372 --> 01:10:43,742
Yeah, we're doomed.

1138
01:10:43,774 --> 01:10:45,210
All right.

1139
01:10:45,243 --> 01:10:46,610
There's something<br>you guys need to see.

1140
01:10:46,644 --> 01:10:48,713
When you get to this corner,

1141
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:51,350
there's gonna be three offices<br>on your left side.

1142
01:10:51,382 --> 01:10:52,518
Damn!

1143
01:10:54,386 --> 01:10:57,355
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1144
01:10:57,389 --> 01:11:00,125
Now, look,<br>this is gonna get weird, all right?

1145
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:01,626
It's pretty freaky,<br>but it's safe.

1146
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:03,462
There's no<br>reason to be scared.

1147
01:11:03,494 --> 01:11:04,662
Oh, no, no.<br>Daddy don't get scared.

1148
01:11:04,695 --> 01:11:06,597
- Really?<br>- Yeah.

1149
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:07,631
Good.

1150
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:17,074
This is the work of gypsies.

1151
01:11:17,108 --> 01:11:18,310
That's witchcraft.

1152
01:11:18,342 --> 01:11:20,078
Wow, that's amazing.

1153
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,613
That's like some<br>David Copperfield shit.

1154
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:22,581
That's some kind of wizardry.

1155
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:23,782
This is sorcery!

1156
01:11:23,814 --> 01:11:25,350
How'd you do that, bro?

1157
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:27,182
Don't freak out.<br>Look at your shoulder.

1158
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:29,020
Ahhh!

1159
01:11:29,054 --> 01:11:30,521
Get off! Get off!

1160
01:11:30,555 --> 01:11:33,158
Wait, I thought<br>Daddy didn't get scared!

1161
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:37,029
I gave them each half a Xanax

1162
01:11:37,061 --> 01:11:39,296
and Hank explained the science<br>of the suit to them.

1163
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:42,300
They fell right asleep.

1164
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:44,802
Hey, look,<br>I wanna thank you for...

1165
01:11:44,836 --> 01:11:46,805
No, please don't.

1166
01:11:46,837 --> 01:11:48,305
We're all doing<br>this for reasons

1167
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:49,541
much bigger<br>than any one of us.

1168
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:51,510
I'm just glad<br>that you might have

1169
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:53,444
a slight chance of<br>maybe pulling this off.

1170
01:11:53,478 --> 01:11:56,614
Hey, thank you, you know,<br>for that pep talk.

1171
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:59,184
You know, the honest truth is,<br>I actually went from despising you

1172
01:11:59,216 --> 01:12:01,052
to almost liking you.

1173
01:12:01,086 --> 01:12:02,654
You really<br>should write poetry.

1174
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:07,658
Get some sleep, Scott.

1175
01:12:58,376 --> 01:12:59,644
All right,<br>just so we're clear,

1176
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:01,246
everyone here knows<br>their role, right?

1177
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:02,747
- Dave?<br>- Wheels on the ground.

1178
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:04,315
- Kurt?<br>- Eyes in the sky.

1179
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:05,649
- Luis?<br>- Oh, man, you know it.

1180
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:07,385
You know what?<br>I get to wear a uniform.

1181
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,886
- That's what's up.<br>- Luis.

1182
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,355
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.<br>I'm just excited.

1183
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:12,791
Plus,<br>your girlfriend's really hot.

1184
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:14,158
So, you know,<br>that makes me nervous, too.

1185
01:13:14,192 --> 01:13:15,260
And you are very beautiful,<br>ma'am.

1186
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:17,194
- Oh, my Lord.<br>- She's not my...

1187
01:13:17,228 --> 01:13:18,467
You know what?<br>I was thinking of

1188
01:13:18,496 --> 01:13:20,431
a tactic,<br>like when I go undercover.

1189
01:13:20,465 --> 01:13:21,632
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying?<br>To like, blend in.

1190
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:24,703
No.<br>Don't whistle. No whistling.

1191
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,604
It's not The Andy Griffith Show.<br>No whistling.

1192
01:13:44,555 --> 01:13:45,657
All clear in Sector One.

1193
01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:51,795
Step out.

1194
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:55,734
All clear.

1195
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:02,541
We're set.

1196
01:14:03,341 --> 01:14:04,475
Wish me luck.

1197
01:14:15,853 --> 01:14:17,655
Utilities online.

1198
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:32,570
Hey! What are you doing?

1199
01:14:32,604 --> 01:14:36,774
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,<br>so I'm securing it.

1200
01:14:38,408 --> 01:14:39,978
I'm the boss.

1201
01:14:40,011 --> 01:14:41,512
- Oh.<br>- Utilities 1.3...

1202
01:14:55,627 --> 01:14:57,729
Water level is dropping!

1203
01:15:26,457 --> 01:15:28,326
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1204
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:29,560
All right, I see it.

1205
01:15:37,935 --> 01:15:39,604
All right, come on,<br>I gotta get up there.

1206
01:15:39,636 --> 01:15:40,877
That's it.<br>That's it, guys! Yes!

1207
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:47,279
Yes! You got it!<br>You got it! Come on!

1208
01:15:51,783 --> 01:15:53,023
All right,<br>let's fly, Ant-thony.

1209
01:16:04,695 --> 01:16:06,797
The Ant-Man is<br>in the building.

1210
01:16:06,831 --> 01:16:09,533
Pym's pulling up.<br>Right on time.

1211
01:16:11,802 --> 01:16:13,671
Got a Crown Vic<br>right outside there.

1212
01:16:13,704 --> 01:16:15,573
This is problem?

1213
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:17,309
Considering the Crown Vic's<br>the most commonly used car

1214
01:16:17,341 --> 01:16:18,341
for undercover cops, man,

1215
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:20,444
yes, this is problem.

1216
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:25,481
That's Pym.

1217
01:16:28,353 --> 01:16:29,787
Oh, no.

1218
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,622
I'm<br>deploying the bullet ants.

1219
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:34,426
Papanera Claire<br>de Merna Merna...

1220
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:35,493
I don't remember what it's called,<br>but I feel bad for this guy.

1221
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:37,962
- What's up, man?<br>- Hey.

1222
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:45,002
Ow! Ow!

1223
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:49,440
See? That's what<br>I'm talking about.

1224
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:51,609
That's what I call<br>an unfortunate casualty

1225
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:53,645
in a very serious operation.

1226
01:17:02,886 --> 01:17:05,724
Signal decoy in place.

1227
01:17:05,756 --> 01:17:08,893
Mean,<br>pretty lady did good, Scott.

1228
01:17:08,926 --> 01:17:11,029
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1229
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:13,030
Scott, we have problem.

1230
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:14,765
Problem?<br>What's the problem?

1231
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,136
Dave! Dave,<br>that's not part of plan!

1232
01:17:18,168 --> 01:17:20,037
Listen to me.

1233
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:23,641
If I don't get into this building,<br>people will die.

1234
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:26,077
That's awfully dramatic.

1235
01:17:28,912 --> 01:17:30,015
Are you kidding me?

1236
01:17:34,652 --> 01:17:36,421
Problem solved.

1237
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:52,570
Well...

1238
01:17:54,538 --> 01:17:55,974
How do I look?

1239
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:06,484
There he is.

1240
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:11,088
Just in time. Come on.

1241
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:22,734
12-point verification.

1242
01:18:22,766 --> 01:18:24,769
Little over-the-top,<br>don't you think, Darren?

1243
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,003
Confirming authorization level.

1244
01:18:26,037 --> 01:18:27,905
Well,<br>you can never be too safe.

1245
01:18:27,939 --> 01:18:29,458
Access granted.

1246
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:38,006
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1247
01:18:38,615 --> 01:18:40,819
You really did it.

1248
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:42,487
And you only know<br>the half of it, Hank.

1249
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,114
Arriving in second position.

1250
01:19:12,216 --> 01:19:14,085
All right, top speed,<br>Ant-thony. Let's go!

1251
01:19:25,296 --> 01:19:26,564
Proceeding to command position.

1252
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:45,984
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1253
01:19:47,885 --> 01:19:50,020
All right, guys.<br>I'm in position.

1254
01:19:50,054 --> 01:19:51,788
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1255
01:19:51,822 --> 01:19:54,259
No, no, no, no, no!

1256
01:19:55,592 --> 01:19:56,592
Did you see that?

1257
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,836
Assume formation.

1258
01:20:04,868 --> 01:20:06,804
All right,<br>you cute little crazies,

1259
01:20:06,837 --> 01:20:08,172
let's fry these servers!

1260
01:20:20,784 --> 01:20:22,654
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1261
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,234
Servers are fried.

1262
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:38,735
Data backup completely erased.

1263
01:20:38,769 --> 01:20:40,288
Heading to the particle chamber.

1264
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:48,313
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1265
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:54,918
My associates have agreed<br>to your terms.

1266
01:20:54,952 --> 01:20:56,654
Wonderful.

1267
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:59,289
Mr. Carson introduced me<br>to these fine gentlemen here.

1268
01:20:59,323 --> 01:21:00,958
They're<br>representatives of Hydra.

1269
01:21:00,992 --> 01:21:02,193
They're not what they were.

1270
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,729
They're doing some<br>interesting work.

1271
01:21:04,761 --> 01:21:07,931
And I'm enjoying myself.

1272
01:21:07,965 --> 01:21:10,167
You tried to hide<br>your technology from me.

1273
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:12,036
And now it's gonna<br>blow up in your face.

1274
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:17,774
Wow.

1275
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:21,779
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming<br>a mile away,

1276
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:23,747
but I just figured it'd<br>be all pathetic and weak.

1277
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,082
Well, you figured wrong.

1278
01:21:26,283 --> 01:21:27,618
I know this van.

1279
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,253
Anybody home?

1280
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,100
All right, guys. I'm here.

1281
01:21:41,832 --> 01:21:43,201
I'm setting the charges.

1282
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:05,122
Great job, guys.<br>I'll take it from here.

1283
01:22:14,465 --> 01:22:17,034
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1284
01:22:18,002 --> 01:22:19,003
Final position.

1285
01:22:27,845 --> 01:22:30,180
Guys, how we looking<br>on that laser grid?

1286
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:31,815
- Almost.<br>- No, you're not.

1287
01:22:31,849 --> 01:22:33,328
- I'm getting close!<br>- No, you're not.

1288
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:39,457
San Francisco P.D.!

1289
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:40,489
Out of the van!

1290
01:22:41,091 --> 01:22:42,126
I know you're in there!

1291
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:43,261
Make it go faster.

1292
01:22:43,293 --> 01:22:44,295
Dude, seriously.

1293
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:52,170
Ready to jump.<br>Do you read, Kurt?

1294
01:22:52,203 --> 01:22:54,137
So close.

1295
01:22:54,171 --> 01:22:55,773
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!<br>- Freeze!

1296
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,742
There was a black guy<br>that looked exactly like me

1297
01:22:57,774 --> 01:22:59,377
who attacked us and put us<br>in the back of this disgusting van.

1298
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:00,712
- Get out of the van!<br>- Okay, I'm coming.

1299
01:23:00,744 --> 01:23:02,779
Take it easy!

1300
01:23:02,813 --> 01:23:04,381
No, I will not move!<br>Go now!

1301
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:07,984
Wait!

1302
01:23:08,018 --> 01:23:09,217
What?<br>What do you mean, "Wait"?

1303
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:16,828
Phew!

1304
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:20,331
What? What?

1305
01:23:22,032 --> 01:23:23,268
Hey, little guy.

1306
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,149
I always suspected you had<br>a suit stored away somewhere.

1307
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:40,217
Which begs the question,

1308
01:23:40,251 --> 01:23:42,453
who is the new Ant-Man?

1309
01:23:42,485 --> 01:23:44,956
Who is the man<br>that my beloved mentor

1310
01:23:44,988 --> 01:23:46,890
trusted even more than me?

1311
01:23:49,126 --> 01:23:51,362
Scott Lang.

1312
01:23:52,829 --> 01:23:54,465
A martyr

1313
01:23:54,497 --> 01:23:57,001
who took on the system<br>and paid the price,

1314
01:23:57,033 --> 01:24:00,470
losing his family<br>and his only daughter in the process.

1315
01:24:00,503 --> 01:24:04,942
Exactly your<br>kind of guy, Hank!

1316
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:09,380
He escapes his jail cell<br>without leaving any clue as to how.

1317
01:24:12,283 --> 01:24:13,752
And then he<br>disappears magically,

1318
01:24:15,118 --> 01:24:17,287
despite having no<br>money to his name.

1319
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,791
And now he brings<br>me the Ant-Man suit.

1320
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:25,962
The only thing that<br>can rival my creation.

1321
01:24:25,996 --> 01:24:29,466
Darren, don't do this.

1322
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,802
If you sell to these men,

1323
01:24:31,836 --> 01:24:33,136
it's gonna be chaos.

1324
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:34,805
I already have.

1325
01:24:34,838 --> 01:24:36,140
And for twice the price,

1326
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:38,442
thanks to you.

1327
01:24:38,475 --> 01:24:41,878
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate<br>an Avengers facility.

1328
01:24:41,912 --> 01:24:43,948
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1329
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,917
I'll sell them<br>the Yellowjacket,

1330
01:24:45,949 --> 01:24:47,470
but I'm keeping<br>the particle to myself.

1331
01:24:48,853 --> 01:24:50,287
They don't run on diesel.

1332
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,990
If you want the fuel,<br>you'll have to come to me.

1333
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,194
What do you call the only man

1334
01:24:56,226 --> 01:24:59,831
who can arm the most<br>powerful weapon in the world?

1335
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:02,332
The most powerful<br>man in the world.

1336
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:04,135
You proud of me yet?

1337
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:07,238
You can stop this, Darren.<br>It's not too late.

1338
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,574
It's been too late<br>for a long time now.

1339
01:25:11,942 --> 01:25:13,578
Darren!

1340
01:25:15,145 --> 01:25:17,081
What are you doing?

1341
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:19,350
He wasn't any more capable of<br>caring for you than he was for me.

1342
01:25:19,382 --> 01:25:21,385
This is not who you are.

1343
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:24,055
It's the particles altering<br>your brain chemistry.

1344
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:34,497
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1345
01:25:36,367 --> 01:25:38,603
You're right. I have<br>to be the one to do it.

1346
01:25:41,438 --> 01:25:42,506
Here we go.

1347
01:25:44,108 --> 01:25:47,311
Drop your gun.

1348
01:25:50,113 --> 01:25:53,117
You know, I came to the house<br>the other night to kill him,

1349
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:54,918
but you were there.

1350
01:25:54,952 --> 01:25:57,889
You're sick and I can help you.<br>Just put the gun down.

1351
01:25:57,921 --> 01:25:59,162
I wasn't ready<br>to kill you then,

1352
01:26:00,957 --> 01:26:02,025
but I think I am now!

1353
01:26:02,059 --> 01:26:04,395
Drop your gun now!

1354
01:26:04,427 --> 01:26:07,398
You picked<br>the wrong side, Hope.

1355
01:26:20,677 --> 01:26:21,880
Dad!

1356
01:26:30,554 --> 01:26:31,655
Hank, no.

1357
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:34,292
No, Hank.

1358
01:26:34,324 --> 01:26:36,327
Hank?<br>Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1359
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:38,439
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1360
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:42,132
Take the suit off, or I'll blow<br>your brains out and peel it off.

1361
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:07,958
Thanks Goldenbeard

1362
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,094
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

1363
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:11,462
Request immediate backup!

1364
01:27:11,494 --> 01:27:12,563
Go, go, go!

1365
01:27:25,676 --> 01:27:27,610
Get me to the roof.

1366
01:27:27,644 --> 01:27:29,447
And radio ahead.

1367
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:31,649
I want to make sure the helicopter<br>is ready to take off.

1368
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:33,216
You two,

1369
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,752
kill anything that<br>comes out of that vault!

1370
01:27:35,786 --> 01:27:38,957
Dad, can you move?

1371
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:42,527
We need to get<br>him out of here.

1372
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:46,463
Go get that suit.

1373
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,274
Hey, Scotty.

1374
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:32,643
Hey, did I save your life?

1375
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,145
Scotty?

1376
01:28:35,179 --> 01:28:37,047
Scotty?

1377
01:28:39,216 --> 01:28:40,650
Thank you, Luis.

1378
01:28:40,684 --> 01:28:42,286
- Are we the good guys?<br>- Yeah.

1379
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:43,421
We're the good guys, right?

1380
01:28:43,453 --> 01:28:44,493
Yeah, we're the good guys.

1381
01:28:45,322 --> 01:28:47,123
Feels kinda weird, you know.

1382
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:49,292
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1383
01:28:49,326 --> 01:28:51,162
Get out of here<br>before this place blows!

1384
01:28:58,101 --> 01:29:01,139
Damn it! That guy.

1385
01:29:02,506 --> 01:29:04,641
Hey!<br>We're getting out of here!

1386
01:29:09,145 --> 01:29:10,613
The charges are set.

1387
01:29:10,646 --> 01:29:12,115
We've gotta find a way out of here.<br>And fast.

1388
01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:14,318
Don't worry.

1389
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:16,753
I'm not gonna die.

1390
01:29:16,787 --> 01:29:18,256
And neither are you.

1391
01:29:19,323 --> 01:29:21,626
It's not a keychain.

1392
01:29:25,128 --> 01:29:27,664
It's total chaos in here!<br>Multiple shots fired!

1393
01:29:38,675 --> 01:29:40,444
And there's a tank.

1394
01:29:50,186 --> 01:29:51,588
A little help!

1395
01:29:53,256 --> 01:29:54,256
I got it.

1396
01:29:55,192 --> 01:29:56,461
We need a doctor!

1397
01:29:57,728 --> 01:29:58,796
We've got him.

1398
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,766
Thank you.

1399
01:30:04,301 --> 01:30:05,670
Let's go!

1400
01:30:21,752 --> 01:30:22,886
Ant-thony!

1401
01:30:36,466 --> 01:30:37,702
Go!

1402
01:30:39,203 --> 01:30:40,443
You're gonna regret that.

1403
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:52,416
Wait a minute!<br>Get out of that van!

1404
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:53,884
- What?<br>- Get out of that van!

1405
01:30:53,917 --> 01:30:55,796
It's too loud, there's a tank.<br>I can't hear you!

1406
01:30:56,886 --> 01:30:59,356
Hey! Hey!

1407
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,497
Are you crazy?<br>Put the gun down!

1408
01:31:06,529 --> 01:31:07,832
The windows!

1409
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:15,605
Did you think you could<br>stop the future with a heist?

1410
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:16,918
It was never just a heist!

1411
01:31:39,395 --> 01:31:40,664
Put the gun down!

1412
01:31:49,472 --> 01:31:51,512
Okay, I got him, I got him.<br>There he is! Go, go, go!

1413
01:32:07,858 --> 01:32:09,694
We gotta set her<br>down somewhere.

1414
01:32:39,689 --> 01:32:42,326
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1415
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:43,998
Playing Disintegration<br>by the Cure.

1416
01:33:22,365 --> 01:33:23,567
Call 911!

1417
01:33:41,952 --> 01:33:43,520
It's okay.

1418
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:49,926
Freeze! Put your hands up!<br>Get them up!

1419
01:33:52,496 --> 01:33:53,730
Scott?

1420
01:33:53,764 --> 01:33:55,431
Paxton,<br>you have to listen to me!

1421
01:34:23,193 --> 01:34:25,695
Paxton, turn around!<br>Take me back!

1422
01:34:25,729 --> 01:34:27,765
I am taking you back.<br>To prison.

1423
01:34:27,797 --> 01:34:30,100
There's something in that backyard<br>that needs to be destroyed.

1424
01:34:30,132 --> 01:34:31,601
In the bug zapper. There...

1425
01:34:33,569 --> 01:34:36,640
You need to desist right now!<br>Your delusions are out of hand.

1426
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:38,876
All units, we have a 2-36

1427
01:34:38,908 --> 01:34:40,844
in progress at<br>840 Winter Street.

1428
01:34:40,877 --> 01:34:42,546
- Cassie!<br>- That's my house.

1429
01:34:59,796 --> 01:35:00,898
Don't be scared.

1430
01:35:02,097 --> 01:35:03,199
Paxton, let me help!

1431
01:35:03,233 --> 01:35:04,467
Don't move.

1432
01:35:04,501 --> 01:35:05,735
Let me help!

1433
01:35:05,769 --> 01:35:06,603
Maggie! What's going on?

1434
01:35:06,636 --> 01:35:07,871
He's got Cassie!

1435
01:35:07,904 --> 01:35:09,605
- Who's got Cassie, honey?<br>- That thing.

1436
01:35:09,639 --> 01:35:11,759
- Thing?<br>- I don't know! I don't know!

1437
01:35:19,783 --> 01:35:21,018
Are you a monster?

1438
01:35:22,853 --> 01:35:24,788
Do I look like a monster?

1439
01:35:25,822 --> 01:35:27,091
I want my daddy!

1440
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,726
I want your daddy, too.

1441
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:35,231
There you are.

1442
01:35:35,265 --> 01:35:36,567
Daddy, is that you?

1443
01:35:38,268 --> 01:35:40,470
Hi, peanut.

1444
01:35:40,503 --> 01:35:42,224
Why don't you pick on<br>someone your own size?

1445
01:35:55,886 --> 01:35:58,221
Now,<br>where did you go, little guy?

1446
01:36:03,693 --> 01:36:04,761
There you are.

1447
01:36:08,765 --> 01:36:09,867
Not just me!

1448
01:36:20,644 --> 01:36:21,878
Damn it!

1449
01:36:22,578 --> 01:36:23,980
Go! Go!

1450
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,802
Scotty needs us,<br>you know what I'm saying?

1451
01:37:19,836 --> 01:37:21,271
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1452
01:37:24,207 --> 01:37:25,576
Back it up.

1453
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:26,643
Back it up, slow.

1454
01:37:26,676 --> 01:37:27,711
Yeah.

1455
01:37:27,743 --> 01:37:28,945
- Back it up.<br>- Yeah.

1456
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:30,680
- Back it up.<br>- Okay.

1457
01:37:32,015 --> 01:37:33,317
- We just back it up, okay?<br>- That's it.

1458
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,751
- Back it up.<br>- That's right.

1459
01:37:34,783 --> 01:37:36,219
Backin' up?

1460
01:37:36,252 --> 01:37:37,820
Yep, just backin' up.

1461
01:37:37,854 --> 01:37:39,054
No, no. Just back it up.

1462
01:37:45,795 --> 01:37:47,631
You insult me, Scott.

1463
01:37:52,135 --> 01:37:55,706
Your very existence<br>is insulting to me.

1464
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:00,944
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you<br>if you were bigger.

1465
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:04,247
Yeah, I agree.

1466
01:38:26,069 --> 01:38:27,070
Cassie!

1467
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:37,847
I'm gonna show you<br>just how insignificant you are.

1468
01:38:39,015 --> 01:38:41,217
Cassie! I'm coming!

1469
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:55,931
That's<br>a messed-up looking dog.

1470
01:38:55,965 --> 01:38:57,134
I'm gonna destroy

1471
01:38:57,167 --> 01:38:58,702
everything you love.

1472
01:39:00,336 --> 01:39:01,971
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1473
01:39:09,912 --> 01:39:11,047
I can't break through.

1474
01:39:12,215 --> 01:39:14,051
It's titanium, you idiot!

1475
01:39:20,189 --> 01:39:22,126
- Get her out of here.<br>- Come on.

1476
01:39:23,326 --> 01:39:24,927
Sorry, sweetheart.

1477
01:39:24,961 --> 01:39:27,229
You have to help Daddy<br>pay for his mistakes.

1478
01:39:27,262 --> 01:39:28,864
- You stay behind me, okay?<br>- Okay.

1479
01:39:28,898 --> 01:39:29,898
Stay behind me.

1480
01:39:31,467 --> 01:39:34,136
I'm gonna have to shrink<br>between the molecules to get in there.

1481
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:36,206
Get away from us!

1482
01:39:38,073 --> 01:39:39,141
Daddy, help!

1483
01:39:39,175 --> 01:39:40,743
I love you, Cassie.

1484
01:40:10,539 --> 01:40:12,007
Daddy, where are you?

1485
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:15,779
You could go subatomic.

1486
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:16,814
You could go subatomic.

1487
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:19,115
Oh, no.

1488
01:40:31,226 --> 01:40:33,896
You would enter a reality

1489
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:38,135
where all concepts<br>of time and space...

1490
01:40:38,167 --> 01:40:42,238
All concepts of time and space<br>become irrelevant.

1491
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:48,145
...all concepts of time and space<br>become irrelevant.

1492
01:40:52,448 --> 01:40:55,284
Come back, Daddy!

1493
01:40:55,318 --> 01:41:01,457
...as you shrink for all eternity.

1494
01:41:03,259 --> 01:41:05,929
Everything that you know

1495
01:41:07,863 --> 01:41:09,399
and love,

1496
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:13,170
gone forever.

1497
01:41:13,203 --> 01:41:14,403
Daddy, where are you?

1498
01:41:32,988 --> 01:41:33,988
Where are you?

1499
01:41:36,893 --> 01:41:38,127
Where are you?

1500
01:41:39,328 --> 01:41:41,131
- Daddy!<br>- Cassie.

1501
01:41:49,005 --> 01:41:50,373
Come back, Daddy!

1502
01:41:54,877 --> 01:41:57,113
Do not screw<br>with the regulator!

1503
01:42:27,676 --> 01:42:29,345
Daddy!

1504
01:42:32,948 --> 01:42:34,350
I love you so much.

1505
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:36,220
I love you, too.

1506
01:42:36,685 --> 01:42:38,020
So much.

1507
01:42:42,557 --> 01:42:44,158
You know, there's<br>a big hole in the roof.

1508
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:48,364
Sorry.

1509
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,103
- Is she all right?<br>- Yeah, she's fine.

1510
01:42:55,171 --> 01:42:56,172
Mommy!

1511
01:42:59,274 --> 01:43:00,476
She's fine, she's fine.

1512
01:43:10,252 --> 01:43:12,255
Scott, please.

1513
01:43:12,287 --> 01:43:14,224
You don't remember anything?

1514
01:43:14,256 --> 01:43:15,457
Hank. I don't.

1515
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:17,895
There must be something else.

1516
01:43:19,595 --> 01:43:22,966
Well, I suppose the human mind

1517
01:43:22,998 --> 01:43:25,469
just can't<br>comprehend the experience,

1518
01:43:27,569 --> 01:43:28,905
but you made it.

1519
01:43:29,572 --> 01:43:31,173
You went in,

1520
01:43:32,574 --> 01:43:34,278
and you got out.

1521
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:38,081
It's amazing.

1522
01:43:38,981 --> 01:43:40,582
Scott,

1523
01:43:40,615 --> 01:43:42,519
I'll walk you out.

1524
01:43:46,488 --> 01:43:47,990
Get some rest.

1525
01:43:56,265 --> 01:43:58,435
Is it possible?

1526
01:44:16,519 --> 01:44:17,619
When did this happen?

1527
01:44:17,653 --> 01:44:19,221
Nothing's happening.

1528
01:44:19,255 --> 01:44:21,323
Whoa. Hold on.<br>Something's kind of happening.

1529
01:44:21,356 --> 01:44:23,259
Well, if that's the case,

1530
01:44:23,292 --> 01:44:25,328
shoot me again.

1531
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,529
Yeah. I don't know<br>what you were doing,

1532
01:44:26,561 --> 01:44:27,997
grabbing and<br>kissing me like that.

1533
01:44:28,030 --> 01:44:30,000
I'm a little surprised myself.

1534
01:44:30,033 --> 01:44:32,268
I have to get somewhere.<br>I'll see you later, Hank.

1535
01:44:32,301 --> 01:44:33,537
Really, Hope.

1536
01:44:34,569 --> 01:44:36,506
- Scott.<br>- Yeah?

1537
01:44:36,538 --> 01:44:38,307
- You're full of shit.<br>- Oh, yeah.

1538
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:42,078
Scott,<br>I met with my captain today.

1539
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:45,215
He wanted a report on the night<br>that you got out of jail.

1540
01:44:45,247 --> 01:44:46,648
Something happened<br>with the cameras.

1541
01:44:47,216 --> 01:44:49,386
Some circuits got fried.

1542
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:53,023
But I told him that<br>you were processed correctly.

1543
01:44:53,055 --> 01:44:54,224
Really?

1544
01:44:54,256 --> 01:44:55,458
Well, yeah.

1545
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,229
Can't be sending Cassie's dad<br>back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1546
01:45:00,262 --> 01:45:02,297
Thank you, Paxton.

1547
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:04,734
I'm blown away.

1548
01:45:04,766 --> 01:45:06,403
Thank you for everything<br>you do for Cassie.

1549
01:45:06,435 --> 01:45:08,471
Well, that's my pleasure.

1550
01:45:09,704 --> 01:45:12,641
But, no.<br>This one, I did for you.

1551
01:45:15,078 --> 01:45:16,345
- This is awkward.<br>- Yeah.

1552
01:45:16,378 --> 01:45:17,396
Yeah.

1553
01:45:18,448 --> 01:45:19,748
I mean, what do we even talk about<br>after all of that?

1554
01:45:19,782 --> 01:45:21,417
- Oh, I know.<br>- What?

1555
01:45:21,451 --> 01:45:22,585
I did my first<br>cartwheel today.

1556
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:24,054
What?

1557
01:45:24,087 --> 01:45:26,523
Yeah. She has been<br>practicing all week.

1558
01:45:26,555 --> 01:45:28,224
But today was the magic day.

1559
01:45:28,256 --> 01:45:29,497
I recorded it on my phone.<br>Here.

1560
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:33,363
No, that can't be Cassie.<br>That's not you.

1561
01:45:33,395 --> 01:45:35,331
- Yeah, it is.<br>- Yeah, it is.

1562
01:45:35,363 --> 01:45:37,233
This is a professional gymnast.<br>There is no way that's you.

1563
01:45:37,265 --> 01:45:38,265
Yeah, that's her.

1564
01:45:39,135 --> 01:45:40,537
Good boy.

1565
01:45:42,637 --> 01:45:45,408
Sweetie, that's<br>pretty amazing, peanut.

1566
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:49,311
Sorry.

1567
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,716
It's work.

1568
01:45:53,381 --> 01:45:54,618
Yeah.

1569
01:45:56,351 --> 01:45:57,587
All right.

1570
01:45:57,619 --> 01:45:59,421
Here's the deal.<br>Just give me the facts.

1571
01:45:59,454 --> 01:46:00,590
Just the facts.<br>Only the facts.

1572
01:46:00,622 --> 01:46:04,761
Breathe.<br>Focus. Keep it simple.

1573
01:46:04,793 --> 01:46:06,563
No, no, no.<br>No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1574
01:46:06,595 --> 01:46:09,265
So, I'm at this art museum<br>with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1575
01:46:09,297 --> 01:46:12,101
And there was this, like,<br>abstract expressionism exhibit.

1576
01:46:12,135 --> 01:46:14,737
But you know me, I'm more<br>like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1577
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:16,139
But there was this one Rothko<br>that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1578
01:46:16,171 --> 01:46:17,306
Luis.

1579
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,574
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1580
01:46:18,608 --> 01:46:20,443
You know,<br>I just get excited and stuff.

1581
01:46:20,475 --> 01:46:22,679
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1582
01:46:22,712 --> 01:46:24,581
"Yo, I met this<br>crazy-fine writer chick

1583
01:46:24,613 --> 01:46:26,381
"at the Spot last night.<br>Like fine-fine.

1584
01:46:26,414 --> 01:46:27,850
"Like crazy-stupid fine."<br>And he

1585
01:46:27,884 --> 01:46:30,220
"goes up to<br>the bartender and goes,

1586
01:46:30,252 --> 01:46:31,820
"Look at the girl I'm with.<br>You know what I'm sayin'?

1587
01:46:31,854 --> 01:46:34,157
"She's<br>crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1588
01:46:34,189 --> 01:46:35,792
The bartender's all like,<br>"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1589
01:46:35,824 --> 01:46:38,528
So this writer<br>chick tells Ignacio,

1590
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,762
"Yo, I'm like a boss<br>in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1591
01:46:40,796 --> 01:46:42,198
"and I got mad connects<br>with the peeps behind the curtains,

1592
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:43,432
"you know what I'm saying?"

1593
01:46:43,466 --> 01:46:45,335
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1594
01:46:45,368 --> 01:46:47,170
And she's like,<br>"Yeah, you know what,

1595
01:46:47,203 --> 01:46:48,872
I can't tell you<br>who my contact is,

1596
01:46:48,904 --> 01:46:49,538
"because he works<br>with the Avengers."

1597
01:46:49,572 --> 01:46:51,140
Oh, no.

1598
01:46:51,173 --> 01:46:52,375
Yeah, and this dude sounds<br>like a badass, man.

1599
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:54,344
Like,<br>he comes up to her and says,

1600
01:46:54,377 --> 01:46:55,744
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude<br>who's new on the scene,

1601
01:46:55,778 --> 01:46:57,846
"who's flashing<br>his fresh tack,

1602
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,582
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?<br>Who you got?"

1603
01:46:59,614 --> 01:47:01,216
And she's like,<br>"Well, we got everything

1604
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:03,819
nowadays.<br>We got a guy who jumps.

1605
01:47:03,853 --> 01:47:05,287
"We got a guy who swings,<br>we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1606
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:07,689
"You gotta be more specific."

1607
01:47:07,722 --> 01:47:09,192
And he's like,<br>"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1608
01:47:09,225 --> 01:47:10,493
And I'm, like, "Damn!"<br>I got all nervous

1609
01:47:10,525 --> 01:47:12,162
'cause I'd keep mad<br>secrets for you, bro.

1610
01:47:12,194 --> 01:47:14,229
So I asked Ignacio,

1611
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:15,832
"Did the badass tell<br>the stupid-fine writer chick

1612
01:47:15,864 --> 01:47:17,533
"to tell you to tell me,<br>because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1613
01:47:17,567 --> 01:47:18,768
"that he's looking for him?"

1614
01:47:19,435 --> 01:47:21,805
And? What'd he say?

1615
01:47:25,274 --> 01:47:26,710
He said, "Yes."

1616
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:23,893
There's something<br>I want to show you.

1617
01:49:26,494 --> 01:49:29,532
I realized you<br>can't destroy power.

1618
01:49:31,466 --> 01:49:34,970
All you can do is make sure<br>that it's in the right hands.

1619
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:44,079
This is an advanced prototype

1620
01:49:44,113 --> 01:49:46,783
that your mother and I<br>worked on together.

1621
01:49:48,551 --> 01:49:51,887
She never got to use it.

1622
01:49:51,921 --> 01:49:55,891
But now I realize that we were...<br>We were working on it for you.

1623
01:50:02,931 --> 01:50:05,068
Maybe it's time<br>we finished it.

1624
01:50:11,907 --> 01:50:14,344
It's about damn time.

1625
01:56:14,869 --> 01:56:16,038
Hey, Cap!

1626
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:33,021
This would have<br>been a lot easier a week ago.

1627
01:56:33,055 --> 01:56:34,823
- If we call Tony...<br>- He won't believe us.

1628
01:56:34,856 --> 01:56:36,192
Even if he did...

1629
01:56:36,225 --> 01:56:37,904
Who knows if the Accords<br>will let him help.

1630
01:56:39,161 --> 01:56:40,729
We're on our own.

1631
01:56:42,096 --> 01:56:43,231
Maybe not.

1632
01:56:45,934 --> 01:56:47,069
I know a guy.
