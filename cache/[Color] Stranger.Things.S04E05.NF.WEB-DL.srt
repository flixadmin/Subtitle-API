Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</font>

2
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,187
<font color="#32ff0c">- God.
- Keep pressure on it.</font>

3
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,522
<font color="#32ff0c">- It's not slowing.
- Keep putting pressure on it.</font>

4
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,067
<font color="#32ff0c">- More pressure. Get the napkins.
- Come on.</font>

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,818
<font color="#32ff0c">- More napkins.
- Shit.</font>

6
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,362
<font color="#32ff0c">- It's not slowing.
- Argyle! Get us to St. Mary's.</font>

7
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,740
<font color="#32ff0c">I don't think praying's
gonna help that dude.</font>

8
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,784
<font color="#32ff0c">- No, you idiot! St. Mary's Hospital.
- No, no.</font>

9
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,411
<font color="#32ff0c">- What?
- No hospital.</font>

10
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:40,582
<font color="#32ff0c">- We're gonna get you to the hospital.
- You need to warn...</font>

11
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,959
<font color="#32ff0c">...O... Owens.</font>

12
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,710
<font color="#32ff0c">- Owens, okay.
- The girl.</font>

13
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:46,670
<font color="#32ff0c">She... She's in danger.</font>

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,673
<font color="#32ff0c">Okay, how... how do we find Owens?</font>

15
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:50,674
<font color="#32ff0c">Nina. Nina.</font>

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,844
<font color="#32ff0c">- Nina. Who's Nina?
- Come on. A pen.</font>

17
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:54,344
<font color="#32ff0c">- Okay.
- Shit.</font>

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,514
<font color="#32ff0c">- Here's the number.
- Number. Number.</font>

19
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,034
<font color="#32ff0c">- He wants to write something.
- We can call this Nina?</font>

20
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,728
<font color="#32ff0c">Grab a magazine or something.
Will, get something.</font>

21
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,022
<font color="#32ff0c">- He's really bleeding a lot.
- Right here.</font>

22
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,106
<font color="#32ff0c">- Come on. Hey.
- Write the number.</font>

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,733
<font color="#32ff0c">Hey! Look at me!</font>

24
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,319
<font color="#32ff0c">- Hey! Come on!
- Hold on!</font>

25
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,986
<font color="#32ff0c">- Oh, shit.
- Hey!</font>

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,114
<font color="#32ff0c">Hey, yo, yo. Wait, wait, wait.</font>

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,075
<font color="#32ff0c">Why is it so quiet back there, huh?</font>

28
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,703
<font color="#32ff0c">Yo, is he dead? Jesus, man.</font>

29
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,996
<font color="#32ff0c">Talk to me! Shit!</font>

30
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,707
<font color="#32ff0c">We should get off the road.</font>

31
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,378
<font color="#32ff0c">Argyle, Ar... Argyle, get off the road, now!</font>

32
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,921
<font color="#32ff0c">Shit, he's dead, isn't he?</font>

33
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,091
<font color="#32ff0c">- This is real bad.
- What are you doing?</font>

34
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,966
<font color="#32ff0c">Get off the road!</font>

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,430
<font color="#32ff0c">Listen.</font>

36
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,742
<font color="#32ff0c">I know she was just here.</font>

37
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,102
<font color="#32ff0c">And if you wanna live...</font>

38
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,105
<font color="#32ff0c">you're gonna tell me where she is.</font>

39
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,546
<font color="#32ff0c">Apologies for the bumpy ride, kiddo.</font>

40
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,175
<font color="#32ff0c">I would've paved the road, but...</font>

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,554
<font color="#32ff0c">kinda ruins the whole
"top secret location" thing.</font>

42
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,723
<font color="#32ff0c">Did you get some rest?</font>

43
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,058
<font color="#32ff0c">A little.</font>

44
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,144
<font color="#32ff0c">Good.</font>

45
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,313
<font color="#32ff0c">I have a feeling you're gonna need it.</font>

46
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,639
<font color="#32ff0c">Oop.</font>

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,185
<font color="#32ff0c">Okay. Here we go.</font>

48
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,863
<font color="#32ff0c">You didn't really think
we were working out of a shed, did you?</font>

49
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,595
<font color="#32ff0c">You built all this?</font>

50
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,514
<font color="#32ff0c">Well, more gave it a face-lift.</font>

51
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,934
<font color="#32ff0c">Do you know what an ICBM is?</font>

52
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,562
<font color="#32ff0c">It stands for
intercontinental ballistic missile.</font>

53
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,439
<font color="#32ff0c">It's a... a fancy bomb.</font>

54
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,569
<font color="#32ff0c">We used to store them in these silos,
but we haven't used this one in years.</font>

55
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,821
<font color="#32ff0c">In fact, there...
there's no bomb here at all.</font>

56
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,824
<font color="#32ff0c">It's just a big ol' empty space.</font>

57
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:29,036
<font color="#32ff0c">So we repurposed it to hold something
much more powerful than a missile:</font>

58
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,079
<font color="#32ff0c">you.</font>

59
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:36,377
<font color="#32ff0c">- Anne, Tracy. Morning.
- Morning, doc.</font>

60
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,545
<font color="#32ff0c">Morning.</font>

61
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:41,423
<font color="#32ff0c">You'll have to forgive the staring.
You're a bit of a celebrity down here.</font>

62
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,175
<font color="#32ff0c">- I am?
- Oh yeah. You kidding?</font>

63
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,137
<font color="#32ff0c">You... You're bigger than Madonna to them.</font>

64
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:50,016
<font color="#32ff0c">They've all given up their lives,
their jobs, their families</font>

65
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:53,310
<font color="#32ff0c">to come work on this program,
'cause they believe in the cause.</font>

66
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,021
<font color="#32ff0c">They believe in you.</font>

67
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,737
<font color="#32ff0c">It's okay. Yeah.</font>

68
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,326
<font color="#32ff0c">We call her Nina.</font>

69
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
<font color="#32ff0c">What is it?</font>

70
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,877
<font color="#32ff0c">If we told you,
it would ruin the surprise.</font>

71
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:28,346
<font color="#32ff0c">Hello, Eleven.</font>

72
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
<font color="#32ff0c">I know.</font>

73
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,893
<font color="#32ff0c">You're frightened of me.</font>

74
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,439
<font color="#32ff0c">Perhaps, in our time apart,
you may have even grown to hate me.</font>

75
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,526
<font color="#32ff0c">But all I've ever wanted to do</font>

76
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,485
<font color="#32ff0c">is to help you.</font>

77
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,906
<font color="#32ff0c">And right now,
I think you very much need my help.</font>

78
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,494
<font color="#32ff0c">Your gifts have been stolen.</font>

79
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:53,829
<font color="#32ff0c">I believe I know why.</font>

80
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,332
<font color="#32ff0c">And I believe I know how to get them back.</font>

81
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,461
<font color="#32ff0c">Let us work together again.</font>

82
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,755
<font color="#32ff0c">You and I.</font>

83
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:05,966
<font color="#32ff0c">Daughter</font>

84
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,802
<font color="#32ff0c">and Papa.</font>

85
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,971
<font color="#32ff0c">Papa!</font>

86
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,694
<font color="#32ff0c">Yeah, I got her.</font>

87
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,411
<font color="#32ff0c">Why don't you go back inside?
Play nice for the doctor, hmm?</font>

88
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:36,745
<font color="#32ff0c">No!</font>

89
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:38,665
<font color="#32ff0c">No!</font>

90
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,086
<font color="#32ff0c">The more you move,</font>

91
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,465
<font color="#32ff0c">- the more this is gonna hurt.
- No! No! No!</font>

92
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,007
<font color="#32ff0c">Leave her.</font>

93
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,889
<font color="#32ff0c">- No.
- I'm... I'm sorry, Eleven.</font>

94
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:57,393
<font color="#32ff0c">This is not how I wanted things to begin.</font>

95
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,689
<font color="#32ff0c">But everything's going to be all right.</font>

96
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,524
<font color="#32ff0c">You're home now.</font>

97
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,028
<font color="#32ff0c">You're home.</font>

98
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,957
<font color="#32ff0c">Enough!</font>

99
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,794
<font color="#32ff0c">He is not yours to kill.</font>

100
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,047
<font color="#32ff0c">Fools.</font>

101
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,636
<font color="#32ff0c">What I tell you, American?</font>

102
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,931
<font color="#32ff0c">No run.</font>

103
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,808
<font color="#32ff0c">You don't listen.</font>

104
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,147
<font color="#32ff0c">Now is going to be much pain.</font>

105
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,357
<font color="#32ff0c">Much.</font>

106
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,610
<font color="#32ff0c">It could be worse, American.</font>

107
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,778
<font color="#32ff0c">At least you have company.</font>

108
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,828
<font color="#32ff0c">Your eyes don't deceive you.</font>

109
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,498
<font color="#32ff0c">I'm a prisoner now.</font>

110
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,581
<font color="#32ff0c">Like you.</font>

111
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,628
<font color="#32ff0c">Yuri, the smuggler, he betrayed me.</font>

112
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,546
<font color="#32ff0c">Betrayed us.</font>

113
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,634
<font color="#32ff0c">The pig's in trouble now.</font>

114
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:20,011
<font color="#32ff0c">You said we could trust him!</font>

115
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,304
<font color="#32ff0c">You swore to me!</font>

116
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,307
<font color="#32ff0c">Because I believed we could.</font>

117
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,225
<font color="#32ff0c">You think this is what I planned?</font>

118
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:27,019
<font color="#32ff0c">I have lost everything. Everything!</font>

119
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,270
<font color="#32ff0c">We both knew the risks. Both of us.</font>

120
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,481
<font color="#32ff0c">Do us all a favor. Finish him!</font>

121
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,274
<font color="#32ff0c">We gambled today,</font>

122
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:34,775
<font color="#32ff0c">and we lost.</font>

123
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,363
<font color="#32ff0c">We lost.</font>

124
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,950
<font color="#32ff0c">Finish him!</font>

125
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,293
<font color="#32ff0c">Joyce.</font>

126
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,919
<font color="#32ff0c">What about Joyce?</font>

127
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,067
<font color="#32ff0c">There you are, my girl!</font>

128
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,152
<font color="#32ff0c">Mwah!</font>

129
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,326
<font color="#32ff0c">Why the long faces?</font>

130
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,914
<font color="#32ff0c">Are you not excited for your journey
across the Iron Curtain?</font>

131
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,794
<font color="#32ff0c">Yuri, I have a family.
I have three kids waiting for me.</font>

132
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,923
<font color="#32ff0c">Did you know?
Peanut butter is banned in motherland.</font>

133
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,467
<font color="#32ff0c">I buy for dollar-thirty here,</font>

134
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,595

223
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,768

227
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,693
<font color="#32ff0c">Is it that big a leap to suggest
you somehow wound up in his?</font>

228
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:10,945
<font color="#32ff0c">Like Freddie Krueger's boiler room.</font>

unlocked a backdoor to Vecna's world?</font>

and it's the same busy signal.</font>

240
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,145

247
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,825

<font color="#32ff0c">I guess you're still not quite awake, huh?</font>

259
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,375

<font color="#32ff0c">Look who finally decided to join us.</font>

267
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:37,772
<font color="#32ff0c">Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.</font>

268
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,236
<font color="#32ff0c">Heart rate's now 120 BPM.</font>

269
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,324
<font color="#32ff0c">- She's rejecting it.
- Give her time.</font>

270
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,243
<font color="#32ff0c">No, no, no. We shouldn't have
just thrown her in like this.</font>

271
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:53,497
<font color="#32ff0c">- She's gonna drown in there.
- No.</font>

272
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:56,165
<font color="#32ff0c">No, she is going to swim.</font>

273
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,969
<font color="#32ff0c">Oh man.</font>

274
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:13,349
<font color="#32ff0c">Okay. This is not the way
it's supposed to go, okay?</font>

275
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:15,935
<font color="#32ff0c">Oh man, oh man, oh man.
Okay, this is so messed up.</font>

276
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,313
<font color="#32ff0c">This is so messed up!
This is so messed up!</font>

277
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,273
<font color="#32ff0c">Okay. Dude's probably got,
like, a family, kids, you know.</font>

278
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,859
<font color="#32ff0c">All that shit.
We gotta go to the cops with this.</font>

279
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:27,405
<font color="#32ff0c">Lay it all on 'em. Your superpowered
girlfriend, bad government dudes,</font>

280
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,365
<font color="#32ff0c">- Upside Down dimension planet thing...

282
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,913
<font color="#32ff0c">The bad government dudes are after
your super girlfriend, right? Right? Okay.</font>

283
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,499
<font color="#32ff0c">So maybe cops can help us
find out where she is.</font>

284
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,708
<font color="#32ff0c">They're gonna kill her.</font>

285
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,644
<font color="#32ff0c">- If they kill her, they're gonna kill us.
- Hey!</font>

286
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,837
<font color="#32ff0c">They might kill us before they kill her.</font>

287
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,256
<font color="#32ff0c">- I dunno, man.
- Argyle!</font>

<font color="#32ff0c">- Eeny meeny miny moe...
- Argyle!</font>

290
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,970
<font color="#32ff0c">- Listen!
- What?</font>

291
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:53,306
<font color="#32ff0c">Look, I think we can
figure this out, okay?</font>

292
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,307
<font color="#32ff0c">We just gotta open our minds.</font>

293
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,727
<font color="#32ff0c">Open our minds?
That's an open grave in front of me, man!</font>

294
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,230
<font color="#32ff0c">- Open my mind? What are you talking about?
- Listen. Hey, dude! Hey!</font>

295
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,858
<font color="#32ff0c">Just relax, okay?</font>

296
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,111
<font color="#32ff0c">- Yeah.
- Why don't you just go to the van...</font>

297
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:09,114
<font color="#32ff0c">...and do your thing, huh?</font>

298
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:10,865
<font color="#32ff0c">- Purple Palm Tree Delight.
- Right.</font>

299
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,701
<font color="#32ff0c">Right.</font>

300
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,785
<font color="#32ff0c">It's all worn off.</font>

301
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:14,869
<font color="#32ff0c">It's just worn off.</font>

302
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:16,454
<font color="#32ff0c">I'm all emotional.</font>

303
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,124
<font color="#32ff0c">- You're emotional.
- Okay.</font>

304
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,711
<font color="#32ff0c">- I'm sorry.
- You're fine.</font>

305
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,128
<font color="#32ff0c">- Jonathan.
- Yeah?</font>

306
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:26,213
<font color="#32ff0c">More weed? Is that really a good idea now?</font>

307
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,174
<font color="#32ff0c">Got a better idea to keep him calm?</font>

308
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,594
<font color="#32ff0c">Let's just get this done.</font>

309
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:42,146
<i><font color="#32ff0c">You can't let him get to you.</font></i>

310
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:45,442
<font color="#32ff0c">He's stoned out of his mind.
Doesn't know what he's talking about.</font>

311
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,359
<font color="#32ff0c">That doesn't mean he's wrong.</font>

312
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,615
<font color="#32ff0c">I mean, if that guy would've lived
one more second, one more second,</font>

313
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,575
<font color="#32ff0c">then w... we would know where she is.</font>

314
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,494
<font color="#32ff0c">Wh... Why didn't he just say the number?</font>

315
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:00,289
<font color="#32ff0c">I should've explained myself.</font>

316
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,835
<font color="#32ff0c">Maybe Eleven would've taken me with her
and things would be different, but...</font>

317
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,587
<font color="#32ff0c">- No.
- I didn't... I didn't know what to say.</font>

318
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:12,594
<font color="#32ff0c">Sometimes I think it's just scary
to open up like that.</font>

319
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,137
<font color="#32ff0c">To say how you really feel.</font>

320
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,851
<font color="#32ff0c">Especially to people
you care about the most.</font>

321
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,645
<font color="#32ff0c">Because, what if...</font>

322
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:24,855
<font color="#32ff0c">what if they don't like the truth?</font>

323
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,278
<font color="#32ff0c">Does anybody know
the dead dude's name?</font>

324
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,197
<font color="#32ff0c">- What?
- The dead dude.</font>

325
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,324
<font color="#32ff0c">I'm making him a headstone.</font>

326
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:37,576
<font color="#32ff0c">You do realize we spent all morning
<i>hiding</i> the body.</font>

327
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,330
<font color="#32ff0c">Well, I'll just write, uh,
"Here Lies Unknown Hero Agent Man."</font>

328
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,751
<font color="#32ff0c">Yeah. "Saved Argyle, Jonathan,
Will, and Mike from certain death."</font>

329
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,713
<font color="#32ff0c">You... You're gonna write our names
on the pizza box?</font>

330
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:51,924
<font color="#32ff0c">They're pretty common names.</font>

331
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,301
<font color="#32ff0c">Okay, dude. Uh, do your thing.</font>

332
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,304
<font color="#32ff0c">Jesus Christ.</font>

333
00:25:58,097 --> 00:25:59,182
<font color="#32ff0c">Come on, man.</font>

334
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,183
<font color="#32ff0c">That's his pen.</font>

335
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,851
<font color="#32ff0c">What?</font>

336
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,604
<font color="#32ff0c">Unknown Hero Agent Man,</font>

337
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,273
<font color="#32ff0c">that's the pen he gave me
right before he died.</font>

338
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:08,607
<font color="#32ff0c">Piece of shit.</font>

339
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,734
<font color="#32ff0c">Why would he give me a pen
that didn't work?</font>

340
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,996
<font color="#32ff0c">Come on.</font>

341
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,705
<font color="#32ff0c">Hey, man, I'm using that.</font>

342
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,874
<font color="#32ff0c">What are you doing?</font>

343
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,169
<font color="#32ff0c">Something fell outta that pen, man.</font>

344
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:29,421
<font color="#32ff0c">Wh... What is it?</font>

345
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,217
<font color="#32ff0c">It's the number.</font>

346
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,760
<font color="#32ff0c">We've had it this whole time.</font>

347
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,221
<font color="#32ff0c">We got his digits, man?</font>

348
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,609
<font color="#32ff0c">Did I tell you
it's okay to break?</font>

349
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:54,362
<font color="#32ff0c">Over there, there is a hand.</font>

350
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:55,572
<font color="#32ff0c">A HAND!</font>

351
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,531
<font color="#32ff0c">Are we animals?</font>

352
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,327
<font color="#32ff0c">Psst!</font>

353
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,913
<font color="#32ff0c">Hey, Ivan. Ivan!</font>

354
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,174
<font color="#32ff0c">Stop calling my name.</font>

355
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,551
<font color="#32ff0c">You trying to get me in trouble?</font>

356
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,929
<font color="#32ff0c">I don't know what they've told you,</font>

357
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,472
<font color="#32ff0c">but it is all lies.</font>

358
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,016
<font color="#32ff0c">I'm here by mistake!</font>

359
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,059
<font color="#32ff0c">I'm sorry. I cannot help you.</font>

360
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,439
<font color="#32ff0c">I can make you rich.</font>

361
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:37,489
<font color="#32ff0c">See this American?</font>

362
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:39,615
<font color="#32ff0c">He comes from money.</font>

363
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,036
<font color="#32ff0c">Old money.</font>

364
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,957
<font color="#32ff0c">Tell him, American.
Tell him how you will make him rich.</font>

365
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,386
<font color="#32ff0c">You're a real help, American,
you know that?</font>

366
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:03,640
<font color="#32ff0c">A real help.</font>

367
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:07,559
<font color="#32ff0c">Hey.</font>

368
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,065
<font color="#32ff0c">You want to die here?
You want to die? Is that it?</font>

369
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:14,317
<font color="#32ff0c">That's what we've been brought here to do.</font>

370
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,528
<font color="#32ff0c">So, that is it? You give up, then?</font>

371
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:26,371
<font color="#32ff0c">What about your woman, huh?</font>

372
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,749
<font color="#32ff0c">She's captured, yes, but still alive.</font>

373
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,375
<font color="#32ff0c">We can still save her.</font>

374
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,586
<font color="#32ff0c">"Save her."</font>

375
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,007
<font color="#32ff0c">That is amusing to you?</font>

376
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,759
<font color="#32ff0c">You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.</font>

377
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,763
<font color="#32ff0c">The closer I get with Joyce,
the more danger she's in.</font>

378
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,308
<font color="#32ff0c">You're not thinking straight, American.</font>

379
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,769
<font color="#32ff0c">No, I think I am.</font>

380
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,398
<font color="#32ff0c">For the first time in my life,
I think I'm thinking straight.</font>

381
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,945
<font color="#32ff0c">I used to think I was cursed.</font>

382
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,865
<font color="#32ff0c">Ever since I was 18.</font>

383
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,048
<font color="#32ff0c">Got some letter of induction in the mail.</font>

to go fight some war in the jungle.</font>

'cause of commie bastards like you, and...</font>

386
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:16,628
<font color="#32ff0c">You know, I'm happy enough to go.</font>

387
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,340
<font color="#32ff0c">Prove to my old man
I'm not the piece of shit he thinks I am.</font>

388
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:25,846
<font color="#32ff0c">I get over there, I must test well,
and they put me in the Chemical Corps.</font>

389
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,516
<font color="#32ff0c">There I am. I'm just... a kid, you know.</font>

390
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,434
<font color="#32ff0c">I'm 18 years old, 8,000 miles away,</font>

<font color="#32ff0c">and I'm mixing up
these... 55-gallon drums of Agent Orange.</font>

393
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,323
<font color="#32ff0c">We used to clean out
these buffalo turbines after a run</font>

394
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:45,157
<font color="#32ff0c">and just be inhaling the stuff.</font>

395
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,576
<font color="#32ff0c">No masks, nothing.</font>

396
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:53,958
<font color="#32ff0c">"It's not chemical warfare.
It's just herbicide to kill plants."</font>

397
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,171
<font color="#32ff0c">"Harmless." That's what they told us.</font>

398
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,092
<font color="#32ff0c">Then I got back to real life,</font>

399
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,428
<font color="#32ff0c">and these guys I worked with,
the ones that made it back,</font>

400
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:08,347
<font color="#32ff0c">they started trying
to get back to normal, you know?</font>

401
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,058
<font color="#32ff0c">Having families.
And then things started going wrong.</font>

402
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,439
<font color="#32ff0c">Kids born stillborn. Dead in the womb.</font>

403
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,777
<font color="#32ff0c">Crooked spines, eyes popped out.</font>

404
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:24,905
<font color="#32ff0c">The horror...</font>

405
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,326
<font color="#32ff0c">followed us, clung to us.</font>

406
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,163
<font color="#32ff0c">My wife Diane, she wanted a baby.</font>

407
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,750
<i><font color="#32ff0c">I did too.</font></i>

408
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:39,253
<i><font color="#32ff0c">We had a baby, and she was, um...</font></i>

409
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:41,673
<i><font color="#32ff0c">she was born healthy.</font></i>

410
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,423
<i><font color="#32ff0c">She was perfect, you know. Sara.</font></i>

411
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,176
<font color="#32ff0c">And then she died.</font>

412
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,886
<font color="#32ff0c">Blood pressure's dropping.</font>

413
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,931
<i><font color="#32ff0c">It wasn't an easy death. She...</font></i>

414

<i><font color="#32ff0c">suffered.</font></i>

<i><font color="#32ff0c">I knew the risks, but I, um...</font></i>

416
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,314
<font color="#32ff0c">I hid them.</font>

417
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:03,528
<font color="#32ff0c">And then Diane left me.
She didn't blame me. Not with words.</font>

418
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,613
<font color="#32ff0c">After that, I was just...</font>

419
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:11,076
<font color="#32ff0c">I just hid myself in drugs and alcohol.</font>

420
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,582
<font color="#32ff0c">And then people
started coming into my life.</font>

421
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:22,337
<i><font color="#32ff0c">This girl El, and Joyce just happened,
and I told myself they needed me.</font></i>

422
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,673
<font color="#32ff0c">But that wasn't true.</font>

423
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,720
<font color="#32ff0c">That's a lie. They didn't need me.</font>

424
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:32,307
<font color="#32ff0c">I needed them.</font>

425

426
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:41,273
<font color="#32ff0c">You were right, what you said last night.
I knew the risks,</font>

427
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:43,483
<font color="#32ff0c">breaking out of here, but I did it anyway.</font>

428
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,155
<i><font color="#32ff0c">The minute I sent for Joyce,
the minute I sent for her,</font></i>

429
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,116
<font color="#32ff0c">I sentenced her to death.</font>

430
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,827
<font color="#32ff0c">Just like I did with Sara.</font>

431
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,795
<font color="#32ff0c">Everyone I love, I hurt.</font>

432
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,761
<font color="#32ff0c">See, I was wrong this whole time.</font>

433
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,640
<font color="#32ff0c">I wasn't cursed.</font>

434
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,853
<font color="#32ff0c">I am the curse.</font>

435
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,746
<font color="#32ff0c">I've heard rumors of a monster.</font>

436
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,914
<font color="#32ff0c">From America.</font>

437
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,002
<font color="#32ff0c">I don't know
if what you say is true, American,</font>

438
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:47,798
<font color="#32ff0c">if you're truly a cursed man,
but you're right about one thing.</font>

439
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:50,759
<font color="#32ff0c">We are going to die in here.</font>

440
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:18,953
<font color="#32ff0c">Can I help you?</font>

441
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,249
<font color="#32ff0c">We need to look around.</font>

442
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,807
<font color="#32ff0c">Yep.</font>

443
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,769
<font color="#32ff0c">I think it's some kind of leak.</font>

444
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,441
<font color="#32ff0c">I haven't had a chance to fix it
with everything going on.</font>

445
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,402
<font color="#32ff0c">Pack your things. We're moving you.</font>

446
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,249
<font color="#32ff0c">The devil is here.</font>

447
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,667
<font color="#32ff0c">I can feel his presence...</font>

449
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:13,925

she touched and brightened.</font>

452

<font color="#32ff0c">But I also know she's frustrated.</font>

453
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:25,980
<font color="#32ff0c">Angry.</font>

454
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,650
<font color="#32ff0c">That the monster
that did this to her is still out there.</font>

455
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,318
<font color="#32ff0c">Still.</font>

- Maybe we should bring this to the cops.</font>

471

Chrissy's a drug dealer?</font>

<font color="#32ff0c">Who are letting this... this psycho
go around killing people?</font>

what if this cult is doing shit to us?</font>

474

- They already know we're after them.</font>

475
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:33,047

479
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,222

481
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:46,686
<font color="#32ff0c">I made a list.</font>

looking for in this shithole?</font>

is important to Vecna.</font>

498
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,378
<font color="#32ff0c">Because Max saw it
in Vecna's red soup mind world?</font>

499
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,922
<font color="#32ff0c">- Basically.
- Great.</font>

500
00:36:57,005 --> 00:37:00,300
<font color="#32ff0c">Maybe it holds a clue to where Vecna is.
Why he's back. Why he killed the Creels.</font>

501
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,346
<font color="#32ff0c">And how to stop him
before he comes back for Max.</font>

502

forgot to pay their electric bill.</font>

00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,041
<font color="#32ff0c">Is this what you saw?</font>

526
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,210
<font color="#32ff0c">In your visions?</font>

527
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:04,925
<font color="#32ff0c">I mean, it's... just a clock.</font>

528
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:06,592
<font color="#32ff0c">Right?</font>

529
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,271
<font color="#32ff0c">Like a normal old clock.</font>

530
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,981
<font color="#32ff0c">Why is this wizard obsessed with clocks?</font>

531
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,570
<font color="#32ff0c">Maybe he's, like,
a clockmaker or something?</font>

532
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,655
<font color="#32ff0c">I think you cracked the case, Steve.</font>

533
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,949
<font color="#32ff0c">All I know is</font>

534
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,119
<font color="#32ff0c">the answers are here.</font>

535
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,329
<font color="#32ff0c">Somewhere.</font>

536
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,001
<font color="#32ff0c">Okay, everyone stay in groups of two.
Robin, upstairs.</font>

537
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:42,755
<font color="#32ff0c">Come on. Let's go.</font>

538
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,221
<font color="#32ff0c">- Was that a sigh?
- No, I did not sigh.</font>

539
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,724
<font color="#32ff0c">- Why'd you sigh?
- I didn't sigh. Just come on, dude.</font>

540
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:56,976
<font color="#32ff0c">- I heard you.
- W... We're just always partners, okay?</font>

541
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,603
<font color="#32ff0c">You have a problem with that?</font>

542
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:01,190
<font color="#32ff0c">It'd just be nice
to, I don't know, mix it up a bit.</font>

543
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,460
<font color="#32ff0c">- I'm boring you? Is that it?
- No, the opposite...</font>

544
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,782
<font color="#32ff0c">Ah.</font>

545
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,242
<font color="#32ff0c">Hey, Yuri.</font>

546
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,246
<font color="#32ff0c">Yuri, I need to take a piss here.</font>

547
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,331
<font color="#32ff0c">Just give it up. He can't hear you.</font>

548
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,666
<font color="#32ff0c">I really do have to go, Joyce.</font>

549
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,335
<font color="#32ff0c">This isn't some ploy to escape.</font>

550
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:27,632
<font color="#32ff0c">- He can't hear.
- What?</font>

551
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,931
<font color="#32ff0c">Joyce, what are you doing?</font>

552
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,684
<font color="#32ff0c">Joyce! Joyce!</font>

553
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:41,146
<font color="#32ff0c">- Joyce!
- My leg is too short.</font>

554
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,981
<font color="#32ff0c">Can you grab that shard with your foot?</font>

555
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,068
<font color="#32ff0c">Perhaps, you know,
we should talk this through first.</font>

556
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,695
<font color="#32ff0c">What is there to talk through?</font>

557
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,965
<font color="#32ff0c">We cut our binds, break free.</font>

558
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,114
<font color="#32ff0c">Yes, okay. Then what?</font>

559
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:53,159
<font color="#32ff0c">- Then you take him out.
- Take him out?</font>

560
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,121
<font color="#32ff0c">You know karate.
You said you were a black belt.</font>

561
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,036
<font color="#32ff0c">We're 10,000 feet in the air, Joyce.</font>

562
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,414
<font color="#32ff0c">I take him, who flies this plane?</font>

563
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,416
<font color="#32ff0c">All right, so don't knock him out.</font>

564
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,751
<font color="#32ff0c">Just get his gun
and make him turn us around.</font>

565
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:05,545
<font color="#32ff0c">Get his gun. Just like that, huh?</font>

566
00:41:05,628 --> 00:41:08,507
<font color="#32ff0c">- Is black not the highest color?
- Yes.</font>

567
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,385
<font color="#32ff0c">- It's just...
- Just what?</font>

568
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,387
<font color="#32ff0c">I've never fought
in a real-world scenario, okay?</font>

569
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,849
<font color="#32ff0c">I've only sparred with the other students.</font>

570
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:18,432
<font color="#32ff0c">How old?</font>

571
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,561
<font color="#32ff0c">It doesn't go younger than 13.</font>

572
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:21,936
<font color="#32ff0c">Thirteen?</font>

573
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,648
<font color="#32ff0c">But Jeremiah is 16.</font>

574
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,483
<font color="#32ff0c">Almost. His birthday is next month.</font>

575
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,943
<font color="#32ff0c">And... And Jeremiah is a ferocious fighter.</font>

576
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:31,362
<font color="#32ff0c">Lightning fast. Very skilled.</font>

577
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,240
<font color="#32ff0c">And I beat him.</font>

578
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:36,076
<font color="#32ff0c">That one time.</font>

579
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,414
<font color="#32ff0c">And certainly Yuri is not
trained or skilled like Jeremiah.</font>

580
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:42,289
<font color="#32ff0c">So, yes.</font>

581
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,918
<font color="#32ff0c">Yes, you're right.</font>

582
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,003
<font color="#32ff0c">I can defeat Yuri.</font>

583
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:47,378
<font color="#32ff0c">Absolutely.</font>

584
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:51,382
<font color="#32ff0c">Thank you for talking it through.
I feel much better now.</font>

585
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,927
