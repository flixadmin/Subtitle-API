00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,838
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,973
When I was a child
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,909
By something impossible.

5
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:12,945
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:16,916
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:19,618
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,354
But secretly, I use my speed
to fight crime

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,356
And find others like me.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,759
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:27,793
Mom!

12
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,194
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,764
I am the Flash.

14
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,599
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

15
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,234
What did you say
your name was again?

16
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,636
- Barry Allen.
- Felicity.

17
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,873
How's Barry doing?

18
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,574
- It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

19
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,876
The kind I have to keep.

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,778
I just have
a little experience

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,315
With liking someone who doesn't
see you the same way.

22
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,250
- Dad, the thing is...
- you two are dating.

23
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,719
- So you're not mad.
- Oh, I'm mad.

24
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,125
What does the fastest man
alive do on his day off?

25
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,962
Before the lightning bolt, if I
wasn't still at the crime lab,

26
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:04,930
I'd be at home chilling,

27
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,332
But now my days off
are different.

28
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:07,967
Now they aren't so lonely.

29
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,502
The lightning
didn't just give me speed.

30
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,805
It also gave me friends.

31
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,808
This isn't even remotely
anatomically correct.

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,144
That's not the point,
Dr. Snow.

33
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,313
Then what is the point?

34
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,148
To have fun.

35
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,484
And to continue your ongoing
training by testing the speed

36
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:29,688
Of your mind by pushing
your ability to multitask.

37
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,095
I'm waiting on you, Dr. Wells.

38
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,378
182 seconds, gentlemen.

39
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,486
Heads up!
I think we got something.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,700
2-11, 2-11.
We're being robbed!

41
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,720
Hey, cool it.

42
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,923
158 seconds to go.

43
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,562
Checkmate.

44
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,497
- Wait, checkmate?
- Checkmate.

45
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,599
I guess we still have
a few things left to learn,

46
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,767
Don't we, Mr. Allen?

47
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,105
Armed robbery
at 4th and Collins.

48
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,575
For the record, I crushed it
in <i>operation</i> and ping pong.

49
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,350
It's not as easy as it looks.

50
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,805
Ugh!

51
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,511
Where's the nearest hospital?

52
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,313
St. Andrews...
seven blocks north, two east.

53
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,449
Call the er, tell them
they have an incoming GSW.

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,293
Let's go. I want
this locked up all the way

55
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,130
To the end of the block.

56
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:52,664
Tow truck was stolen.

57
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,633
Driver of the armored car
is in a stable condition

58
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,169
At St. Andrews, and no one's
exactly sure how he got there.

59
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,804
Did you check
the security cameras?

60
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,339
Camera's storage drive
was stolen.

61
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,474
Guys are pros.

62
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,543
Everything's still here,

63
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,411
Including what
I think they were after,

64
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,180
The Kahndaq dynasty diamond.

65
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,016
It was on its way to central
city museum for exhibition.

66
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,886
Right, Iris is trying
to talk me into going.

67
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm not much of a museum guy,

68
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,957
But when she really
wants to do something...

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,796
I'm just going to walk away now.

70
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,732
Sorry, Captain.
I was at the hospital

71
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,700
Visiting a friend.
There's nothing missing.

72
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,736
It looks like someone
interrupted a robbery.

73
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,304
Guard says
there was three of them.

74
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,739
Actually, there was four.

75
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,140
I mean, that's
how many I would bring

76
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,576
If I were doing a robbery
of this nature.

77
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,645
That's definitely
a four guy truck.

78
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,247
A driver, two more
to cover the guards, and...

79
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,083
Somebody used liquid nitrogen
to crack open this door,

80
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,685
So four bad guys.

81
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,856
Thank you, Mr. Allen,
for your brilliant insight.

82
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,491
For somebody so fast,

83
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,193
You're a little slow
on the improvising.

84
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,028
Did you see anything that could
help us catch these guys?

85
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,433
Yeah,
one of them lost his mask.

86
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:06,238
I saw his face.

87
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,740
So look through these mug shots
of Central City's most wanted,

88
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,475
And see if you can find our guy.

89
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,044
That's him.

90
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,445
Damn.

91
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,947
Leonard Snart.

92
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,982
Leonard? That's almost as bad
as Bartholomew.

93
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,650
Snart ain't sexy, either.

94
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,552
Snart's father was a cop...

95
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,187
Was a bad cop.

96
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,423
Took his anger out on his kids
until he went to prison.

97
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,391
Snart's dad's in prison too?

98
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,926
We should start a club.

99
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,761
He shows up, like,
every six months.

100
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,564
He cases a job for weeks
before he makes his move.

101
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,766
Then,
he does the job... gets away.

102
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,035
That's before the Streak
was around.

103
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,304
Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

104
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,640
I referred to the Streak,
which I'm pretty sure I can top.

105
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,874
I've been thinking
of a new name.

106
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,142
What do you think
about the Fla...

107
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,877
Coffee break.

108
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,079
Thought I would bring
Central City's finest java

109
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,747
Over to Central City's finest.

110
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:53,852
Thanks.
I'm off caffeine.

111
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,853
My dad's been mad
at me every since I told him

112
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,855
About me and Eddie.

113
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,557
No, you mean he's mad at you
because you didn't tell him.

114
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,460
Uh, first, that sounds
like you're taking his side,

115
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,128
And second, do you know
how he does this whole,

116
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,796
"I'm not talking to you,
but I have a whole bag

117
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,698
Full of judgmental looks
I'm gonna try out on you later?"

118
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,166
Yeah, I've been
on the receiving end

119
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,635
Of those a few times.

120
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,336
Speaking of communications,

121
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,638
Or lack thereof, after all
of these journalism classes,

122
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,274
- I got an idea.
- Huh.

123
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,975
I started a blog.

124
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,944
All right, what's it about?
Your brownie obsession?

125
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,145
'Cause, you know, you probably
shouldn't broadcast that.

126
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,880
No, something important.

127
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:26,485
Something that Central City
needs to know about, the Streak.

128
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,086
He's out there, Barry.

129
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,323
Rumor has it, he stopped
an armed car robbery earlier.

130
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,191
I was hoping that I could take
a look at the file, and...

131
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,793
What?
I'm not at liberty

132
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,663
To discuss an ongoing police
investigation with you.

133
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:40,032
Since when, Mr. Blabbermouth?

134
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:41,633
Take it from someone
who's been

135
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,835
Investigating the impossible
since they were 11.

136
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,437
Blogging about this is

137
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,039
Only gonna bring the crazies
to your front door.

138
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,874
My blog is anonymous.

139
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,709
All right, well,
anonymous or not, it's not safe.

140
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,644
You never know what kind
of weirdos are out there

141
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,879
Trolling on the internet.

142
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,547
I can vouch for that.

143
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:59,351
The internet is full of weirdos
and nerd rage...

144
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,086
Lots and lots of nerd rage.

145
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,758
Hi.
Felicity Smoak.

146
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,527
Iris West.

147
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,529
Barry Allen.

148
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,698
But you both already knew that.
Felicity is...

149
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,032
The girl that you met in
Starling City,

150
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,168
The computerer, right?

151
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,737
You two worked on one
of Barry's unexplainable cases.

152
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:23,575
Which, long story short,
was definitely explainable.

153
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,446
So the lightning
came through here?

154
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,083
Yeah.

155
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,221
There's been some rumors
the last few weeks.

156
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,224
People seen a red blur
tearing through the streets.

157
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,826
What the hell is it, man?

158
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,227
Maybe it was a drone.

159
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,330
Some top secret army thing.

160
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,736
When I was a kid,
my grandfather used to

161
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:54,339
Take my sister and me
to this diner, the motorcar.

162
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,542
Food was for crap,
but the view was great,

163
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,879
Right across from
the Central City precinct.

164
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,348
I still go there.
I listen to their radios.

165
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,084
I learn their response times.

166
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,919
There are 40 banks
in Central City,

167
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,722
Each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

168
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,726
That's the advantage
of hitting a moving target.

169
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,728
Once the armored car called 911,

170
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,799
We had 182 seconds before
any cop could be on the scene.

171
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:25,003
No one could have gotten there
fast enough to stop us.

172
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,840
But something did,

173
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,676
And you lost your cool.

174
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,645
You know the rules.

175
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,448
We don't shoot guards or cops
unless it's the only option.

176
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,516
We don't need the heat.

177
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,353
The heat?

178
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,491
What the hell do you think
the blur is, Snart?

179
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,660
Right.
Screw this.

180
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,729
Screw you.
I'm out.

181
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,501
Well, if you're out,
you're out.

182
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,474
This blur is a man.

183
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,479
We're gonna have to
up our game.

184
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,150
Iris seems very nice.

185
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,554
And really pretty.
Like, <i>super</i> pretty.

186
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,489
Congratulations.

187
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,324
Well, Iris
isn't my girlfriend.

188
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:23,028
She's just a friend
who actually has a boyfriend.

189
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,865
Oh, that's... interesting,

190
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,568
I guess.

191
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,203
What are you
really doing here?

192
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,838
I mean, it's good to see you,

193
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
But do you and Oliver
need something, or...

194
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,977
No, no, I came
because I wanted to see you.

195
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,746
I heard you were
out of the coma.

196
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,015
Didn't call, didn't write,

197
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:47,319
Didn't race over...

198
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,160
Oliver told you?

199
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,962
Honestly, I heard
you two talking

200
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,684
on that rooftop
in Starling City that night.

201
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,068
I want to see it.

202
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,838
And by "it,"
I mean your speed,

203
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,039
In case you thought I was
talking about something else,

204
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,877
Which I... which I was not.
Okay.

205
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,745
Okay, you see that building?

206
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,747
Uh-huh.

207
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,849
Keep your eyes on it.

208
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,056
Whoo-hoo!

209
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,725
Whoa.

210
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,693
You took a picture of me?

211
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,161
From the top of that building?

212
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,531
Yeah.
Don't instagram that.

213
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,799
Unbelievable.

214
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,234
Your shoes are smoking.

215
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,474
That... that's fine.
It's... it happens sometimes.

216
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,876
It's why I have
a friction-proof suit.

217
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,412
Where did you get that?

218
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,247
I'll show you.

219
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,294
And this is where my team
monitors the police bands

220
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,062
For criminal activity.

221
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,564
We can track anything
that's happening in the city.

222
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,765
Check this out.

223
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,933
We've got our own satellite.

224
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,401
I know.

225
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:10,902
I've hacked into it
from time to time.

226
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,537
- Rude.
- It is, of course,

227
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,873
So wonderful to see you again,
Felicity.

228
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,474
I'm just wondering

229
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,644
How much of our operation
she needs to know about.

230
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,146
I'm really good
at keeping secrets.

231
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,614
Yeah, Felicity works
with the Arrow.

232
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,817
- Sweet.
- And you apparently are not.

233
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,652
Now it's all making sense.

234
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,120
You know who the Arrow is.

235
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,290
Wait, do you know
who the Arrow is?

236
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,727
Uh...

237
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,696
Let's just say that my team
has a similar set up,

238
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,898
But with...
More pointy objects.

239
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,801
Welcome, Ms. Smoak.

240
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,269
Dr. Wells?

241
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,770
<i>The</i> Dr. Wells?

242
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,907
Please, call me Harrison,
Felicity.

243
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,041
Oh, you know who I am?

244
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,476
Ranked second in

245
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,911
The national informative
technology competition

246
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,212
At age 19,

247
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,214
Graduated M.I.T.
with masters degree

248
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,049
in cyber security
and computer sciences.

249
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,784
I know who you are.

250
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,954
I keep an eye out for promising
talent in scientific fields.

251
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,423
It's what brought me Cisco,
Caitlin,

252
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:11,296
And I foresaw great things
from you.

253
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,531
Speaking of great things,

254
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,266
Want to see something cool?

255
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,638
How fast can he run?

256
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,172
He hasn't reached
his top speed yet,

257
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,375
Theoretically speaking.

258
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:24,976
So is he really okay?

259
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,112
His heart rate is
within normal range for him.

260
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:30,615
No, I mean,
the lightning bolt changed him.

261
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,517
Do any of you really
know how much?

262
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,153
We know a fair amount.

263
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,955
If everything
about him is sped up,

264
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,323
Is he going to age faster?

265
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,258
What would happen
if he ran too fast?

266
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,760
I mean, would he just
be running, and then, poof,

267
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,930
He's dust in a red costume?

268
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,167
Everything we do
here at S.T.A.R. Labs

269
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,802
Is to protect Barry Allen.

270
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:54,639
Trust us, Felicity,
he is in very good hands here.

271
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,042
Want to see
how fast I can run backwards?

272
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,179
Don't worry.
He heals quickly too.

273
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,186
Eh, I don't get it.

274
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,988
Why would Snart come here?

275
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,523
Snart's been deterred before,

276
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,091
But once he goes
after something,

277
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,260
He doesn't stop
until he gets it, ever.

278
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,166
Joe, I want you to know that
I'm really serious about Iris.

279
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,402
She's an amazing woman,
and I can really see myself...

280
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,337
I ever tell you
about that wild night

281
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,240
I had my last day of college?

282
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,842
I don't think so.
No?

283
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:34,345
Not even after we kicked back
a few beers after work?

284
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,848
We've never done that.

285
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,349
Oh, right.

286
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,285
That's the things
I do with my friends,

287
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,555
And since we've never done
those things we ain't friends.

288
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,989
So there's actually no reason

289
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,093
I need to know
about your dating life.

290
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,029
I just don't want
my personal relationship

291
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,933
With your daughter to affect
our working relationship.

292
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,001
It ain't about you, Eddie.
It's about her.

293
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,205
So as long as we don't talk
about you and her,

294
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,842
We will be cool.

295
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,279
Maybe we should just listen
to the radio.

296
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:13,585
♪ When a man loves a woman ♪

297
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,287
♪ Let's get it on ♪

298
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,258
Quiet is good.

299
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,263
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

300
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,464
Hey, you two.

301
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,233
- Hey.
- We're not a two.

302
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,435
Oh, no.
We are a one and one.

303
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,970
Yeah.

304
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,171
Has Barry been showing you

305
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,773
Some of the sights
in Central City?

306
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:38,409
Yes, I have seen
some pretty amazing things.

307
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,079
Really?

308
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,148
Well, if you've got some time,

309
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,283
Maybe we can show you some
of Central City's night life.

310
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,785
Oh, no.

311
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,454
I get plenty of night life
in Starling City.

312
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,322
Oh, this is something that

313
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,092
I don't think that
you're gonna want to miss.

314
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,794
Trivia night at jitters.

315
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,595
Eddie's not really excited
about it, I admit.

316
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,564
But it could be our night, guys.

317
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,367
Our night to win $75 worth
of cappuccinos.

318
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,969
Uh, yum.

319
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,471
You know what,
I'm gonna go call work,

320
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,306
Check in,
make sure everything's okay.

321
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:12,377
I'll be back in a second.

322
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,245
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

323
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,647
The trivia night
with you and Eddie,

324
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,515
Forcing this whole double date
thing.

325
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,751
Because that girl is great,

326
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,453
And she happens to come
from your very rare species

327
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,889
Of adorable nerds.

328
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,125
Why didn't you tell me
more about her?

329
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,626
There's nothing to tell.

330
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,195
She's just a friend.

331
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,297
Barry, girls don't
just hop on trains

332
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,698
And travel hundreds of miles

333
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,867
To see someone
that they don't like.

334
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,136
See, this is
why you need my help.

335
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,337
Bring her tonight.

336
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,140
We'll have fun.

337
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,676
Yeah, fun.

338
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,915
You wanted state of the art,
Snart.

339
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,017
I bring you state of the art,
my good sir.

340
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,486
- What's this?
- It might not look like much,

341
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,956
But never judge a book
by its cover, you know?

342
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,992
Fires highly concentrated,
combustible liquid fuel

343
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,228
That ignites on contact
with the air.

344
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,196
I don't need
to heat things up.

345
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,400
I need to slow them down.

346
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,602
That's the one, then.

347
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,470
You were drawn right to it.

348
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,907
Stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident,

349
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,775
And with nothing
but a skeleton security crew

350
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,144
To guard the tech inside.

351
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,314
Emits some sort of substance.
I'm not sure what it is.

352
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,651
Like a white flame,
but it's not hot, it's cold.

353
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,152
Glasses look like they're made
of the same tech.

354
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,754
What are they for?

355
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,757
The glare.
You'll see.

356
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,126
Who else knows you took this?

357
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,128
Just us.

358
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,431
No, just me.

359
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,233
Sorry, pal.

360
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,579
Party people,

361
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,941
Who's ready to
get their trivia on?

362
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,384
Okay, everybody, welcome.
We've got some new challengers.

363
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:04,255
Please, welcome e=mc hammer.

364
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,558
No, you see, I did it
because e=mc squared

365
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,428
Is Einstein's formula
for kinetic energy, right?

366
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,597
And, you know,
<i>can't touch this.</i>

367
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,499
That's great, Barry.

368
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,567
So where is Felicity?

369
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,969
I'm not sure.

370
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,938
I told her it started at...

371
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,443
Feel free to buy
yourself that dress.

372
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,448
I totally overdressed
for trivia night.

373
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,283
No, you look amazing.

374
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,286
Yeah, you do.

375
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,722
E=mc hammer.

376
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,424
That's funny.

377
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:42,827
See?

378
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,163
It wasn't until 1852,

379
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,799
When the transcontinental
railroad laid their tracks

380
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,500
Through this thriving
cattle town,

381
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,903
That we became
officially incorporated.

382
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,473
That same year, the worst flood
this area's ever seen hit.

383
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:59,644
But from that disaster rose
Central City's greatest hero,

384
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:03,314
Cattle rancher
Bobby "bovine" McFeely.

385
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:07,418
Bovine McFeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

386
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,421
Hey, kid.
Gum?

387
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,832
And now, for the exhibit

388
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,001
I'm sure you've all
come here to see,

389
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:27,038
The historic Kahndaq
dynasty diamond.

390
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,639
Be careful.
Get too close

391
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,042
And you'll set off
the proximity alarms.

392
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,144
Wouldn't want to do that.

393
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,225
- Three is Pasteur.
- Mm-mm.

394
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,460
Three is Erdel,
and four is Pasteur.

395
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,829
- Right.
- Five?

396
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,897
Both: Descartes.

397
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,966
Are they even speaking
English?

398
00:18:54,968 --> 00:19:00,705
And the points
go to e=mc hammer.

399
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,875
I knew you two
would make a good team.

400
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,777
So, Felicity, what do you do?

401
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,145
I work in computer sciences

402
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,447
At Queen Consolidated.
Really?

403
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,884
Do you have a boyfriend
in Starling City?

404
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:16,587
No, no, there is no one.

405
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,022
I'll get us some more drinks.

406
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,524
And I had too many
of those first ones,

407
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,526
So I will be right back.

408
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,602
- What?
- Dude.

409
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,571
Dude? Wha...

410
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,973
Are you still gonna tell me
that she's not into you?

411
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,042
Look at that dress.

412
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,577
And when I asked her
the boyfriend question,

413
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,079
She froze.

414
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,548
Yeah, you were
particularly sly with that one.

415
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,085
Felicity is smart, nice,
and pretty.

416
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,253
And most importantly,
she is the first girl

417
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,856
That I have seen you with
that really understands

418
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,858
And appreciates you
for the amazing person

419
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,594
That I am always
telling you that you are.

420
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,230
She's perfect for you,

421
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,233
So what are you waiting for,
Barry?

422
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,971
How long has it been missing?

423
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,775
I don't know.

424
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,711
I'm gonna ask you again,
Cisco.

425
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,580
But when I do,

426
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,549
I expect a more specific answer
than "I don't know."

427
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:23,921
Now, how long has this weapon
been gone?

428
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,624
A day, maybe two.

429
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,527
One of the janitors didn't
show up for work this morning.

430
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,462
He was probably the one
who took it.

431
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:35,099
I didn't think that...

432
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,767
You didn't think,

433
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,138
Because if you had, you would
have discussed with me

434
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,439
First your desire to build
something that could,

435
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,640
In theory, hurt anyone,

436
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:46,210
And in particular,
Barry Allen.

437
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,879
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,947
If you just let me explain...

439
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,749
You know how I feel
about weapons, Cisco.

440
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,484
They do not belong
in S.T.A.R. Labs.

441
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:57,688
Now, you are gonna figure out
a way to locate this gun,

442
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,958
And you are gonna
do it right now.

443
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,201
This thing you built,
what can it do?

444
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,806
Bad stuff.

445
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,543
You said to call if
there was anything suspicious.

446
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,478
This guy went through the tour
twice.

447
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,547
Nobody does that.

448
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,322
This is Detective West.

449
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,957
I have a visual on Leonard Snart
at the museum.

450
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,193
Requesting immediate back up.

451
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,131
I'm sorry.
I thought I knew it,

452
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,633
And I got excited,
and I... I just hit it.

453
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,536
No, I mean,
maybe they'll get it wrong too.

454
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,471
Oh, yeah.
I am sure that the team

455
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,473
named Pride and Padawans
doesn't know the name

456
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:54,478
to Han Solo's ship.

457
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,940
Oh, honey, you are so cute
when you're confused.

458
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,324
Someone spotted Snart.

459
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,000
I gotta go.

460
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,350
I'll cover for you.

461
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,814
All right, what are you
gonna say?

462
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,600
I usually tell people Oliver's
at a night club with a girl

463
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,733
or nursing a hangover.

464
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,135
None of which will work
for me.

465
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:18,769
Bad stomach ache...
really bad diarrhea.

466
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,031
Yeah, I'm not comfortable
with that excuse.

467
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,172
Just go.

468
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,007
Stay safe.

469
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,910
And I'm talking to air now,
which is odd.

470
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,845
And I'm still doing it.

471
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,997
Snart!

472
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,765
- You okay?
- Ahh, aah, it burns.

473
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:31,075
Time for a test run.

474
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,811
Let's see how fast you are.

475
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:39,984
Gah!

476
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,801
No!

477
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,480
No.

478
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,018
I couldn't...

479
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,426
It's still numb.

480
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,328
It's presenting itself
like third degree frostbite.

481
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,763
I thought
he had hyper healing.

482
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,331
It's been slowed.

483
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,899
If your cells
weren't regenerating at the rate

484
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,435
They are, your blood vessels
would have frozen solid

485
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,337
And the nerve damage
would have been permanent.

486
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,739
You're lucky to be alive.

487
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,774
Snart wasn't
another meta-human.

488
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,075
He has some kind of gun.

489
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,277
It froze things,
slowed me down...

490
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,848
Enough that I wasn't in time
to save someone.

491
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,416
According to his record,

492
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,051
Snart didn't even bother
to finish high school,

493
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:50,755
So how did he build a handheld
high tech snow machine?

494
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,923
S.T.A.R. Labs
built the cold gun.

495
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:57,661
Dr. Wells and Caitlin
had nothing to do with this.

496
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:01,766
I built the gun.

497
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:04,101
You did?

498
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,336
Why?

499
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:08,439
Because speed
and cold are opposites.

500
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,074
Temperature is measured

501
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,243
By how quickly the atoms
of something are oscillating.

502
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,078
The faster they are,
the hotter it is,

503
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,781
And when then are cold, they're
slower on the atomic level.

504
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:19,016
When there's no movement at all,
it's called...

505
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,519
Absolute zero.

506
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,254
Yeah.

507
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:28,826
I designed a compact cryo engine
to achieve absolute zero.

508
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,162
I built it to stop you.

509
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:34,298
I didn't know
who you were then, Barry.

510
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,001
I mean, what if you turned out
to be some psycho,

511
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,269
Like Mardon or nimbus?

512
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,838
But I didn't.
Did I?

513
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,775
We built the entire structure
you're standing in to do good,

514
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,343
And it blew up.

515
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,579
In the wake of that,
you can understand why Cisco

516
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,347
would want
to be prepared for the worst.

517
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,683
I can understand that,
but what I can't understand

518
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,519
is why you didn't tell me
what you did.

519
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,021
I mean,
after all we've been through,

520
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,389
I thought you trusted me.

521
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,391
- I thought we were friends.
- We are, Barry.

522
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,293
I mean, if you
would have just told me,

523
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,228
I could have been prepared.

524
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,163
But instead,
someone died tonight.

525
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,368
And I have to live with that.

526
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,306
No, Cisco.
We all do.

527
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,213
Theatergoers remain shaken

528
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,315
After surviving tonight's
brutal and bizarre attack

529
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,316
In a downtown theater...

530
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,385
The news... are you okay?

531
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:31,155
I'm fine.

532
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,390
How long is this gonna go on?

533
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,993
Seems like the cold treatment
is going around.

534
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,461
Not now, Iris, please.

535
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,630
Yes, now.

536
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,465
You did the same thing
when I tried to sign up

537
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,400
For the police academy
without telling you.

538
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,169
You didn't speak to me
for weeks...

539
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,137
Not until I withdrew
my application.

540
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,707
Well, I am not withdrawing
this time, dad.

541
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,142
I am dating Eddie
whether you like it or not.

542
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,911
- Eddie's my partner.
- I know.

543
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,513
But you don't.
You're not a cop.

544
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,915
You don't know
what having a partner means.

545
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,918
Wherever I go, he goes,

546
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,221
And where I go
isn't always safe, Iris.

547
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:07,892
I need to be 100% focused.

548
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:11,295
Now, there's a part
of me that isn't focused,

549
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,197
That doesn't see Eddie
as my partner,

550
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,466
But as your boyfriend.

551
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,969
So if he gets hurt or worse,

552
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,971
And I'm there,

553
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,073
How am I gonna look at you?

554
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,110
How you gonna look at me?

555
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:28,913
Now, I'm not mad at you,

556
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:33,751
But that's
why this is so hard for me.

557
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,586
Do you understand?

558
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,125
We're going back tonight.

559
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,526
- Back where?
- To the museum.

560
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,628
That diamond isn't going
to steal itself.

561
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,697
Super gun freeze
your brain, Snart?

562
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,566
The museum's gonna
be crawling with police by now,

563
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,434
And the Streak.
This can stop the Streak.

564
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:53,037
It hurt him,
and I know his real weakness.

565
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,040
So we go, unless you want out.

566
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:59,610
We both want out... alive.

567
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,513
So you thought ahead
and made a plan.

568
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:06,183
Least I taught you something.

569
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,952
So what are you waiting for?

570
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:10,955
Shoot me.

571
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,123
You better put a bullet
in my brain right now,

572
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,959
Because if you don't,

573
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:17,528
If I ever see either one
of you again...

574
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,797
You don't get it, do you?

575
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,199
This blur is out there,

576
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,102
And Central City
ain't your playground anymore.

577
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,543
Sure, it is.

578
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,119
Barry?

579
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:45,422
Barry.

580
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,425
What?
What are you doing?

581
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,661
You should go back
to your hotel.

582
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,197
Get some sleep.
You should too.

583
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:56,200
Not go back to my hotel...
I meant get some sleep.

584
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,106
I can't.

585
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,375
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

586
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,114
I watched him die.

587
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,586
I have to go faster.

588
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,422
Barry, it's not your fault.

589
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,990
And it's not Cisco's, either.

590
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,558
Barry, I know you're upset,

591
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,928
But you have to look at this
from his point of view.

592
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,897
No, I get it.

593
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,666
He didn't trust me.

594
00:29:28,668 --> 00:29:31,669
Barry, when you met us...
me, Oliver, and Dig...

595
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:34,738
We were this well-oiled
archery machine.

596
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,007
But it didn't start out
that way.

597
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,176
And unlike you guys, we weren't
tossed together overnight.

598
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:42,346
We came together one at a time.

599
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,114
Believe me, it took much more
than watching Oliver

600
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,583
Do the salmon ladder
to make me trust him.

601
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,401
I've seen firsthand
what this life can do to people.

602
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,403
It's a lonely path.

603
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:10,007
Don't make it
any lonelier than it has to be.

604
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,089
Freeze!

605
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,024
You want to end up
like that door?

606
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,334
Hi there.

607
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,538
I figured out a way
to track Captain cold.

608
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,407
You gotta stop
naming these guys.

609
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,944
- Barry, listen to him.
- How?

610
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:50,047
The cold gun is powered
by an engine control unit,

611
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,382
A microcomputer that regulates
air-to-fuel ratios

612
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,784
So the sub-cooled fluid

613
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,786
In the chambers don't overflow
and...

614
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:57,521
- Explode.
- Right.

615
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,891
This E.C.U. was receiving updates
wirelessly from my tablet.

616
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:03,727
If I boost the signal
using Central City's network

617
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,095
And send a false update,

618
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,463
We'll get a ping back,
and then...

619
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,999
We can locate Snart.

620
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,567
How long will it take?

621
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,269
First I have to hack
into the city's network,

622
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,138
So I don't know, 30 minutes,
maybe?

623
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,939
I can do it in less than one.

624
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,941
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

625
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:21,445
Ow! That was not as bad ass
as I pictured.

626
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,282
All right, I'm in.

627
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:26,650
Are you kidding?

628
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,353
All right,
I'm sending the updates.

629
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,788
We're connected.

630
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,823
Network is triangulating
the location.

631
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:34,992
We got him.
He's heading west on Nelson

632
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,827
Toward the train station.

633
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,296
If he's leaving, it appears
Mr. Snart may have gotten

634
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:42,232
What he came for.

635
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,001
When we put our minds to it,

636
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,470
Dude, nothing can stop us.

637
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,505
Oh, you turned your ear
piece off.

638
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,641
How are we gonna talk
to each other?

639
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:52,943
I don't feel
like talking right now.

640
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,083
All available units,

641
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,886
Suspect spotted at
Central City train station.

642
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,255
We got Snart.

643
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,958
- Wait here for back up.
- Wait for back up? No way.

644
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,526
That's an order.

645
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,032
- You should go after Barry.
- You heard him, Felicity.

646
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,466
He wants to do this alone.

647
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,868
Of course, he said that.

648
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,069
He's hurt.

649
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,871
You're his team and his friends.

650
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:23,173
If I had a nickel for every time
the Arrow told me to back off,

651
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,175
I would be as rich
as Oliver Queen,

652
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:28,045
Who I mention because he's
the richest person I know,

653
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,546
Or used to be.

654
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,082
The point is,

655
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,585
You have your partner's back

656
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:38,555
No matter what.

657
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:41,825
I have something
that might help.

658
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:54,705
I'm your partner,
not your assistant.

659
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,391
There's nowhere to run.

660
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,093
I didn't see you before.

661
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:19,429
Your mom know you're out
past your bedtime?

662
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,565
If you wanted to get away
you should've taken something

663
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,233
Faster than a train.

664
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,969
That's if I wanted
to get away.

665
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,872
I've seen your weakness
at the armored car,

666
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,574
Then at the theater.

667
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:33,210
See, while you're busy
saving everybody,

668
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,612
I'll be saving myself.

669
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,628
Good luck with that.

670
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,768
Ahh!

671
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,105
Pretty fast, kid,

672
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,507
But not fast enough.

673
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,550
Thank you.

674
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:47,718
For what?

675
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,886
You forced me to up my game,

676
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,188
Not only with this gun,

677
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,690
But with how I think
about the job.

678
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,359
It's been educational.

679
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:59,029
Drop it.

680
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,797
This is a prototype cold gun,

681
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:05,569
Four times the size,
four times the power.

682
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,704
I was wondering
who you were talking to.

683
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,741
Hey, unless you want a taste
of your own medicine,

684
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:11,742
I'd back the hell up.

685
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,976
Your hands are shaking.

686
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,745
You've never killed anyone.

687
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:17,447
There's a first time
for everything, Captain Cold.

688
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,385
I will shoot you.

689
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,959
You win, kid.

690
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,061
I'll see you around.

691
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,934
Hey, leave the diamond.

692
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,037
Don't push your luck.

693
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,578
Couldn't shoot him
if I wanted to.

694
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,416
This is actually
the S.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner

695
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:54,151
with a lot of LEDs.

696
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:58,488
Let's get you warm.

697
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,323
Thank you.

698
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,869
We've been
trying to track Snart,

699
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:17,674
But he must have
disconnected the signal somehow.

700
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:22,379
We'll find him,
Cisco, together.

701
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,217
You have a great team here,
Barry.

702
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:32,722
Speaking of teams, I should
probably get back to mine.

703
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,459
It was nice meeting you,
Ms. Smoak.

704
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:38,028
Please extend a hello
to the Arrow for us.

705
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,097
I will.

706
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,969
Good-bye, Felicity.

707
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,805
Bye, Barry.

708
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,053
Remarkable young woman.

709
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,689
She's special.

710
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:08,024
Yeah, she is.

711
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,733
Cisco,

712
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:21,905
Don't you ever
do anything like that again.

713
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,742
Do you understand me?

714
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,111
Yes, sir.

715
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,593
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

716
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,400
If you're looking for Eddie,
he's in evidence.

717
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,036
I am looking for you.

718
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:55,172
I came to apologize... again.

719
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:00,510
You're really trying to hit
that magic number, aren't you?

720
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,180
Look, dad,
I just want you to know

721
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:05,482
That there is nothing
that you could do

722
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,484
That would ever change the way
that I look at you.

723
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,186
And I'm sorry.

724
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:10,687
I should have thought
about how

725
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,122
It would affect you
if Eddie and I...

726
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,157
Listen...

727
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,127
Chasing down
this Snart character tonight?

728
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,429
He had the draw on me.

729
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:23,233
Eddie saved my life.

730
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:26,069
Maybe I underestimated him.

731
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:29,673
From now on, no more secrets.

732
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,179
No more secrets.

733
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,753
Well, go see Eddie.
Okay.

734
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:46,590
Thank him for watching out
for your old man.

735
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,510
Did I just yelp?

736
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,079
- Yeah.
- I yelped.

737
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,714
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

738
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,515
Don't tell me
you're here to save me.

739
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,584
Taking the train is still one
of the safest ways to travel.

740
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,720
I thought that was airplanes.

741
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,722
Mm...

742
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,961
You remember when you told me
you had a little experience

743
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,230
Liking somebody
who didn't see you the same way?

744
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,201
That was Iris, right?

745
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,739
How did you know?

746
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,141
It's the little things.

747
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:41,344
The way you linger on her
when she isn't looking,

748
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:45,048
The smile you fake
to play the part,

749
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,651
Quiet dreams
you keep to yourself.

750
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:54,224
Like you and Oliver.

751
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,992
Takes one to know one.

752
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,501
I'm afraid
it'll change everything.

753
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,304
It will.

754
00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:09,706
But maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

755
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,511
What is wrong with us?

756
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:17,847
We are perfectly perfect
for each other.

757
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,851
Yet we're sitting here,
pining for people we can't have.

758
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,688
I guess what they say is true.

759
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,523
Opposites do attract.

760
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,696
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

761
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:34,197
Same.

762
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,832
Well, as fast I can run,

763
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,401
Which might take me a while,
but I will still come.

764
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,144
Bye, Felicity.

765
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,600
Bye, Barry.

766
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,302
Whoo-hoo!

767
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,479
I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

768
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,248
I know it didn't go so well
for you,

769
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,883
And I know I said
we were finished.

770
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,551
But things have changed.

771
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,387
If I want to keep
working in Central City,

772
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,989
I'm gonna need
a new kind of crew.

773
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,125
I'm gonna need someone like you.

774
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:37,127
You're tolerant of extremes.

775
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:39,763
You have certain skills.

776
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:44,100
You just need some direction.

777
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:47,370
And I can give that to you.

778
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,873
You still like playing
with fire?

779
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,742
You're gonna love this.

780
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,611
So...

781
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,981
Are you in,
Mick, or are you out?

782
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,118
Yeah, buddy.
I'm in.

783
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,009
Greg, move your head.
