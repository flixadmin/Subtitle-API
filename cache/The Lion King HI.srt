166
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:50,165
And beyond those shadows?

167
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,135
You must not go there, Simba.

168
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:54,737
But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

169
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,839
Take any territory.

170
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,075
While others search
for what they can take...

171
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:03,286
a true king searches
for what he can give.

172
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:12,088
Everything you see
exists together

173
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,058
in a delicate balance.

174
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,661
As king, you need to
understand that balance...

175
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,829
and respect all the creatures...

176
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,901
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

177
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,971
SIMBA: But, Dad,
don't we eat the antelope?

178
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:31,775
MUFASA: Yes, Simba.
But let me explain.

179
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:36,045
When we die, our bodies
become the grass...

180
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:39,082
and the antelope
eat the grass...

181
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:44,286
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

182
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:46,655
Sire!
Morning, Zazu.

183
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,223
Do you have the morning report?

184
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,825
Yes, sire.

00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,276
Two giraffe were caught necking.

187
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,964
The buzz from the bees...

188
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,098
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

189
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,099
Ready for some fun?

190
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,968
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

191
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:00,804
I'm like,
"Birds, we get it."

192
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,372
Stay low to the ground.

193
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,839
I got this.

194
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,977
MUFASA: Check the wind,
the shadows...

195
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:09,646
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

the baboons' dinner,

00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,068
and now the baboons
are going ape.

198
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,217
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

199
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:15,352
That's what I say.

No, son. You stay
with the other cubs.

I am not a cub.

So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

No. He said I can't
go there. Ever.

Something is approaching.

We are never
getting married, Zazu.

near my son again...

491
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,718
No, Mufasa. Never.

492
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:16,151
Never again.

493
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:18,764
You've been warned, Shenzi.

494
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,802
(SOFTLY) I thought
you were very brave.

495
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:06,872
MUFASA: Zazu?

496
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:11,342
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

497
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:14,075
ZAZU: Yes, sire.

498
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,178
Don't be too hard on him, sire.

499
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:19,814
I remember a cub,
a certain headstrong cub...

500
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:21,850
who was always getting
into scrapes.

501
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:24,687
And he achieved some prominence,

502
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,087
did he not, sire?

503
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:29,264
I have to teach my son a lesson.

504
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:36,372
Nala, come along.

505
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:43,926
MUFASA: Simba?

506
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:06,260
You deliberately disobeyed me.

507
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:07,696
SIMBA: I know. (SIGHS)

508
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:09,230
MUFASA: You could
have been killed.

509
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:13,168
And what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

510
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:16,738
Do you understand
what's at stake?

511
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:20,676
You jeopardized
the future of our pride.

512
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,812
I just wanted to show you
I could do it.

513
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:25,881
That I could be brave like you.

514
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:28,050
I'm only brave
when I have to be,

515
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,119
when there's no other choice.

516
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,188
But you're not scared
of anything.

517
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,823
I was today.

518
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:36,025
You were?

519
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:39,765
Yes. I thought
I might lose you.

520
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:45,036
I guess even kings
get scared, huh?

521
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,670
More than you could ever know.

522
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,672
But guess what?
What?

523
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:54,208
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

524
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:57,412
That's 'cause nobody messes
with your dad.

525
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:59,281
Come here.

526
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:01,392

Uh-huh?

529
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,362
We're pals, right?

530
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:15,898
(CHUCKLES) Right.

531
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,132
And we'll always be together...

532
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,436
right?

533
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:25,474
Simba, let me tell you
something my father told me.

534
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:27,743
Look at the stars.

535
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:30,112
The great kings of the past...

536
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:33,381
look down on us
from those stars.

537
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:35,851
Really?
Yes.

538
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:38,187
So whenever you feel alone...

539
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:41,189
just remember
that those kings...

540
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,861
will always be up there
to guide you.

541
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:47,129
And so will I.

542
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,398
But I can't see them, Dad.

543
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:51,734
Keep looking, son.

544
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:53,382
Keep looking.

545
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:08,505
(WHINING SOFTLY)

546
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:30,538
Mufasa is strong.

547
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,440
Like, way stronger than us.

548
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:34,243
Please give me some space.
What?

549
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:36,178
You could lay anywhere
in this cave.

550
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,514
Where do you want me to...
I need some personal space.

551
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:39,785
Okay?
Okay.

552
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:44,052
Not to take anything away
from you. You were great.

553
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,420
But he is... (EXHALES)

554
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:47,288
See, now I know you're
doing this on purpose.

555
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,991
Very brave, too.
Tough, good energy.

556
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:51,232
Now you're just being spiteful.

557
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:52,128
Good posture.

558
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:53,228
Next time I see Mufasa...

559
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:56,198
I'm gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget.

560
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:58,566
Well, you're in luck!
He's right behind ya.

561
00:33:58,567 --> 00:33:59,848
Mufasa?

562
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:14,081
(HYENAS CHATTERING)

563
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:15,854
That's not the king.

00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:21,356
You fools have stripped your
land of every living thing.

565
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:24,827
And yet I send
two little cubs your way...

566
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:26,360
and they come back alive.

567
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:28,998
I guess we'll have to
eat you instead.

568
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:31,967
Why eat one meal...

569
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:35,604
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives?

570
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:38,506
What could you possibly
offer us?

571
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:41,376
A place where you can
fill your bellies.

572
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:43,478
Where everything
the light touches

573
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,479
is yours for the kill.

574

are not yours to give.

we're going to kill him.

As long as you resist
they will reject me.

992

the lions will eat
after the hyenas.
