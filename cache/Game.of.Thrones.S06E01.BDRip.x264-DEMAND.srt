1
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,242
It's coming from the courtyard.

2
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,920
It's the Lord Commander!

3
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,443
Help me get him inside.

4
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,885
Thorne did this.

5
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,566
How many of your brothers
do you think you can trust?

6
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,406
Trust?

7
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,727
The men in this room.

8
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,246
Does the wolf know you?

9
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,765
We need all the help we can get.

10
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,685
Ser Davos.

11
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,843
I saw him in the flames

12
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,404
fighting at Winterfell.

13
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,483
I can't speak for the flames,

14
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,845
but he's gone.

15
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,402
He was our Lord Commander.

16
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,448
He never should have been!

17
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,604
You all know why you're here.

18
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,442
Jon Snow is dead.

19
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,726
Who killed him?

20
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,603
I did.

21
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,206
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck

22
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,524
and the other officers in this castle.

23
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,409
- Murderers!
- Traitors!

24
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,529
You're right!

25
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,728
We've committed treason, all of us.

26
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,771
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

27
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,689
I had no love for him.

28
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,690
That was no secret.

29
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,603
But I never once disobeyed an order.

30
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,162
Loyalty is the foundation
on which the Night's Watch is built.

31
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,561
And the Watch means everything to me.

32
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,724
I have given my life,

33
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,771
we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

34
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,843
Jon Snow was going to destroy
the Night's Watch.

35
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,567
He let the wildlings through our gates

36
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,089
as no Lord Commander has
ever done before.

37
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,804
He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

38
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,406
and raped and murdered.

39
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

40
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,923
I've no doubt about that.

41
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,410
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

42
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,331
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

43
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,925
And we made it.

44
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,922
He'll have seen we didn't come.

45
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,002
Thorne will have made it official by now.

46
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,605
Castle Black is his.

47
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,206
I don't care who's sitting
at the high table.

48
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,605
Jon was my friend.

49
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,843
And those fuckers butchered him.

50
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,285
Now we return the favor.

51
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,805
We don't have the numbers.

52
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,321
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

53
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,289
I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,

54
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,443
but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

55
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,842
If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

56
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,770
We all die today.

57
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,166
I say we do our best
to take Thorne with us when we go.

58
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,564
We need to fight,
but we don't need to die.

59
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,880
Not if we have help.

60
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,121
Who is gonna help us?

61
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,443
You're not the only ones
who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

62
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,164
Bolt the door. Don't let anyone in.

63
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,330
I'll be back as soon as I can.

64
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,850
She was 11 the first time
I saw her.

65
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,168
The kennelmaster's daughter.

66
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,849
She smelled of dog.

67
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,843
I wasn't much older,
but everybody was already afraid of me.

68
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,330
You certainly were.

69
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,771
Myranda wasn't though.

70
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,170
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

71
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,689
She was fearless.

72
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,083
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

73
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,604
Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

74
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,327
I wish you could be here to watch.

75
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,244
Shall I have a grave
dug for her, my lord?

76
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,810
Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

77
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,245
Buried, burned?

78
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,371
This is good meat.
Feed it to the hounds.

79
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,491
Your command of the cavalry
was impressive.

80
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,211
Thanks to you,
the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead.

81
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,047
Do you know who struck the killing blow?

82
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,884
- No.
- A shame.

83
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,371
I'd reward the man.

84
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,561
Still, a great victory.

85
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,490
Do you feel like a victor?

86
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,726
I rebelled against the crown
to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.

87
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,360
Do you think that burning
wagons in the night

88
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,687
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

89
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,923
is the same as facing
a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?

90
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,167
No.

91
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,204
A reckoning will come.

92
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,770
We need the North to face it.

93
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,285
The entire North.

94
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,011
They won't back us without Sansa Stark.

95
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,647
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

96
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,283
You played your games with her.

97
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,562
You played your games
with the heir to the Iron Islands

98
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,880
and now they're both gone.

99
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,770
I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

100
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,367
They won't get far.

101
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,930
I'm glad to hear it.

102
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,849
Without Sansa,
you won't be able to produce an heir.

103
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,924
And without an heir, well...

104
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,881
Let's hope the maesters are right
and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

105
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,490
We can't stop.

106
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,130
We have to cross here.

107
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,486
- I can't.
- It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

108
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,131
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

109
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,771
I've seen what his hounds do to a person.

110
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,569
This way is better.

111
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,963
Over here. Come on.

112
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,325
Sansa.

113
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,050
Sansa.

114
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,170
Tell them to settle down!

115
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,725
Stay here. I'll lure them away.

116
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,451
- No, I won't make it without you.
- You will.

117
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,564
Go north, only north.

118
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,969
Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.

119
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,801
He'll help you.

120
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,446
See somebody, eh?

121
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,280
- There they are!
- Get them!

122
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,005
Where is Lady Bolton?

123
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,284
- Dead.
- Liar.

124
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,447
She broke her leg jumping
from the ramparts.

125
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,525
I left her to die in the snow.

126
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,528
Got something! Run!

127
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,001
Resist. Stay.

128
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,441
Stay.

129
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,047
I can't wait to see
what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.

130
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,881
Rider!

131
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,041
- Who is it?
- It's a bloody woman.

132
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,287
No! Please! Don't!

133
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,090
Lady Sansa,
I offer my services once again.

134
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,086
I will shield your back and keep your counsel
and give my life for yours if need be.

135
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,168
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

136
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,681
And I vow

137
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,284
that you shall always
have a place by my hearth

138
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,241
and...

139
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,125
Meat and mead at my table.

140
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,407
Meat and mead at my table.

141
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,445
And I pledge to ask no service of you

142
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,202
that might bring you dishonor.

143
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,566
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

144
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,486
Arise.

145
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,402
Your Grace,
I'm sorry to disturb you.

146
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,847
A ship from Dorne has
sailed into the harbor.

147
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,566
Myrcella.

148
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,090
Do you remember the first time
you saw a dead body?

149
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,441
Mother.

150
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,445
All I could think about when she died
was what would happen to her now.

151
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,684
Every day, every night,

152
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,128
what does Mama look like now?

153
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,684
Has she started to bloat?

154
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,643
Has her skin turned black?

155
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,042
Have her lips peeled back
from her teeth?

156
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,211
I think about locking Myrcella
in a crypt.

157
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,810
I think about her beautiful little face
starting to collapse.

158
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,121
Don't think about it.

159
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,440
I have to.

160
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,680
I have to. It's not right
she has to suffer alone.

161
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,087
She's not suffering. She's gone.

162
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,284
No one can hurt her anymore.

163
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,931
She was good.

164
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,287
From her first breath,
she was so sweet.

165
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,324
I don't know where she came from.

166
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,364
She was nothing like me.

167
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,848
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

168
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,001
I know.

169
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,725
I thought if I could
make something so good,

170
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,126
so pure,

171
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,447
maybe I'm not a monster.

172
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,090
Listen... Listen to me.

173
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,686
She was my daughter and I failed her.

174
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,410
No, I knew this would happen.

175
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,760
The witch told me years ago.

176
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,683
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

177
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,802
And gold their shrouds.

178
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,882
Everything she said came true.
You couldn't have stopped it.

179
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,530
It's prophecy. It's fate.

180
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,927
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

181
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,326
You told me yourself when Father died.

182
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,209
You said we had to stay together.

183
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,090
You said people would try to tear us apart,
take what's ours.

184
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,446
That was a prophecy too.

185
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,330
I didn't listen to you,
and everything you said came true.

186
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,890
Fuck prophecy.

187
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,531
Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn't us.

188
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,081
We're the only ones who matter,
the only ones in this world.

189
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,006
And everything they've taken from us,
we're going to take back and more.

190
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
We're going to take everything there is.

191
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,921
The seven hells
brim with the souls of saintly men.

192
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,810
They scream in agony
and their shame is so great,

193
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,042
they do not feel the flames,

194
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,809
for now they see if not for a single sin
they concealed, they were saved.

195
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,564
I'd like to see my brother.

196
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,688
- Confess.
- Please.

197
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,125
How is he? At least tell me that.

198
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,531
Confess.

199
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,762
I am the queen
and I demand to see my brother.

200
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,763
Sinners don't make demands.

201
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,882
They make confessions.

202
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,211
Septa Unella.

203
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,321
Our other guests need you.

204
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,126
There.

205
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,450
Septa Unella can be overzealous
at times.

206
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,881
I'll speak with her.

207
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,844
My brother, can you tell me how he is?

208
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,248
It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.

209
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,724
Your husband misses you dearly.

210
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,451
The love between a man
and wife is sacred.

211
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,084
It reflects the love the
gods have for all of us.

212
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,001
But sin leads us away from the sacred.

213
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,567
And only confession can purge sin.

214
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,442
I have nothing to confess.

215
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,291
So you believe you are pure?

216
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,127
Perfect?

217
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,009
Wholly without sin?

218
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,125
None of us are.

219
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,925
You have started down the path.

220
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,528
But you have many miles to go.

221
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,881
I always envied Oberyn.

222
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,761
He lived.

223
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,561
He truly lived.

224
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,130
Sailed around the world.

225
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,881
Fought men from every country.

226
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,008
Lay with the most beautiful women alive.

227
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,923
- And men.
- And men.

228
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,482
He experienced everything

229
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,084
while I sat here in Dorne

230
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,801
trying my best to keep my people
alive and well fed.

231
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,764
But that is life.

232
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,249
We each have our roles.

233
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,401
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

234
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,523
And I was born to rule.

235
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,290
The gods are not fools.

236
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,922
You would have been a lousy adventurer.

237
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,765
And Oberyn,

238
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,650
he would have been a terrible ruler.

239
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,002
Your mother is a brilliant woman,
you know that?

240
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,330
Prince Doran.

241
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,084
The Princess Myrcella.

242
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,486
When was the last time
you left this palace?

243
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,968
You don't know your own people.

244
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,250
Their disgust for you.

245
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,251
Elia Martell, raped and murdered,
and you did nothing.

246
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,646
Oberyn Martell, butchered,
and you did nothing.

247
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,529
You're not a Dornishman.

248
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,890
And you're not our prince.

249
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,248
My son, Trystane...

250
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,363
Your son is weak, just like you.

251
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,369
And weak men will never rule Dorne again.

252
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,329
I told you I'm not hungry.

253
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,888
We're not here to feed you.

254
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,363
We're here to kill you.

255
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,364
You want her to do it or me?

256
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,046
We are family.
I don't want to hurt you.

257
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,283
Her or me?

258
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,081
You.

259
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,121
Good.

260
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,760
Smart boy.

261
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,641
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

262
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,289
We're never going to fix
what's wrong with this city

263
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,806
from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.

264
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,246
We'll be fine.

265
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,849
We're dressed like common merchants.

266
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,529
You walk like a rich person.

267
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,489
You've spent a lot of time studying
the way rich people walk?

268
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,962
You walk as though the paving stones
were your personal property.

269
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,404
I used to steal from people like you
when I was a boy.

270
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

271
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,010
Because you have no cock.

272
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,760
For your baby.

273
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,327
To eat.

274
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,047
To eat.

275
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,529
She thinks you want to eat her baby.

276
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,766
His Valyrian is terrible.

277
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,651
He only wants to give you money,

278
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,770
so your baby can eat.

279
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,923
Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.

280
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,490
I know what mhysa means.

281
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,449
- Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

282
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,288
Our queen is not as popular in Meereen
as she used to be.

283
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,850
The Sons of the Harpy?

284
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,206
Very possibly.

285
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,404
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

286
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,683
told them human beings
weren't even property to begin with.

287
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,524
You can see why they're unhappy.

288
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,326
Of course,

289
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,809
it could also be the freed men.

290
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,929
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

291
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,405
The Lord of Light sent the
Mother of Dragons to you,

292
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,121
and those who love the
darkness chased her away.

293
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,443
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

294
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,964
She did fly away on a dragon
and not come back.

295
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,244
How will you respond?

296
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,160
Will you wring your hands, while you
wait for the Mother of Dragons to return?

297
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,040
Or will you take up her flames yourselves?

298
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,090
Will you fight for your own salvation,

299
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,322
now that Queen Daenerys
is not here to fight for you?

300
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,771
It's a problem.

301
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,486
Fear has brought Meereen
to a standstill.

302
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,881
Whoever you are, wherever you go,

303
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,687
someone in this city
wants to murder you.

304
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,926
We can't fight an enemy
we don't know.

305
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,165
The Sons of the Harpy planned their
attack in the fighting pits very carefully,

306
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,086
which means they take orders
from someone.

307
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,162
And have you started
looking for that someone?

308
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,291
My little birds have already taken wing.

309
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,968
Soon they'll return,
singing songs of men in gold masks.

310
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,844
Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros
anytime soon.

311
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,006
Goat?

312
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,481
Ram.

313
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,609
Do you think our friend got him?

314
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,364
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

315
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,528
We're on the right path then.

316
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,767
Perhaps she's tired of being queen.

317
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,763
I don't think she likes it very much.

318
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,729
She's too smart to like it.

319
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,041
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,
somewhere far away from men like us.

320
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,248
I've been all over the world.

321
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,004
There's no escaping men like us.

322
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,169
There's no escaping her, eh?

323
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,491
You keep coming back. Why?

324
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,885
You know why.

325
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,245
Isn't it frustrating

326
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,440
wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

327
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,045
Of course it is.

328
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,851
You're a romantic. I admire that.

329
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,329
Sometimes I look at you and I think,
so that's what I'll be like when I grow old.

330
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,811
If you grow old.

331
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,041
If I grow old.

332
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,804
I hope I do.

333
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,804
I want to see what the world looks like
when she's done conquering it.

334
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,646
So do I.

335
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,921
Huh, an army?

336
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,966
Not an army.

337
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,560
A horde.

338
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,641
Dothraki?

339
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,726
They have her.

340
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,884
Maybe she saw a ghost.

341
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,850
My friend's mother saw a ghost
and her hair turned white.

342
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,571
Pink people are afraid of the sun.

343
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,608
It burns their skin.

344
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,446
This one stands too long in the sun
and her hair goes white.

345
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,923
You think she's got white pussy hair too?

346
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,241
You ever been with a girl
with white pussy hair?

347
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,449
Only when I was fucking your grandma.

348
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,602
I'll ask Khal Moro for a night with you.

349
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,967
What do you think?

350
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,567
Pretty eyes, but she's an idiot.

351
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,602
She doesn't have to be smart
to get fucked in the ass.

352
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,130
I like to talk when I'm finished.
Otherwise, we might as well be dogs.

353
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,961
No.

354
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,044
For you, my Khal.

355
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,726
The white-haired girl
we found in the hills.

356
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,044
Look at those lips, blood of my blood.

357
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,727
Blue-eyed women are witches.

358
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,245
It is known.

359
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,566
Cut off her head,
before she casts a spell on you.

360
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,883
Even if I was blind,

361
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,409
I'd hear my wives say,

362
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,281
cut off her head

363
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,167
and I'd know this woman is beautiful.

364
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,768
I'm glad I'm not blind.

365
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,049
Seeing a beautiful woman naked
for the first time,

366
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,804
what is better than that?

367
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,882
Killing another Khal?

368
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,769
Yes, killing another Khal.

369
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,322
Conquering a city
and taking her people as slaves,

370
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,006
and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.

371
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,844
Breaking a wild horse,

372
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,327
forcing it to submit to your will.

373
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,486
Seeing a beautiful woman naked
for the first time

374
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,928
is among the five best things in life.

375
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,082
Do not touch me.

376
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,323
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen,

377
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,963
the First of Her Name, the Unburnt,

378
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,485
Queen of Meereen,

379
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,325
Queen of the Andals
and the Rhoynar and the First Men,

380
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,243
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

381
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,322
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

382
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,970
You are nobody,
the millionth of your name,

383
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,769
Queen of Nothing,

384
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,130
slave of Khal Moro.

385
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,010
Tonight I will lie with you,

386
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,643
and if the Great Stallion is kind,

387
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,927
you will give me a son.

388
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,968
Do you understand?

389
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,562
I will not lie with you.

390
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,850
And I will bear no children,
for you, or anyone else.

391
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,720
Not until the sun rises in the west,
and sets in the east.

392
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,641
I told you she was a witch.

393
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,003
Cut off her head.

394
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,490
I like her. She has spirit.

395
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,482
I was wife to Khal Drogo,
son of Khal Bharbo.

396
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,885
Khal Drogo is dead.

397
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,246
I know.

398
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,361
I burnt his body.

399
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,563
Forgive me. I did not know.

400
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,564
It is forbidden to lie with a Khal's widow.

401
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,210
No one will touch you.

402
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,365
You have my word.

403
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,205
If you will escort me back to Meereen,

404
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,522
I will see that your khalasar is given a
thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude.

405
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,371
When a Khal dies,

406
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,727
there is only one place for his khaleesi.

407
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,841
Vaes Dothrak.
The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

408
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,686
To live out her days with
the widows of dead khals.

409
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,244
It is known.

410
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,927
But there has to be a price
to pay for everything.

411
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,447
I know, but have you tried
telling him that?

412
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,206
Thank you.

413
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,406
Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

414
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,686
Probably had it coming.

415
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,245
Maybe so, but I'm not risking it.

416
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,129
- Just can't do it.
- All right.

417
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,328
Honesty as well. He gets it.

418
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,289
Are you listening, blind girl?

419
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,645
Do you hear them talking?

420
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,842
Do any of them talk to you?

421
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,961
No.

422
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,641
So sad.

423
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,087
Stand and fight, blind girl.

424
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,401
I can't see.

425
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,448
That's your problem, not mine.

426
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,370
See you tomorrow.

427
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,443
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

428
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,529
We are both anointed knights.

429
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,844
Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.

430
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,922
I will grant amnesty to all brothers
who throw down their arms before nightfall.

431
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,607
And you, Ser Davos,
I will allow you to travel south

432
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,441
a free man with a fresh horse.

433
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,571
And some mutton.

434
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,811
I'd like some mutton.

435
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,881
What?

436
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,970
I'm not much of a hunter.

437
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,522
I'll need some food if I'm gonna
make it south without starving.

438
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,250
We'll give you food.

439
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,291
You can bring the Red Woman
with you if you like.

440
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,449
Or you can leave her here with us,
whichever you choose.

441
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,204
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

442
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,644
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

443
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,886
We'll discuss amongst ourselves
and come back to you with an answer.

444
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,164
Boys, I've been running
from men like that all my life.

445
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,569
In my learned opinion, we open that door...

446
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,051
And they'll slaughter us all.

447
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,487
They want to come in,
they're gonna come in.

448
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,801
Aye, but we don't need to
make it easy for them.

449
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,644
Edd is our only chance.

450
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,491
It's a sad fucking statement
if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

451
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,046
There's always the Red Woman.

452
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,851
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

453
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,006
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.
