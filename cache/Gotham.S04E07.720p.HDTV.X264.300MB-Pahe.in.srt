<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,273
- Oink. Oink.
- What the?

3
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:05,929
GORDON: A cop was murdered last night.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,830
A bagman on your payroll?

5
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,999
I think someone is trying
to send you a message.

6
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:11,267
Grenade!

7
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:13,970
We have unfinished business.

8
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,805
Listen, if you think you're gonna...

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,408
- Don't talk about my mother.
- (grunts)

10
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:21,878
An opportunity awaits you.

11
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:23,446
With you and Barbara,

12
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,615
the three of us
could give all those creeps

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,083
a run for their money.

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:28,918
OSWALD: She's making alliances
with politicians.

15
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,787
Building a fortress.

16
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,288
She's been planning a war.

17
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,625
Oswald, I want you to
know I forgive you.

18
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,293
OSWALD: You started an orphanage?

19
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,461
I wanted to surprise you.

20
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,996
RA'S AL GHUL: If you don't kill me,

21
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:43,466
I will kill everyone you love.

22
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,834
(grunts)

23
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:49,739
It doesn't stop

24
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:50,907
till I've butchered

25
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:53,209
every single swine

26
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:55,211
on Penguin's payroll.

27
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:58,775
We both know, Captain Bullock,
you deserve this.

28
00:00:58,883 --> 00:00:59,882
Hold on, buddy.

29
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:02,085
GORDON: How long you been
taking money from Penguin?

30
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,386
You got to understand, Jim.

31
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,688
- The debts I got...
- It stops now.

32

00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,501
Call dibs on my office?

34
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:22,672
- I ain't dead yet.
- Just measuring

35
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,307
for when you are.

36
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:25,775
Shouldn't you be resting?

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,377
- Let me help you.
- I'm fine.

38
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:32,081
Great, so we can talk

39
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:33,850
about you taking Penguin's money.

40
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,218
I'm not that fine.

41
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:36,519
I meant what I said, Harvey.

42
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,055
This stops today. You hear me?

43
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,890
- MAN: Hey, hey!
- What the hell is that?

44
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:43,764
- You're trying to change the subject.
- Obviously.

45
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,922
But seriously, what the hell is that?

46
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:49,524
(indistinct chatter)

47
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:04,840
Some fancy-ass guy on the phone.

48
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,342
How was I supposed to know
what we were carrying?

49
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,078
Stench of death, for starters?

50
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,346
I got a cold.

51
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,614
44 boxes...

52
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,950
one for every cop in the precinct.

53
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,451
(indistinct chatter)

54
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,520
Pyg's escalating.

55
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,522
He's not just after dirty cops anymore.

56
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,057
It's the whole GCPD.

57
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:23,825
There are 45 cops here.

58
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:26,194
Oh, yeah. The instructions said

59
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,630
don't give nothing to
this one cop here named, uh...

60
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,566
Uh...

61
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:34,336
Jim Gordon?

ALFRED: Your support,
I really appreciate it.

64
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,880
Enjoy the, uh, benefit.

65
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,015
MAN: As far as the foundation
is concerned...

66
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:50,085
Helping the needy.

67
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,388
Very good for the soul, Master Bruce.

68
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,025
I have to say I really appreciate

69
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,317
you allowing us
to do the fund-raiser here.

70
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:02,097
The Society meant a great deal
to your father.

71
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:04,833
As long as I don't have to leave
the house.

72
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:07,068
Well, you're Bruce Wayne, ain't you?

73
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,571
The world can come to you.

74
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,206
Hey.

75
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,726
- What the hell?
- Excuse me?

76
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:15,210
- You knocked into me.
- Bruce.

77
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:17,779
- Sorry, I didn't notice.
- Well, you should've.

78
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,363
- Bruce.
- Honestly. I'm really sorry.

79
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,728
(breathing heavily)

80
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,071
I haven't wanted to push, Master Bruce.

81
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:46,448
I mean, what happened with Ra's...

82
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,910
I know that you're hurting.

83
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:52,047
Just, please, tell me

84
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:55,250
- what I can do to help.
- You can get off my back.

85
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:58,353
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,255
I just...

87
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:06,576
I can't stop thinking...

88
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:11,132
about... when I k...

89
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,428
I should feel bad.

90
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,405
Guilty. I...

91
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:26,114
- I-I just...
- You're just angry.

92
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,928
That anger

93
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,053
is concealing what's really going on.

94
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:35,855
Unless you face it full-on,

95
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,292
it will consume you.

96
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:40,886
And it will erupt.

97
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,800
I know...

98
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,942
what you're capable of.

99
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:49,404
And I don't want to see you

100
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:52,507
or anybody else get hurt.

101
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,613
I need some air.

102
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,692
All right.

103
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,830
Next time you see red stuff
dripping from a package,

104
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,599
consider calling the police.

105
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:19,167
We're C.O.D.

106
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,929
Get the hell out of here.

107
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,873
Hey, Jim.

108
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,544
OSWALD: James!

109
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,080
I am so happy
we are working hand in hand

110
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,983
to rid the city of this menace. (laughs)

111
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:37,452
He just showed up to, uh, offer his help.

112
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:38,757
Did he?

113
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,989
Nice to meet you, Jim. I'm Headhunter.

114
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,324
I'm sure you heard of me.

115
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,627
My new security consultant.

116
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,562
Recommended by Victor,

117
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,831
who is off visiting his bubbie.

118
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,533
You want to know why
I carry two pistols?

119
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,901
Overcompensation?

120
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,370
(laughs) See, I always shoot twice.

121
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,372
The first one does the job.

122
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,307
Every time. But the second one, well...

123
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,444
...that's just my signature. (chuckles)

124
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,145
He has a signature.

125
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:06,014
Colorful, isn't he?

126
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,082
- Mm-hmm.
- But effective.

127
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,484
Mr. Headhunter and my men

128
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,119
will help the GCPD

129
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:12,921
until this Pyg situation is resolved.

130
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,458
We don't want your help,
or that of your idiot hit man.

131
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,127
Pyg's actions threaten the both of us.

132
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,762
He's killing

133
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,032
my cops, my employees.

134
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,366
Allegedly.

135
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:27,602
Get this through your head, Oswald.

136
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,870
We don't work for you,

137
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:30,138
and we don't work with you.

138
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,306
Ever.

139
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,308
(chuckles)

140
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:37,145
Well, your captain says otherwise.

141
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,583
Excited to work with you, Jim.

142
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,788
Are you out of your frickin' mind?

143
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,224
- Jim, listen...
- You are legitimizing him, Harvey.

144
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,023
He's been legitimized for years.
He was the freaking mayor!

145
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,896
Is it about the money? Is that it?

146
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,698
It's not about that.

147
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,299
How can I know that?

148
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,834
How can you even know that?

149
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,469
Take a look out there, okay?

150
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,104
Half the precinct skipped town

151
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,740
because they didn't want to wear
bacon-flavored death masks.

152
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,642
We need the help.

153
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,744
You are dangerously overreacting.

154
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,446
I'm overreacting because every cop

155
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,881
in this precinct got a death threat.

156
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,082
Except, of course,

157
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,750
- for you.
- So, Penguin's guys

158
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,585
are gonna beat and torture
their way through the city?

159
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,753
Then execute Pyg

160
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,388
- if they find him?
- And?

161
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:22,090
And the people need to know

162
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,359
they don't need gangsters
to keep them safe.

163
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,651
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna find Pyg,

164
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:28,363
alive, and I'll bring him to justice.

165
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:30,198
Good for you.

166
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,200
Three cops just went missing.

167
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,568
Where?

168
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:36,738
It's gonna be tough. It's the Narrows.

169
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,877
So, that's it.

170
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:44,312
We're shutting up shop.

171
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,214
So long. Farewell. Toodle-oo.

172
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,649
I can't believe this.

173
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,284
I can.

174
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,120
All this was so I could be
Ra's eyes and ears in Gotham.

175
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,388
He was bankrolling us,

176
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,557
and now he's gone.
So I'm pulling the plug.

177
00:07:57,197 --> 00:07:59,416
Help yourself to whatever.

178
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,661
So all of this... being partners,

179
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,032
building something together...

180
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,333
lies.

181
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,135
A sales pitch.

182
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,504
- I couldn't do it alone.
- We can still spy

183
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,073
on the jerks who come in here
and get intel on jobs.

184
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,208
We can make it work.

185
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,711
What? And the three of us stay together

186
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,313
like a plucky little family?

187
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,114
Well, how about a little parting lesson

188
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,749
from big sis.

189
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:24,960
In this life, you're on your own.

190
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,914
Always.

191
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,192
(groans)

192
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,560
Bonus lesson:

193
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:35,329
never make Bellinis from a can.

194
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,443
I followed a buyer
from the Street Demonz.

195
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:44,872
They have a chop shop across town,

196
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:47,787
and I saw exactly
where they hide their stash.

197
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,245
Let's hit it. Show her she's wrong.

198
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,379
We're not gonna rip off

199
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,647
one of Gotham's
biggest motorcycle gangs.

200
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,082
Why not?

201
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,353
You and I will find something else.

202
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:00,455
(scoffs)

203
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:10,098
(sirens wailing)

204
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:17,205
(tires screeching)

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,008
All right, PD here,
Penguin's guys over there.

206
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:24,512
Three missing officers.
Patel from our precinct,

207
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,890
Fisoli and Perkov from the 2-2.

208
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,998
Good Lord, there's blood all over.

209
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,889
He got them here.

210
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,661
Clear view from dozens of
windows. Someone saw it.

211
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,046
They sure did.

212
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:44,699
All right, bring it in,
everybody. Come on.

213
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:49,637
This is the Narrows:

214
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,539
the poorest of the poor,

215
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,441
the hardest of the hard.

216
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:54,876
Now, I don't need to tell you

217
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:57,007
that they got a code of silence
down here,

218
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,447
which means we got to make 'em
more scared of us

219
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,941
than they are of their own people.

220
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:04,574
We go floor by floor.

221
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:05,787
Airmail!

222
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:06,821
(indistinct yelling, shouting)

223
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,962
(laughs)

224
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,132
- Let's get 'em! Move on out!
- (laughs)

225
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:20,168
(indistinct shouting)

226
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,372
This is gonna be fun.

227
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,590
Hey! Hey!

228
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:41,680
Get off of him!

229
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:44,583
Get back.

230
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:48,619
(man grunts, woman screams)

231
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,072
Hey! Hey!

232
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:51,385
Get off! Get off of him.

233
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,426
They're potential witnesses.
They're not perps.

234
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,481
This is the Narrows, Gordon.
You think there's a difference?

235
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,450
- Step away, Ruseckas.
- BULLOCK: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

236
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:01,906
Ruseckas, they need you upstairs.
You two, go. Now.

237
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,512
Working out great.

238
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,419
If it gets me my cop killer,
yeah, it is.

239
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:12,421
Right.

240
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,661
(classical music playing)

241
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:21,597
Bruce?

242
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,666
I just wanted to say hi.

243
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,671
I'm Grace. We went to school together.

244
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,606
Grace Blomdhal.

245
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:32,975
Yeah.

246
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:34,310
Sorry I d...

247
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,924
It's been years...
I didn't even recognize you.

248
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:38,581
I heard you were homeschooling.

249
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,916
Yeah.

250
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:41,751
I, um...

251
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:44,169
Why aren't you in school?

252
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,523
'Cause it's Saturday.

253
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,360
I don't mean to knock your fund-raiser,

254
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,963
but is there any chance
you're as bored as I am?

255
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:59,605
- You'd have to be pretty bored.
- (laughs)

256
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,104
So do you want to maybe go somewhere?

257
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,776
Yeah.

258
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,812
(grunting, indistinct shouting)

259
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:19,422
(door chain slides)

260
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,391
May I?

261
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:23,826
(indistinct shouts)

262
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,982
Ma'am, please.

263
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:35,705
I'm Detective Gordon.

264
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,907
We didn't see nothin'.

265
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,142
But you knew those missing cops.

266
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,026
Or knew of 'em. Right?

267
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:46,282
Three officers, different precinct,

268
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:49,852
same patrol car...
they were freelancing.

269
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,893
Look, I know how it is down here.

270
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:56,225
A lot of bad stuff happens; half
the time it's the cops doing it.

271
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:59,595
They were running some sort of
protection racket, am I right?

272
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:06,110
You sit over here. Yeah?

273
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,070
It gives you a pretty good view.

274
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:09,774
So what'd you see?

275
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,742
Please, I need you to leave.

276
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,310
No one's gonna know
you told me anything.

277
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,012
I give you my word.

278
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:21,951
Can I help?

279
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:23,085
Get out of here.

280
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:24,687
Now.

281
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,489
Will do, Jim.

282
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,392
- (woman screams)
- GORDON: Hey!

283
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:35,338
This is ridiculous.
We're all on the same team.

284
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,299
(woman sobbing)

285
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,270
(gasping breaths)

286
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,413
No, no, come on.

287
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,042
Come on. Come, come... yeah.

288
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,577
If the old lady doesn't talk,

289
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:50,813
the old man gets it!

290
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,849
And after that,
I go apartment by apartment

291
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:55,651
until I get an answer!

292
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,724
Drop it!

293
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:58,988
Back atcha, Jim.

294
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:01,709
Oh!

295
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,193
Oh! Everybody stand down!

296
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,395
- I'm giving you three seconds.
- I'm giving you two.

297
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,897
BULLOCK: No one is counting!

298
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,598
You drop your weapon!

299
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,734
(woman crying)

300
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:15,638
I'll tell you what I saw!

301
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,642
WOMAN: He took them.

302
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:23,472
He was driving a hearse.
I didn't see the plate.

303
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,414
It's all right.

304
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,083
We don't need the plate.

305
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,605
Just tell me which direction
was he headed.

306
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,277
Down 7th. Heading west.

307
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,025
Hey, thanks, Jim.

308
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,061
You know, I never really did the
whole good-cop/bad-cop thing.

309
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:41,030
It's quite effective.

310
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,532
(chuckling)

311
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:45,668
West on 7th... that's Hoover Island.

312
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:48,170
It's tiny... there's only a
couple of abandoned buildings.

313
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,506
We can canvass the whole area
in ten minutes.

314
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah.

315
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:52,842
HEADHUNTER: And the second shot...

316
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:54,543
well, that's just my signature.

317
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:56,745
I know it doesn't look good,

318
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,848
but no one got hurt too bad.

319
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:00,516
And we got what we needed, right?

320
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,552
You just, you got to trust me
on this one, partner, okay?

321
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,020
People, we're moving out

00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,690

Let's move! Go!

00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,571
This man is alive. Call an ambulance.

333
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,773
(panting)

334
00:15:58,176 --> 00:15:59,209
(weakly): Help me.

335
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,577
- We will. We're here.
- BULLOCK: Jim!

336
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:03,880
Pyg disappeared. There's no sign
of the third cop anywhere.

337
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:05,481
All right. Get some help.

338
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,017
Hold on.

339
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:10,987
(whimpering)

340
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,488
My God.

341
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:14,524
It's okay.

342
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,925
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>

343
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:18,178
<i>we just had a major police operation.</i>

344
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,429
<i>A raid of some sort on this...</i>

345
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:21,297
Sofia, look!

346
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,866
Those are my men.

347
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:26,369
And there's that Headhunter
person I was talking about.

348
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,706
Kind of a moron, but... he is effective.

349
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:30,974
<i>...at the scene.</i>

350
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:32,842
<i>Another is in stable condition
and on his way...</i>

351
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:36,112
(laughs): So, technically,

352
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:37,947
I saved that cop's life.

353
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,118
Such great PR. (laughs)

354
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,156
Excuse me. Little person.

355
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:48,391
Scoot.

356
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:51,227
(news report continues indistinctly)

357
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,766
(exhales)

358
00:16:58,336 --> 00:16:59,569
Is co-opting the police

359
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,438
not the most brilliant idea
I have ever had?

360
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:04,447
It is Pax Penguina

361
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,609
taken to a whole other level.

362
00:17:10,415 --> 00:17:12,148
Hello?

363
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:13,750
Isn't it?

364
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:16,719
Oh. You don't need to know what I think.

365
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,255
Well, now I definitely do.

366
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,125
(exhales)

367
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,281
Ears.

368
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,344
My father never would have

369
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,532
publicly aligned with the GCPD.

370
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:33,036
They are incompetent and unreliable.

371
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:35,772
Eventually, they will fail
and fail big, and...

372
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:38,090
you will fail with them.

373
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,176
So...

374
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:42,111
that's what I think.

375
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,481
Thank you for your input.

376
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,283
You're welcome, Oswald.

(chuckles)

378
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:53,523
Because you have shown me
very clearly what not to do.

379
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:54,691
In fact...

380
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:56,459
I'm gonna get more involved.

381
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,668
Personally.

382
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:02,875
Don't ask for my opinion
if you don't want to hear it.

383
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,135
(whispers): Okay.

still no sign of Pyg or Officer Patel.

Wait, wait. He's coming to.
I'll call you back.

412
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:19,936
Officer Fisoli.

413
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,437
It's okay. It's all right.

414
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,423
You're on your way to Gotham General.

415
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,908
You're safe. I'm Detective Gordon.

416
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:29,220
- I know who you are.
- You were taken by the Pyg.

417
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,681
Did you happen to see his face?

418
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:34,437
Nah, he wore a mask.

419
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:36,319
The others?

420
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,445
Perkov didn't make it.

421
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:41,190
Patel's gone missing.

422
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:43,759
- Do you remember anything?
- I don't know, man.

423
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:46,095
He was torturing us for hours.

424
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:50,355
He was singing nursery rhymes...
talking crazy.

425
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,902
Oh, geez. (panting)

426
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:54,937
I watched him bleed out Perkov.

427
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:58,262
- Did he say anything about Patel?
- I don't know. I don't remember.

428
00:20:58,308 --> 00:20:59,619
Look at me.

429
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:00,610
- Look what he did to me.
- Okay,

430
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:02,211
all right, all right, all right.

431
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,247
Let's take a break.

432
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,739
Why is he doing this?

433
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:14,449
'Cause he's insane.

434
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:17,260
But it's more than that.

435
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:20,396
(sighs) I guess he's just
reached a breaking point.

436
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,834
There's so much rot in Gotham.

437
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,339
All of it, high to low.

438
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,742
Sometimes even I feel
like breaking, you know?

439
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:40,843
I was on Penguin's pad.

440
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,901
Started off small stuff...

441
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,143
deliveries and... payoffs... and then...

442
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:52,028
it got bad.

443
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,629
I get it.

444
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:56,465
I've done bad stuff myself.

445
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:00,836
For Penguin, even.

446
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,508
But you and I can make it right.

447
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,143
Once I get Pyg,

448
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:09,946
I'm gonna take down the Pax Penguina.

449
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:13,874
And then I'm gonna go after
the dirty cops, one by one.

450
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:16,452
Now you have a chance

451
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:18,688
to make right what you've done wrong.

452
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:21,290
Help me.

453
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:27,163
Pyg is planning something.

454
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,832
Nearby. He was...

455
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,834
Maybe where he took Patel.

456
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,732
He-he kept saying something about,

457
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:37,847
"I'll bring justice to where there is,

458
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,746
uh, justice no more."

459
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:43,646
Justice. A courthouse.

460
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:46,048
There ain't no courthouse
in the Narrows.

461
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:47,994
There's one they abandoned
a few years back.

462
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:49,485
Pull it over!

463
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,902
- I'm getting out.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:54,667
- Thank you, Officer Fisoli.
- Hey.

465
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:58,501
You are one of the good ones, Jim.

466
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:09,256

468
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:15,278
Hey, Brant.

469
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:18,752
I ran into an old friend. Bruce Wayne.

470
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:22,018
Bruce, this is Emma Hsueh
and Tommy Elliott.

471
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:28,375
You two know each other?

472
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:31,127
Oh, yeah. Last time I saw this
guy, he punched me in the face.

473
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,732
I should go.

474
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:38,534
TOMMY: Hey, hold on, bro.

475
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,245
I totally deserved it.

476
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:41,989
If anything,
you should've hit me harder.

477
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:45,567
So true. He was such a jerk back then.

478
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,987
Okay.

479
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:49,289
Little heads-up, next time

480
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:51,650
you just bring some
random kid to my place...

481
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:54,784
- Parents' place, Brant.
- He's so jealous.

482
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,919
Brant wanted Grace all to himself.

483
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:58,254
(Brant scoffs)

484
00:23:58,289 --> 00:23:59,255
Whatever.

485
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,389
Uh, you want a shot?

486
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,591
Maybe sample some party favors?

487
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:03,926
I'm good.

488
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:07,263
Oh, I forgot about
this guy. Total animal.

489
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:09,103
So what do you do for fun?

490
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,603
I used to walk on rooftops
and fight crime.

491
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:15,002
Now I'm not so sure.

492
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:18,274
Whoa! You're a bigger dork
than I remember.

493
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,477
Just kidding. Hey, whatever
happened to that, uh, that,

494
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:23,346
that creepy old guy, the butler?

495
00:24:23,381 --> 00:24:25,448
Is he still, uh, buttling?

496
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,453
Kidding.

497
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:33,222
It's a joke. (chuckles)

498
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:35,209
Seriously, does he buttle with you?

499
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:37,141

- Stop!
- (grunting)

502
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,190
So, does he buttle with you?

503
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:52,480
Brant, didn't you say
you had a hookup at that club?

504
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:54,677
Yeah. Yeah, this is lame.

505
00:24:54,712 --> 00:24:56,379
Let's go.

506

Didn't have to.

- Let her claw her way out.
- We owe her.

That is what her salary was for.

539
00:26:58,628 --> 00:26:59,927
Look, she only went there

540
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:01,828
to prove that we can make this work,

541
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:03,563
us running heists together.

542
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh. Then she might have
considered not getting caught.

543
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:08,802
She just wants a purpose.

544
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,270
She wants a home.

545
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:11,705
Mm. Then sucks for her.

Then sucks for you.

550
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:32,625
It was my idea to offer
my consulting services.

551
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:36,730
And I daresay it has been
a smashing success,

552
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:40,090
the Pax Penguina taken
to the tactical level.

553
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:43,269
And now we have reason to believe
that the notorious Pyg is trapped

554
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:45,286
in the courthouse behind us.

555
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:48,145
Look, I know it's a bit of a circus.

556
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,043
But there was no way in hell
I was gonna let you go

557
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:52,312
in there alone, all right? The
Pyg ain't gonna go down easy.

558
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:55,048
So I say we let Penguin's thugs
go in first... let them be

559
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,250
the cannon fodder instead of our guys.

560
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,418
It's win-win.

00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:00,333

interpretation, Jim. The Pyg
is not trying to save you.

He's trying to save himself

We called Gotham General.

643

They can't locate Fisoli

Jim, it's Gotham General.
It's a madhouse down there.

If I'm correct, the Pyg
isn't even in the courthouse.

646
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:54,654
I came directly from the ambulance.

647
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:57,297
There is no way he beat me here.

648
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,126
You're wrong! Pyg is in there, Jim!

649

He's right!

650
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,629
We got a spotter across the street

651
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:05,231
that got a visual on Pyg in there,

652
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,500
standing next to Patel tied to a chair.

653
00:32:07,535 --> 00:32:09,235
- I swear.
- Look,

654
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:11,704
I can't explain it.
All I know is, this is a trap.

655
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,239
Now, you asked me to trust you.

656
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:16,063
I am asking you to trust me.

657
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:20,364
Ugh! It's so tiresome!

658
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,749
- Start the operation!
- Let's go.

- (Oswald scoffs)
- Jim, I'm sorry.

660
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:27,453
I'm with Penguin on this one.
We got to think about Patel.

661
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:30,323
Let's move out, people!

662
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:33,926
You better pray I can clean up
your mess on this one, Harvey.

663
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:35,828
- You are out of line, pal!
- And you are

664
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:37,178
gonna get our guys slaughtered!

665
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:40,066
Jim Gordon, I am ordering you
to stand down!

666
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:44,431
Finally, a good idea, Harvey! Boys?

You know what to do. Let's go.

You're coming back to the nest.

We got a shipment coming in

I did not order the cops in there.

732
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:57,085
I do not have that authority.

733
00:37:57,132 --> 00:37:59,982
I made a suggestion.
It was Captain Bullock...

734
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,464
- WOMAN: Gordon. Gordon!
- (all clamoring)

735
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:03,842
How did you find the courage to run in

736
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:05,744
and save all of those people?

737
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:10,639
If the Pyg is watching...

738
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:13,418
the GCPD is gonna take you down.

739
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,725
And that was Detective James
Gordon with a very modest,

740
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,994
if I may say, statement about

741
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:24,696
- his genuinely heroic...
- Thanks, Jim.

742
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:26,998
- Way to go, Jim.
- Thanks.

743
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:34,305
They think Patel's gonna make it.

744
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:38,209
Congratulations, Jim.

745
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:40,411
You're a hero.

746
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,552
And I'm just the cop

747
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:46,044
who shot a cop.

748
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:51,289
(phone ringing)

749
00:38:57,063 --> 00:38:58,463
This is Gordon.

Oh, I was right about you.

753
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:08,406
You are a "get things done"
type, Jim Gordon.

754
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:11,517
Oh, and those things
that you want to get done...

755
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:15,480
well... they're the same things I want.

756
00:39:15,515 --> 00:39:17,615
Only if you want to go to prison
for the rest of your life.

757
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:19,484
Well, now that's just mean.

758
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,493
I'm gonna find you.

759
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:24,826
Oh, I hope you do.

760

765
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:42,540
well, gave me an idea.

766
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,471
The next step in my plot.

767
00:39:45,545 --> 00:39:48,442
It's a saga.

768
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:51,888
It's an epic. Ah.

769
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:53,918
<i>It's a spectacle.</i>
