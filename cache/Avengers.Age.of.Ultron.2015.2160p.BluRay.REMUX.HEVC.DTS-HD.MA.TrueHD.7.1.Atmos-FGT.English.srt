00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,412
there would have been
double the casualties.

167
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,040
My best friend
would've been a treasured memory.

168
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,709
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

169
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,628
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

170
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,714
How long before you trust me?

171
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,426
It's not you I don't trust.

172
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,055
Thor, report on the Hulk.

173
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,100
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

174
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,977
(GROANS SOFTLY)

175
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,105
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

176
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,440
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

177
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,569
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

178
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,906
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

179
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,533
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

180
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,576
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

181
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,953
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

182
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,413
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

183
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,415
- JARVIS: <i>Very good, sir.</i>
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

184
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,874
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,876
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

186
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,421
STARK: Feels good, yeah?

187
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,631
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

188
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,800
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

189
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,302
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

190
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,930
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

191
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,265
I don't just mean weapons.

192
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,101
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

193
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,520
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

194
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,688
Is that cool with you?

195
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,815
Just a few days till the farewell party.

196
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,067
You're staying, right?

197
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,903
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.

198
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,781
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

199
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,826
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

200
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,578
So, yes, revels.

201
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,232
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

202
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,696
Lab's all set up, boss.

203
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,947
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

204
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,492
I just pay for everything
and design everything

205
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,160
and make everyone look cooler.

206
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,661
What's the word on Strucker?

207
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,830
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

208
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,541
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

209
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,503
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

210
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,172
Sokovia's had a rough history.

211
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,717
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

212
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,010
Their abilities?

213
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,178
He's got increased metabolism

214
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,971
and improved thermal homeostasis.

215
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,182
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

216
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,392
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

217
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,645
He's fast and she's weird.

218
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,564
- Well, they're gonna show up again.
- (BEEPING)

219
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,608
Agreed. File says they volunteered

220
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,527
for Strucker's experiments.

221
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,529
- It's nuts.
- Right.

222
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,824
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

223
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,200
to protect their country?

224
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,077
We're not at war, Captain.

225
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,912
They are.

226
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,844
(WHIRRING)

227
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,360
How's he doing?

228
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,736
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

229
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,196
That's terrible.

230
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,906
He's fine. He's thirsty.

231
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,909
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.

232
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,036
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

233
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,080
so let's make the most of it.

234
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,750
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

235
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,920
JARVIS: <i>The scepter is alien.</i>

236
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,089
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

237
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,591
So there's elements you can?

238
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,759
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

239
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,303
<i>for something inside,</i>

240
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,762
<i>something powerful.</i>

241
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,972
Like a reactor?

242
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,307
<i>Like a computer.</i>

243
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,601
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

244
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,479
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

245
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,108
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

246
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,777
DR. CHO: There's
no possibility of deterioration.

247
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,031
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

248
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,116
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

249
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,160
She's creating tissue.

250
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,661
If you brought him to my lab,

251
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,414
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

252
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,458
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

253
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,002
BARTON: No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

254
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,670
(LAUGHS) I'm gonna be made of plastic.

255
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,130
STARK: Here's your beverage.

256
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,965
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

257
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,675
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

258
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,927
I don't have a girlfriend.

259
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,303
That I can't fix.

260
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,139
This is the next thing, Tony.

261
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,308
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

262
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,185
That is exactly the plan.

263
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,980
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

264
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,566
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

265
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,819
Will Thor be there?

266
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,324
- BANNER: What's the rumpus?
- Well, the scepter.

267
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,120
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

268
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:03,166
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

269
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,669
You may recognize...

270
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,505
- Jarvis.
- JARVIS: <i>Doctor.</i>

271
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,592
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

272
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,760
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

273
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,512
He runs more of the business

274
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,014
- than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh.

275
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,224
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

276
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,642
JARVIS: <i>I suspect not for long.</i>

277
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:22,936
Meet the competition.

278
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,193
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

279
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,321
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

280
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,865
I mean, this could be...

281
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,410
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

282
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,537
I mean, look at this.

283
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,872
They're like neurons firing.

284
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,543
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

285
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,255
They deep-sixed the data,

286
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,466
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

287
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,761
Artificial intelligence.

288
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,642
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

289
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,145
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)

290
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,604
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

291
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,981
Yesterday it was.

292
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,151
If we can harness this power,

293
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,320
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

294
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,072
That's a man-sized "if."

295
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,575
Our job is "if."

296
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,286
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

297
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,913
turning brown instead of green?

298
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,374
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

299
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,126
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

300
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,045
As a worst-case measure, right?

301
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,755
How about a best case?

302
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,798
What if the world was safe?

303
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,718
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

304
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,762
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

305
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,307
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

306
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,059
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

307
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,604
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

308
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,606
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.

309
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,274
That's three days. Give me three days.

310
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,984
So you're going for artificial intelligence,

311
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,444
and you don't want to tell the team?

312
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,988
Right. That's right. You know why?

313
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,740
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

314
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,494
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

315
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,704
I see a suit of armor around the world.

316
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,748
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

317
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,584
I've seen colder.

318
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,297
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

319
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,924
it needs Ultron.

320
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,222
Peace in our time.

321
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,266
Imagine that.

322
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,766

He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

He said he wanted us dead.

He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

574
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,928
He also said he killed somebody.

There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

Yes, there was.

This is insane.

579
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,489
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

580
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,491
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

581
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:57,620
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

582
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,456
This isn't strategy. This is

No.

It's probably not, right?

(LAUGHS) Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.

This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

605

with something you don't understand.

606
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,178
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,472
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

We didn't. We weren't even close.

614
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,443
Were we close to an interface?

615
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:15,155
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

616
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,991
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

RHODES: Never heard that.
STARK: Recall that?

620
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,751
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

621
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,546
We're standing 300 feet below it.

We're the Avengers.

623

We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

624
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,304
but that up there, that's...

625
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,973
That's the endgame.

626
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,434
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

627
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,769
Together.

628
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,482
We'll lose.

629
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,485
Then we'll do that together, too.

630
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,699
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

631
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,410
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

632
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,371
The world's a big place.

ULTRON: Did you know this church is
in the exact center of the city?

637
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,280
The elders decreed it so that everyone

638
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,866
could be equally close to God.

639
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,576
I like that.

why you can't look inside my head.

642

Sometimes it's hard.

643
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,380
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

644
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,424
Oh, I'm sure they do.

645
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,969
But you needed
something more than a man.

646
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,306
That's why you let
Stark take the scepter.

647
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,724
I didn't expect,

648
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,145
but I saw Stark's fear.

649
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,022
I knew it would control him.

650
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,982
Make him self-destruct.

651

Everyone creates the thing they dread.

652

Men of peace create engines of war.

653

655
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,830
smaller people? Uh...

656
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:31,041
"Children." (CHUCKLES)
I lost the word, there.

657
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,501
Children

658
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,920
designed to supplant them,

659
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,840
to help them end.

660
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,634
Is that why you've come,

661
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:41,885
to end the Avengers?

662
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,304
I've come to save the world.

663
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,641
But also... Yeah.

664
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,522
We'll move out right away.

665
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,149
This is a start, but there's something

666
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,817
we need to begin the real work.

667
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,902
- All of these are...
- ULTRON: Me.

668
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,990
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

669
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,367
They're discordant. Disconnected.

670
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,327
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

671
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,872
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

672
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:12,166
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

673
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,750
And make them martyrs?

674
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,961
You need patience.

675
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,796

676
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,216
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

677
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,011
I take it out and look at it,

678
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:25,971
every day.

679
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,932
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

680
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,184

682

We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

683
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,404
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

684
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,573
it makes a hole in the floor.

685
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,241
It's big.

686
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,453
Our parents go in

687
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:52,623
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

688
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,875
I grab her,

689
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,669
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

690
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,963
But it doesn't go off.

691
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,634
It just

692
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,094
sits there in the rubble.

693
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,348
Three feet from our faces.

694
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,434
And on the side of the shell

695
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,936
is painted one word.

696
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,771
"Stark."

697

700
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,156
I think, "This will set it off."

701
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,869
We wait for two days

702
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,288

survived Strucker's experiments.

I think you're being hard on yourself.

1134
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,085
Here I was hoping that was your job.

1135
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,590
What are you doing?

1136
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:53,051
I'm running with it.

1137
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,971
With you.

1138
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:59,057
If running is the plan,

1139
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:01,935
as far as you want.

1140
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:05,564
Are you out of your mind?

1141
01:07:10,903 --> 01:07:12,321
I want you to understand that, um...

1142
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:13,822
Natasha,

1143
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,408
where can I go?

1144
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,786
Where in the world am I not a threat?

1145
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:22,247
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

1146
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:24,958
Even if I didn't just...

1147
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:27,961
There's no future with me.

1148
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,631
I can't ever...

1149
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:33,133
I can't have this.

1150
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:34,968
Kids.

1151
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:38,013
Do the math. I physically can't.

1152
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:41,183
Neither can I.

1153
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:49,399
In the Red Room where I was trained...

1154
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,361
Where I was raised, um,

1155
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,948
they have a graduation ceremony.

1156
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:59,409
They sterilize you.

1157
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,039
It's efficient.

1158
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:08,335
One less thing to worry about.

1159
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,799
The one thing
that might matter more than a mission.

1160
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,053
Makes everything easier.

1161
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,681
Even killing.

1162
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,855
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

1163
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,114
So, we disappear?

1164
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,414
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

1165
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:49,001
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

1166
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:52,170
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

1167
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:54,298
Yeah, give him time.

1168
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:56,341
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1169
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,178
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1170
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:01,930
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1171
01:09:02,264 --> 01:09:03,515
Seems like you walked away all right.

1172
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,185
Is that a problem?

1173
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,479
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1174
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:11,732
Call me old-fashioned.

1175
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:14,401
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1176
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:16,903
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1177
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:19,406
Well, I guess you'd know.

1178
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:20,782
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1179
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,075
Banner and I were doing research.

1180
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,328
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1181
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:25,746
Isn't that the mission?

1182
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:27,205
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1183
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:29,541
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1184
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:35,172
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1185
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:36,840
innocent people die.

1186
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:37,966
Every time.

1187
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:42,846
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

1188
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:44,806
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1189
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,434
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1190
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:49,936
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1191
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:55,108
Don't take from my pile.

1192
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:57,277
(DOOR OPENS)

1193
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:06,536
Hello, Deere.

1194
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,791
Tell me everything.

1195
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,418
What ails you?

1196
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:14,628
FURY: Do me a favor.

1197
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:18,799
Try not to bring it to life.

1198
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,467
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1199
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,345
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1200
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,763
Was she ever not working for you?

1201
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,348
Artificial intelligence.

1202
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,059
You never even hesitated.

1203
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:30,644
Look, it's been a really long day,

1204
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:32,396
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1205
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:34,481
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1206
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,941
Look me in the eye and tell me

1207
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,317
you're going to shut him down.

1208
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,027
You're not the director of me.

1209
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,987
I'm not the director of anybody.

1210
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,906
I'm just an old man

1211
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,158
who cares very much about you.

1212
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:49,830
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1213
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:52,791
I saw it.

1214
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,543
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1215
01:10:55,836 --> 01:10:57,671
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1216
01:10:58,046 --> 01:10:59,548
The whole world, too.

1217
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,007
Because of me.

1218
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:03,677
I wasn't ready.

1219
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,555
I didn't do all I could.

1220
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,683
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1221
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:13,812
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1222
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,189
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1223
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:18,692
The end of the path I started us on.

1224
01:11:19,568 --> 01:11:21,653
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1225
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:25,365
War isn't one of them.

1226
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,412
I watched my friends die.

1227
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:32,664
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1228
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:33,874
(SCOFFS)

1229
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:35,542
Nope.

1230
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:39,087
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

1231
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,381
is that you didn't.

1232
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:49,181
SELVIG: I'll see you tonight.

1233
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,226
I like the look.

1234
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,938
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1235
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:58,315
I need your help.

1236
01:11:58,565 --> 01:11:59,566
It's nice to be needed.

1237
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,318
It's dangerous.

1238
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,695
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1239
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:09,910
FURY: Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1240
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:13,246
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1241
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,957
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1242
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,542
I don't think it's just one thing.

1243
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,002
What about Ultron himself?

1244
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,463
FURY: Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1245
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:24,299
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1246
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:27,761
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1247
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,095
Is he still going after launch codes?

1248
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:30,722
FURY: Yes, he is.

1249
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,307
But he's not making any headway.

1250
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,518
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1251
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:37,229
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1252
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:38,313
Nexus?

1253
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,065
BANNER: It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1254
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:42,275
Every byte of data flows through there.

1255
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:43,568
Fastest access on Earth.

1256
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:44,778
So, what did they say?

1257
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,780
FURY: He's fixated on the missiles.

1258
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,615
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1259
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:50,158
By whom?

1260
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,619
Parties unknown.

1261
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:53,912
Do we have an ally?

1262
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,373
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1263
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,542
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1264
01:12:58,667 --> 01:12:59,834
I might need to visit Oslo.

1265
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:01,461
Find our unknown.

1266
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:03,088
Well, this is good times, boss,

1267
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,464
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1268
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:05,590
you'd have more than that.

1269
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,884
I do. I have you.

1270
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,512
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1271
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:11,972
Ears, everywhere else.

1272
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,308
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1273
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,311
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1274
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:20,313
with nothing but our wit

1275
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,023
and our will to save the world.

1276
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,819
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1277
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:27,445
between him and his mission.

1278
01:13:27,571 --> 01:13:29,739
And whether or not he admits it,

1279
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,617
his mission is global destruction.

1280
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:35,996
All this, laid in a grave.

1281
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,708
So stand.

1282
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,252
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1283
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,129
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1284
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:45,630
You know what, Romanoff?

1285
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,174
So, what does he want?

1286
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,595
To become better.

1287
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,096
Better than us.

1288
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,849
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1289
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:58,059
The human form is inefficient.

1290
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,353
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1291
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,439
But he keeps coming back to it.

1292
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:04,566
When you two programmed him

You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

2097
02:08:08,557 --> 02:08:11,101
Did you know then
what was gonna happen?

2098
02:08:13,311 --> 02:08:15,230
You never know.

2099
02:08:15,438 --> 02:08:18,942
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

2100
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:20,902
I got a great team.

2101
02:08:22,028 --> 02:08:23,989
Nothing lasts forever.

2102
02:08:24,281 --> 02:08:26,324
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

2103
02:08:26,575 --> 02:08:29,911
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

2104
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:35,000
ROGERS: <i>The rules have changed.</i>

2105
02:08:35,208 --> 02:08:36,793
STARK: We're dealing
with something new.

2106
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,253
Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence.

2107
02:08:38,378 --> 02:08:40,297
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

2108
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:42,299
No, it's not like
a person lifting the hammer.

2109
02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:44,217
Right, different rules for us.

2110
02:08:44,426 --> 02:08:45,468
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- ROGERS: Thank you.

2111
02:08:45,677 --> 02:08:48,555
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

2112
02:08:49,472 --> 02:08:51,558
It's safe with the Vision.

2113
02:08:51,808 --> 02:08:54,311
And these days, safe is in short supply.

2114
02:08:56,354 --> 02:08:58,315
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

2115
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,233
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

2116
02:09:00,358 --> 02:09:02,152
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

2117
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:03,820
Not if you don't leave.

2118
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:05,780
I have no choice.

2119
02:09:06,031 --> 02:09:08,199
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

2120
02:09:08,325 --> 02:09:09,701
to show up in the last few years.

2121
02:09:09,826 --> 02:09:11,411
It's not a coincidence.

2122
02:09:12,245 --> 02:09:13,997
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

2123
02:09:14,164 --> 02:09:15,790
and has made pawns of us.

2124
02:09:15,916 --> 02:09:17,792
And once all these pieces
are in position...

2125
02:09:17,918 --> 02:09:19,336
Triple Yahtzee.

2126
02:09:19,544 --> 02:09:21,004
You think you can find out
what's coming?

2127
02:09:21,129 --> 02:09:22,213
I do.

2128
02:09:23,048 --> 02:09:24,507
Besides this one,

2129
02:09:24,633 --> 02:09:27,010
there's nothing that can't be explained.

2130
02:09:34,309 --> 02:09:36,853
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

2131
02:09:39,981 --> 02:09:42,609
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

2132
02:09:42,734 --> 02:09:44,277
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

2133
02:09:44,444 --> 02:09:45,987
- (CAR LOCK BEEPS)
- (ENGINE STARTS)

2134
02:09:46,488 --> 02:09:48,114
I will miss you, Tony.

2135
02:09:48,365 --> 02:09:49,366
Yeah?

2136
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:51,952
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

2137
02:09:52,202 --> 02:09:54,371
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

2138
02:09:54,537 --> 02:09:57,457
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

2139
02:09:58,249 --> 02:09:59,417
The simple life.

2140
02:09:59,668 --> 02:10:01,962
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

2141
02:10:02,212 --> 02:10:04,589
Family, stability...

2142
02:10:05,757 --> 02:10:08,885
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

2143
02:10:10,387 --> 02:10:12,222
I think someone else came out.

2144
02:10:16,184 --> 02:10:17,268
You all right?

2145
02:10:17,477 --> 02:10:19,854
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

2146
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:21,398
I'm home.

2147
02:10:29,322 --> 02:10:32,075
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

2148
02:10:32,242 --> 02:10:33,576
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

2149
02:10:33,743 --> 02:10:36,746
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

2150
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:37,872
How do we look?

2151
02:10:38,123 --> 02:10:40,417
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

2152
02:10:40,542 --> 02:10:42,252
We got some hitters.

2153
02:10:42,419 --> 02:10:44,796
They're good. They're not a team.

2154
02:10:44,963 --> 02:10:46,589
Let's beat them into shape.

2155
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:06,609
Avengers...

2156
02:13:25,456 --> 02:13:26,875
THANOS: Fine.

2157
02:13:28,334 --> 02:13:30,170
I'll do it myself.
