1
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:03,500
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:06,570
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:09,656
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:12,526
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,196
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,248
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,752
but, in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:25,005
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:27,708
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,459
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,545
- He's your brother, Cisco.
- Not by choice.

12
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,797
So Mom tells me you're
still working at S.T.A.R. Labs.

13
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,716
We couldn't do what we do without Cisco.

14
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:37,267
Oh, he's loyal. Just like a dog.

15
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:39,102
We had a deal.

16
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:41,438
My speed for Wally's life.
Hand him over, and it's yours.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,390
The Speed Force is leaving his body.

18
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:44,858
He's becoming human again.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,226
Aah!

20
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,896
I know some piece of you did care for me.

21
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:52,232
Please, let him go.

22
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:53,984
- Caitlin!
- You are gonna get

23
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,403
your speed back, Allen,
and I'm gonna help you do that.

24
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,955
- How?
- By creating another

25
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,207
particle accelerator explosion.

26
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:14,228
Barry, there's a high-speed chase

27
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,481
heading south on Milton Ave.

28
00:01:20,353 --> 00:01:21,569
We lost 'em.

29
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:24,605
Not gonna lose him, though.

30
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:25,606
You wanna bet?

31
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:33,164
Oh! Oh! You wanna play?

32
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,449
Okay! All right.

33
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:37,285
Get ready to bring it!

34
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:40,371
- They're not slowing down.
- Of course not!

35
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:46,260
There's our out... the tunnel!
Take the tunnel!

36
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,963
They're headed for the Fifth Street tunnel.

37
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:50,465
Satellite can't project in there.

38
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:52,300
What? You just thought of this now?

39
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,218
I didn't think he'd actually
try to outrun The Flash!

40
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,554
Lightning. Lightning toss!

41
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,189
He wants to do the lightning toss.

42
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,607
Nope. No lightning. It's a hologram.

43
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,642
- Remember?
- Just...

44
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,644
No. No, no. The wind-up!

45
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:05,446
So we can block their field of vision.

46
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,647
Yes! Of course.

47
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,319
All right, Cisco.

48
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,204
This is where all
those countless hours gaming

49
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,623
in your basement are about to pay off.

50
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,326
Fingers, don't fail me now.

51
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,294
Leerooooy...!

52
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:25,049
- Ah, my eyes!
- What is this?

53
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:33,925
Hands in the air!

54
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:40,336
Synced and corrected oykubuyuk
www.addic7ed.com

55
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,768
I need a breather.

56
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,019
I didn't think this hologram thing

57
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,605
was gonna work, but so far, so good.

58
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,907
I mean, I figured if they could get 2Pac

59
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,742
rapping again at a concert,
we could definitely get

60
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:53,194
The Flash running around Central City.

61
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:55,079
- It's not gonna last.
- There it is.

62
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,281
It's not gonna be long
before someone figures out,

63
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,200
"Oh, wait. You never say anything.

64
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,452
You never touch anything.
Oh, wait. You never go indoors"

65
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:03,204
Okay, well, without Barry's speed,

66
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:06,541
- this is as good an idea as any.
- Actually, I beg to differ.

67
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,593
I think a better idea, instead of playing

68
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,044
"Hoodlums and Holograms"

69
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:12,380
would be to rebuild the particle accelerator

70
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,432
- to get Barry's speed back.
- Yeah, Wells,

71
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,384
- that's what you keep saying.
- That's right.

72
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,886
Look at what that explosion
did to this city.

73
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,888
Not to mention, last time
we tried something like that,

74
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,191
we blew a hole in the universe
and created, like,

75
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:24,559
50 portals to your Earth.

76
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:26,277
Which is exactly how Zoom and his henchmen

77
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:29,197
- got here in the first place.
- I told you.

78
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,948
I know how to contain the explosion.

79
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,284
- Really?
- Yes.

80
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:35,570
You know how to contain
a dark matter explosion

81
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,823
that, last time, just radiated
all of Central City?

82
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:41,209
You tried this on your Earth, remember?

83
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,743
Didn't go so well.

84
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:44,328
And, even if you could contain it,

85
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,580
I thought you said that Barry couldn't tap

86
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,248
into the Speed Force anymore.

87
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,833
It wasn't connected the first
time he got his powers.

88
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:51,252
Look, I have your Wells's data.

89
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,421
The Harrison Wells from this
Earth, I have his science.

90
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:55,923
I know what chemicals
need to be in your body.

91
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,226
I know how the lightning needs
to bond with the dark matter

92
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,977
from the particle accelerator explosion.

93
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:03,564
I can recreate the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

94
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,932
This will work.

95
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:08,653
Your subterfuge... is not gonna last.

96
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:12,607
But more importantly...
it's not gonna save Snow.

97
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:18,112
It's not gonna bring your Caitlin back.

98
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:20,197
You wanna be ready should Zoom return...

99
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,585
if Zoom returns... when Zoom returns...

100
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:26,454
there is only one way to do it,

101
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:29,040
and that's by getting your speed back.

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,477
Hey.

103
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,145
- Hey.
- How are you?

104
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,531
- You made it.
- Yeah.

105
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,483
- Look at this.
- Come inside. Get warm.

106
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,785
Yeah. Wow.

107
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:03,791
- Sure is a pretty drive up here.
- It is that.

108
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:11,666
I can't help but wonder why
a speedster needs a car.

109
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:16,304
Because I am no longer a speedster.

110
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,172
You've lost your powers?

111
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:22,343
I gave them up to save Wally, Joe's son.

112
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:26,647
Zoom had him, so it was either
give him my speed, or...

113
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:31,185
I couldn't let Wally die.

114
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:35,439
No. You couldn't.

115
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:39,327
Now Jay has taken Caitlin, and
we have no idea how to save her.

116
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,995
Jay took Caitlin?

117
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:43,247
Jay. It's... yeah.

118
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:48,869
Turns out Jay Garrick is not
the Flash from Earth-2.

119
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:50,204
He's Zoom.

120
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:52,256
Garrick?

121
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,842
Garrick, yeah. Why?

122
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,210
My mom's maiden name.

123
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,432
Maybe... maybe Wells is right.

124
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,385
Maybe I should try to get my powers back.

125
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:06,220
How would you do that?

126
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,889
By recreating the
particle accelerator explosion.

127
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,941
And getting struck by lightning again?

128
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,863
That doesn't seem like
the safest option, does it?

129
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,733
No.

130
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:24,238
I've watched you grow
ever since you became The Flash,

131
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,043
and I am so proud of that man.

132
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,630
But ask yourself,

133
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,299
do you really need powers

134
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,752
in order to be that person?

135
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:43,474
It just feels like every time something good

136
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,927
happens in my life, it's taken away.

137
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:52,767
Well, maybe it's time
we did something about that.

138
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:00,408
It looks like the Vacuum.

139
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,576
Uh, what's the Vacuum?

140
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,579
- No "Fringe" on Earth-2. Noted.

141
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,248
What is that thing?

142
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,451
That is how Barry's gonna
get his speed back.

143
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,037
This is what you've been
working on in the workshop?

144
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,955
Someone has to worry about Zoom.

145
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:18,459
- Okay. Barry cannot do this.
- He has to, Ramon.

146
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,960
You keep calling me that, but that's...

147
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:27,718
Dante?

148
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:33,107
What did you see? Zoom? Did you see Zoom?

149
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:35,192
No.

150
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:38,896
I saw my brother.

151
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:42,233
I got to go.

152
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,901
See where everybody is.

153
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:45,402
Hey.

154
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,570
Henry?

155
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,539
Iris. Hi.

156
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,241
It's so good to see you.

157
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,460
Aw, you too.

158
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,229
I guess Barry
dragged you back for a bit, huh?

159
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:58,215
Looks like maybe for good.

160
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:00,050
Wait, what? Seriously?

161
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:04,338
Yeah, yeah, I figured I spent
enough time away from my son.

162
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,006
Have you told Dad?

163
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,726
No, I wanted to tell him in person.

164
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,427
Yeah. I think he's with Wally at CCPD.

165
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,730
I'll give him a call.

166
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:15,349
- Good to see you.
- Yeah. Let's get settled.

167
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:27,244
Your sister called,
checking in when we'd be home.

168
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,413
- As in, we need to get going?
- Thanks.

169
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:30,531
You know your sister.

170
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,750
Okay, move it. Let's go.

171
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,120
Do you ever get sick of this job?

172
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:37,454
Being a cop?

173
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:41,425
Oh, looks like someone inherited the West

174
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,928
I-need-to-help-people gene.

175
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,381
Ever since The Flash saved me, I just...

176
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:49,049
I don't know if designing cars

177
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:52,303
is what I'm meant to do with my life.

178
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:55,689
Well, I'm sure there's something out there

179
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,474
that'll satisfy your need for speed

180
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:00,027
and helping people, but, until then,

181
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,730
you should stick with engineering.

182
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:04,398
It's much safer.

183
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,233
We should get going before Singh comes up

184
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:08,152
with something for me to do.

185
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,572
Zoom!

186
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:13,874
Hello, old friend.

187
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,242
Stay away from him.

188
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,044
Do not move.

189
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,462
Or what?

190
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:22,132
You've tried your guns on me once before.

191
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:26,253
No! Don't hurt them.

192
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,590
Let them go, please.

193
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:41,151
Tell everyone that this city is mine.

194
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:44,688
Anyone who disobeys me

195
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,942
will meet their end.

196
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:54,114
All right. Clear out!

197
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:15,082
- Caitlin's with Zoom.
- Why would he bring her here?

198
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,450
To show power.

199
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:19,069
That's exactly what he did on my Earth.

200
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,571
- What are you talking about?
- The first thing he did

201
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:22,789
was murder people.

202
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,408
Slaughtered a bunch of policemen.

203
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:27,163
Then recruited every
meta-human he could find.

204
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,833
And those that disobeyed, he killed too.

205
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,719
- Where are the police now?
- Outside the precinct.

206
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:35,505
He'll kill them, Joe. He'll kill them all.

207
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,257
Not with Caitlin with him.

208
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,559
She talked him out of killing
everyone when he took over CCPD.

209
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:40,593
That's what we're gonna rely on?

210
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:42,011
Snow talking him out of it?

211
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,897
Joe, you need to get
those guys out of there.

212
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,899
What if they set up at Jitters?

213
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:48,518
That's a good idea... it's just
a block away from the precinct.

214
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,236
And then what? What happens next?

215
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,105
You saw what Zoom did on my Earth.

216
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:54,107
He will do the exact same thing here.

217
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:56,075
Barry, we need to get you your powers back.

218
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:59,329
- There must be another way.
- There's not.

219
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:02,332
There's not.

220
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,900
I'm gonna get word to Singh.

221
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:06,369
Get him to set up a task force at Jitters.

222
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,037
- And then what?
- I don't know yet,

223
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,540
but I'm gonna make sure
Wally and Jesse are safe.

224
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,387
You know they're gonna figure
out a way to stop you, right?

225
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,474
Who? Barry? Wells? The police?

226
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:30,693
No. Nobody can stop me now.

227
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,228
Not anymore.

228
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,697
So...what's your plan?

229
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:38,568
You're just gonna kill everyone?

230
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,905
Not everyone.

231
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:43,907
Then why are you keeping me here?

232
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,080
'Cause I don't want to be alone anymore.

233
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,751
I am never going to be with you.

234
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:57,921
You think that you're not like me,

235
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:01,140
but I've seen the darkness
inside of you, Caitlin.

236
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:04,811
Just like it was inside Killer Frost.

237
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:09,065
All you have to do... is unlock it.

238
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:38,211
Hey.

239
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:40,096
There she is.

240
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,266
Still refuse to dress
like a grown-up, I see.

241
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:44,517
One grape soda.

242
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,219
Ah, no. I'm good.

243
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,271
Thanks.

244
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:51,474
So... what's wrong?

245
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:52,976
What? Something has to be wrong

246
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,644
for me to want to catch up with my brother?

247
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:55,778
Yeah, that's usually the way it works

248
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,196
with you, isn't it?

249
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,149
Actually, I had this...

250
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:02,785
feeling that I should come see you

251
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,654
and make sure you're okay, so...

252
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,539
Don't tell me I'm gonna be kidnapped

253
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,157
by Snart and his pyromaniac friend again.

254
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,660
Us. You. Me. Us. They kidnapped both of us.

255
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,045
Yeah, well, you're not the one

256
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,213
who almost had his hands frozen off.

257
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:16,749
Lucky I can still play the piano.

258
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,501
Well, my octaves haven't quite
been the same,

259
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:19,836
but not that that matters to you.

260
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:22,171
Dante, I called you, more than once,

261
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:24,140
but, of course, you didn't answer.

262
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:26,175
Like I said. Only when something's wrong.

263
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,595
Yeah. Okay.

264
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,515
I don't know why I thought

265
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:34,851
that whole experience... that was it.

266
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,104
That was gonna bring us closer.

267
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:41,190
Cisco, we haven't been close
since we were kids.

268
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:44,410
I don't think anything's
ever gonna change that.

269
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:51,501
All right. We'll bring down

270
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:52,585
some more supplies later.

271
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:54,370
How you can reach us.

272
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,789
And exactly how long
are we supposed to be in here?

273
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,875
Until someone lets you out.

274
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:02,762
This isn't ideal... none of it...
but Zoom's here,

275
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:04,931
and until he's taken care of,
this is what we're doing.

276
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,766
This is the safest place
for the two of you right now.

277
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,217
What are you gonna do?

278
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:10,219
- Whatever we can.
- Joe, let me do something.

279
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:12,188
Wally, there isn't anything
you can do right now.

280
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,523
Sit tight.

281
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,608
Okay, well, what about the...

282
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,646
bathroom?

283
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:21,864
This room have Wi-Fi at least?

284
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,571
Wally and Jesse are all good.

285
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,790
Thank you.

286
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:36,796
So this is what it takes
to get Barry his speed back.

287
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:38,998
Yeah, yeah.

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,918
It's not uncomplicated, but almost there.

289
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,303
I told you before,
once Barry makes up his mind,

290
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,389
it's impossible to change it.

291
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,725
Well, then we need to convince
him that this is the only way,

292
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,927
before he decides not to do it, right?

293
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,395
Shouldn't have to convince anyone

294
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:54,597
to do anything against his will.

295
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,234
Joe, we're talking about Barry, right?

296
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,353
I mean, I can't... I can't imagine

297
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:03,106
you don't feel the same way.

298
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,657
I mean, right now, I don't know what

299
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,192
the right thing to do is.

300
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:07,527
Seems clear to me.

301
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,246
This isn't just about your son.

302
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:12,832
Henry, this is about
the people in Central City.

303
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:15,668
About saving those people.
This is about stopping Zoom.

304
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,920
Your daughter is safe.

305
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:21,374
This could kill my son.

306
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,126
I'm not gonna let that happen.

307
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:24,794
The last time he was struck by lightning,

308
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,295
he was in a coma for nine months.

309
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,464
How did that happen? I know what I'm doing.

310
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:31,968
You are messing with something
that is out of your control.

311
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,470
And what if it did work? I mean, what then?

312
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,355
Joe? He goes up against Zoom,

313
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:40,193
the monster that snapped
his back and almost killed him,

314
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:43,312
and then took the one thing
that he's convinced now

315
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,198
that he needs in order to make him whole?

316
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,035
This is the way. This is the only way.

317
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,704
The people of Central City need The Flash.

318
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:52,789
Guys.

319
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:00,663
I know that you care about me,
each of you, in your own way,

320
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,248
and you all have
your own point of view on this,

321
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,583
but this decision is mine.

322
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:08,671
I have to make it on my own.

323
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:16,729
Can you put the Diamonds game on?

324
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,482
Ah, sports. That's my cue.

325
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:22,185
All right, well, this was fun.

326
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:26,105
Um...good hang. Whoa. Wait.

327
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,941
Gonna take care of that, right?

328
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:30,359
Dude, you invited me.

329
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:32,862
Unbelievable.

330
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:37,116
Hey, hold up!

331
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:41,204
Oh, no.

332
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,623
What? Cisco?

333
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,508
Hey, wait.

334
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:50,263
Yo! I need a lift home.

335
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:51,514
You still don't have a car?

336
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:52,715
Some of us don't have

337
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,801
a fleet of company cars at our disposal.

338
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,269
Dude, it's on the way.

339
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,970
Yeah, okay. Come on.

340
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,864
You okay?

341
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,297
Hello, Vibe.

342
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,117
Simmer down, Reaper.
We got no beef with you.

343
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,702
Maybe not,

344
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,654
but I've got beef with you, Vibe.

345
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:36,039
Why does he keep calling you that?

346
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,373
I don't know.

347
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,209
You killed my brother, so, now, you die.

348
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:42,078
Oh, my God.

349
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,797
You're "Princess Bride"-ing me right now!

350
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,000
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else, Inigo.

351
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:50,003
I don't think so. My brother was Reverb.

352
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,423
Remember now?

353
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,731
- Move!
- He looks...

354
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,733
- Get... get... get in the van!
- He looks like...

355
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:04,934
Now!

356
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:11,908
I knew there was something wrong.

357
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,242
Every time I see you, we get attacked

358
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,994
by lunatics with crazy weapons!

359
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,834
Come on! He's gonna
blast us with that thing!

360
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:22,835
No, he's not!

361
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:27,457
Go! Go!

362
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:37,517
You want to tell me exactly
what you've gotten us

363
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,435
into this time?

364
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,604
He calls himself Rupture.

365
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:44,440
Another meta-human under Zoom's
control from my Earth.

366
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,726
Great, so he's bringing more
of his friends over.

367
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:49,062
That's what I told you he would do.

368
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:51,781
Okay, well, Zoom must've lied to fake-Dante

369
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:53,316
and told him
I was the one who killed Reverb,

370
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,817
'cause dude wants me dead.

371
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,069
We got to do something.

372
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,854
What else do you know about him?

373
00:18:57,856 --> 00:19:00,073
He gets his power
from that scythe he wields.

374
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,291
Thing's legit too... it almost
took half the van with him.

375
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:03,960
All right, then that's what we need to do.

376
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:06,045
We need to figure out a way
to get it away from him.

377
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,498
Right. Okay, all right.

378
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,049
I'm sure I can come up with something.

379
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,468
I just have to figure out
a way to not tell Dante

380
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,671
why this psychopath looks exactly like him.

381
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,927
You know what you need to do.

382
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,598
I need a minute.

383
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:40,296
Hey.

384
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,799
Hey.

385
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:47,170
It should be an easy decision. Why isn't it?

386
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,589
I mean, it's not like you're picking out

387
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:52,141
what sweater you're gonna wear.

388
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:54,844
Getting hit by another
particle accelerator explosion?

389
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:57,313
I mean, come on.
What if something goes wrong?

390
00:19:57,315 --> 00:20:00,516
What if...

391
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:04,771
I thought bringing my dad here
would make this easier.

392
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:06,739
It's just made it a lot harder.

393
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:08,691
Yeah, I can understand him
not wanting you to do it.

394
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,660
He just wants you to be safe.

395
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:14,030
What about you?

396
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:15,581
I mean, I don't know if I could go through

397
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,867
what I went through last time
if you get hurt.

398
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,041
Are you okay?

399
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:31,881
Not really.

400
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:33,383
What's up?

401
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,770
Do you remember when I told you

402
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:39,439
that I didn't want you going to Earth-2

403
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,607
if you felt like you
didn't have anything left here?

404
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:45,144
Yeah... because Patty left.

405
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:49,198
It wasn't just because of Patty.

406
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,150
What do you mean?

407
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:55,238
Barry, you've always
had someone to come home to.

408
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,205
Me.

409
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:03,880
I've just been thinking a lot lately...

410
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:08,718
About us.

411
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,638
What Wells said about us
being married in the future.

412
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,341
And on Earth-2.

413
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:18,978
And I can't help wondering if...

414
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,431
maybe we were meant to be together.

415
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:31,524
So...

416
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:35,194
when I told you how I felt
about you last year...

417
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:37,747
I wasn't available in that way.

418
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:43,336
But... but I am now.

419
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:47,290
Why are you telling me this now?

420
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:50,710
Because, Barry, I need you to know

421
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:56,265
that it doesn't matter to me
if you're The Flash or not.

422
00:21:56,267 --> 00:22:00,386
You, Barry... that's who I want
to see if I have a future with.

423
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,192
I mean...

424
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:10,113
if you still want that too, of course.

425
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:22,458
I should go see if Jesse
and Wally need anything.

426
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:40,977
Come on.

427
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,404
Yes!

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,749
And?

429
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:07,336
He got away, but I'll find him.

430
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:09,038
Later.

431
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,874
He needs to pay
for what he did to my brother!

432
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:16,095
And he will. Later, Rupture!

433
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,380
What do you want me to do?

434
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:20,466
The police have gathered again.

435
00:23:20,468 --> 00:23:24,303
They think I've spared their lives.

436
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:28,224
Tonight... show them they're wrong.

437
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,566
You disapprove?

438
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:39,035
You said you would spare them.

439
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:41,320
I need to teach them a lesson.

440
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:42,705
Is that why you change your voice?

441
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:45,541
So that everyone will be afraid of you?

442
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:50,246
I'm not a monster!

443
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:53,749
As you once said...

444
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,752
I'm nothing but a monster.

445
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:10,816
Can we come out now?

446
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,184
- No!
- No!

447
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:16,105
Something's blinking over here.

448
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:23,779
- From CCPD.
- That's Caitlin.

449
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:26,499
- What about Caitlin?
- She sent us a message.

450
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:29,335
Rupture is gonna attack Jitters tonight.

451
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:32,171
We got to move, Barry.

452
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:34,540
What are you gonna do, slugger?

453
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:42,048
Having The Flash might
be the best way to stop Zoom

454
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,716
and all the metas he's sending over.

455
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:47,103
But, look, until we know for sure

456
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:50,056
that setting off the accelerator
will work, it's too risky.

457
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:52,608
Not just for me. For the entire city.

458
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,694
Countless others that would be affected

459
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:56,312
if the explosion is not contained.

460
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,863
- Yes, but Allen...
- Stop, Wells.

461
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:00,533
Look, I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.

462
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:03,703
Sorry.

463
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:04,870
We're gonna have to figure out

464
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,739
how to do this without The Flash.

465
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,366
- Joe, did you reach The Flash?
- He'll be here.

466
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:28,034
Great, these guys are almost ready.

467
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:30,153
Put it on "1."

468
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:31,805
Hey, we're all set up.

469
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,289
Are you sure this is the best plan?

470
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,208
Look, I know you can't help as The Flash,

471
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,827
but stopping one of Zoom's
cronies sends him a message

472
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,829
that we won't be intimidated.

473
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,915
You think I made the right decision?

474
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,166
I don't know, Bare.

475
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,467
Whether you made the right one or not,

476
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,553
you're gonna have to live with it.

477
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:47,921
Yeah. All right.

478
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,683
What is this?

479
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,102
You went to another Earth?

480
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,853
You weren't supposed to read that.

481
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,189
It was on your desk.
It was addressed to Mom and me.

482
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,991
So, yeah, I read it.

483
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:10,493
Look, I got to go, okay?
We'll talk about this later.

484
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:12,362
No, man, we're gonna talk
about this right now!

485
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,947
Okay, let's talk about this now.

486
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,532
What did you want me to say?

487
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,834
"What up, fam?
I know you probably don't care,

488
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:19,786
"but I'm going off
to another Earth for a hot sec.

489
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,421
"If I don't make it back in time for dinner,

490
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,123
it probably didn't go so well."

491
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,008
Why did you even go in the first place?

492
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,711
Because my friends needed my help.

493
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,679
What kind of help?

494
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:32,549
- They needed me to vibe.
- Vibe?

495
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,519
That's what that lunatic
called you, who attacked us.

496
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:38,605
What aren't you telling me, Cisco?

497
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:48,198
I have powers.

498
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,650
Powers?

499
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,655
What, you're, like, a meta-human?

500
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,831
I was affected

501
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,966
when the accelerator went off two years ago,

502
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:12,172
and now I see things, vibes... of people.

503
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:15,508
Like visions?

504
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,260
So that's why you called me.

505
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,345
Yeah.

506
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,348
I had one of you, or at least
I thought it was you,

507
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,351
until your "World of Warcraft"
doppelganger showed up.

508
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,853
You killed his brother?

509
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,856
No, I didn't kill his brother.
Of course not.

510
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,524
Why wouldn't you tell me any of this?

511
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:35,195
Because you're right.
It's just like you said.

512
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:39,365
We haven't been close in years and...

513
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,668
and there's nothing
we can do to change that.

514
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:48,291
Look, I got to go.

515
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,376
Um...

516
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:53,046
just wait for me here, okay?

517
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,059
You all set, Cisco?

518
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,894
Yeah, we're set.

519
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:10,280
Here he comes.

520
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,581
Now, where has everybody gone?

521
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:36,222
Flash? Not who I was expecting,

522
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,757
but you'll be a nice warm-up.

523
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,011
Too slow, Rupture.

524
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:52,488
Come on, Flash!

525
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,357
All right. Time to win an Oscar.

526
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,243
Let's do it.

527
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:14,928
Get up.

528
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,130
Are we the guys you were looking for?

529
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,798
Hope you like being alone, 'cause you won't

530
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,051
be talking to anyone at Iron Heights.

531
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,272
Cisco, we got him. All good.

532
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:27,974
Get back! Get that camera back.

533
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,560
Breaking news coming out
of Jitters coffee shop.

534
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,979
CCPN has learned that a meta-human

535
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,316
was just apprehended after
an altercation with The Flash.

536
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,735
You told them Rupture was coming.

537
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:41,621
How? How?

538
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:50,046
Oh, you... are smart, aren't you?

539
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:51,464
You betrayed me!

540
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:54,884
You said you would spare them.

541
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,502
I guess...

542
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:57,887
now we're even.

543
00:29:57,889 --> 00:29:58,805
Jay, no!

544
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,427
My name... is Zoom.

545
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:14,153
Oh, my God. No!

546
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:23,265
Make sure you get this.

547
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:25,434
- What the...?
- They got to get out of there.

548
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:30,156
Everybody move!

549
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:46,539
- Barry, don't!
- No!

550
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:51,343
I told you what would happen
if you disobeyed me.

551
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:54,513
Hey, stop! Stop! God...

552
00:30:54,515 --> 00:30:56,298
you've made your point.

553
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,718
Not quite yet.

554
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:05,891
You're an even bigger disappointment

555
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:09,228
than your brother.

556
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:19,121
Central City...

557
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:24,493
the Flash you've seen
in your streets is a fake.

558
00:31:24,495 --> 00:31:28,414
A hologram meant to give you hope.

559
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:33,752
But there is no more hope,
there is no more Flash,

560
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:38,474
and there's no one left
to protect your city...

561
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:40,676
from me.

562
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:46,932
Tell the rest of your force, Captain,

563
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:50,603
that their policing days are over.

564
00:31:53,274 --> 00:31:57,443
You're only alive because of Caitlin.

565
00:31:57,445 --> 00:32:00,830
Try something like this again,

566
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:03,249
and my affection for her

567
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:07,620
won't stop me from killing you...

568
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:10,089
or the rest of this city!

569
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:30,276
Did you see this?

570
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:34,230
That's what you left to go do, wasn't it?

571
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:36,565
Look, man. I know you're mad at me.

572
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,701
We haven't been close in a long time.

573
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:44,823
I want things to change.

574
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:50,129
You're my brother.

575
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:56,252
Okay.

576
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:01,840
Okay.

577
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:12,234
You know that wall's not
just gonna open for you, right?

578
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:13,686
It might.

579
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:17,573
Yeah, trust me. It won't.

580
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,191
We shouldn't be in here.

581
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:21,243
We should be out there with them.

582
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:23,779
Why? So Zoom can take us again?

583
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:26,448
- No, so we can help stop him.
- What are we gonna do?

584
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,918
I mean, we don't have any powers.

585
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,703
I don't know.

586
00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:35,457
Hey, you're pretty quick
at solving unsolvable problems.

587
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:38,877
Let's figure it out.

588
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:41,714
I will see what I can do.

589
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:43,349
It won't be long now.

590
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:45,517
He's moving faster
than he ever did on my Earth.

591
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,219
So what's next?

592
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:49,271
Next, he'll recruit every
meta-human he can find,

593
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:50,889
and then force them to do what he wants.

594
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:52,191
How many could be left?

595
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:53,726
We defeated most of them, didn't we?

596
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,562
No. You're not even close.

597
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,948
This...

598
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,784
is a list of meta-humans from my Earth.

599
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:03,285
Ones that are known, anyway.

600
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:05,037
The particle accelerator explosion

601
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,538
was contained on my Earth.

602
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
That didn't happen here.

603
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:11,410
Then why wouldn't we know
about other meta-humans here?

604
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:13,245
Because of The Flash.

605
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:15,297
And now that everyone knows
that he's not around...

606
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:17,249
They'll start coming out of the woodwork.

607
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,751
We don't know that.

608
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,803
What more do you need?

609
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:22,588
I told you he'd recruit meta-humans.

610
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,806
We've seen him do that. I told you

611
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:24,890
he would kill those officers.

612
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:26,258
We saw him do that too.

613
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,509
What more do you need?

614
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:34,850
Let's do it. I want to do it.

615
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:43,492
One of the cops that Zoom killed
tonight, he had a son.

616
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:45,361
Same age I was when Mom was murdered.

617
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:48,614
And now, another kid has to grow
up without one of their parents

618
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:52,951
because The Flash wasn't there
to stop that monster.

619
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:58,340
I left this city unprotected
by giving up my powers to Zoom.

620
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:01,460
I enabled him to rule this Earth.

621
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:02,628
I need my powers back.

622
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:07,299
Let's do it.

623
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:09,518
Let's set off the particle accelerator.

624
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,820
So how does this work?

625
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,104
It's an abbreviated version

626
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,156
of the accelerator evil Wells built,

627
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:31,444
except Harry is isolating
the antimatter and dark energy

628
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:34,113
to direct it to Barry
instead of the entire city.

629
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,032
Good. Last thing we need

630
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,785
is more meta-humans
running around Central City.

631
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:44,507
So... Barry just gets in,
we turn it on, and that's it?

632
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,342
Yeah.

633
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,628
No. Not exactly.

634
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,296
In addition to recreating what happened with

635
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:52,215
the particle accelerator explosion,

636
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,133
we also have to recreate
what happened to Barry.

637
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:56,019
Getting struck by lightning.

638
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,303
That's right.

639
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,688
Wait, so how are you gonna do that?

640
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,023
It's not even raining outside.

641
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,058
Well, Ramon, you have the wand.

642
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,810
The one I made for Mark Mardon?

643
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:05,812
No, the one you built
for the Harry Potter convention.

644
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:08,064
Yes, of course,
the one you built for Mardon.

645
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,283
How do you know about
the Harry Potter convention?

646
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:13,703
- Get the wand. Get on the roof.
- Why the roof?

647
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,955
Because we're gonna need a lightning rod,

648
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:19,826
and that, Ramon, is gonna be you.

649
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:31,170
All right, I'm on the roof. Wow.

650
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,673
I've never actually been up here before.

651
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,842
I think I can see my apartment from here.

652
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:37,560
Now head straight to the satellite, Ramon.

653
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,178
When I give you the signal,

654
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,514
you're gonna create
a lightning storm above you.

655
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:43,349
So I'm just supposed
to stand here in the middle

656
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,351
- of a lightning storm?
- Really, Ramon.

657
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,103
Chances of being struck are slim, indeed.

658
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,988
Yeah, not when you're the one causing it.

659
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,691
All we need is one lightning
bolt to strike the satellite.

660
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:53,526
The satellite circuitry's
connected to the breach room.

661
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:55,695
Barry's in the breach room. Just do it.

662
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,080
Yeah. I'm doing it.

663
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,532
Mozart better watch out.

664
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:02,702
Cisco Ramon's about
to conduct something nasty.

665
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,425
You're gonna feel these
clamps, but they're necessary.

666
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,632
- You good?
- Yeah. You?

667
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:20,887
I'll be fine, Joe.

668
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,229
Barry, whatever happens,

669
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:33,232
it will never change
the way that I feel about you.

670
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,917
Son...

671
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,753
you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

672
00:37:56,558 --> 00:38:01,928
Being The Flash...
that's the best version of me.

673
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,983
If I don't have my speed, I'll
never be that person anymore.

674
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:10,520
I have to do this.

675
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,105
Okay.

676
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:17,076
You ready, Allen?

677
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,833
All right, then.

678
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,119
Here we go.

679
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:35,845
Think of it as hotwiring a car, right?

680
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,964
So there's a motor inside the wall.

681
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,799
So all we have to do is provide electricity

682
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,301
- to make it turn on.
- Exactly.

683
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,137
So we just do a little here...

684
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,640
And voila!

685
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,559
Do you feel that?

686
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,145
Yeah, what's happening?

687
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,814
Particles are becoming unstable.

688
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,365
Ramon, get ready!

689
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,284
I'm gonna release the chemicals
into his system.

690
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,829
Why are you doing this?

691
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,831
The night Barry was struck by lightning,

692
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,666
he was doing fingerprint analysis.

693
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:15,551
Those chemicals got in his system then,

694
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,170
and they are going in now.

695
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:18,671
So you're injecting them into him?

696
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:20,006
We have to recreate everything

697
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:21,557
that happened to Barry that night.

698
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,343
I'm okay, Iris!

699
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:27,897
- Hold on, Barry.
- God!

700
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,850
- He's going hydrostatic.
- Almost there. Almost there.

701
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:32,985
- Wells!
- Almost there.

702
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:34,821
Ready, Ramon?

703
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:37,023
Ready!

704
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:40,576
- Now!
- Expecto Patronum!

705
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,615
Great Scott! It's working!

706
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,254
No!

707
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,210
Initiating collision.

708
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:11,641
Barry!

709
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:39,669
It worked!

710
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,672
Is everyone okay?

711
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,924
What happened?

712
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,520
No!

713
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:04,193
No. What did you do to my son?

714
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,787
You thought you could give
The Flash his speed back?

715
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,876
Well done.

716
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:23,429
You killed him instead.

717
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,534
