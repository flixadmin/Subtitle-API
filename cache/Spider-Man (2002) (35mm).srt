1
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:06,563
Who am I?

2
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:08,428
You sure you wanna know?

3
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,589
The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.

4
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,827
If somebody said it was
a happy little tale...

5
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:19,384
if somebody told you I was just your
average guy, not a care in the world...

6
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:21,063
somebody lied.

7
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,677
But let me assure you,

8
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:26,065
this like any story worth telling...

9
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,606
is all about a girl.

10
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:29,301
That girl.

11
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:30,885
The girl next door.

12
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:32,824
Mary Jane Watson.

13
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:36,011
The woman I've loved since
before I even liked girls.

14
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,640
I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.

15
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,847
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

16
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:43,301
Hey!

17
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:44,601
Stop the bus!

18
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:47,146
That's me.

19
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:49,397
Tell him to stop! Please!

20
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:50,563
Stop!

21
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,969
Hey! Stop the bus!

22
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:54,010
Stop the bus!

23
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,433
He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

24
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:57,898
Catch a cab, Parker!

25
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,911
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:11,815
What a geek!

27
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:13,927
Don't even think about it.

28
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:15,996
You're so lame, Parker.

29
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,648
Would you date him?

30
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:37,953
Midtown High seniors.

31
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,010
No wandering.

32
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,901
Proceed direct. Knock it off.

33
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,733
Remember, it is a privilege to be here.

34
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:49,856
We're guests of Columbia
University's Science Department.

35
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,496
So behave accordingly.

36
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:54,816
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

37
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:57,272
Come on, people, stay together.

38
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,694
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

39
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,800
Where were you?
Checking out the library.

40
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:06,666
Looking at the books.
Yeah, right.

41
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,397
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

42
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:12,563
Why?

43
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,856
The entrance is right there.

44
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,731
Dad, these are public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

45
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:21,477
What, you want me to trade in
my car for a Jetta...

46
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:24,539
because you flunked out of every
private school I sent you to?

47
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:25,593
It wasn't for me.

48
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:26,874
Of course it was.

49
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:30,040
Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.

50
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,627
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

51
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:33,772
It's just...

52
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:35,215
Just what, Harry?

53
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:36,897
Forget it.

54
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,169
Pete!

55
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:43,815
Hi, Harry.
Hey, man. What's up?

56
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:44,980
Harry.

57
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,718
Won't you be needing this?

58
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,169
Thanks, Dad.

59
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,065
Peter, may I introduce
my father, Norman Osborn.

60
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:52,844
I've heard so much about you.

61
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:54,301
Great honor to meet you, sir.

62
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,413
Harry says you're a science whiz.

63
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,218
You know,

64
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:59,397
I'm something of a scientist myself.

65
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:02,731
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really brilliant.

66
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,010
And you understood it?

67
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,981
Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

68
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:07,146
Impressive.

69
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,189
Your parents must be very proud.

70
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:11,154
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

71
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,984
Hey, you two! Let's move!

72
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:15,343
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,053
Hope to see you again.
Yeah.

74
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,718
He doesn't seem so bad.

75
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,405
Not if you're a genius.

76
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,455
I think he wants to adopt you.

77
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:27,927
There are over 32,000,

78
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,645
known species of spiders in the world.

79
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,802
They're in the order Araneae,

80
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,790
divided into three suborders.

81
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:36,018
That's amazing!

82
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:40,356
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

83
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:41,579
It's unreal.

84
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:43,718
Arachnids,

85
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:45,200
from all three groups possess,

86
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,619
varying strengths which help
them in their constant search for food.

87
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:50,010
For example,

88
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,635
the Delena spider,

89
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,335
family Sparassidae...

90
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,052
has the ability,

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,271
to jump to catch its prey.

92
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,301
For the school paper?

93
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:05,760
Next we have,

94
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,301
the net web spider,

95
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,439
family Filistatidae...

96
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,350
genus Kukulcania.

97
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,094
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web

98
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,590
whose strands have a tensile strength,

99
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:19,635
proportionately equal to a type
of high tension wire

100
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,449
used in bridge building.

101
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,689
Leave him alone.
Or what?

102
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:26,129
Or his father will fire your father.

103
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,510
What's Daddy gonna do?

104
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:29,564
Sue me?

105
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,219
What is going on?

106
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:34,094
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

107
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:35,405
I kid you not.

108
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,059
This grass spider...
Let's go.

109
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,176
Hunts using a set of reflexes

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,991
with nerve conduction velocity so fast,

111
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:45,689
that some researchers believe
that it almost borders on precognition.

112
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,897
An early awareness of danger.
Those guys are jerks.

113
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,022
A spider-sense.

114
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,108
Hey, look at that spider.

115
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:56,112
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

116
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:58,640
It's a defense mechanism.

117
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,229
Peter,

118
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:02,521
what makes you think
I would want to know that?

119
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,573
Who wouldn't?

120
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,094
Over five painstaking years,

121
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,269
Columbia's genetic research facility...

122
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:09,510
You gonna talk to her now?

123
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:12,611
No. Come on. You talk to her.

124
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,609
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

125
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,580
we have now begun what
was once thought impossible.

126
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:18,718
Disgusting.

127
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,089
Yeah, hateful little things.

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,855
I love them!

129
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,414
Yeah, me too.

130
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,022
You know,

131
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:29,322
spiders can change their color...

132
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:31,844
to blend into their environment.

133
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:33,388
Really?

134
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:36,343
Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.

135
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:38,530
Cool.
Yeah.

136
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:41,598
Transfer RNA to encode
an entirely new genome

137
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,063
combining the genetic information
rom all three spiders

138
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,885
into these,

139
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:49,397
15 genetically designed super-spiders.

140
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,898
There's 14.

141
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,022
I beg your pardon?

142
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:54,563
One's missing.

143
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:56,043
Yeah.

144
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,646
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

145
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,572
Do you know that this is
the largest electron microscope

146
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:06,980
on the Eastern Seaboard?

147
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:10,364
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

148
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:13,022
Let's go talk about how we listen.

149
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:17,802
Now,

150
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,680
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

151
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:23,395
but at Midtown High...
112.5.

152
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:30,623
Hey.

153
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:33,094
Could I take your picture?

154
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:34,845
I need one with a student in it.

155
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,844
Sure, yeah.

156
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,010
Great.
Where do you want me?

157
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,626
Over here?

158
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:41,146
Yeah. Yeah that's great.

159
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:42,834
Don't make me look ugly.

160
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,119
That's impossible.

161
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,969
Perfect.

162
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:03,084
Is that good?
Great.

163
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:09,771
That's great.

164
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,216
MJ, let's go!

165
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,271
Wait.

166
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:21,423
Thanks!

167
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:36,313
Parker,

168
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:37,930
let's do it.

169
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:56,468
We solved the horizon glide,

170
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,229
and the multi-G balance issues.

171
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:00,511
I've already seen the glider.

172
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,250
That's not what I'm here for.

173
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,524
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

174
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:09,271
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

175
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,218
Norman.

176
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:11,322
Mr. Osborn.

177
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:15,063
Always a pleasure to have our board
of directors pay us a little visit.

178
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,688
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

179
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:21,610
We tried vapor inhalation
with rogue subjects,

180
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,354
they showed an 800% increase in strength!

181
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:25,278
800%? That's excellent.
Any side effects?

182
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:26,683
In one trial, yes.

183
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,635
It was an aberration.

184
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,501
All the tests since
then have been successful.

185
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,844
And in the trial that went wrong,
what happened?

186
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:33,193
What were the side effects?

187
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,492
Violence,

188
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:35,714
aggression...

189
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:37,712
and insanity.

190
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,094
And what do you recommend?

191
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:40,623
That was only one test.

192
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,718
With the exception of Dr. Stromm,

193
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:44,909
our entire staff certifies the product

194
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,426
ready for human testing.

195
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:47,883
Dr. Stromm?

196
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,501
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

197
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,343
Back to formula?

198
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,387
Dr. Osborn.

199
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,109
I'm gonna be frank with you.

200
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,844
I never supported your program.

201
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:04,315
We have my predecessor
to thank for that.

202
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:05,385
Norman,

203
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,706
the general gave
the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace

204
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:10,246
to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

205
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,260
They test in two weeks.

206
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:15,635
And if your so-called performance
enhancers have not had a...

207
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,582
successful human trial by that date,

208
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:20,718
I'm gonna pull your funding.

209
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:22,607
I'm going to give it to them.

210
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,876
Gentlemen. Ladies.

211
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,385
And the Lord said, Let there be light.

212
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,552
And voilà!

213
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,184
There is light.

214
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:40,141
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

215
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,635
Good boy. God will be thrilled.

216
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,260
Just don't fall on your ass.

217
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,429
I'm already on my ass, May.

218
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,927
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after...

219
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:54,052
after 35 years,
what else would you call it?

220
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,656
I am on my ass.

221
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:57,304
Hand me that dish. The green one.

222
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:00,957
The corporation is
downsizing the people and...

223
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:02,728
upsizing their profits.

224
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,796
Ben, you'll get
another job somewhere.

225
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:08,523
Well...

226
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:10,398
let's look in the paper and see.

227
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,638
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

228
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,449
Computer...

229
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,787
Computer salesman,

230
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:20,137
computer engineer, computer analyst.

231
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:23,250
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

232
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:25,718
May, I'm 68 years old.

233
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:29,479
I'm too old for computers and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

234
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:30,884
I love you.

235
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:32,563
And Peter loves you.

236
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:36,063
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

237
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:37,969
We've been down-and-out before.

238
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:39,827
But somehow, we survived.

239
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:41,177
Yeah.

240
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:42,885
Hi, sweetie.

241
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:43,908
You're just...

242
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,146
Just in time for dinner.

243
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:47,052
Hey.

244
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,896
How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

245
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:51,054
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

246
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:52,934
You won't have a bite?

247
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,495
No thanks. Had a bite.

248
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,103
Did, did you get some pictures, Peter?

249
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:00,123
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

250
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,291
What's that all about?

251
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,271
In this recombination lab,

252
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:32,063
we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome

253
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,456
combining the genetic
information from all three spiders

254
00:14:35,522 --> 00:14:39,827
into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

255
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:55,969
Dr. Osborn, please.

256
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:58,486
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

257
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,151
The data just doesn't justify this test.

258
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,134
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.

259
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:05,897
We can't do this.

260
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,947
Don't be a coward.

261
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:11,479
Risks are part of laboratory science.

262
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,794
Let me reschedule,

263
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:15,396
with a proper medical staff
and a volunteer.

264
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,760
I mean if you just give me two weeks.
Two weeks?

265
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,205
In two weeks,

266
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,462
we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

267
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,677
Sometimes,

268
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:25,420
you gotta do things yourself.

269
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:27,677
Get me the Promachloraperazine.

270
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:28,755
For what?

271
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,745
It begins catalyzation, when
the vapor hits the bloodstream.

272
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,069
40,000 years of evolution

273
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:40,518
and we've barely even tapped
the vastness of human potential.

274
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:56,260
That's cold.

275
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:55,730
Norman?

276
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,229
Norman!

277
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:03,594
Norman!

278
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,097
My God.

279
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:16,063
Oh my God!

280
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:17,662
Norman?

281
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:20,604
My God, Norman!

282
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:24,087
Norman!

283
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,813
Back to formula?

284
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:14,453
Weird.

285
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,354
Peter?
Yeah?

286
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,821
Are you alright?

287
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,229
I'm fine.

288
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:35,271
Any better this morning?
Any change?

289
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,438
Change?

290
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:38,813
Yep.

291
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:39,872
Big change.

292
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:41,134
Well, hurry up.

293
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,552
You're gonna be late.

294
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:43,692
Right.

295
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:03,271
Ok.

296
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,052
Goodness me!

297
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:10,075
Jeez.

298
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,290
I thought you were sick.

299
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:14,022
I got better.
You see?

300
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,010
Bye, guys.

301
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:17,235
You haven't eaten anything.
Have you got your lunch money?

302
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:17,966
Yeah, I got it.

303
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,094
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're
painting the kitchen right after school.

304
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,760
You got it?
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.

305
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,219
Don't start without me.

306
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:25,608
And don't start up with me.

307
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:28,938
Teenagers.

308
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,172
Raging hormones.
They never change.

309
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,370
Mary jane talk to me!

310
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:35,950
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

311
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:36,886
Just like her!

312
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:38,791
I have to go to school.
Who's stopping you?

313
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:58,688
Hi, MJ.

314
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,229
Hey, MJ.

315
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,969
I don't know if you realize this,
but we've...

316
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,770
we've been neighbors since I was 6,
and I was wondering if maybe...

317
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,205
we could get together sometime?
Hey M.J?

318
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,424
I got the car. Hop in.

319
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:12,688
Maybe do something fun?
Hi guys!

320
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:14,686
Or I don't know.
Come on.

321
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:17,459
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

322
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:19,855
Or not.

323
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,491
Sorry Parker, the bus is full!
Hey!

324
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:29,474
Hey!

325
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,620
Stop the bus!
Catch a cab!

326
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:33,707
Tell him to stop.

327
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,494
Check him out!
Dork!

328
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,521
Dad!

329
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:01,677
Dad!

330
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,801
Are you alright?

331
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:04,938
Harry.

332
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,084
What are you doing on the floor?

333
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:11,660
I don't know.

334
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,212
Have you been there all night?

335
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,479
Last night I was...

336
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:21,813
What?

337
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,179
I don't remember.
Mr. Osborn?

338
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,302
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

339
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:29,052
Sorry, my father's not feeling well.

340
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,301
Mr. Osborn...

341
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:31,962
Dr. Stromm is dead.

342
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,203
What?

343
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,176
They found his body
this morning in the lab.

344
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,030
He's been murdered, sir.

345
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,343
What are you talking about?

346
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,188
And the flight suit and the glider...

347
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:41,468
What about it?

348
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:42,771
It's been stolen, sir.

349
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:09,915
Great reflexes!

350
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:11,969
Thanks.

351
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:13,137
No problem.

352
00:22:14,564 --> 00:22:15,563
Hey you...

353
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,552
have blue eyes.

354
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,479
I... I didn't notice without your glasses.

355
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,659
You just get contacts?

356
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,646
Well,

357
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:29,727
see you.

358
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:12,635
What happened?

359
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,326
He's freaking weird.

360
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:16,896
Did you see that?

361
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,479
Parker?

362
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:54,061
It's a fight!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you freak?

363
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:55,677
Flash, it was just an accident.

364
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,664
My fist breaking your
teeth, that's the accident.

365
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:59,094
Come on Flash, stop.

366
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:00,396
I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

367
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:01,843
I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.

368
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,120
Kick his ass.

369
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,271
Help him, Harry.

370
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,420
How'd he do that?

371
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:32,730
Which one?

372
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,229
He's all yours, man.

373
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,467
Flash, get up!

374
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,487
Jesus Parker, you are a freak.

375
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,207
Peter, that was amazing.

376
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:02,426
I'm out of here. Come on.

377
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:06,930
Peter.

378
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:48,800
Go, web!

379
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:51,604
Fly.

380
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,168
Up, up and away, web.

381
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:58,497
Shazam!

382
00:26:59,319 --> 00:26:59,969
Go!

383
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:00,652
Go!

384
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:01,924
Go, web, go!

385
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:36,875
Tallyho.

386
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,857
Is she back with the beer yet?
What?

387
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,479
Come here, bring me some beer!

388
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:27,010
Get up off your ass!

389
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:28,229
I paid for beer...

390
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:29,753
Stop yelling!
Stop it!

391
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:31,301
You're as stupid as your mother.

392
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:32,324
Get away from me!

393
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,146
You are drunk, do you know that?

394
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:36,023
Where's she going?
Where you going?

395
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,047
Where you going?

396
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:38,385
Stop, look!

397
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:39,718
These dishes are not done.

398
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:41,271
Somebody's gotta do the dishes!

399
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,218
Why don't you do them?

400
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:45,624
Get in here little girl
and you do the dishes, now!

401
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,863
You do them. They're yours, anyway.
I'm going out!

402
00:28:49,314 --> 00:28:50,510
Were you listening to that?

403
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:51,533
No.

404
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,885
Well I heard, but I was just...

405
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,528
taking out the trash.

406
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:57,041
I guess you can always hear us.

407
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:58,160
Well,

408
00:28:58,543 --> 00:28:59,968
everybody shouts.

409
00:29:01,143 --> 00:29:02,392
Your aunt and uncle don't.

410
00:29:03,064 --> 00:29:05,444
They can scream
pretty good sometimes.

411
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:08,207
Listen,

412
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:10,010
MJ, about today

413
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:11,998
at school with Flash...

414
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:13,461
You really freaked us out.

415
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,855
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,022
Is he ok?

417
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:18,974
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

418
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:25,163
So where are you going
after you graduate?

419
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:29,760
I...

420
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:33,162
I wanna move into the city.

421
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:35,885
And hopefully...

422
00:29:36,346 --> 00:29:37,552
get a job as a...

423
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:39,186
photographer.

424
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:41,192
Work my way through college.

425
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:44,396
What about you?

426
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:46,278
Headed for the city too.

427
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,447
Can't wait to get out of here.

428
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,022
I wanna...

429
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:54,771
What?

430
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,104
No, come on.

431
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:00,753
Try me.

432
00:30:01,272 --> 00:30:02,271
I wanna...

433
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:04,896
Act...

434
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:07,396
on stage.

435
00:30:08,397 --> 00:30:09,396
Really?

436
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:11,972
That's perfect.

437
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:15,670
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

438
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,635
Really?

439
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:17,658
Yeah.

440
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:21,438
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

441
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:23,466
Peter, that was first grade.

442
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:25,487
Well...

443
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:27,579
even so.

444
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:30,349
Sometimes...

445
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:32,933
you know people.

446
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:35,760
You can just...

447
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:37,359
see what's coming.

448
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:43,049
What do you see coming for you?

449
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:47,637
I don't know.

450
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:51,760
Whatever it is,

451
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,513
it's something I never felt before.

452
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,909
And...

453
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,438
what for me?

454
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:02,860
For you?

455
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,301
You're gonna light up Broadway.

456
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:10,063
You know,

457
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:16,354
you're taller than you look.

458
00:31:17,564 --> 00:31:18,563
I hunch.

459
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:22,354
Don't.

460
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:27,396
Hey, MJ!

461
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:29,956
Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

462
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,022
Come on!

463
00:31:33,064 --> 00:31:34,069
I gotta go.

464
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:36,302
Bye.

465
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,063
My God, it's gorgeous!
Yeah, right?

466
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,836
Look at it!
Hop in.

467
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:44,366
Oh my God! What a cool car!

468
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:45,896
Pretty tight?

469
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:48,718
Wait untill you hear the sound system.

470
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,789
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

471
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:53,730
Cool car.

472
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,293
Peter?

473
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:29,081
What's... What's going on in there?

474
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:30,134
I'm exercising.

475
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:31,443
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

476
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:32,510
Well,

477
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:34,862
you're acting so strangely, Peter.

478
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,288
Ok. Thanks.

479
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:09,802
Something's bothering him.

480
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:12,063
Maybe he's too embarrassed
to tell me what it is.

481
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,349
Maybe I'm too embarrassed...

482
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,015
to ask him.

483
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:17,262
I just don't know anymore.

484
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,556
I'm going to the downtown library.
I'll see you later.

485
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:21,426
Yeah, wait Pete.

486
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,094
I'll drive you there, buddy.

487
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:24,137
No, I'll take the train.

488
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,593
No, no, no. I need the exercise.
Go on.

489
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:26,879
Go, go, go, go.

490
00:34:38,504 --> 00:34:40,094
Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
No, wait a minute.

491
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:41,961
Peter we need... we need to talk.

492
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:43,552
We can talk later.

493
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:45,177
Well, we can talk now.

494
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,143
If you let me.

495
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,813
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

496
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:51,997
Because we haven't talked
at all for so long

497
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:54,244
your Aunt May and I don't
even know who you are anymore.

498
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:55,900
You shirk your chores.

499
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:59,342
You have all those weird experiments
in your room.

500
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:03,189
You start fights at school, you know.
I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

501
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,010
Well, you sure as hell finished it.

502
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:07,113
What was I supposed to do, run away?
No.

503
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,043
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

504
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:10,927
Pete, look.

505
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:11,843
You're changing.

506
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:14,646
I know, I went through exactly
the same thing at your age.

507
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,191
No. Not exactly.

508
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,669
Peter...

509
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:20,679
these are the years
when a man changes

510
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:24,052
into the man he's gonna
become the rest of his life.

511
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,692
Just be careful who you change into.

512
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:31,801
This guy, Flash Thompson.

513
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:34,354
He probably deserved what happened.

514
00:35:34,897 --> 00:35:37,028
But just because you can beat him up,

515
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:39,507
doesn't give you the right to.

516
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:41,888
Remember,

517
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:43,426
with great power,

518
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:45,876
comes great responsibility.

519
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:49,718
Are you afraid that I'm gonna
turn into some kind of criminal?

520
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:51,723
Quit worrying about me, ok?

521
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:52,927
Something's different.

522
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,094
I'll figure it out.

523
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:55,670
Stop lecturing me, please.

524
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:57,969
I don't mean to lecture,
I don't mean to preach.

525
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,039
And I know I'm not your father...

526
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:01,719
Then stop pretending to be!

527
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:07,980
Right.

528
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:12,598
I'll pick you up here at 10.

529
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,551
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

530
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:56,260
One, two, three.

531
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,166
That's it!
Who's the man?

532
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:02,647
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

533
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:05,271
Ladies and gentlemen...

534
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:09,980
Give it up for Bone Saw McGraw!

535
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,930
For $3000,

536
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:20,012
is there no one here
man enough to stay in the ring

537
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:25,085
for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

538
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:29,307
Who?

539
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:31,664
I know who.

540
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:37,187
The Flying Dutchman!

541
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,654
Next.

542
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:42,186
There's no featherweight
division here, small fry.

543
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:43,185
. Next.

544
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:44,504
No, no. Sign me up.

545
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:46,521
Ok.

546
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:49,122
You understand
the NYWL is not responsible

547
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:50,612
for any injury you may and

548
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:53,229
probably will sustain while
participating in said event?

549
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,676
And you are indeed participating
under your own free will?

550
00:37:55,814 --> 00:37:56,813
Yes.

551
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:58,260
Down the hall to the ramp.

552
00:37:58,284 --> 00:37:59,510
May God be with you.

553
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,099
Next.

554
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:05,405
Told you! Told you!

555
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:08,004
Winner!

556
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:09,362
Next victim!

557
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:13,443
Are you ready for more?

558
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:18,563
Bone Saw is ready!

559
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:25,376
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

560
00:38:25,856 --> 00:38:29,052
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage

561
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:33,677
with Bone Saw McGraw,
the sum of $3000

562
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,187
will be paid to...

563
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,063
What's your name, kid?

564
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:38,649
The Human Spider.

565
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:42,022
The Human Spider, that's it?
That's the best you got?

566
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:42,802
Yeah.

567
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:44,077
That sucks.

568
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,980
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

569
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:50,343
the terrifying,

570
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,396
the deadly,

571
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:56,110
the amazing Spider-Man!

572
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,855
My name's The Human Spider.
I don't care, get out there.

573
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,592
No, he got my name wrong.
Get out there, you moron.

574
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:09,450
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

575
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:11,354
I hope you brought
your mommy with you.

576
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:14,514
We'll break you!
You'll need someone to cry to.

577
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:20,877
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one!

578
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:24,022
Oh my God!

579
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,268
My legs!

580
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:28,254
God. I can't feel my legs.

581
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:36,715
Kill! Kill! Kill!

582
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:41,938
Cage!

583
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,730
Hello? Guys?

584
00:39:53,772 --> 00:39:58,730
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

585
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,438
Hey, listen.

586
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,489
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

587
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:04,593
Hey!

588
00:40:04,865 --> 00:40:06,343
Unlock the thing!

589
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,636
Take the chain off!

590
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:09,181
Hey, freak show!

591
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:11,483
You're going, nowhere.

592
00:40:12,397 --> 00:40:14,317
I got you for three minutes.

593
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:17,166
Three minutes of playtime.

594
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:26,971
What are you doing up there?
Staying away from you.

595
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:28,760
That's a cute outfit.

596
00:40:28,784 --> 00:40:30,104
Did your husband give it to you?

597
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,288
Finish him off!

598
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:47,032
Smash him!

599
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,248
Hit him!
Harder!

600
00:40:58,397 --> 00:41:00,267
Kick his spider ass!

601
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:03,896
Hit him!

602
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:19,104
One, two, three!

603
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:20,385
That's it! That's it!

604
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:22,356
Winner!

605
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:24,802
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion,

606
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,517
Spider-Man!

607
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:32,918
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

608
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:35,808
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

609
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:45,873
Now get out of here.

610
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:49,218
A hundred bucks?

611
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:50,855
The ad said 3000.

612
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:52,818
Well, check it again, webhead.

613
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:55,010
It said three grand,

614
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:57,358
for three minutes.
And you pinned him in two.

615
00:41:57,689 --> 00:42:00,660
For that, I give you 100
and you're lucky to get that.

616
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,604
I need that money.

617
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:05,352
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

618
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,802
Hey, what the hell?

619
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,316
Put the money in the bag.

620
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:20,278
Hurry up!

621
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:29,312
Hey! He stole the gate!

622
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:30,803
Stop that guy!

623
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,913
Stop him! He's got my money!

624
00:42:34,314 --> 00:42:35,313
Thanks.

625
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:39,010
What the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

626
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:41,604
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

627
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:43,635
You could've taken that guy apart.

628
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:45,813
Now he's gonna get away
with my money.

629
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,990
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

630
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,369
Sir, you gotta get back.
Get back.

631
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:11,214
I can't see anything.
What happened?

632
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:13,054
Old dude, man.

633
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,103
Come on folks. Keep moving, please.

634
00:43:15,423 --> 00:43:16,984
Please, keep moving. Let's go!

635
00:43:17,814 --> 00:43:20,225
What happened?
Someone got hurt.

636
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:23,760
Excuse me.

637
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,593
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

638
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:26,616
Stay back.

639
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:28,563
Hey, stay back! Stay back!
That's my uncle!

640
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:31,677
What happened?

641
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:33,173
Carjacker. He's been shot.

642
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,498
But we just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

643
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,229
Uncle Ben?

644
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:40,521
Uncle Ben.

645
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:45,771
Uncle Ben?

646
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:50,730
Peter.

647
00:43:52,105 --> 00:43:53,330
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

648
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:00,521
Peter.

649
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:24,094
They got the shooter.

650
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:25,858
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

651
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:27,635
We got three cars in pursuit.

652
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:30,280
Alright. Folks come on.
Come up. Move back.

653
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:09,604
Get a unit to the rear!

654
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,104
I got the back!

655
00:47:27,023 --> 00:47:28,161
Who's there?

656
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:55,510
Don't hurt me.

657
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:56,718
Just give me a chance.

658
00:47:56,742 --> 00:47:57,922
Just give me a chance!

659
00:47:57,991 --> 00:47:59,094
What about my uncle?

660
00:47:59,117 --> 00:48:00,593
Did you give him a chance?

661
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,019
Did you?

662
00:48:02,477 --> 00:48:03,476
Answer me!

663
00:48:07,397 --> 00:48:09,111
Stop that guy!

664
00:48:14,064 --> 00:48:15,063
Thanks.

665
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:26,813
See you.

666
00:48:48,564 --> 00:48:49,385
Freeze!

667
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,631
We've got the place
completely surrounded.

668
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,838
No. My God.

669
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:40,755
No.
My God. No!

670
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:52,134
Good evening General.

671
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:53,703
Good to see you.

672
00:49:54,814 --> 00:49:57,688
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.

673
00:49:57,856 --> 00:50:01,891
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

674
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,570
He's clear, let's go!
I assume you're confident about this test?

675
00:50:07,595 --> 00:50:08,385
Absolutely.

676
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:10,060
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

677
00:50:10,731 --> 00:50:13,251
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

678
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:17,434
Nothing would please me more than
to put Norman Osborn out of business.

679
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:21,094
Preflight complete.

680
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:22,702
Mark.

681
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:29,803
We are picking up an
unidentified object, closing fast.

682
00:50:29,856 --> 00:50:30,938
What the hell is that?

683
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:32,104
Can you see anything?

684
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,063
Oh my God!

685
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:45,510
Say chess.

686
00:50:45,534 --> 00:50:46,830
Chess!

687
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:49,063
Peter!

688
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:50,927
Darling.

689
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:54,063
I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

690
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,885
Pete?

691
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:58,313
Good news. My father got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

692
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,063
That's great.
You made it.

693
00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:04,917
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

694
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,271
Congratulations.
Thanks, Dad.

695
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,885
Peter, the science award.

696
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:13,122
That's terrific.

697
00:51:13,147 --> 00:51:14,146
Yeah.

698
00:51:17,397 --> 00:51:19,813
I know this has been
a difficult time for you

699
00:51:20,939 --> 00:51:23,184
but I want you to try to enjoy this day.

700
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:25,510
Commencement.

701
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:27,468
The end of one thing.

702
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,631
The start of something new.

703
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:33,468
I don't want to be with you anymore.

704
00:51:33,492 --> 00:51:35,224
Here's your ring.

705
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:37,979
You know what? Whatever.

706
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:40,022
Your loss.

707
00:51:41,188 --> 00:51:42,593
You're like a brother to Harry.

708
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:44,222
That makes you family.

709
00:51:44,975 --> 00:51:46,843
And if you ever need anything just...

710
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:48,022
give me a call.

711
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:02,267
Can I...

712
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:03,898
Can I fix you something?

713
00:52:05,023 --> 00:52:06,022
No, thanks.

714
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,762
I missed him a lot today.

715
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:56,943
I know.

716
00:52:59,272 --> 00:53:00,380
I miss him too.

717
00:53:02,856 --> 00:53:04,563
But he was there.

718
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,802
I can't help thinking about...

719
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,699
the last thing I said to him.

720
00:53:13,778 --> 00:53:15,885
He tried to tell me something
important,

721
00:53:16,391 --> 00:53:18,178
and I threw it in his face.

722
00:53:20,522 --> 00:53:21,909
You loved him

723
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:25,735
and he loved you.

724
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:29,989
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

725
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,501
How you were meant for great things.

726
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,731
You won't disappoint him.

727
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:12,260
With great power...

728
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:14,895
comes great responsibility.

729
00:54:15,397 --> 00:54:16,593
Remember that, Pete.

730
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:18,188
Remember that.

731
00:54:28,605 --> 00:54:29,637
Hurry up!

732
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,310
This is not a man.

733
00:54:43,335 --> 00:54:45,933
My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center Fountain.

734
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:47,426
I think he's human,

735
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,425
I think he's a man.
Could be a woman.

736
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:54,176
Bobby.

737
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,551
Get a load of this!

738
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:01,317
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out,

739
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,662
and he climbs up
the ropes like a spider web.

740
00:55:03,897 --> 00:55:05,802
I see the web and it's his signature,

741
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:08,163
and I know Spider-Man was here.

742
00:55:08,188 --> 00:55:09,635
The guy protects us, you know?

743
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:10,813
He protects the people.

744
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:13,730
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wackadoo.

745
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,896
He stinks and I don't like him.

746
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,716
Don't move, lady!

747
00:55:26,314 --> 00:55:27,426
Guy with eight hands.

748
00:55:27,955 --> 00:55:29,063
Sounds hot.

749
00:55:29,131 --> 00:55:31,255
He has those tights
and that tight little...

750
00:55:47,314 --> 00:55:48,885
Who is Spider-Man?

751
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:50,605
He's a criminal, that's who he is!

752
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:52,094
A vigilante.

753
00:55:52,117 --> 00:55:53,260
A public menace.

754
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:55,017
What's he doing on my front page?

755
00:55:55,196 --> 00:55:57,490
Mr. Jameson, your wife's on line one.
She needs to know if you...

756
00:55:57,514 --> 00:55:58,957
Mr. Jameson, there's a page six problem.

757
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,628
We have a page one problem. Shut up.

758
00:56:00,759 --> 00:56:02,299
Well?
He's news.

759
00:56:02,814 --> 00:56:05,373
They're really important clients.
They can't wait. They're about to.

760
00:56:05,397 --> 00:56:07,802
He pulled six people off that subway car.

761
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:09,479
Sure, from a wreck he probably caused.

762
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:11,456
Something goes wrong
and this creepy crawler is there.

763
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,813
Look at that. He's fleeing the scene!
What's that tell ya?

764
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:16,730
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

765
00:56:16,758 --> 00:56:18,039
He's a hero!

766
00:56:18,064 --> 00:56:19,222
Then why does he wear a mask?

767
00:56:19,996 --> 00:56:21,005
What's he got to hide?

768
00:56:21,064 --> 00:56:24,023
She just needs to know if you want the
chintz or the chenille in the dining room.

769
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,094
Whichever one's cheaper.

770
00:56:25,117 --> 00:56:26,747
Mr. Jameson, it's like this.

771
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,362
We double-booked page six.

772
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:30,731
See, so both Macy's and Conway's
both have three quarters...

773
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:32,718
We sold out four printings.

774
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:34,330
Sold out?

775
00:56:34,355 --> 00:56:35,604
Every copy.

776
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:38,688
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,
page one with a decent picture this time.

777
00:56:38,712 --> 00:56:40,453
Move Conway to page 7.
There's a problem with page 7...

778
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:43,040
And make it page eight, get him
10 percent off. Make it five percent.

779
00:56:43,064 --> 00:56:44,479
That can't be done.
Get outta here!

780
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:46,989
The problem is,
we don't have a decent picture.

781
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:49,865
Eddie's been on it for weeks,
we can barely get a glimpse of him.

782
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:51,425
What is he, shy?

783
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:56,106
If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a
thong, we can surely get a picture with this weirdo.

784
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,468
Put an ad on the front page.

785
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:59,315
Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man.

786
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,260
He doesn't wanna be famous?

787
00:57:01,813 --> 00:57:03,438
I'll make him infamous!

788
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:15,646
Hey!

789
00:57:15,897 --> 00:57:16,896
Buzz off.

790
00:57:18,023 --> 00:57:19,551
MJ, it's me, Peter.

791
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:20,574
Hi!

792
00:57:20,622 --> 00:57:21,621
Hey.

793
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,856
What are you doing around here?

794
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,341
I'm begging for a job.
How about you?

795
00:57:28,064 --> 00:57:29,510
I'm headed to an audition.

796
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:30,533
An audition?

797
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:31,968
So you're acting now?

798
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:33,086
Yeah.

799
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,468
I work steady.

800
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:37,063
In fact, I just got off a job.

801
00:57:37,324 --> 00:57:38,490
That's great, MJ!

802
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:40,010
You're doing it!

803
00:57:40,197 --> 00:57:41,875
You're living your dream!
Hey, glamour girl!

804
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:43,980
Yeah.
Your drawer was short $6!

805
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:45,301
Next time that happens,

806
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:46,771
I'mma take it out of your check.

807
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:49,343
Excuse me, Miss Watson?

808
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:50,760
I'm talking to you!

809
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:51,783
Hey!

810
00:57:51,856 --> 00:57:54,074
Yes, Enrique! Ok? I get you.

811
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,760
Well, it better not happen
no more, you hear me?

812
00:57:55,784 --> 00:57:57,390
Don't roll your eyes at me.

813
00:58:05,397 --> 00:58:06,405
Some dream?

814
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:09,854
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

815
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:11,843
Don't tell Harry.

816
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:13,054
Don't tell Harry?

817
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:15,510
Aren't you guys living together?

818
00:58:15,855 --> 00:58:17,401
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

819
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:20,024
Yeah. Right.

820
00:58:20,814 --> 00:58:23,896
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

821
00:58:24,064 --> 00:58:25,677
He'd think it was low or something.

822
00:58:25,979 --> 00:58:27,010
It's not low.

823
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,479
You have a job.

824
00:58:28,814 --> 00:58:29,984
You know Harry...

825
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:33,146
doesn't live on a little place
I like to call Earth.

826
00:58:34,647 --> 00:58:36,485
No, I guess not.

827
00:58:41,564 --> 00:58:42,751
Thanks, Pete.

828
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:45,966
We should catch up sometime.

829
00:58:50,587 --> 00:58:52,194
Let's get some lunch some evening.

830
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,635
Well I...

831
00:58:55,822 --> 00:58:58,866
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

832
00:58:59,188 --> 00:59:00,468
And I won't tell Harry.

833
00:59:00,492 --> 00:59:01,896
No, don't tell Harry.

834
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,071
I won't!

835
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,852
I won't tell Harry.

836
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,332
Timing's perfect. Hey.

837
00:59:21,188 --> 00:59:22,468
Five new contracts.

838
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:23,587
It'll be great.

839
00:59:26,832 --> 00:59:29,336
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

840
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,990
Spent half of it on the phone.

841
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:35,385
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help.

842
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:36,792
I'm really lost here.

843
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:39,625
Are you alright?

844
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:42,468
You look like you just got,

845
00:59:42,492 --> 00:59:44,331
second place in the science fair.

846
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:45,611
No I...

847
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,855
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

848
00:59:49,952 --> 00:59:51,012
You were late again?

849
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,229
I don't get it.

850
00:59:53,962 --> 00:59:55,360
Wait, where do you go all the time?

851
00:59:56,355 --> 00:59:57,354
Around.

852
00:59:57,889 --> 00:59:58,888
Peter Parker.

853
00:59:59,814 --> 01:00:01,551
Maybe you'll tell me who she is.

854
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:02,525
Who's that?

855
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,646
This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
Dad.

856
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,604
When do I get to meet her?
Dad.

857
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:09,901
Well sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her.

858
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:15,843
Hey Pete, you're probably looking for a...

859
01:00:16,052 --> 01:00:17,239
a job now, right?

860
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:18,966
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

861
01:00:20,397 --> 01:00:23,551
No I... I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
It's no problem.

862
01:00:23,676 --> 01:00:24,831
I'll make a few calls.

863
01:00:24,856 --> 01:00:26,385
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.

864
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:29,146
I like to earn what I get.
I can find my own work.

865
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:30,354
I respect that.

866
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,773
You want to make
it on your own steam.

867
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:35,591
That's great.

868
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:38,518
What other skills do you have, Parker?

869
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:41,643
I was thinking of something in photography.

870
01:00:44,355 --> 01:00:45,354
Hello.

871
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:48,521
Let's go!

872
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,689
Move it!

873
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,018
Watch the street!

874
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,063
Cheese!

875
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:19,355
They're crap.

876
01:01:19,856 --> 01:01:20,855
Crap.

877
01:01:20,893 --> 01:01:22,524
Crap. Megacrap.

878
01:01:23,023 --> 01:01:24,551
I'll give you $200 for all of them.

879
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,214
That seems a little low.

880
01:01:26,397 --> 01:01:27,643
Take them somewhere else, then.

881
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:31,111
Sir, your wife says the tile you
ordered for the foyer is out of stock.

882
01:01:31,381 --> 01:01:32,820
Tell her we'll just put a rug there.

883
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:33,843
Sit down.

884
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:34,866
Give me that.

885
01:01:36,564 --> 01:01:37,635
Give you 300.

886
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:39,104
That's the standard freelance fee.

887
01:01:39,272 --> 01:01:41,218
Tear up page one.
Run that photo instead.

888
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:42,002
Headline?

889
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,927
Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?

890
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,330
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos.

891
01:01:45,355 --> 01:01:46,176
Menace?

892
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,539
He was protecting that armoured...
Tell you what, Atticus.

893
01:01:48,564 --> 01:01:50,176
You take the pictures,
I'll make up the headlines. Ok?

894
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,373
Alright? That ok with you?

895
01:01:51,517 --> 01:01:52,927
Yes, sir.
Goody.

896
01:01:53,897 --> 01:01:55,176
Give this to the girl up front.

897
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,558
She'll see you get paid.

898
01:01:57,592 --> 01:01:58,718
I'd like a job, sir.

899
01:01:58,742 --> 01:02:00,468
No jobs. Freelance.

900
01:02:00,684 --> 01:02:02,411
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

901
01:02:02,689 --> 01:02:05,389
You bring me some more shots
of that newspaper-selling clown,

902
01:02:05,414 --> 01:02:06,853
maybe I'll take them off your hands.

903
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:08,468
But I never said you have a job.

904
01:02:09,097 --> 01:02:10,096
Meat.

905
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:11,802
I'll send you a nice box
of Christmas meat,

906
01:02:11,826 --> 01:02:13,094
best I can do. Get outta here.

907
01:02:13,117 --> 01:02:14,604
Bring me more photos.

908
01:02:16,188 --> 01:02:17,532
Hi.
Hi.

909
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:20,014
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

910
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,635
Welcome to the Daily Bugle.

911
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:24,774
Thank you.

912
01:02:25,772 --> 01:02:27,146
I'm Peter Parker.

913
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:30,940
I'm a photographer.

914
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:33,604
Yes.

915
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:34,907
I can see that.

916
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:44,482
As of today,

917
01:02:44,856 --> 01:02:46,301
OSCORP lndustries,

918
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:48,987
has surpassed Quest Aerospace

919
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:52,381
as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

920
01:02:53,689 --> 01:02:55,940
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

921
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,010
costs are down,

922
01:02:58,546 --> 01:02:59,710
revenues are up,

923
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:01,134
and our stock,

924
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:02,721
has never been higher.

925
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:04,468
Wonderful news Norman.

926
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:05,491
Wonderful.

927
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:07,590
In fact, it's the reason
for selling the company.

928
01:03:08,605 --> 01:03:09,269
What?

929
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:12,510
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing.

930
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:14,160
Expanding.

931
01:03:15,188 --> 01:03:17,563
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

932
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:19,271
Why wasn't I told?

933
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:21,885
Last thing they want
is a power struggle,

934
01:03:22,223 --> 01:03:23,675
with entrenched management.

935
01:03:24,074 --> 01:03:25,978
The deal is off if you come with it.

936
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:29,154
The board expects
your resignation in 30 days.

937
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:31,932
You can't do this to me.

938
01:03:34,873 --> 01:03:36,795
I started this company.

939
01:03:38,355 --> 01:03:40,556
You know how much I sacrificed?

940
01:03:44,605 --> 01:03:45,604
Max.

941
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:47,069
Please.
Norman,

942
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,511
the board is unanimous.

943
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:53,866
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

944
01:03:54,772 --> 01:03:55,817
I'm sorry.

945
01:03:57,272 --> 01:03:58,666
You're out, Norman.

946
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:10,395
Am I?

947
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:18,021
Welcome to OSCORP lndustries
Unity Day Festival!

948
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:20,725
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

949
01:04:57,897 --> 01:04:58,896
MJ,

950
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,396
why didn't you wear the black dress?

951
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:04,510
Just, I wanted to impress my father.

952
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,104
He loves black.

953
01:05:06,272 --> 01:05:08,635
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what.

954
01:05:09,617 --> 01:05:10,888
You think I'm pretty.

955
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:12,762
I think you're beautiful.

956
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,718
MJ, would you do me a favor?

957
01:05:27,742 --> 01:05:29,982
I... forgot my drink inside.
Come on.

958
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:41,343
Hi, Mr. Fargas.

959
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:42,366
Harry.

960
01:05:43,188 --> 01:05:44,760
Have you seen my father around?

961
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:48,526
Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.

962
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:01,385
What is that?

963
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:03,119
Must be new this year.

964
01:06:08,144 --> 01:06:09,143
What is that?

965
01:06:09,224 --> 01:06:10,306
That's our glider!

966
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,008
What the hell was that?

967
01:06:51,314 --> 01:06:52,730
Code three! Code three!

968
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:11,112
Oh my God! Harry!
MJ!

969
01:07:16,856 --> 01:07:19,329
Harry! Help me! Harry!

970
01:07:25,867 --> 01:07:27,616
Out, am I?

971
01:07:32,564 --> 01:07:33,593
Mary Jane!

972
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:34,616
Harry!

973
01:07:37,772 --> 01:07:39,510
Hello, my dear.

974
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:41,841
It's Spider-Man!

975
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:55,010
Come on, move, kid.

976
01:07:55,034 --> 01:07:56,033
Billy!

977
01:07:59,439 --> 01:08:01,363
Somebody help him!

978
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:03,229
No!

979
01:08:05,023 --> 01:08:06,022
Mommy!

980
01:08:08,564 --> 01:08:09,677
Hold it right there!

981
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:10,929
I surrender.

982
01:08:11,035 --> 01:08:11,885
Boy.

983
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:12,909
Hold it right there!

984
01:08:19,771 --> 01:08:20,771
Impressive.

985
01:08:44,897 --> 01:08:45,986
Mary Jane!

986
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:47,134
Help!

987
01:08:47,158 --> 01:08:48,596
Someone please help me!

988
01:09:13,689 --> 01:09:14,688
Hold on!

989
01:09:16,397 --> 01:09:17,396
Watch out!

990
01:09:26,522 --> 01:09:28,094
We'll meet again,

991
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:29,987
Spider-Man!

992
01:09:31,897 --> 01:09:33,008
Hold on, Mary Jane!

993
01:10:15,772 --> 01:10:16,426
Well,

994
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:18,004
beats taking the subway.

995
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:20,907
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

996
01:10:21,829 --> 01:10:22,828
Wait.

997
01:10:23,355 --> 01:10:24,354
Who are you?

998
01:10:24,772 --> 01:10:26,134
You know who I am.

999
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:27,305
I do?

1000
01:10:27,517 --> 01:10:29,264
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1001
01:10:41,897 --> 01:10:42,896
Incredible?

1002
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:45,290
What do you mean he's incredible?

1003
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,551
No. Alright, wait.

1004
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,966
Stay there. I'm gonna come over.

1005
01:10:51,272 --> 01:10:52,485
No, I'm gonna come o...

1006
01:10:53,272 --> 01:10:54,343
Alright. Fine.

1007
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:56,349
Fine, will you call me in the morning,
and, and...

1008
01:10:56,897 --> 01:10:58,511
we'll go and have breakfast and...

1009
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:01,274
I wanna buy you something.

1010
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:04,633
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

1011
01:11:06,856 --> 01:11:07,855
Ok.

1012
01:11:08,105 --> 01:11:09,104
And...

1013
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:10,626
what do you mean, incredible?

1014
01:11:13,355 --> 01:11:14,343
Alright. I'm sorry.

1015
01:11:14,367 --> 01:11:15,366
Sleep tight.

1016
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,199
Don't let the bedbugs...

1017
01:11:23,397 --> 01:11:24,593
She's alright.
She's...

1018
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:26,136
just a little rattled.

1019
01:11:27,798 --> 01:11:30,592
Look Pete, I should have
told you about us.

1020
01:11:33,064 --> 01:11:34,845
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

1021
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:37,636
It's just you know,
you never made a move.

1022
01:11:39,981 --> 01:11:40,980
You're right.

1023
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:43,396
I didn't.

1024
01:11:47,834 --> 01:11:49,530
I'm gonna get some rest.

1025
01:11:51,564 --> 01:11:53,276
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

1026
01:11:54,897 --> 01:11:56,117
What was that thing?

1027
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,229
I don't know.

1028
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:02,141
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

1029
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:20,393
Somebody there?

1030
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:22,781
Somebody?

1031
01:12:24,522 --> 01:12:25,567
Who said that?

1032
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:29,414
Don't play the innocent with me.

1033
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:34,565
You've known all along.

1034
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,319
Where are you?

1035
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:44,401
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

1036
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:52,658
I'm right here.

1037
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:56,419
I don't understand.

1038
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:01,196
Did you think it was coincidence?

1039
01:13:01,647 --> 01:13:05,372
So many good things,
all happening for you.

1040
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:06,969
All for you,

1041
01:13:07,401 --> 01:13:08,642
Norman.

1042
01:13:11,564 --> 01:13:12,563
What do you want?

1043
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,432
To say what you won't.

1044
01:13:15,856 --> 01:13:17,956
To do what you can't.

1045
01:13:18,564 --> 01:13:19,969
To remove...

1046
01:13:20,257 --> 01:13:22,326
those in your way.

1047
01:13:27,105 --> 01:13:28,303
The board members.

1048
01:13:30,758 --> 01:13:31,757
You killed them.

1049
01:13:31,897 --> 01:13:33,294
We killed them.

1050
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:34,855
We?

1051
01:13:35,023 --> 01:13:36,061
Remember?

1052
01:13:36,731 --> 01:13:39,396
Your little accident in the laboratory.

1053
01:13:41,397 --> 01:13:43,022
The performance enhancers.

1054
01:13:43,188 --> 01:13:44,094
Bingo.

1055
01:13:44,117 --> 01:13:45,116
Me!

1056
01:13:45,744 --> 01:13:47,797
Your greatest creation.

1057
01:13:48,731 --> 01:13:52,018
Bringing you what you've always wanted.

1058
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:55,686
Power, beyond your wildest dreams.

1059
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,653
And it's only the beginning.

1060
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,259
There's only one...

1061
01:14:02,173 --> 01:14:03,656
who can stop us.

1062
01:14:04,856 --> 01:14:07,754
Or imagine if he joined us.

1063
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:14,176
Spider-Man.

1064
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,229
And the Green Goblin.

1065
01:14:16,397 --> 01:14:17,885
The Green Goblin. You like that?

1066
01:14:17,909 --> 01:14:19,347
Made it up myself.
Mr. Jameson.

1067
01:14:19,662 --> 01:14:21,509
These weirdos all gotta have a name now.

1068
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:22,883
Mr. Jameson, Spider-Ma...

1069
01:14:22,908 --> 01:14:23,907
Hoffman!
Yeah?

1070
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:27,969
Call the patent office,
copyright the name Green Goblin,

1071
01:14:27,993 --> 01:14:29,751
I want a quarter every
time somebody says it.

1072
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:31,198
How about Green Meanie?

1073
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,969
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.

1074
01:14:33,993 --> 01:14:35,373
He was trying to save it. That's slander.

1075
01:14:35,397 --> 01:14:37,247
It is not. I resent that.

1076
01:14:37,731 --> 01:14:38,969
Slander is spoken.

1077
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,272
In print, it's libel.

1078
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,793
You don't trust anybody,
that's your problem.

1079
01:14:43,023 --> 01:14:44,221
I trust my barber.

1080
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:47,263
What are you, his lawyer?
Get outta here.

1081
01:14:47,314 --> 01:14:49,438
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

1082
01:14:49,605 --> 01:14:50,884
That's what made this country...

1083
01:14:59,564 --> 01:15:00,593
Jameson,

1084
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:02,172
you slime.

1085
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:06,259
Who's the photographer
who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

1086
01:15:06,397 --> 01:15:08,495
I don't know who he is.
His stuff comes in the mail.

1087
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,313
You're lying!
I swear.

1088
01:15:10,425 --> 01:15:12,780
He's the one who can bring me to him.

1089
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:14,052
I don't know who he is.

1090
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,708
You are useless.

1091
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:17,456
Set him down tough guy.

1092
01:15:18,272 --> 01:15:19,697
Speak of the devil!

1093
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:22,010
Spider-Man, I knew you two
were in this together!

1094
01:15:22,034 --> 01:15:22,670
I...

1095
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:25,675
Hey kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?

1096
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,157
Sleep...

1097
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,510
Wake up little spider.

1098
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:46,252
Wake up.

1099
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:47,938
No,

1100
01:15:48,272 --> 01:15:49,802
you're not dead...

1101
01:15:50,137 --> 01:15:51,136
yet.

1102
01:15:51,564 --> 01:15:53,532
Just paralyzed...

1103
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:55,280
temporarily.

1104
01:15:56,856 --> 01:15:59,603
You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.

1105
01:16:00,327 --> 01:16:02,898
You and I are not so different.

1106
01:16:03,451 --> 01:16:04,593
I'm not like you.

1107
01:16:05,518 --> 01:16:06,784
You're a murderer.

1108
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:08,063
Well,

1109
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:09,601
to each his own.

1110
01:16:10,105 --> 01:16:11,635
I chose my path,

1111
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:13,227
you chose the way of the hero.

1112
01:16:13,731 --> 01:16:16,134
And they found you amusing
for a while,

1113
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:18,043
the people of this city.

1114
01:16:18,564 --> 01:16:21,553
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

1115
01:16:22,023 --> 01:16:23,760
is to see a hero fail,

1116
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:24,593
fall,

1117
01:16:24,617 --> 01:16:25,616
die trying.

1118
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:28,468
In spite of everything you've done for
them,

1119
01:16:28,492 --> 01:16:30,133
eventually, they will hate you.

1120
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:31,438
Why bother?

1121
01:16:32,177 --> 01:16:33,677
Because it's right.

1122
01:16:34,104 --> 01:16:35,838
Here's the real truth.

1123
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:39,521
There are eight million
people in this city.

1124
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:44,396
And those teeming masses
exist for the sole purpose

1125
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:48,563
of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

1126
01:16:49,059 --> 01:16:50,058
You, me,

1127
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:52,019
we're exceptional.

1128
01:16:52,897 --> 01:16:57,563
I could squash you
like a bug right now.

1129
01:16:57,772 --> 01:16:59,677
But I'm offering you a choice.

1130
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:01,579
Join me.

1131
01:17:01,605 --> 01:17:04,991
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

1132
01:17:05,397 --> 01:17:07,496
What we could create.

1133
01:17:08,731 --> 01:17:10,361
Or we could destroy.

1134
01:17:11,018 --> 01:17:14,322
Because the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish

1135
01:17:14,346 --> 01:17:17,182
battle again and again and
again until we're both dead.

1136
01:17:17,755 --> 01:17:19,565
Is that what you want?

1137
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:23,835
Think about it, hero.

1138
01:17:36,772 --> 01:17:39,343
In spite of everything
you've done for them,

1139
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:41,403
eventually they will hate you.

1140
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,229
Hey!

1141
01:17:52,397 --> 01:17:53,301
It's me again.

1142
01:17:53,325 --> 01:17:54,091
Hey!

1143
01:17:54,272 --> 01:17:55,433
How was your audition?

1144
01:17:55,897 --> 01:17:56,927
How'd you know?

1145
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,492
The hot line. Your mom

1146
01:17:59,064 --> 01:18:00,599
told my aunt, told me.

1147
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,898
So you just came by?

1148
01:18:03,023 --> 01:18:04,468
I was in the neighborhood.

1149
01:18:04,492 --> 01:18:06,175
Needed to see a friendly face.

1150
01:18:06,814 --> 01:18:10,521
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

1151
01:18:11,647 --> 01:18:12,714
So how'd it go?

1152
01:18:15,314 --> 01:18:17,434
They said I needed acting lessons.

1153
01:18:18,008 --> 01:18:20,232
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

1154
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:23,510
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.

1155
01:18:24,011 --> 01:18:26,052
The sky's the limit, up to $7

1156
01:18:26,606 --> 01:18:27,844
84 cents.

1157
01:18:28,647 --> 01:18:30,222
I'd like a cheeseburger.

1158
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,593
But, I'm going out to dinner with Harry.

1159
01:18:35,064 --> 01:18:36,063
Come with us.

1160
01:18:36,647 --> 01:18:37,646
No, thanks.

1161
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:39,560
How's it going with...

1162
01:18:41,314 --> 01:18:42,162
Never mind.

1163
01:18:42,187 --> 01:18:43,758
That's none of my business.

1164
01:18:44,314 --> 01:18:45,313
It's not?

1165
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,448
Why so interested?

1166
01:18:49,564 --> 01:18:50,563
I'm not.

1167
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:52,313
You're not?

1168
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,802
Well, why would I be?

1169
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:56,963
I don't know.

1170
01:18:57,244 --> 01:18:58,500
Why would you be?

1171
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:02,065
I, that's a...

1172
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,492
I don't know.

1173
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:08,933
Sorry you won't come with us.

1174
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:13,928
I better run, tiger.

1175
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:24,100
Hey, check it out, man.

1176
01:19:25,339 --> 01:19:26,338
Come on, man.

1177
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:32,506
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

1178
01:19:51,548 --> 01:19:52,586
Get off me!

1179
01:20:26,225 --> 01:20:27,224
Wait!

1180
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:34,768
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

1181
01:20:35,272 --> 01:20:37,218
You have a knack for saving my life.

1182
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:39,755
I think I have a superhero stalker.

1183
01:20:39,856 --> 01:20:41,533
I was in the neighborhood.

1184
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:44,604
You are...

1185
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:45,886
amazing.

1186
01:20:47,188 --> 01:20:48,623
Some people don't think so.

1187
01:20:50,981 --> 01:20:51,980
But you are.

1188
01:20:52,535 --> 01:20:53,980
Nice to have a fan.

1189
01:20:54,731 --> 01:20:56,696
Do I get to say thank you this time?

1190
01:20:58,814 --> 01:20:59,813
Wait.

1191
01:22:08,926 --> 01:22:10,885
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!

1192
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:12,218
My baby's in there! Let me go!

1193
01:22:12,242 --> 01:22:13,842
I can't let you in there,
the roof's about to collapse!

1194
01:22:13,866 --> 01:22:15,510
Please save my baby!
I can't let you in there,

1195
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:17,498
Somebody save my baby!
The roof's about to collapse!

1196
01:22:17,522 --> 01:22:18,855
Look! Up there!

1197
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:27,313
Save my baby, please!

1198
01:22:50,981 --> 01:22:51,980
No!

1199
01:22:59,856 --> 01:23:01,218
It's ok. Your baby's fine.

1200
01:23:01,697 --> 01:23:02,907
My baby!

1201
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,510
God bless you, Spider-Man.

1202
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:07,933
Bless you.

1203
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:09,771
There he's! Don't let him get away!

1204
01:23:09,981 --> 01:23:11,385
Hold it! Hold it right there!

1205
01:23:11,664 --> 01:23:13,295
You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.

1206
01:23:13,342 --> 01:23:15,489
My God, there's
somebody still up there!

1207
01:23:17,897 --> 01:23:18,896
I'm going.

1208
01:23:21,188 --> 01:23:22,760
I'll be here when you get back.

1209
01:23:22,784 --> 01:23:24,229
Not coming back, chief.

1210
01:23:24,647 --> 01:23:25,771
Go! Go!

1211
01:23:34,689 --> 01:23:35,719
Where are you?

1212
01:23:38,403 --> 01:23:39,707
Where are you?

1213
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:46,685
I'm gonna get you out of here!

1214
01:23:50,355 --> 01:23:51,354
It's ok.

1215
01:23:58,897 --> 01:24:01,091
You're pathetically predictable.

1216
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:03,331
Like a moth to the flame.

1217
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,896
What about my generous proposal?

1218
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:09,094
Are you in

1219
01:24:09,117 --> 01:24:10,425
or are you out?

1220
01:24:10,981 --> 01:24:12,551
It's you who's out, Gobby.

1221
01:24:12,843 --> 01:24:13,842
Out of your mind.

1222
01:24:14,059 --> 01:24:15,361
Wrong answer.

1223
01:24:17,314 --> 01:24:18,313
Great.

1224
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:59,636
No one says no to me!

1225
01:25:07,564 --> 01:25:09,510
MJ, will you stop goofing around?

1226
01:25:09,534 --> 01:25:10,980
Harry, relax.

1227
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,730
He's here.

1228
01:25:15,522 --> 01:25:16,521
Are you ready?

1229
01:25:16,872 --> 01:25:17,871
Yeah.

1230
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,927
Aunt May.

1231
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:21,364
I'm sorry I'm late.

1232
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:22,843
Work was murder.

1233
01:25:23,514 --> 01:25:24,998
I picked up a fruitcake.

1234
01:25:25,023 --> 01:25:26,195
Why thank you Mr. Osborn.

1235
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:27,500
We're so glad you could come.
You look great.

1236
01:25:27,524 --> 01:25:28,523
Thanks.

1237
01:25:28,689 --> 01:25:30,638
Who is this lovely young lady?

1238
01:25:31,564 --> 01:25:33,760
MJ, I'd like you to meet
my father, Norman Osborn.

1239
01:25:33,784 --> 01:25:35,485
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

1240
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:36,843
Hi.
How do you do?

1241
01:25:36,867 --> 01:25:38,786
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

1242
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:40,301
Happy Thanksgiving, sir.

1243
01:25:40,325 --> 01:25:42,646
Now, where is Peter?

1244
01:25:43,025 --> 01:25:45,230
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

1245
01:25:50,902 --> 01:25:51,677
That's...

1246
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:53,329
weird, I didn't know he was here.

1247
01:25:57,522 --> 01:25:58,521
Peter?

1248
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,749
Peter?

1249
01:26:07,064 --> 01:26:08,150
Is that you?

1250
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:13,200
Pete?

1251
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:15,593
How strange.

1252
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:17,048
There's nobody here.

1253
01:26:24,856 --> 01:26:26,343
Bit of a slob, isn't he?

1254
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:28,559
All brilliant men are.

1255
01:27:02,037 --> 01:27:03,052
Hey, everyone.

1256
01:27:03,762 --> 01:27:04,552
Peter!

1257
01:27:04,577 --> 01:27:06,523
Peter!
Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.

1258
01:27:06,548 --> 01:27:09,211
Had to beat an old lady with
a stick to get these cranberries.

1259
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:12,010
Thank you.

1260
01:27:12,034 --> 01:27:13,813
Now then, everybody sit down

1261
01:27:14,051 --> 01:27:15,633
and we can say grace.

1262
01:27:17,038 --> 01:27:18,037
Parker.

1263
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:20,855
Here we go.

1264
01:27:27,814 --> 01:27:28,927
There we are.

1265
01:27:28,951 --> 01:27:30,514
It looks delicious.

1266
01:27:30,647 --> 01:27:31,646
Norman.

1267
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:35,360
Will you do the honors?

1268
01:27:47,897 --> 01:27:49,176
Why Peter,

1269
01:27:49,285 --> 01:27:50,875
you're bleeding.

1270
01:27:53,864 --> 01:27:54,863
Yeah.

1271
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:56,968
I stepped off a kerb and...

1272
01:27:57,409 --> 01:27:59,313
got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

1273
01:27:59,449 --> 01:28:00,859
Well, let me see.

1274
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:02,813
Oh my goodness.

1275
01:28:02,981 --> 01:28:05,296
That looks awful.
No, it's nothing.

1276
01:28:05,564 --> 01:28:07,176
I'll get the first-aid kit.

1277
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:08,872
Then we'll say grace.

1278
01:28:08,897 --> 01:28:11,677
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
in this apartment

1279
01:28:11,701 --> 01:28:14,223
and we
are going to do things properly.

1280
01:28:15,147 --> 01:28:17,183
How did you say that happened?

1281
01:28:18,647 --> 01:28:19,739
Bike messenger.

1282
01:28:20,564 --> 01:28:21,776
Knocked me down.

1283
01:28:27,897 --> 01:28:29,593
If you'll excuse me I've...

1284
01:28:29,796 --> 01:28:31,643
got to be going.
Wh... Why?

1285
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,593
Something...

1286
01:28:33,994 --> 01:28:35,703
has come to my attention.

1287
01:28:36,064 --> 01:28:37,063
Are you alright?

1288
01:28:37,443 --> 01:28:38,927
I'm fine, just fine.

1289
01:28:38,951 --> 01:28:41,283
Thank you, Mrs. Parker.
Everyone.

1290
01:28:41,647 --> 01:28:42,718
Enjoy the fruitcake.

1291
01:28:42,898 --> 01:28:43,897
Dad!

1292
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,349
Dad!

1293
01:28:46,466 --> 01:28:47,465
What are you doing?

1294
01:28:47,746 --> 01:28:50,282
I plan this whole thing so you can
meet MJ and now you have to leave?

1295
01:28:50,306 --> 01:28:51,312
I've got to go.

1296
01:28:52,352 --> 01:28:53,843
This girl is important to me.

1297
01:28:53,867 --> 01:28:56,261
Harry, please. Look at her.

1298
01:28:56,623 --> 01:29:00,484
Do you think a woman like that's sniffing
around because she likes your personality?

1299
01:29:00,731 --> 01:29:01,730
What are you saying?

1300
01:29:02,227 --> 01:29:03,768
Your mother was beautiful too.

1301
01:29:03,793 --> 01:29:04,959
They're all beautiful.

1302
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:09,313
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

1303
01:29:09,522 --> 01:29:10,813
You're wrong about her, Dad.

1304
01:29:11,314 --> 01:29:14,479
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend.

1305
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:17,354
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

1306
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:30,744
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

1307
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:32,688
You heard?

1308
01:29:33,226 --> 01:29:34,457
Everyone heard that creep.

1309
01:29:34,543 --> 01:29:36,259
That creep is my father.

1310
01:29:36,283 --> 01:29:38,702
Alright, If I'm lucky, I'll
become half of what he is.

1311
01:29:38,981 --> 01:29:41,418
So just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand!

1312
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:43,330
Harry Osborn!

1313
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,259
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1314
01:29:49,067 --> 01:29:52,399
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

1315
01:29:52,731 --> 01:29:53,968
But Parker,

1316
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,217
we can destroy him.

1317
01:29:56,504 --> 01:29:57,503
I can't.

1318
01:29:57,564 --> 01:30:00,389
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

1319
01:30:00,814 --> 01:30:01,593
Parker...

1320
01:30:01,617 --> 01:30:03,063
must be educated.

1321
01:30:05,868 --> 01:30:06,706
What do I do?

1322
01:30:06,731 --> 01:30:10,534
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

1323
01:30:10,981 --> 01:30:12,218
Make him suffer.

1324
01:30:12,313 --> 01:30:14,303
Make him wish he were dead.

1325
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:15,563
Yes?

1326
01:30:15,731 --> 01:30:17,646
And then grant his wish.

1327
01:30:18,885 --> 01:30:19,884
But how?

1328
01:30:20,064 --> 01:30:24,354
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

1329
01:30:24,564 --> 01:30:25,730
Tell me how!

1330
01:30:25,897 --> 01:30:28,063
The heart, Osborn.

1331
01:30:28,314 --> 01:30:31,354
First, we attack his heart.

1332
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:36,837
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses

1333
01:30:37,109 --> 01:30:39,920
as we forgive those who
trespassed against us.

1334
01:30:40,188 --> 01:30:43,213
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

1335
01:30:51,902 --> 01:30:54,442
Deliver us!

1336
01:30:54,628 --> 01:30:55,812
Finish it!

1337
01:30:56,147 --> 01:30:57,176
Finish it!

1338
01:30:57,201 --> 01:30:59,574
From evil!

1339
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:10,980
Get the BP.

1340
01:31:11,318 --> 01:31:12,317
Aunt May!

1341
01:31:12,481 --> 01:31:13,551
Is she gonna be ok?

1342
01:31:13,575 --> 01:31:15,414
What happened? What happened?
Yes, she's going to be ok.

1343
01:31:15,438 --> 01:31:16,484
Look, you're going to have to leave.

1344
01:31:16,508 --> 01:31:17,385
Right now.
What happened?

1345
01:31:17,502 --> 01:31:18,673
Those eyes!

1346
01:31:18,753 --> 01:31:21,213
Those horrible yellow eyes!

1347
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,838
He knows who I am.

1348
01:32:13,939 --> 01:32:14,938
I'm sorry.

1349
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:20,408
Will she be ok?

1350
01:32:20,433 --> 01:32:21,774
She's gonna be fine.

1351
01:32:21,799 --> 01:32:23,452
She's been sleeping all day.

1352
01:32:25,522 --> 01:32:26,593
Thanks for coming.

1353
01:32:27,186 --> 01:32:28,214
Of course.

1354
01:32:32,439 --> 01:32:33,438
How are you?

1355
01:32:33,732 --> 01:32:35,471
You ok about the other night?

1356
01:32:35,496 --> 01:32:36,495
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

1357
01:32:37,212 --> 01:32:39,161
I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

1358
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:40,551
Have you talked to Harry?

1359
01:32:40,904 --> 01:32:41,903
He called me.

1360
01:32:43,043 --> 01:32:44,396
I haven't called him back.

1361
01:32:47,105 --> 01:32:48,231
The fact is...

1362
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:51,802
I'm in love with somebody else.

1363
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:52,813
You are?

1364
01:32:52,918 --> 01:32:54,209
At least, I think I am.

1365
01:32:56,856 --> 01:32:58,869
It's not the right time to talk about it.
No, no.

1366
01:32:58,894 --> 01:32:59,893
Go on.

1367
01:33:00,064 --> 01:33:02,287
Would I know his name, this guy?

1368
01:33:03,825 --> 01:33:05,877
You'll think I'm a stupid
little girl with a crush.

1369
01:33:06,564 --> 01:33:07,586
Trust me.

1370
01:33:08,188 --> 01:33:09,264
It's funny.

1371
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:13,301
He's saved my life twice,

1372
01:33:13,325 --> 01:33:15,059
and I've never even seen his face.

1373
01:33:16,284 --> 01:33:17,283
Him.

1374
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:18,939
You're laughing at me.
No. No.

1375
01:33:18,963 --> 01:33:20,301
No, I understand.

1376
01:33:20,811 --> 01:33:22,246
He is extremely cool.

1377
01:33:22,271 --> 01:33:25,189
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

1378
01:33:25,214 --> 01:33:26,176
No, no.

1379
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,130
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

1380
01:33:29,897 --> 01:33:31,119
I know him a little bit.

1381
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:34,124
I'm sort of his
unofficial photographer.

1382
01:33:34,814 --> 01:33:36,385
Has he mentioned me?

1383
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:38,169
Yeah.

1384
01:33:38,272 --> 01:33:39,352
What'd he say?

1385
01:33:40,384 --> 01:33:41,383
I said...

1386
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:44,258
He asked me...

1387
01:33:45,306 --> 01:33:46,633
what I thought about you.

1388
01:33:48,264 --> 01:33:49,411
And what did you say?

1389
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:51,688
I said...

1390
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:56,134
Spider-Man. I said...

1391
01:33:57,537 --> 01:33:59,519
The great thing about MJ...

1392
01:34:00,344 --> 01:34:01,343
Is...

1393
01:34:02,647 --> 01:34:03,646
When you...

1394
01:34:04,018 --> 01:34:05,300
look in her eyes,

1395
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:10,365
and she's looking back in yours,

1396
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:13,802
everything...

1397
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,269
feels...

1398
01:34:16,856 --> 01:34:18,187
Not quite normal.

1399
01:34:19,939 --> 01:34:21,155
Because you feel...

1400
01:34:22,272 --> 01:34:23,403
stronger...

1401
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:26,468
and weaker...

1402
01:34:27,196 --> 01:34:28,507
at the same time.

1403
01:34:30,128 --> 01:34:31,559
You feel excited...

1404
01:34:33,222 --> 01:34:34,626
and at the same time...

1405
01:34:35,772 --> 01:34:36,881
Terrified.

1406
01:34:39,731 --> 01:34:41,301
The truth is you...

1407
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,850
you don't know what you feel,

1408
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:48,034
except you know what
kind of man you want to be.

1409
01:34:51,772 --> 01:34:53,200
It's as if you've...

1410
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:55,271
reached...

1411
01:34:55,627 --> 01:34:57,040
the unreachable...

1412
01:34:59,023 --> 01:35:00,645
and you weren't ready for it.

1413
01:35:05,188 --> 01:35:06,358
You said that?

1414
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:09,598
Well, something like that.

1415
01:35:40,198 --> 01:35:41,197
Hey.

1416
01:35:54,314 --> 01:35:55,313
Dad?

1417
01:36:01,147 --> 01:36:02,602
Dad, is that you?

1418
01:36:09,814 --> 01:36:10,813
What is it?

1419
01:36:13,736 --> 01:36:15,134
Well, you were right about MJ.

1420
01:36:15,999 --> 01:36:17,489
You're right about everything.

1421
01:36:19,704 --> 01:36:21,080
She's in love with Peter.

1422
01:36:22,564 --> 01:36:23,563
Parker?

1423
01:36:23,984 --> 01:36:24,424
Yeah.

1424
01:36:24,694 --> 01:36:26,325
And how does he feel about her?

1425
01:36:29,064 --> 01:36:31,264
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1426
01:36:32,564 --> 01:36:34,218
He pretends like he doesn't, but...

1427
01:36:34,616 --> 01:36:36,457
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1428
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:41,820
I'm so sorry.

1429
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:47,122
I haven't always been
there for you, have I?

1430
01:36:50,147 --> 01:36:52,510
You're busy.
You're an important man. I...

1431
01:36:52,534 --> 01:36:53,533
I understand.

1432
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,002
That's no excuse.

1433
01:36:56,276 --> 01:36:57,647
I'm proud of you.

1434
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:02,195
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'm gonna make it up to you, Harry.

1435
01:37:03,731 --> 01:37:07,120
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

1436
01:37:21,105 --> 01:37:22,784
Wake up, little spider.

1437
01:37:22,993 --> 01:37:24,033
Wake up.

1438
01:37:25,897 --> 01:37:27,271
Go home, dear.

1439
01:37:27,603 --> 01:37:28,936
You look awful.

1440
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:31,521
And you look beautiful.
Well, thank you.

1441
01:37:31,731 --> 01:37:33,104
I don't like to leave you here.

1442
01:37:33,129 --> 01:37:34,603
But I'm safe here.

1443
01:37:35,188 --> 01:37:36,551
Can I do anything for you?

1444
01:37:36,575 --> 01:37:37,896
You do too much.

1445
01:37:38,064 --> 01:37:39,218
College, a job,

1446
01:37:39,433 --> 01:37:42,267
all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1447
01:37:44,355 --> 01:37:46,077
A smile. Finally.

1448
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:49,471
Haven't seen one of those on your
face since Mary Jane was here.

1449
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:50,539
Hey.

1450
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:52,599
You were supposed to be asleep.

1451
01:37:53,754 --> 01:37:58,100
You know, you were about 6 years old
when MJ's family moved in next door.

1452
01:37:58,856 --> 01:38:00,426
And when she got out of the car,

1453
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:02,813
and you saw her for the first time,

1454
01:38:02,981 --> 01:38:05,593
you grabbed me and said,
Aunt May,

1455
01:38:05,617 --> 01:38:06,802
Aunt May,

1456
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:09,125
is that an angel?

1457
01:38:09,522 --> 01:38:10,718
Gee, did I say that?

1458
01:38:11,162 --> 01:38:12,591
You sure did.

1459
01:38:15,692 --> 01:38:16,145
Well,

1460
01:38:16,649 --> 01:38:17,961
Harry's in love with her.

1461
01:38:18,689 --> 01:38:20,094
She's still his girl.

1462
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,208
Well, isn't that up to her?

1463
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:24,551
She doesn't really know who I am.

1464
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:26,860
Because you won't let her.

1465
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:29,865
You're so mysterious all the time.

1466
01:38:30,814 --> 01:38:31,813
Tell me,

1467
01:38:32,019 --> 01:38:33,711
would it be so dangerous

1468
01:38:33,736 --> 01:38:36,999
to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1469
01:38:38,147 --> 01:38:40,646
Everybody else knows.

1470
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:44,938
I'll be right back.

1471
01:38:45,605 --> 01:38:46,604
But...

1472
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:55,667
Come on, pick up.

1473
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,279
Hi...
Hey MJ!

1474
01:38:57,304 --> 01:38:58,653
Sing your song at the beep.

1475
01:39:00,731 --> 01:39:02,173
MJ, it's Peter. You there?

1476
01:39:02,915 --> 01:39:03,914
Hello?

1477
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:05,170
You there?

1478
01:39:06,397 --> 01:39:08,279
Well, I'm just calling
to check up on you.

1479
01:39:08,303 --> 01:39:10,048
Will you call me when you get in, ok?

1480
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:11,945
Alright, well...

1481
01:39:12,647 --> 01:39:13,646
Don't...

1482
01:39:14,637 --> 01:39:16,173
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1483
01:39:17,147 --> 01:39:18,146
Hello?

1484
01:39:21,424 --> 01:39:24,062
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1485
01:39:24,981 --> 01:39:26,182
Where is she?

1486
01:40:13,071 --> 01:40:14,736
What is that?
That's cool!

1487
01:40:40,564 --> 01:40:42,271
Goblin, what have you done?

1488
01:41:24,535 --> 01:41:25,593
Spider-Man!

1489
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:28,661
This is why only fools are heroes.

1490
01:41:28,981 --> 01:41:30,689
Because you never know,

1491
01:41:30,772 --> 01:41:34,865
when some lunatic will come
along with a sadistic choice.

1492
01:41:36,647 --> 01:41:39,133
Let die the woman you love?

1493
01:41:43,605 --> 01:41:44,604
Or...

1494
01:41:45,771 --> 01:41:48,350
Suffer the little children.

1495
01:41:50,954 --> 01:41:51,760
Spider-Man!

1496
01:41:51,784 --> 01:41:53,030
Save us!

1497
01:41:54,064 --> 01:41:55,559
Save us!

1498
01:41:56,564 --> 01:41:59,146
Make your choice, Spider-Man.

1499
01:41:59,355 --> 01:42:02,613
And see how a hero is rewarded.

1500
01:42:02,826 --> 01:42:04,081
Don't do it, Goblin!

1501
01:42:05,147 --> 01:42:07,540
We are who we choose to be.

1502
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:09,414
Now, choose!

1503
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:10,492
No!

1504
01:42:39,731 --> 01:42:41,094
Everybody stay still!

1505
01:42:50,814 --> 01:42:51,981
Ahoy up there!

1506
01:42:52,384 --> 01:42:55,299
We're gonna bring
the barge right under you.

1507
01:43:02,949 --> 01:43:03,948
He's coming back!

1508
01:43:04,322 --> 01:43:05,321
Listen.

1509
01:43:05,508 --> 01:43:06,855
I need you to climb down.

1510
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:07,718
I can't.

1511
01:43:07,742 --> 01:43:08,741
Yes, you can!

1512
01:43:13,605 --> 01:43:15,134
MJ, you can do it.

1513
01:43:15,337 --> 01:43:16,336
You have to!

1514
01:43:16,696 --> 01:43:17,695
Trust me.

1515
01:43:19,897 --> 01:43:21,010
Hold on tight

1516
01:43:21,613 --> 01:43:22,612
and go quickly.

1517
01:43:28,064 --> 01:43:29,063
Hurry!

1518
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:30,413
I can't. I can't do it!

1519
01:43:30,438 --> 01:43:31,810
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1520
01:44:00,397 --> 01:44:02,543
He's not gonna make it.
He's gonna make it!

1521
01:44:12,897 --> 01:44:14,756
It's time to die.

1522
01:44:23,105 --> 01:44:25,921
Come on up here, tough guy!
I got a little something for ya!

1523
01:44:25,946 --> 01:44:27,192
We ought to kick your freaking ass!

1524
01:44:27,216 --> 01:44:28,426
Leave Spider-Man alone!

1525
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:30,608
You gonna pick on a guy trying
to save a bunch of kids?

1526
01:44:31,188 --> 01:44:32,932
Yeah, I got something for your ass!

1527
01:44:32,957 --> 01:44:34,831
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1528
01:44:34,856 --> 01:44:37,313
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1529
01:44:50,897 --> 01:44:52,345
Spider-Man, watch out!

1530
01:45:24,522 --> 01:45:26,849
Misery, misery, misery.

1531
01:45:26,874 --> 01:45:28,480
That's what you've chosen.

1532
01:45:29,689 --> 01:45:31,492
I offered you friendship,

1533
01:45:32,378 --> 01:45:34,252
and you spat in my face.

1534
01:46:25,397 --> 01:46:28,519
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1535
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:32,872
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death

1536
01:46:32,897 --> 01:46:34,438
would have been quick and painless.

1537
01:46:34,463 --> 01:46:37,477
But now that
you've really pissed me off,

1538
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:39,968
I'm gonna finish her,

1539
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:43,287
nice and slow.

1540
01:46:47,689 --> 01:46:49,264
MJ and I...

1541
01:46:50,564 --> 01:46:53,659
We're gonna have a hell of a time.

1542
01:47:47,518 --> 01:47:48,807
Peter, stop!

1543
01:47:49,314 --> 01:47:50,313
Stop!

1544
01:47:50,355 --> 01:47:51,452
It's me.

1545
01:48:00,731 --> 01:48:01,902
Mr. Osborn.

1546
01:48:02,253 --> 01:48:03,674
Peter, thank God for you.

1547
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:06,438
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1548
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:08,911
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1549
01:48:09,285 --> 01:48:11,392
Don't, don't let him take me again.

1550
01:48:11,772 --> 01:48:13,813
I beg you. Protect me.

1551
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:16,120
You tried to kill Aunt May.

1552
01:48:16,145 --> 01:48:17,521
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1553
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:18,777
But not you.

1554
01:48:19,897 --> 01:48:21,426
I tried to stop it,

1555
01:48:21,891 --> 01:48:23,663
but I couldn't stop it.

1556
01:48:24,064 --> 01:48:25,551
I would never hurt you.

1557
01:48:26,355 --> 01:48:27,791
I knew from the beginning...

1558
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,702
If anything ever happened to me...

1559
01:48:31,072 --> 01:48:33,379
It was you that I could count on.

1560
01:48:33,897 --> 01:48:37,229
You, Peter Parker,
would save me and so you have.

1561
01:48:37,814 --> 01:48:39,060
Thank God for you.

1562
01:48:40,647 --> 01:48:41,823
Give me your hand.

1563
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:44,301
Believe in me...

1564
01:48:44,684 --> 01:48:46,305
as I believed in you.

1565
01:48:47,766 --> 01:48:49,606
I've been like a father to you.

1566
01:48:52,397 --> 01:48:54,063
Be a son to me now.

1567
01:48:55,856 --> 01:48:57,175
I have a father.

1568
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,438
His name was Ben Parker.

1569
01:49:02,856 --> 01:49:04,854
Godspeed Spider-Man.
What?

1570
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,229
Peter...

1571
01:49:27,064 --> 01:49:28,354
Don't tell Harry.

1572
01:50:00,564 --> 01:50:01,668
What have you done?

1573
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:03,615
What have you done?

1574
01:50:27,272 --> 01:50:28,271
Hey.

1575
01:50:32,147 --> 01:50:33,473
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1576
01:50:35,105 --> 01:50:37,056
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1577
01:50:40,397 --> 01:50:41,593
I didn't lose him.

1578
01:50:41,617 --> 01:50:43,104
He was stolen from me.

1579
01:50:45,272 --> 01:50:46,921
One day, Spider-Man will pay.

1580
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:51,845
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1581
01:50:57,564 --> 01:50:59,111
Thank God for you, Peter.

1582
01:51:00,105 --> 01:51:01,625
You're the only family I have.

1583
01:51:26,954 --> 01:51:28,449
No matter what I do,

1584
01:51:29,389 --> 01:51:31,304
no matter how hard I try,

1585
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,467
the ones I love

1586
01:51:35,152 --> 01:51:37,119
will always be the ones who pay.

1587
01:51:47,772 --> 01:51:49,661
You must miss him so much.

1588
01:51:51,064 --> 01:51:53,095
It's been so hard without him.

1589
01:51:57,023 --> 01:51:59,074
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1590
01:52:01,618 --> 01:52:02,946
When I was up there,

1591
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:05,819
and I thought I was gonna die...

1592
01:52:08,647 --> 01:52:11,087
There was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1593
01:52:13,772 --> 01:52:16,043
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1594
01:52:18,383 --> 01:52:19,757
It was you Pete.

1595
01:52:21,731 --> 01:52:22,996
I kept thinking,

1596
01:52:24,272 --> 01:52:26,227
I hope I make it through this,

1597
01:52:28,272 --> 01:52:31,403
so I could see Peter Parker's
face one more time.

1598
01:52:34,023 --> 01:52:35,022
Really?

1599
01:52:35,897 --> 01:52:37,426
There's only one man,

1600
01:52:38,417 --> 01:52:40,524
who's always been there for me...

1601
01:52:42,939 --> 01:52:44,419
Who makes me feel...

1602
01:52:45,355 --> 01:52:47,813
like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1603
01:52:51,188 --> 01:52:52,379
That I'm just...

1604
01:52:53,522 --> 01:52:54,521
Me.

1605
01:52:56,105 --> 01:52:57,205
And that's ok.

1606
01:52:59,986 --> 01:53:00,985
The truth is,

1607
01:53:03,814 --> 01:53:04,813
I love you.

1608
01:53:07,689 --> 01:53:09,286
I love you so much, Peter.

1609
01:53:30,314 --> 01:53:31,509
All I wanted,

1610
01:53:31,797 --> 01:53:34,084
was to tell
her how much I loved her...

1611
01:53:35,272 --> 01:53:36,271
I can't.

1612
01:53:39,314 --> 01:53:40,380
You can't what?

1613
01:53:41,981 --> 01:53:43,026
Tell you...

1614
01:53:45,147 --> 01:53:46,676
Everything. I mean...

1615
01:53:47,724 --> 01:53:49,396
there's so much to tell.

1616
01:53:50,564 --> 01:53:51,563
Yeah.

1617
01:53:52,423 --> 01:53:54,155
There's so much to tell.

1618
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:56,629
I want you to know...

1619
01:53:57,772 --> 01:54:00,148
that I will always be there for you.

1620
01:54:00,803 --> 01:54:03,583
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1621
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:07,072
I promise you that.

1622
01:54:10,897 --> 01:54:12,792
I will always be your friend.

1623
01:54:16,105 --> 01:54:17,420
Only a friend...

1624
01:54:18,856 --> 01:54:19,941
Peter Parker?

1625
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:24,303
That's all I have to give.

1626
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:53,971
Whatever life holds in store for me,

1627
01:54:54,727 --> 01:54:57,000
I will never forget these words.

1628
01:54:57,850 --> 01:54:59,176
With great power,

1629
01:54:59,605 --> 01:55:01,580
comes great responsibility.

1630
01:55:02,856 --> 01:55:04,171
This is my gift.

1631
01:55:05,272 --> 01:55:06,466
My curse.

1632
01:55:07,897 --> 01:55:08,896
Who am I?

1633
01:55:10,188 --> 01:55:11,563
I'm Spider-Man.
