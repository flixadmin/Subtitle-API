1
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,091
<i>This is Free City.</i>

2
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,477
<i>Look at this guy.
He's one of the sunglasses people.</i>

3
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:02,739
<i>And the people who wear sunglasses
are heroes.</i>

4
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,887
<i>They have a devil-may-care attitude
and they run this town.</i>

5
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,595
You are so hot.

6
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,621
Oh, I know.

7
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,372
<i>See? That's not even his car.</i>

8
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:27,036
<i>Or his wife.</i>

9
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:36,489
<i>For the sunglasses people,
they get to do anything they want.</i>

10
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:41,269
<i>They go on all sorts of missions.
They got cool hair, cool clothes.</i>

11
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:46,666
<i>I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.
They're more like mild suggestions.</i>

12
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,661
<i>Like, I don't think
he's gonna return that car.</i>

13
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:51,161
<i>Or that nice lady.</i>

14
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,951
<i>See what I mean?</i>

15
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,729
<i>Hero.</i>

16
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:28,898
<i>My name is Guy, and I live in paradise.</i>

17
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,718
Good morning, Goldie.

18
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:39,875
<i>I've lived here in Free City my whole life.</i>

19
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:42,597
<i>I've got a best friend,
I've got a goldfish,</i>

20
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,183
<i>and I work at the bank.</i>

21
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,559
<i>What more could a guy want?</i>

22
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,712
Sunday should be warm and sunny
with just a scattering of drive-bys.

23
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,226
Great day for the beach,
but not Hitman's Beach,

24
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,170
which will be mined and sprayed
with high-calibre fire

25
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:55,695
from a renegade gunship stolen by...

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,011
<i>And every morning,</i>

27
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:02,349
<i>I start my day with the most delicious
coffee in the whole, wide, whole world.</i>

28
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,960
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

29
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,546
You know it. Mmm.

30
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:07,598
Mmm!

31
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:10,210
That is unexpectedly hot.

32
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,960
Jeez, that's good.

33
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,863
It's like losing my virginity,
but in my mouth.

34
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,242
Thank you for making this with such love.

35
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,552
You're welcome.

36
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:22,750
- Officer Johnny!
- Have a good one, Guy.

37
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:25,653
Don't have a good day,
have a great day!

38
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,226
Hold the fudge.

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,087
You mean to tell me that nobody snapped up
those bad boys? Today is the day.

40
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,447
- Like every other day.
- I'll be back for those.

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,007
Oh! So close.

42
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,702
Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee
of all time.

43
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,046
I wanna write a song about it.

44
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,156
I wanna dance to that song with my body.

45
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,331
I love my life.

46
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,149
There's something about finding your lane
and just staying in it.

47
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:54,640
That's why they call 'em comfort zones,
they're so damn comfortable.

48
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:57,287
Oh, Joe!

49
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:01,050
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

50
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,976
- You said it, Guy.
- Yeah.

51
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:09,531
<i>In Free City, I have everything I need.</i>

52
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:11,099
Don't have a good day...

53
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,605
...have a great day.

54
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,881
Thank you.

55
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:16,190
Take care.

56
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,968
<i>Except one thing.</i>

57
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,346
Seem happy.

58
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,781
Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy. 
You gonna find someone.

59
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,450
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

60
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,994
Feel like I've been looking
for her forever, you know?

61
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,520
Maybe it's not meant to be.

62
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:31,132
Everybody down on the ground!

63
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,532
- I know the woman I'm looking for.
- Oh, let me guess.

64
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,281
- Woman with an offbeat sense of humour.
- Sense of humour.

65
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:44,786
An obsession with feel-good diva pop.

66
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,012
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

67
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,956
She's rented space in my brain
and she won't move out.

68
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,140
And you know what?
I don't want her to.

69
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,656
Well, guess what?
She won't move either in or out.

70
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,646
You know why?
'Cause she doesn't exist.

71
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,773
- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
- That's cruel. You're cruel.

72
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,399
- You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
- I'm being real.

73
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,427
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

74
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,489
So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?

75
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,432
Of course we're going for 
beers on the beach after work.

76
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,892
- That makes me so happy.
- Me too.

77
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:22,423
What have you got?

78
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,909
Proof of a secret level.
That's what you're looking for, right?

79
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,669
You got a video or a screen grab?

80
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,362
Nope. But I know who does.

81
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,630
Wanna know what I do to people
who waste my time?

82
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:33,325
Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play.

83
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,450
Hey, you really British,
or is that an accent filter?

84
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:37,271
'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

85
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:40,841
I don't have a burning desire
to see your mum's basement, thanks.

86
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,283
Got jokes, huh?

87
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,071
Well, I got a map,
shows the location of his stash house.

88
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,224
Don't know how you'll get in, 
but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.

89
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,427
Now, I got a question.

90
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,521
What's so special about
this video clip anyway?

91
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:56,591
What's special is I kill people
who ask questions about it.

92
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,755
Mmm, I see. Fun. Yeah, that's fun.

93
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,296
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

94
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:06,145
But, seriously, is it loot
or is it just the experience?

95
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:08,683
Those are questions.

96
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:13,182
Did you see the sneakers
on that last robber?

97
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,735
- The 2:30?
- No, the 4:00.

98
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:19,168
The three-quarter high-top,
gorgeous foam soles.

99
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:21,130
I could barely feel it
when he stepped on my face.

100
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:21,991
Oh, man.

101
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:25,330
Wow. Life in the big city. 
Ain't nothing like it.

102
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:26,356
Give it to me!

103
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:27,833
Looks like rain.

104
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,075
Has anyone seen my cat?

105
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,536
You know something, Guy,
people say it all the time, like,

106
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,731
"Guy can take a shoe to the face
better than anybody I know."

107
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,425
I mean, when you put it on there,
you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

108
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,784
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

109
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,081
Love that song.

110
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,932
That's a new one.

111
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,003
Hey!

112
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,918
That's her.

113
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:17,637
Her who?

114
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,205
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

115
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:21,016
She exists.

116
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,682
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

117
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:26,875
Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

118
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:28,540
So?

119
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:30,057
Whatcha mean "so"?

120
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,386
So, people with sunglasses don't talk
to people like us.

121
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,413
- You know that!
- I gotta try.

122
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:35,534
Look, Guy!

123
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,750
Guy!

124
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,706
Guy! What about beers on the beach?

125
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,164
Excuse me!

126
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:47,854
Hey!

127
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,120
Hey!

128
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,588
Coming soon... Free City 2!

129
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:07,376
Bigger! Badder! Radder!

130
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,632
Free City 2: Carnage.

131
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,259
Pre-order today 
and get the bonus Mayhem Pack.

132
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:12,618
You done?

133
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:15,573
Sorry. Are you closing?

134
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:16,706
Yes.

135
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:18,525
We usually don't put
the chairs on the tables,

136
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,479
one-small-coffee-over-four-hours girl.

137
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,856
You really like that game, huh?
My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.

138
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,549
Seems like everyone's obsessed with it.

139
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:32,127
Oh, Free City? Ah. No. I, uh,
have a lawsuit against the publisher

140
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:34,432
and the evidence that I need is in
the game. So then I had my codes-

141
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:38,127
Oh, I wish we weren't closing
so I could hear more about this.

142
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,150
Good morning, Goldie.

143
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:58,065
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

144
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,017
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

145
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,495
Actually, 
I think I'd like to try a cappuccino today.

146
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,096
Ooh. "Cappuccino". I enjoy saying that.

147
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,457
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

148
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:14,722
Excuse me?

149
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:16,555
I'd like to try a cappuccino.

150
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:17,963
Please.

151
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,159
But you get a medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

152
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,397
That's what you get. That's what
everyone gets. Every day. Always.

153
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,778
- Well, I...
- Somebody's about to get shot.

154
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,194
Officer Johnny.

155
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:31,659
I just thought I'd try
something different today, you know?

156
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,135
Whatever. Right? Yeah?

157
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:38,816
Hi.

158
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,471
Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.

159
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,854
Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.

160
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,042
I'm joking.

161
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,523
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

162
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,815
He was just kidding!

163
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,176
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself
of your baristic artistry?

164
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,510
No way, no how.

165
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:59,110
Mmm. That's hot.

166
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:02,776
It's like Jesus washed my tongue

167
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:07,167
but, right before he finished, he finally 
told my dad, "He's good enough."

168
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,153
Thank you so much.

169
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,489
- Officer Johnny!
- Have a good one, Guy.

170
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,079
Cappuccino.

171
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,292
Don't have a good day...

172
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,635
...have a great day, I guess.

173
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,941
Okay. Good day to you.

174
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,957
Everybody down on the ground!

175
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,809
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

176
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,868
That's the girl.

177
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,040
We've been over this.

178
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,056
You tried to talk to her yesterday,
it didn't work.

179
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,499
It will never work.

180
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,400
She's wearing sunglasses. 
We don't mess with the sunglasses people.

181
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:12,595
Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own.

182
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,899
What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

183
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,400
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

184
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,219
Hi.

185
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:18,639
What'd you say?

186
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,103
Hi.

187
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,684
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.

188
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:24,910
Ooh. Ow.

189
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:25,936
I'm just gonna...

190
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,525
I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec.

191
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,914
What the hell do you think you're doing?

192
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,124
Go back to your side, man.

193
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:32,212
He's just an NPC. Waste that mother-

194
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,253
Okay, just need to borrow them
for a sec, okay?

195
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,322
- Back off! I said, don't!
- Just real quick. Real quick.

196
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,509
Stop!

197
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,566
You broken or somethin'?

198
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,775
I'm the robber!

199
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,680
You're the guy who lies down
and takes it!

200
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,706
Please, just stay down!

201
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,314
I said, stay down!

202
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,394
Guy, you don't do this, man.

203
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:52,505
This isn't you.

204
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,782
You don't do this.

205
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,259
Maybe I do.

206
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,212
What is wrong with this

207
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:00,238
stupid mission?

208
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,658
I told you to smoke his ass.

209
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:03,032
Let go!

210
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,728
I'll give them right back.

211
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:05,611
I said-

212
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,441
Guy?

213
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,693
He's just resting.

214
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:21,283
In pieces! That man is dead!

215
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:23,025
He's so sleepy.

216
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:29,458
I'm just gonna put your gun down 
right here,

217
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,669
for when you wake.

218
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,796
- Okay?
- Guy.

219
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,028
Guy! Where you goin'?

220
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,415
Excuse me.

221
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:11,931
Do you see this?

222
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,212
Have the quarterly reports
on my desk by Friday.

223
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:36,775
Whoo!

224
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,158
Oh!

225
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:40,923
Giddy up!

226
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:43,242
I feel brand new.

227
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,775
<i>Loser.</i>

228
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,555
What is happening?

229
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,018
So much money.

230
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:32,681
Hey, Mouser, check this out.

231
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,958
What's up, Keys?

232
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,351
What am I looking at?

233
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,088
Okay, so, this user, 
he gets his glasses stolen and then killed.

234
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:41,220
The guy was smoked by
a non-playable character.

235
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,830
An NPC? That's impossible.

236
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:44,572
Yeah, exactly.

237
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:47,071
Nobody can equip an NPC skin
on their avatar.

238
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,933
Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass
noob and ban him for life, you're done.

239
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,770
I tried that, but I... I can't trace him.

240
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,965
Whoever it is, they're good.

241
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,160
Hmm. You gotta be better 
at your job, buddy.

242
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:05,197
- I'm pretty good.
- I'll see you on the inside.

243
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:06,330
Select your skin.

244
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,509
Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with?

245
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,658
The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,
big guns, bigger moustache.

246
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:13,384
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it.

247
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,369
Almost scared to ask,
but what are you going with?

248
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:19,056
Uh, full body moustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.

249
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,525
I'm terrified.

250
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:22,353
Let's do this.

251
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:58,892
Seriously, man.

252
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,296
I'm just being honest, I think
the bunny suit is just a little much.

253
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,751
Excuse me?

254
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,689
Right.

255
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:09,494
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

256
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:13,681
Hey, 40-year-old virgin! Get over here!

257
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,707
Let's go!

258
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:16,243
Uh-huh. Captain Khakis.

259
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,145
- Come here. Come on, bud.
- Go, let's go.

260
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,900
- Closer.
- There he is.

261
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,468
Blue shirt guy.

262
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:23,285
Blue shirt?

263
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:24,881
Yes.

264
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,982
Hello, Officer.

265
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:29,423
Rabbit.

266
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,449
Nice skin.

267
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:33,079
Thank you. That's sweet.

268
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,392
How'd you get it?

269
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:39,657
Well, uh, mostly genetics, I think. I'm
pretty lucky. I have naturally dewy skin.

270
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,060
Listen up, Neutrogena.

271
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,212
You know you can't go around
looking like that. The rules are clear.

272
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:45,279
And another thing. 
You can't hack the NPC avatars.

273
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,023
No, sir!

274
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,358
- It screws up the mission load...
- Screws it up!

275
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,454
- ...and it makes the game look bad.
- Horrible!

276
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,821
I got, like, 5% of that.

277
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:53,656
Lose the skin!

278
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,985
I... Lose?

279
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,825
How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?

280
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,851
Take it off, man.

281
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,370
Just take it off. What are you doing?

282
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:00,437
- What?
- Seriously.

283
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:01,985
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?

284
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,415
- Everything. Ditch it.
- Take it off.

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,833
If you don't, we're gonna kill you.

286
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,460
- Why?
- And we're gonna keep killing you.

287
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,353
Still why?

288
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:08,946
Until we do find out who you are,

289
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,698
and then we're gonna ban you for life.

290
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:14,220
Okay. No, no. Okay, I want to comply.

291
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,372
I just find the order of those threats
very confusing.

292
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,103
- Somebody's about to get shot.
- Light him up!

293
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,467
No.

294
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,225
Come on, Blue Shirt.

295
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,539
Oh! Didn't see that one coming.

296
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,134
Did you see that one coming?
Scared me a little bit.

297
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,683
- We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!
- Coming to get ya.

298
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:16,830
We're coming to get ya.

299
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,517
Wait! Wait!

300
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,202
I can explain everything.

301
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:25,998
I found these glasses
and then I can see things now.

302
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,609
Things that... Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.

303
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,551
Except they are there.

304
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,830
I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!

305
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:37,891
You can run, Blue Shirt, 
but you cannot hide.

306
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,904
Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.

307
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:42,722
We're apex predators.

308
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,292
All we do is bone and brawl
and slit throats.

309
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,113
Too high! Too high!

310
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,699
Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt?
Watch this.

311
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,840
I tire of these games, Keys. It's time
I went god-mode on this beyotch.

312
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,160
Okay, bring it.

313
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:07,937
Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.

314
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:24,876
I'm so, so good at this.

315
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:35,001
Time's up, bank teller!

316
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:57,970
Nope!

317
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:23,866
I can't die!

318
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:24,889
I'm never gonna die!

319
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,461
Whoo!

320
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:29,997
And that was the heartbreaking story
of Blue Shirt Guy.

321
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:31,248
The end.

322
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,317
- Doesn't make sense.
- What?

323
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:34,507
I just checked the server stats.

324
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:37,093
We killed Blue Shirt and 
the number of players online didn't change.

325
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,784
It's just a glitch, man. 
It's not a big deal.

326
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:41,116
I know, I know. It just seems like
that's something new, you know?

327
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:43,514
Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.

328
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,207
I just think it's important
to be transparent, okay?

329
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:46,233
Uh-uh. No.

330
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,077
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care

331
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:52,327
or he's gonna get pissed
and then he's gonna blame us.

332
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,480
So, I don't know what you haven't
figured out about the whole situation.

333
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:59,760
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius,
indie game designer?

334
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:02,287
What are you doing down here dealing
with complaints?

335
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:06,558
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic story 
involving failed dreams, desperation,

336
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,655
and a mountain of college debt.

337
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,307
You do not wanna hear about that.

338
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:12,051
You're absolutely right.

339
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:16,501
That story sounds horrible and boring
and full of white privilege.

340
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,278
Don't talk to Antwan.

341
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:25,051
We never dreamt
this would've happened.

342
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:28,020
{\an8}I mean, Life Itself, it's essentially
a fishbowl game.

343
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,708
{\an8}People aren't playing it,
they're watching it grow.

344
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,919
{\an8}It's a strictly observational experience

345
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,798
{\an8}where computer generated characters
interact and evolve.

346
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,633
{\an8}I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.

347
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:44,120
{\an8}That's what's so charming about Keys,
he's clueless about his own genius.

348
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:45,938
{\an8}Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

349
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:49,509
{\an8}Uh, she built the AI engine
from the ground up.

350
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:53,157
So, to get a little personal, what's 
the thing that gets you up in the morning?

351
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,887
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

352
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:58,502
What's the other thing?

353
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,904
Oh, yeah.
An insatiable thirst for validation.

354
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:02,389
- She's not kidding.
- I'm not.

355
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:03,809
How about you?

356
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,509
- Code.
- Code?

357
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,535
- Code.
- Code, yeah.

358
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,561
There we go.

359
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:09,379
'Cause it's not just zeros
and ones, it's hidden messages.

360
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:12,668
I like to think of myself, actually,
as not a code writer, but an author.

361
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:17,246
I just use zeros and ones instead of
words 'cause words will let you down.

362
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:21,793
But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

363
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,444
- He's not kidding.
- I'm not.

364
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:25,054
Now, I've gotta ask.

365
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:27,331
There is a lot of chemistry between
the two of you.

366
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:28,874
Has this evolved into more than-

367
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:29,707
No.

368
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,103
- No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
- No, no, no. We're friends.

369
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:34,413
- We're like best friends.
- Friendship.

370
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,106
And now your game
is gonna be released by Soonami,

371
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:37,833
one of the biggest publishers
in the world.

372
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,693
- It's crazy, actually.
- It is, yeah.

373
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:42,543
It does seem a little bit like
an unlikely pairing, though.

374
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,098
Yeah, I didn't totally get it either.

375
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:47,625
But Millie's got a real instinct
for these things.

376
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,901
Antwan is a genius.

377
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:52,699
He's brash and obnoxious,
but he's really good at what he does.

378
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:54,892
It's a chance for our work
to be seen by a wider audience.

379
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,043
- God, those two were young and dumb.
- Jeez.

380
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,699
So we're breaking and entering now?

381
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:02,848
How does it feel working for a galactic
black hole of frozen shit?

382
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:05,027
You have to leave. I can't talk to you.

383
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,595
Aw, shame will have that effect.

384
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,403
No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.

385
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,996
I can't even see you. I'm literally
focusing on background objects

386
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:14,528
because looking at your lips move
violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

387
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:16,817
Aw, fired by Antwan,
the guy who stole our work?

388
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:19,249
No, he bought it and then he shelved it.

389
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,348
All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.

390
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:23,629
How can I move on?

391
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,770
How can you?

392
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:28,192
Antwan swiped our AI engine
to use in his dumb shooter.

393
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:31,887
Did he, Millie?
Because, honestly, I'm not so sure.

394
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,456
Our game was complex
and beautiful and interesting.

395
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,918
And Free City, it may be popular but
it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

396
00:23:37,943 --> 00:23:40,020
Then stop defending him
and help me beat his ass.

397
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,214
- Millie, I'm...
- Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

398
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:43,857
And now he's lying about it

399
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:46,318
so he doesn't have to give us the credit
and the royalties that we deserve.

400
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,329
- Millie...
- I found a clue.

401
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:53,215
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.
All I need from you is to get me in there.

402
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,832
Millie, I care about you...

403
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,090
...but you need to leave.

404
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,361
Today is gonna be different, Goldie.

405
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:14,551
What are we lookin' at?

406
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:17,668
Who are you?

407
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:18,903
Okay, okay. Okay.

408
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:21,872
We ran into each other the other day,
you were humming that great song.

409
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:22,898
Oh, yeah.

410
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:25,550
I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?

411
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:29,863
I waited outside by the murder train,
then I followed you.

412
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,210
Shit!

413
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:47,881
Can I come with you?

414
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:50,160
Yes?

415
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:53,984
Holy hell, what just happened?

416
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:56,801
What just happened is
you almost blew my mission.

417
00:25:56,973 --> 00:26:00,145
No, I mean, how did we get from there
to wherever this is?

418
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,692
You mean the portal gun?

419
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:03,590
Portal gun? That sounds expensive.

420
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:05,871
Wow, you are a special kind of noob.

421
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:07,192
Thank you. You too.

422
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,824
- Turn around.
- Okay.

423
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:14,762
Oh.

424
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,395
Is this the North Pole?

425
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,839
Listen, dude.

426
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:23,559
- Guy.
- Guy. Whatever.

427
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:25,582
Props on the NPC outfit,

428
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,026
but I'm busy trying to figure out
how to steal something.

429
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,910
Maybe I could help you.

430
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,399
I work alone.

431
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,842
You have beautiful grenades.

432
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,762
Besides, if you want to have any chance
of making an impact here,

433
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:37,684
you need to have a higher level than that.

434
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:39,121
That's tough.

435
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:40,059
- No.
- No.

436
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,542
- Higher level?
- Good Lord, rook.

437
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,212
- See?
- Oh.

438
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:47,246
That's mine.

439
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,832
And that's yours.

440
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,582
Oh. What, is one the best or the worst?

441
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:55,109
There is literally nothing lower.

442
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:57,153
Well, how do I get to a higher level?

443
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:59,207
- Really?
- Really.

444
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:03,306
- You know, get stuff.
- Yeah.

445
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,996
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Yeah.

446
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:06,835
- Experience, guns...
- Yeah.

447
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,942
- Put that down.
- Uh-huh.

448
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:08,899
Money.

449
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,758
This is Free City. 
You could rob a store, carjack someone,

450
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:14,868
punch a pedestrian in the face.
You'll figure it out.

451
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,312
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

452
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:23,457
Hmm. I've got to admit
that is kind of refreshing.

453
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,879
Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet
on here is a sociopathic man-child.

454
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:30,061
Thank you.

455
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,086
Wait. But the world isn't that bad, 
though, is it?

456
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,543
Oh! Pretty bleak.

457
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:39,134
If you ever met the dick responsible
for this world, you'd agree.

458
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,704
Are we talking about God?
You've met God?

459
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:45,223
And he's a dick?

460
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,792
His name's Antwan,
and, yes, he's an absolute troll.

461
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,669
Trolls exist?

462
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,348
Look, I don't know if anybody does it,

463
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:56,484
but you could rack experience points up
by being a good guy.

464
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,428
- Like a hero.
- Ooh. Easy, tiger.

465
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:00,590
If you don't wanna shoot people,
you could steal their guns.

466
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,240
All that shit makes your level go up.

467
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,641
Go be the good guy.

468
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,020
- Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy.
- Ooh! Ooh.

469
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,788
Okay, well, 
enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.

470
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,040
Off you go.

471
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,108
Okay. Wait! How will I know
that I've levelled up enough?

472
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:14,988
- Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk.
- Whoa.

473
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,130
- Bye now.
- That's so much more than one.

474
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,340
- Like, 99 more.
- Bye now.

475
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,366
Okay.

476
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,279
Hi.

477
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,475
Thanks, Guy.

478
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:48,788
Good morning, Goldie.

479
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:50,772
Good morning, Goldie.

480
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:53,267
Good fucking morning, Goldie.

481
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:57,046
I have three words for you. Blue Shirt Guy.

482
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:01,907
BSG is levelling up and at a record pace
by playing the hero.

483
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:05,540
It's got people all over the world
asking, "Just who is this guy?"

484
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:09,110
I don't know who this guy is,
but he's out-skilling all these players.

485
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:12,979
And here he is, taking out Beefoven,
a level 102 from Clan Ragnarok.

486
00:30:13,004 --> 00:30:15,079
- This is bullshit.
- Who is this guy?

487
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,416
I don't know, but he's good.

488
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,651
Yeah, he's good. He looks like an NPC

489
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:22,363
but he's running around, levelling up
crazy fast by being the freaking good guy.

490
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,758
"This colourful character
in the video game Free City

491
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,761
"has been turning heads
by being the good guy."

492
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,680
- Piper.
- Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

493
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,931
You're absolutely right.

494
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:36,961
Blue Shirt Guy. Who is he or she indeed?

495
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,845
Whoo-hoo!

496
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:05,696
There's a worldwide craze that has
captured kids' hearts, Blue Shirt Guy!

497
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,493
Hello, Hinata.

498
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,642
You have a great outfit.

499
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,539
Don't have a good day...
Have a great day!

500
00:31:12,564 --> 00:31:15,274
Crazy awesome!

501
00:31:56,363 --> 00:32:00,040
Well, well, well. Look who decided
to come to work today, huh?

502
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:02,446
Look, where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you.

503
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:04,649
What is this shirt?

504
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,610
Where's your collar at?
Where's the rest of the buttons?

505
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:08,945
And it's not tucked in. You look sloppy.

506
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,781
Matter of fact, you look horrible.
Did you pick up some muscles, too?

507
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,157
Or is somebody outside pumping you up?

508
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:17,665
I'm sorry that I haven't been around,
Bud. I've been figuring some stuff out.

509
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,568
Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"?
It is nothing to figure out.

510
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:24,563
Okay? You go to bed, you wake up,
you get some coffee, then you come to work.

511
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:26,254
And then you repeat
the same thing tomorrow.

512
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,728
- The girl.
- Oh, my God.

513
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,493
I talked to her. I talked to her.

514
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:31,854
- The one with the sunglasses?
- The sunglasses, yes!

515
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,539
I talked to one of the sunglass people
and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

516
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,360
Me.

517
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,951
Everybody down on the ground!

518
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:41,399
You're so hot.

519
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:44,368
What if I could tell you
that you could be more?

520
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:45,845
Your life could be fuller.

521
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,899
That you're free to make
your own decisions. Your own choices.

522
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:48,928
Yo, dumbass.

523
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:50,899
We are in the middle of something.

524
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,306
Uh...

525
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:54,251
- That's my gun.
- Quiet time.

526
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:58,643
These puppies changed my life.
And they're gonna change yours, too.

527
00:32:58,668 --> 00:33:00,587
Come on now,
you know we don't wear sunglasses.

528
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,178
We do now.

529
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:07,045
Mine now.

530
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,353
Are you kidding me?

531
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,659
- Put 'em on.
- No.

532
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:14,962
Life doesn't have to be something
that just happens to us. All right?

533
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:17,384
Just put the glasses on
and you're gonna see.

534
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,374
You're gonna see.

535
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,854
Come on.

536
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:26,259
I can't, okay?

537
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:29,532
I'm sorry.

538
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:38,087
I'm keeping these, asshole mouth.

539
00:33:38,112 --> 00:33:40,548
Now get out of here. Go be nicer.

540
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:42,645
Beat it. Go, go, go.

541
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,171
Don't walk, run.

542
00:33:44,912 --> 00:33:45,907
And you...

543
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:48,759
Sorry.

544
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:52,715
Um, you could do so much better
than that guy.

545
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:56,071
You could be with, like, a good guy.

546
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:59,681
Or maybe
I don't have to be with any guy.

547
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,083
Right? Exactly. Most of them are awful.

548
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,840
- They really are.
- Terrible.

549
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:05,465
Yeah, do whatever you wanna do.

550
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:14,362
You're my best friend, Buddy.

551
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,455
And you don't have to be scared.

552
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:19,405
If you change your mind, I'll be around.

553
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:28,033
Yo, Keys, our Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

554
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,120
I know.

555
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:31,479
Who is this guy?

556
00:35:00,488 --> 00:35:01,664
I'm here.

557
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:03,898
I really appreciate this, Keys.

558
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:06,122
Okay. Just to be clear,

559
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,983
all I'm doing right now
is opening the door.

560
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:12,094
If this clip really does prove that
Antwan reused our code illegally,

561
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,500
go find it and get out.

562
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,036
Player's doing the jewellery store mission 
in midtown.

563
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:20,521
That gives you 5 minutes.

564
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,207
And go.

565
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:35,860
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

566
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,334
Really? I'm sitting on the toilet
right now, stealing user codes,

567
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:40,489
so I don't exactly feel like one.

568
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,866
Oh, you never have.

569
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,184
Good thing I know better.

570
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:47,091
All right. The clip you're looking for 
should be on the wall to your left.

571
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,315
Thanks for the assist.

572
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,552
You got it. I hope it has the proof 
you're looking for.

573
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,669
Keys! I need your help!

574
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:20,805
He's got that place booby-trapped with
spawn points. Millie, I can't help you.

575
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,474
Blue Shirt Guy?

576
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:47,294
It's a Henley. Was that cool?
It felt really cool.

577
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:50,958
You look really pretty.
Wow, this house is so nice.

578
00:36:58,551 --> 00:36:59,694
What are you doing here?

579
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,555
I was trying to steal a video clip,
now we're trying not to die.

580
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:04,856
Who are you talking to?

581
00:37:06,465 --> 00:37:09,161
You know, that player in the NPC skin.

582
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,255
Millie, there are no other players
in that house.

583
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,918
That actually hurt my hand.

584
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,028
Get down!

585
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:07,950
I'm sorry! Oh, God!

586
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,460
We're doing great.

587
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,065
Wow!

588
00:38:29,462 --> 00:38:30,924
We should definitely go!

589
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,573
Oh, shit!

590
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,607
Is that a Glock in your pocket?

591
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:43,905
- No.
- What?

592
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,127
It's two Glocks.

593
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:46,823
Oh!

594
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:21,688
I don't suppose this thing can fly.

595
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:23,129
No.

596
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:23,961
Jump.

597
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:25,986
Wow!

598
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:28,438
Whoa!

599
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:39,281
Oh, shit.

600
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,936
Good morning, sheeple!

601
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,438
Oh, you are fired.

602
00:39:57,463 --> 00:40:00,318
There is some concern with the bloody
zombies. Retailers won't carry the game.

603
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:02,021
Cut it. It's out.
Never even happened. Next.

604
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:03,377
It's your lawyers.
They need to get your deposition.

605
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:06,130
Speak. Which lawsuit are we talking about?

606
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:07,885
Millie, Millie Rusk?

607
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:10,451
No sweat. That will never
see the inside of a courtroom

608
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,596
because she's got no proof
and her ex-partner works for me.

609
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:14,622
We're golden.

610
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:17,802
Antwan, hey. You look great. Uh, 
I thought you were still at Burning Man.

611
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:20,169
Oh, does it look like
I'm still at Burning Man?

612
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,201
You, you, you-

613
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:23,773
No. So, shut your stupid,
bearded face and listen.

614
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:26,509
You heard about the asshole running
around in the game who looks like an NPC?

615
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:29,320
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy.
But we're gonna get rid of him.

616
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:32,907
Don't get rid of him. People like him.
It's all over social media. No.

617
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:36,005
In fact, know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna use the skin in Free City 2.

618
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,497
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some
upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

619
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,440
'Roid him out.
Make him a hitman or something.

620
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:44,435
Antwan, we're already way behind porting
over the skins from Free City 1.

621
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,696
Skins? Don't even worry about that.
They won't be usable in Free City 2.

622
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,754
Antwan, you told the fans 
Free City 2 is backwards compatible.

623
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:51,900
It was in the commercial.

624
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,969
You said there'd be the same characters
in the sequel.

625
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:57,331
Well, here's the thing.
When I said that, I was lying.

626
00:40:57,356 --> 00:40:59,560
Listen, Antwan,
the game is already buggier than ever.

627
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,336
I got a stack of user complaints,
like, a mile high.

628
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:02,853
Look, I know it sucks.

629
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:07,232
But the IP recognition is rock hard.
Okay? So don't even worry about it.

630
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:10,654
I'm just saying,
we could make an original game.

631
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,467
What? Make an original? Why would I do that
when I could make a sequel?

632
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:15,493
A sequel.

633
00:41:15,518 --> 00:41:16,810
So we can make it better?

634
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:19,912
IPs and sequels,
that is the thing that people want.

635
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,247
- Let me ask you a question.
- Okay.

636
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,648
You love Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?

637
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:23,732
- Mmm-hmm.
- No.

638
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:26,593
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,
and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,

639
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,879
and I know that you love
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

640
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,531
why would I make
another restaurant called,

641
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:32,683
uh, I don't know,
"Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

642
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:33,662
- Okay? 
- Mmm-hmm.

643
00:41:33,687 --> 00:41:34,935
- Makes no sense, homie.
- No sense.

644
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,712
What am I gonna give you? A sequel.

645
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:38,880
Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken, Part Two.

646
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:41,392
Uh, yum. Drop the deuce on him.

647
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,627
Come on. Come here. Come here.

648
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:47,388
I don't want you to stress that glorious
shampoo commercial head of yours about it.

649
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,594
Free City 2 is gonna be jumunjious.

650
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,302
That's not a word.

651
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:56,293
You sure you don't wanna bump up
to programming?

652
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:58,112
I know you got the brains for it.

653
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,444
No thanks. I'm good right where I am.

654
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:07,546
Love it. Fear of flying.
Can't say I can relate.

655
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:10,398
But it's all good with me
if I don't have to pay you more.

656
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:11,966
Antwan out.

657
00:42:22,648 --> 00:42:24,108
Who is this guy?

658
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,469
Wow!

659
00:42:33,494 --> 00:42:35,037
I took your advice.

660
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:38,189
I levelled up.

661
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,434
Impressive.

662
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:44,159
Why are you doing all of this?

663
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:48,355
You know, I guess I felt trapped.

664
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:53,135
You know, in my life, I just felt so...

665
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:54,859
Stuck.

666
00:42:56,337 --> 00:42:59,549
Yeah. And then I saw you.

667
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,846
Then I saw you.

668
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:05,166
Who are you?

669
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:06,995
I'm Guy.

670
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,980
No, who are you really?

671
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,301
Still Guy.

672
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:14,424
All of this, levelling up so fast.

673
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:18,986
Giving this whole world the finger.
How are you pulling this off?

674
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:22,299
I've never given anyone
any of my fingers.

675
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:24,319
- You work at Soonami, don't you?
- No.

676
00:43:24,343 --> 00:43:25,688
You've got an inside track.

677
00:43:25,713 --> 00:43:27,602
- I work at the bank.
- Right. The bank.

678
00:43:27,627 --> 00:43:31,672
So, you're just this incredible hacker
who happens to work at the bank.

679
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,407
- Yes, I work at the bank.
- Where did you get that skin?

680
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:38,717
It's always, sort of, been there.

681
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,869
Why do people keep asking me
that question?

682
00:43:40,894 --> 00:43:42,646
I don't know, why do they?

683
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,776
No, no. Not doing that. I-

684
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:51,596
What's happening right now?

685
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:53,471
I don't know, but I don't buy it.

686
00:43:53,496 --> 00:43:54,393
No.

687
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,838
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it.
- Fine. Good.

688
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:58,260
- I'll let it go.
- Yes.

689
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:00,014
Great.

690
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,111
- We all have our secrets, I guess.
- Yes, we do.

691
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:06,937
Hey.

692
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:10,330
Do you like ice cream?

693
00:44:10,745 --> 00:44:13,039
I can't believe I've never been here.

694
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,432
Well, it's sort of a secret.

695
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:19,466
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy,
always come here. It's quiet and safe.

696
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,229
Yeah, it makes sense.

697
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,037
No missions here.

698
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,517
Oh, you gotta try this.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

699
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,060
This is my favourite flavour
in the whole world.

700
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,296
- We'll take two of the usual, please.
- You got it, Guy.

701
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:34,377
It's bubble gum flavour.

702
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:36,018
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

703
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,931
Guy, get out of my brain hole!
I love bubble gum ice cream.

704
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:42,556
No, you don't.
Are you making fun of me right now?

705
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:44,947
No! Nobody likes bubble gum ice cream.

706
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:46,057
No, I do.

707
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:47,745
I had a relationship end
over bubble gum ice cream.

708
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:48,937
- No way. 
- Yeah.

709
00:44:49,162 --> 00:44:50,479
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

710
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:51,596
Mmm.

711
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:53,283
How good is that?

712
00:44:53,308 --> 00:44:54,309
You can taste it?

713
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:57,838
Taste it? It's like my tongue
had a baby with a sunrise.

714
00:44:58,303 --> 00:44:59,611
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

715
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,861
Coffee used to be my favourite food,

716
00:45:02,886 --> 00:45:05,393
but, compared with this,
it tastes like liquid suffering.

717
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:07,151
What?

718
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,861
Nothing. You're funny.

719
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:15,619
- I am?
- Yeah.

720
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:17,361
Weird funny.

721
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:20,861
But that's kind of my speed.

722
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,888
Weird funny,
that's totally my speed, too.

723
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,892
- Great.
- Yeah. I know a joke.

724
00:45:24,918 --> 00:45:26,697
A weird funny joke. You wanna hear it?

725
00:45:26,722 --> 00:45:27,940
- Please.
- Okay.

726
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:33,080
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair
are trying to murder a very small child.

727
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:35,627
- The cripple says to the homosexual-
- Whoa. Stop, stop.

728
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:37,737
Stop! Where did you hear that?

729
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:39,388
A robbery.

730
00:45:39,413 --> 00:45:41,569
The gunman told it to the driver
who thought it was hilarious,

731
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:43,877
so I memorised it and told everyone.

732
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:48,908
Word of advice? Don't crib your jokes 
from the trolls of Free City.

733
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:51,393
- Trolls?
- Is that a swing set?

734
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:17,796
Holy...

735
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:28,537
Okay, this is too weird.

736
00:46:28,562 --> 00:46:31,632
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice cream,
and now swings?

737
00:46:31,816 --> 00:46:33,985
- This is too weird.
- I thought the same thing, too.

738
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,593
I thought the same thing.

739
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:38,537
When I was younger,
I was obsessed with swings.

740
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:41,992
Growing up in my family, it was...

741
00:46:42,992 --> 00:46:44,820
You don't wanna hear this. No.

742
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:46,972
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

743
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:48,765
Oh.

744
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,617
Growing up in my family,
it wasn't good enough to be great.

745
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:55,774
You had to win, and that pressure,
you know,

746
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:57,968
it was just constant.

747
00:46:58,188 --> 00:47:01,687
But when I was in the back garden
on that little swing...

748
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:07,054
You know that moment, that split second 
between rising and falling,

749
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,707
when you're totally weightless,

750
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:10,335
- it feels like you're free.
- In love.

751
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:12,677
Free. What you said. Yeah.

752
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,711
I really wanna kiss you. Is that weird?

753
00:47:18,944 --> 00:47:20,336
You want to kiss me?

754
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,794
I wanna kiss you so badly.

755
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,611
You want to kiss me badly?

756
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:26,812
- No!
- No?

757
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:28,836
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna kiss you well.

758
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,922
I mean, I'm an idiot,
so I say things like an idiot sometimes.

759
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:33,711
No, you're not. You're not.

760
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:35,093
I mean, um,

761
00:47:36,216 --> 00:47:38,594
uh, if you know how to, go for it.

762
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:40,101
I know how.

763
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:42,297
Okay.

764
00:47:44,317 --> 00:47:45,679
Here goes.

765
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:12,247
That was so much better than ice cream.

766
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:13,929
Whoa!

767
00:48:13,954 --> 00:48:15,577
I think someone's at the door.

768
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:16,603
I'll say.

769
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,422
Well, this was great.

770
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:19,726
Yeah, it was.

771
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:21,695
Let's meet up again sometime soon.
Yeah?

772
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,513
Yes. Definitely.

773
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:25,295
Maybe in the real world.

774
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,405
What?

775
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:27,974
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,922
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

777
00:48:31,112 --> 00:48:32,820
Bye, Molotov.

778
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:36,682
Hey, my real name is Millie.

779
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:41,821
My real name continues to be Guy.

780
00:48:48,306 --> 00:48:51,734
Millie, open up! Millie, it's me,
it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

781
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:54,804
Millie! It's me, open up!

782
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:56,789
- What?
- You were right.

783
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,289
- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

784
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:01,733
You were right. Our code, 
it is in Free City

785
00:49:01,758 --> 00:49:04,797
and, Millie, it works.

786
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:06,323
Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof.

787
00:49:06,348 --> 00:49:08,570
Just forget about that for one second.

788
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:10,763
I'm saying that our game, Life Itself,

789
00:49:10,788 --> 00:49:13,885
where characters would grow
and change and feel real...

790
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,137
- Yeah?
- ...worked.

791
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:16,930
- Keys.
- The AI worked.

792
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:20,292
It's the reason why Free City 
is so realistic and people love it so much.

793
00:49:20,317 --> 00:49:22,437
And of course it doesn't look the same.

794
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:25,257
There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

795
00:49:25,282 --> 00:49:28,400
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

796
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:32,945
But the underlying code in the game
is the same. Our code.

797
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,849
And Guy, I mean, he has evolved way
further than we thought was even possible.

798
00:49:35,874 --> 00:49:38,422
Wait, are you talking about the hacker
in the NPC skin?

799
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:42,080
Millie, I'm talking about the fact
that Blue Shirt Guy...

800
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,106
Yeah?

801
00:49:43,131 --> 00:49:44,562
...is not a player.

802
00:49:44,897 --> 00:49:50,280
He is an algorithm who thinks he's alive.
I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.

803
00:49:50,305 --> 00:49:54,367
He is the first real 
artificial intelligence.

804
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,562
- No! No.
- I know.

805
00:49:57,587 --> 00:49:59,389
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

806
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,932
- Guy? My Guy?
- Guy.

807
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,125
- One who has been...
- Your Guy?

808
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,560
- Holy...
- This is a good thing.

809
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:05,087
No, it's really bad.

810
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:08,565
Millie, his code, it's thousands of times 
the size it should be.

811
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,054
We did it, Mills.

812
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:15,032
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

813
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:17,977
Okay? Did you know that
the NPCs have private lives?

814
00:50:18,638 --> 00:50:21,244
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

815
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,271
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

816
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:25,398
I can't even froth my own oat milk
in the morning.

817
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:28,068
And the Bombshell character in the game

818
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:32,703
wrote a memoir that's a searing
indictment of gender roles, the patriarchy.

819
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,910
It's a little preachy in parts
but, over all, it's pretty good.

820
00:50:34,935 --> 00:50:35,936
Millie, we have to celebrate!

821
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:37,828
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

822
00:50:37,853 --> 00:50:40,356
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

823
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:43,375
So, yeah.

824
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,549
I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?

825
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:49,631
Guy.

826
00:50:50,816 --> 00:50:51,734
Guy?

827
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:56,472
The first time I kiss a non-toxic guy
in, like, forever

828
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,491
and of course he's not even real!

829
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:00,992
Uh, there's not a button for that.

830
00:51:01,664 --> 00:51:03,179
Oh, he found the button.

831
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:04,732
- Okay.
- Yeah.

832
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:06,929
- I am... I'm so confused...
- Why is it so hot?

833
00:51:06,954 --> 00:51:08,734
...and surprisingly curious.

834
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:14,101
You let an artificially intelligent
video game character kiss you?

835
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,326
Oh, okay, 
can you just stop saying it like that?

836
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:18,510
Because you have got to meet him, Keys.

837
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:21,496
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

838
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:23,773
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

839
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:27,570
Also, Millie, food for thought,
he's, like, four.

840
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,851
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

841
00:51:30,876 --> 00:51:32,734
Wow, you just made that really creepy.

842
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:34,963
Millie, put all that aside.

843
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:37,980
Weird or not, when people find out
about this, you could win a Nobel Prize.

844
00:51:38,005 --> 00:51:39,197
Oh, God.

845
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,223
What?

846
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,909
Oh, my God, if they see this...

847
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,500
- What? What is it?
- Oh!

848
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:44,902
Antwan. What else?

849
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,108
He's lying. He lied about using our code,

850
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,375
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

851
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,803
- I think he's lying about Free City 1.
- What are you talking about?

852
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:56,890
Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location...

853
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,203
I mean, there's not even a single
character from Free City 1 on here.

854
00:51:59,228 --> 00:52:00,802
Free City 2 is not an update...

855
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:02,078
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

856
00:52:02,103 --> 00:52:03,976
So when Free City 2 launches on Monday...

857
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:07,517
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code,
everything, will be deleted.

858
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,794
He can't do that.

859
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:11,989
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

860
00:52:15,704 --> 00:52:17,046
We're screwed.

861
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:19,221
Maybe not.

862
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,990
If we can find our original build
in the game,

863
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,684
it'll prove that Antwan used our code
without properly licensing it.

864
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:27,000
And we just have to find it
before Free City 2 launches.

865
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:28,437
We have 48 hours.

866
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:30,165
I've looked, Keys. You know I have.

867
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,443
I know you have.

868
00:52:31,468 --> 00:52:33,845
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

869
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,372
maybe he can help?

870
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:37,445
That would mean I'd have to tell him.

871
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:40,883
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

872
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,664
His whole world's about to end.

873
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,333
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

874
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,926
Here you go.

875
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,652
- Thank you.
- You got it.

876
00:52:51,676 --> 00:52:52,823
Guy?

877
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,320
Hey! Hi!

878
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:55,773
Guy, we need to talk.

879
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:58,599
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

880
00:52:58,777 --> 00:52:59,778
British.

881
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,859
I think I know an Australian accent
when I see one.

882
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,015
I turned off the accent filter.

883
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:06,560
This is me.

884
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:08,008
Good.

885
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:10,160
Look, I have to tell you something
really important.

886
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:11,473
Are you married?

887
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:12,562
No.

888
00:53:12,587 --> 00:53:13,859
Oh, God.

889
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:18,172
That would have been, like,
the worst thing ever.

890
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,961
Maybe not the worst thing.

891
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,238
Huh.

892
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,159
I have to show you something.

893
00:53:24,478 --> 00:53:25,383
Okay.

894
00:53:30,934 --> 00:53:31,935
Wow!

895
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,920
I always wondered what was in here.

896
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:37,841
Tune in to the Kill Cam for
more of today's highlights

897
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:41,494
of every bloody, bullet-ridden
corner of Free City.

898
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,555
Has anyone seen my cat?

899
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,312
Hey, that's Phyllis.
She's always losing her cats.

900
00:53:48,377 --> 00:53:51,255
And there's Joe!
He's my friend, I know that guy.

901
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,453
I don't get it. What is this place?

902
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:58,857
There is no easy way to say this,
but this city is a game.

903
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:01,506
There's no easy way to say this,
I know it's a game.

904
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,283
You taught me how to play it. Boop-boop.

905
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:04,885
Yes, you're right, I did.

906
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,954
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

907
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:11,395
It's a video game. And that's all it is.

908
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:15,093
So the entire world is a game?

909
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:15,968
Yes.

910
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:18,023
And we're all just players in the game?

911
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:20,347
Not exactly.

912
00:54:21,483 --> 00:54:22,776
I'm a player.

913
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:26,139
All these people here are players.
We live in the real world.

914
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:28,533
But you only exist here.

915
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:31,144
It's why you can never leave Free City.

916
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:33,047
You're what we call an NPC.

917
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,357
NPC.

918
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:38,100
The policeman and the muscular
bunny rabbit, they called me that.

919
00:54:38,114 --> 00:54:39,348
What is an NPC?

920
00:54:39,372 --> 00:54:40,593
Just watch.

921
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:42,866
Everybody get down on the ground!

922
00:54:42,891 --> 00:54:45,992
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

923
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:47,469
I don't understand.

924
00:54:47,494 --> 00:54:49,328
You're a non-player character.

925
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,250
- Non...
- A background person.

926
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:55,476
Someone designed to make the game more fun
for real people.

927
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:58,000
Wait, hold on a second.
Just stop for a second.

928
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,299
I wanna make sure that
I'm getting this straight.

929
00:54:59,322 --> 00:55:01,365
I just wanna fully understand, here.

930
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,392
So, I'm fake?

931
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,590
The entire world is fake?
I'm not even a main character,

932
00:55:07,615 --> 00:55:10,952
I'm just this idiot 
who's in the background?

933
00:55:11,736 --> 00:55:14,906
Millie, why are you even saying this?
I love you.

934
00:55:15,248 --> 00:55:18,086
You only think that
because it's in your programming.

935
00:55:24,674 --> 00:55:26,865
Guy, I need you to listen to me.

936
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,803
In two days, the game is gonna shut down.
For good.

937
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,330
When the sequel launches, this whole city,

938
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:34,867
you, all the people in it
who aren't players,

939
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:36,422
they'll be gone forever.
You need to listen.

940
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,390
My whole life, I felt like 
there had to be something more.

941
00:55:39,415 --> 00:55:41,125
And then I saw you.

942
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,592
And I knew I was right. I was right!

943
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:48,279
And, for a second, I felt amazing.

944
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:50,056
- I know.
- Except you don't know.

945
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:52,208
Because we're not the same.

946
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:56,163
Isn't that what you said? You said that. 
We're not the same.

947
00:55:56,693 --> 00:55:58,111
You're real.

948
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,882
And I'm what? I'm what?

949
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,031
You're not.

950
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:10,648
You're not.

951
00:56:11,376 --> 00:56:13,679
Well, I may not be real,
but, for a second there,

952
00:56:14,862 --> 00:56:16,697
I felt pretty alive.

953
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:21,529
It's all a lie!

954
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:29,506
Have the quarterly reports
on my desk by Friday.

955
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:31,950
Quarterly reports.
My, what specific business lingo.

956
00:57:31,975 --> 00:57:34,208
Wow. Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

957
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,414
Until it crushes your soul.

958
00:57:35,439 --> 00:57:38,818
Has anyone seen my cat?
Has anyone seen my...

959
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:41,017
Your cats?
No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

960
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:44,963
But here's a revolutionary idea...
close your goddamn door.

961
00:57:44,988 --> 00:57:47,388
It's not like they're climbing
on top of one another,

962
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:50,860
forming a little kitty tower,
and then jimmying the locks.

963
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:53,012
They don't have thumbs, Phyllis.

964
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:54,602
No thumbs!

965
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:58,490
Don't you get it? Don't any of you get it?

966
00:57:59,003 --> 00:58:03,365
None of this matters! None of it!
It's fake! We don't matter!

967
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,201
That building, that's fake!
This street...

968
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:07,819
...it's fake!

969
00:58:07,844 --> 00:58:08,638
That car-

970
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:18,079
Officer Johnny!
Have a good one, Guy.

971
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:28,006
Oh, hey, uh...

972
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:30,675
Come in.

973
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,056
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

974
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:50,904
Buddy, what would you do 
if you found out that you weren't real?

975
00:58:52,276 --> 00:58:53,591
What do you mean?

976
00:58:53,982 --> 00:58:55,177
Pretend with me.

977
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:58,703
Okay, so, can I pretend I'm a ghost?

978
00:59:00,181 --> 00:59:01,182
Sure.

979
00:59:01,301 --> 00:59:04,583
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now?
Or whenever I die?

980
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:05,960
Like, do I have a funeral outfit on?

981
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,130
- This is kind of funeral...
- Doesn't matter.

982
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:09,230
...but even though it's a
work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

983
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:10,857
Let's move on from the concept, okay?

984
00:59:11,478 --> 00:59:12,607
Got it.

985
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:15,474
I'm not a ghost.

986
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,183
- I'm very disappointed, but I get it.
- Yeah.

987
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:22,747
I'm me, who I am right now,
and I'm just trying to help a friend.

988
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:27,146
I say, okay, so what if I'm not real?

989
00:59:27,674 --> 00:59:29,685
I'm sorry. "So what?"

990
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:30,865
Yeah. So what?

991
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:35,513
But if you're not real, doesn't that mean 
that nothing you do matters?

992
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:37,174
What does that mean? Look, brother,

993
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,220
I am sitting here with my best friend,

994
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,052
trying to help him 
get through a tough time.

995
00:59:42,543 --> 00:59:46,964
Right? And even if I'm not real,
this moment is.

996
00:59:48,312 --> 00:59:52,566
Right here, right now, this moment is real.

997
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:56,701
I mean, what's more real than a person
tryin' to help someone they love?

998
00:59:57,616 --> 01:00:02,201
Now, if that's not real,
I don't know what is.

999
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:07,271
Do you know the other security guards?

1000
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,897
I know 'em all. Why?

1001
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:13,569
Hey, Buddy... let's not have a good day,

1002
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:16,216
let's have a great day.

1003
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:19,146
Guy, what are we doin' here?

1004
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:21,632
We're here to get a video clip
for my friend Millie.

1005
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:23,263
Does this look intimidating?

1006
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,834
I don't know, Guy.
How do you hold this thing?

1007
01:00:33,354 --> 01:00:35,106
You have something I want.

1008
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,421
And you're gonna hand it over.

1009
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:41,208
How'd you get in here?

1010
01:00:41,431 --> 01:00:43,433
Easy. I know your security guard.

1011
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,160
Jimmy?

1012
01:00:45,185 --> 01:00:46,353
His name is Luigi.

1013
01:00:46,378 --> 01:00:48,288
So, if you took some time
to learn his name,

1014
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:50,081
maybe he wouldn't turn on you so quick.

1015
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:53,401
I need a video clip,
and you're gonna give it to me.

1016
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,443
Wait a minute, are you...

1017
01:00:56,437 --> 01:00:57,779
Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

1018
01:00:57,804 --> 01:00:58,846
Yeah, maybe.

1019
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:02,135
Holy shit! You're Guy!
You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

1020
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,344
- Yeah.
- I love you.

1021
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:04,662
- You do?
- I mean,

1022
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:06,306
I'm, like, a fan. You're awesome.

1023
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:07,515
You can have anything you want.

1024
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,683
Wait, hold on one second.

1025
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,768
Gamers, listen up,
this is Revenjamin Buttons here.

1026
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:11,794
I'm here with Guy.

1027
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:14,490
The Guy, he's in my stash house,
and he's here to rob me.

1028
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,631
Can I get a little

1029
01:01:15,656 --> 01:01:17,841
"what-what" for my followers, Guy?

1030
01:01:18,193 --> 01:01:19,603
- What?
- Perfect.

1031
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:20,737
All right, so what's happening is

1032
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:22,060
Guy's looking for a clip

1033
01:01:22,085 --> 01:01:24,919
showing a walkthrough I did
to get to the secret level.

1034
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:28,292
Who are you talking to?

1035
01:01:30,294 --> 01:01:31,456
I'm sorry.

1036
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:34,567
Who am I talking to?
It's just such a classic Guy line.

1037
01:01:34,592 --> 01:01:35,593
Right?

1038
01:01:36,036 --> 01:01:38,379
You're good. Oh, anyway...

1039
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:41,657
And you, you tried to steal it from me
with that Molotov chick.

1040
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,925
Her name's Millie.

1041
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,161
- Yeah. Wait, who?
- Millie.

1042
01:01:45,297 --> 01:01:46,637
I think it's going really well.

1043
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,957
I know. This is literally the first time
I took my gun out the holster.

1044
01:01:49,982 --> 01:01:51,177
Totally. Right?

1045
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:54,625
Guy, I tried to go back through,
but the glitch is patched.

1046
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:56,089
And I never found it again.

1047
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:58,161
So I'm the only one that ever saw
what was on the other side.

1048
01:01:58,186 --> 01:01:59,770
But it's all here, check it out.

1049
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:01,833
It's pretty cool, actually.
It's like a whole other world.

1050
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:04,599
- This is it? This is the game clip?
- Yeah, that's it.

1051
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:08,130
Can you do one, single,
just one solid for me?

1052
01:02:08,155 --> 01:02:09,660
- One thing, I'll stop asking, okay?
- Yeah.

1053
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:10,686
Just say my catchphrase.

1054
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:13,147
My viewers will just banana cream
sandwich all over themselves if you say it.

1055
01:02:13,172 --> 01:02:14,880
I love banana cream sandwiches.

1056
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,251
- Maybe not this banana cream sandwich.
- Yeah, this one.

1057
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,520
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just say,
"You know what time it is?"

1058
01:02:19,545 --> 01:02:21,672
- You know what time it is?
- You know what time it is?

1059
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,007
You know what time it is?

1060
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:24,033
You know what time it is?

1061
01:02:24,058 --> 01:02:25,468
You know what time it is?

1062
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,844
You know what time it is?

1063
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,403
You know what time it is?

1064
01:02:28,428 --> 01:02:30,180
It's crime o'clock, baby. Yeah.

1065
01:02:30,604 --> 01:02:31,544
It's crime o'cl-

1066
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,141
No, I can't say that. It's not...

1067
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,395
Okay. It's all right. I'll say it myself.

1068
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,255
- All right, you know what time it is?
- No.

1069
01:02:37,374 --> 01:02:38,345
It's crime o'cl-

1070
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:39,250
Mum!

1071
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,824
Mum! Are you serious with the

1072
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:42,135
vacuum right now?

1073
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,325
You really have to do that here?
I'm saying my

1074
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,833
catchphrase! Everybody's watching!

1075
01:02:45,858 --> 01:02:46,415
God!

1076
01:02:46,439 --> 01:02:48,933
You're 22, living in my house, 
there is no God!

1077
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:49,959
Sorry, Guy.

1078
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:53,371
Thank you, Mr. Buttons. We're gonna go.

1079
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:55,123
No, no, no! No, you gotta kill me.

1080
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,999
- I'm sorry, what?
- You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

1081
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,318
Give it to me, Daddy. Give it to me!

1082
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,654
No. Please don't do that.
Please don't do that.

1083
01:03:01,688 --> 01:03:03,965
We're not gonna hurt anybody.
I'm a good guy.

1084
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,366
What? What'd you say?

1085
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:10,377
- That's deep.
- No, it's not.

1086
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:11,639
That's like I can taste you, deep.

1087
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:15,460
I want your help, Buddy.
I don't have the safeword.

1088
01:03:15,485 --> 01:03:17,753
- I know what you want.
- I don't want that.

1089
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:18,872
Yeah, you do.

1090
01:03:18,897 --> 01:03:20,122
That's touching.

1091
01:03:20,147 --> 01:03:21,273
- They're touching.
- Yeah.

1092
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:24,214
I know what you want. Yes, I do.

1093
01:03:24,737 --> 01:03:27,217
You want a little bit of
that Free City Itchy Kitty.

1094
01:03:27,242 --> 01:03:28,858
- No.
- Uh-huh. Yes, you do.

1095
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,200
The way you move, it's almost dirty.

1096
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:36,225
What about a little Thanos Glove
into a little bit of Thanos Snap?

1097
01:03:36,373 --> 01:03:38,125
- Oh. That looked like it hurt.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1098
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,484
A little Sunday Drive.

1099
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:41,139
You have a beautiful home.

1100
01:03:41,305 --> 01:03:44,642
- Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man?
- Bye, Mr. Buttons.

1101
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,288
Come on, give me one snake!
Just come on, man.

1102
01:03:47,313 --> 01:03:49,381
Mum! Do not touch that sock!

1103
01:03:49,406 --> 01:03:51,033
I swear to God, if you touch that sock

1104
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,473
you will be in therapy 
for the rest of your life!

1105
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:56,608
No! That's my special sock! Put it down!

1106
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,092
Millie, please.

1107
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:06,053
Please wake up from your standing coma.

1108
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,145
Look, I know this world is just a game 
to you and you can come and go,

1109
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,874
but, to me, this place, these people, 
that's all I have.

1110
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,530
And if I can help you save it,
I wanna do that

1111
01:04:15,555 --> 01:04:17,933
but you gotta wake up, please.

1112
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:19,874
Millie, I'm sorry for running away.

1113
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:20,694
Guy?

1114
01:04:22,677 --> 01:04:24,717
Oh, that's so scary! It's just terrifying.

1115
01:04:24,742 --> 01:04:27,045
I know, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1116
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,384
Look, you may have started out living
in the background, but so did I.

1117
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,161
We're done with that.

1118
01:04:33,923 --> 01:04:35,092
I got you a present.

1119
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,506
I didn't have time to wrap it.

1120
01:04:38,493 --> 01:04:39,577
What?

1121
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:51,011
They say over a billion NPCs 
are killed every year.

1122
01:04:51,036 --> 01:04:56,011
Now, I'm not gonna lie,
that's at least 50% my fault.

1123
01:04:56,036 --> 01:05:00,982
I used to shoot all the secondary
characters when I was bored, you know?

1124
01:05:01,007 --> 01:05:04,627
And then, I'd teabag 'em a little bit.

1125
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:07,363
Who the hell even knows
who this Blue Shirt Guy is?

1126
01:05:07,388 --> 01:05:08,517
But I'll tell you this,

1127
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,242
he's got me thinkin' about NPCs 
and how I play the game.

1128
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:15,450
The game wasn't even made for someone
like this, for a player to be a good guy.

1129
01:05:15,475 --> 01:05:16,857
He's also a really cute guy.

1130
01:05:16,882 --> 01:05:19,146
And not just the face, you know,
like, the whole thing.

1131
01:05:19,664 --> 01:05:21,825
And, honestly, it's got me realising,

1132
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:24,353
maybe we've been thinking about NPCs 
wrong this whole time.

1133
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,427
I think Blue Shirt Guy's
like a symbol, you know?

1134
01:05:26,452 --> 01:05:28,411
Like, maybe people
can be whatever they want.

1135
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,813
He's like an icon.
Is that the right word?

1136
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:32,911
Like, he reminds us of what's possible.

1137
01:05:32,936 --> 01:05:34,396
Also, he's, like, crazy hot.

1138
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:37,458
Oh, my God, totally.
I'd hit those pixels hard.

1139
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,161
We should all be more like Blue Shirt Guy.

1140
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,521
Maybe we just stop the killing.

1141
01:05:41,286 --> 01:05:43,040
He's dead! You hear me?

1142
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:44,792
The guy, put him up here.

1143
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:47,211
Put him up here on the screen.
Put him on the screen.

1144
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:50,427
Make me see him. There he is.

1145
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:53,634
Yes. There he is, the little do-gooder.

1146
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,052
I thought you liked Blue Shirt.

1147
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:56,871
Don't say words to me!

1148
01:05:56,896 --> 01:05:59,815
People are so busy watching this loser
on Twitch and YouTube.

1149
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,267
You know what they're not doing, guys?

1150
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,585
Buying Free City 2.

1151
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:04,700
- Pre-sales are down 16%.
- 60.

1152
01:06:04,725 --> 01:06:06,519
60. That's bad.

1153
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:09,255
Oh, we are 48 hours from launch.

1154
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:10,989
Yeah, he's gone viral.

1155
01:06:11,014 --> 01:06:14,726
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass
and ball cancer at the same time!

1156
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,278
Inoperable!

1157
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:21,126
You know, this whole good guy routine,
it is a bad influence,

1158
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,705
and is bad for the franchise.

1159
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,245
I want him gone.
I don't care who it is, boot him.

1160
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,271
You can't.

1161
01:06:26,971 --> 01:06:28,107
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1162
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:29,133
You can't.

1163
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:30,446
Why not?

1164
01:06:30,471 --> 01:06:33,466
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan.
He's an NPC.

1165
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:37,370
You're tryin' to tell me that all this shit
about a self-aware NPC is real?

1166
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:40,739
Yeah. I don't know how or why,
but he's real.

1167
01:06:41,736 --> 01:06:43,653
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1168
01:06:46,209 --> 01:06:48,169
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1169
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:49,593
What to do? What to do?

1170
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:50,677
Got it.

1171
01:06:52,324 --> 01:06:53,659
And kip-up!

1172
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:58,866
So we can't kick him out of the game.

1173
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:01,686
How do we reset his AI?
Ideas, people. Come on.

1174
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:03,013
Hit me. Ideas.

1175
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:05,216
You could just reboot the server.

1176
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:06,332
Keep talking.

1177
01:07:06,357 --> 01:07:07,692
If we reboot the server

1178
01:07:07,717 --> 01:07:10,950
then he's just gonna revert back
to a regular non-player guy.

1179
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,018
- Solution.
- Antwan.

1180
01:07:13,043 --> 01:07:14,771
Antwan, you're talking about terminating

1181
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:17,843
the first confirmed artificially
intelligent life-form right now, okay?

1182
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,328
Honey, honey. Shush.

1183
01:07:20,193 --> 01:07:21,489
He's losing me money.

1184
01:07:21,514 --> 01:07:24,934
So, I don't care 
if he's Arnold-Frickin'-Schwarzen-Vader.

1185
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:26,134
Terminate him.

1186
01:07:26,158 --> 01:07:27,439
- Reboot.
- On it.

1187
01:07:27,463 --> 01:07:28,646
You can't do that.

1188
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:29,672
Reboot!

1189
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:45,062
Order up and drown your bloodlust
with a tall glass of murderjuice.

1190
01:07:45,087 --> 01:07:46,880
Here's this week's highlights.

1191
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:49,427
He's very expressive with his body.

1192
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,692
- Clearly.
- What is that?

1193
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:53,152
It's a whole new world over there.

1194
01:07:53,177 --> 01:07:54,466
Some kinda paradise and shit.

1195
01:07:54,835 --> 01:07:56,295
Oh, my God, that's it.

1196
01:07:56,515 --> 01:08:00,942
It's our original build and that build
is proof our code is in the game.

1197
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:02,969
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this.

1198
01:08:02,994 --> 01:08:04,682
I've seen this place.

1199
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:05,880
What?

1200
01:08:11,772 --> 01:08:12,773
Yeah.

1201
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,967
What do you mean? How could you
have possibly seen it?

1202
01:08:19,318 --> 01:08:21,195
Millie? Millie?

1203
01:09:06,102 --> 01:09:08,573
We're dark. Free City is offline.

1204
01:09:16,067 --> 01:09:18,111
What is happening?

1205
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:24,289
Bye-bye, Blue Shirt.

1206
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,883
No, no, no.

1207
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:47,059
It's okay. Come on.

1208
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,233
Come on.

1209
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:56,594
Come on, come on, come on.

1210
01:10:02,618 --> 01:10:03,911
Good morning, Goldie.

1211
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:12,906
Front of warm, dry gunfire
mixed with late afternoon stabbings

1212
01:10:12,931 --> 01:10:16,430
could leave you in the streets wet with the
blood of innocents by early Tuesday night.

1213
01:10:17,188 --> 01:10:20,025
What really is the difference between
a light roast and a dark roast?

1214
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,367
Nobody knows.

1215
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,487
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

1216
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:24,709
Guy, can we talk?

1217
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,934
How does the sunglass girl know your name?

1218
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:26,974
I don't know. Keep walking.

1219
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:28,334
Come on, Guy! You know me.

1220
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:29,560
You know this.

1221
01:10:30,361 --> 01:10:32,297
You said this clip showed a place
you'd seen before.

1222
01:10:32,322 --> 01:10:33,500
I need to know where.

1223
01:10:34,085 --> 01:10:36,208
The data's been erased,
but it's in your head.

1224
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:38,867
Please try to remember.
This is really important.

1225
01:10:39,637 --> 01:10:42,906
Please, Guy, think.
The ice cream, the swings?

1226
01:10:42,931 --> 01:10:44,383
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

1227
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,760
At Free City Harbor Park,
there's a great swing set there.

1228
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:47,928
- Have you been?
- Yes.

1229
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,288
We had bubble gum ice cream.

1230
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:52,156
OMG, I love bubble gum ice cream!

1231
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,720
He loves the bubble gum ice cream.

1232
01:10:53,745 --> 01:10:55,859
Yes, I know.
We had it together, remember?

1233
01:10:56,972 --> 01:10:59,308
Please, Guy, you're all I've got.

1234
01:11:03,512 --> 01:11:06,344
I'm sorry, lady.
I think you have the wrong guy.

1235
01:11:07,177 --> 01:11:09,638
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

1236
01:11:24,006 --> 01:11:25,049
Hello?

1237
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:26,075
I might've found something.

1238
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,553
I've been going through Guy's code
and there is something there,

1239
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:31,622
even now, after the wipe.

1240
01:11:31,647 --> 01:11:32,648
What's the point?

1241
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:35,617
Guy was, like, a one-in-a-billion miracle.
We can't replicate that.

1242
01:11:35,642 --> 01:11:37,310
I tried, okay? You were right, it's over.

1243
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,156
No, Millie, Millie,
you're not listening to me, all right?

1244
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:43,059
A reboot, it doesn't erase his AI coding.

1245
01:11:43,084 --> 01:11:45,611
You literally would have to destroy
the servers to do that.

1246
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:48,013
His AI is still there,
it just needs to be accessed.

1247
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:50,242
I've seen him, Keys.
He's forgotten everything.

1248
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:52,660
Just look at the trace log I sent you.

1249
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:54,269
It'll explain everything.

1250
01:12:07,965 --> 01:12:09,513
Now, from the beginning,

1251
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:14,068
Guy's behaviour is much more complex
than it should be, thanks to our code.

1252
01:12:14,446 --> 01:12:18,057
But he's still stuck in Free City.
He's still stuck in this life, this loop.

1253
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:22,147
And, then, something changes.
He comes to life. Why?

1254
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:23,576
And then I remembered.

1255
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:27,482
One of the characters from Life Itself
was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.

1256
01:12:27,507 --> 01:12:31,818
And he was someone who was designed
to never meet the right person.

1257
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:34,349
It was essentially the building blocks
of the character.

1258
01:12:34,374 --> 01:12:38,552
But he never stopped hoping that
he would meet "the girl of his dreams".

1259
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,296
So I had to base this girl off of someone,

1260
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:43,950
and who better than the person
that I was sitting next to every day?

1261
01:12:44,077 --> 01:12:45,078
You.

1262
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:46,809
But then, one day,

1263
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:49,505
he meets you in Free City,
and once he sees you

1264
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,130
he can never be the same.

1265
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:56,460
He was supposed to feel doomed, but
instead, he feels alive until, eventually,

1266
01:12:56,485 --> 01:12:57,959
he is alive.

1267
01:12:58,982 --> 01:13:01,109
You changed him, Millie.

1268
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:05,748
You changed his code.
And I think you can do it again.

1269
01:13:05,773 --> 01:13:07,984
You brought him to life, Millie.

1270
01:13:09,178 --> 01:13:11,221
You brought him to life.

1271
01:13:11,246 --> 01:13:13,412
And he was alive because
he met the one pers-

1272
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:16,826
Don't have a good day...

1273
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:18,954
have a great day.

1274
01:13:18,979 --> 01:13:20,105
Thank you.

1275
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:21,648
Take care.

1276
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:23,341
Everybody down on the ground!

1277
01:13:23,598 --> 01:13:26,253
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

1278
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:27,279
Okay.

1279
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:28,847
Everybody except you.

1280
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,255
Door, door, door. I got it.

1281
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,763
Please, I have a goldfish.

1282
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:37,056
Look, I don't have long.

1283
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,349
I just took you hostage,
so there are three badges on me.

1284
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:41,168
Badges? Is that like a Girl Scout thing?
What is that?

1285
01:13:41,193 --> 01:13:43,337
- There is something inside you, Guy.
- What? I don't want anything inside of me.

1286
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,555
They stuck you in that bank and
expected you to just follow the rules...

1287
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:47,459
- I love the bank.
- ...and do the same thing every day.

1288
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:49,777
- You are so much more than that.
- I don't wanna be more than that.

1289
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,612
No, and I need you to remember it.

1290
01:13:51,637 --> 01:13:53,639
Why have you been following me
and how do you know my name?

1291
01:13:53,664 --> 01:13:54,732
Put these on.

1292
01:13:54,757 --> 01:13:56,466
I don't have to do anything
that I don't wanna do.

1293
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:58,576
True. The choice is totally yours.

1294
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,412
Okay. Okay. Fine.

1295
01:14:05,376 --> 01:14:07,216
What is that?

1296
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,213
What are these? Trick glasses or something?

1297
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:10,239
Listen carefully.

1298
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:15,494
In 24 hours, this world, everyone you know,
it's all gonna disappear for good.

1299
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:17,193
Can you please just let me go?

1300
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,615
I mean, I haven't really even
seen your face.

1301
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,962
I mean, I've seen the general area, but
I'm not really good with descriptive words.

1302
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,377
Not really good with words in general.

1303
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:25,959
- Screw it.
- What? Oh!

1304
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:05,252
I remember.

1305
01:15:06,265 --> 01:15:07,642
Welcome back.

1306
01:15:08,283 --> 01:15:11,245
No. I remember everything.

1307
01:15:12,092 --> 01:15:13,294
Come with me.

1308
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:16,935
I do this every day so much,
I'd forgotten why.

1309
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:21,792
Do you see that?

1310
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:23,379
Right there.

1311
01:15:24,005 --> 01:15:25,423
Oh, my God.

1312
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:28,483
Oh, my God!

1313
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:32,329
Antwan hid our original build past
the horizon, making it invisible,

1314
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:34,646
but he forgot to scrub the reflections.

1315
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:37,505
It's still out there, Guy. 
We just can't see it.

1316
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:40,262
If we can get there,
that is the evidence we need.

1317
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:42,998
You can't go past the water line.
I tried.

1318
01:15:43,023 --> 01:15:44,248
We need help.

1319
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:47,380
Antwan found a way
to hide it in plain sight

1320
01:15:47,405 --> 01:15:49,717
in the one place no one can even get to.

1321
01:15:49,742 --> 01:15:51,840
I can't even believe
he's smart enough to be this diabolical.

1322
01:15:51,865 --> 01:15:53,567
Keys, I need you to focus.

1323
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:57,237
Okay. So, the reflection shows the build
past the southern horizon.

1324
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,348
But the game physics
won't allow you past the beach.

1325
01:15:59,373 --> 01:16:02,159
But you think you can find a way
to get us past the collision mesh?

1326
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:03,310
We're gonna need a bridge.

1327
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:05,724
You just get to Hitman's Beach
and I'll figure out the rest.

1328
01:16:05,749 --> 01:16:06,959
And, Millie,

1329
01:16:07,538 --> 01:16:08,790
be careful.

1330
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:10,876
Antwan may be an asshole,
but he's not stupid.

1331
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:13,445
He'll figure out what you're up to and
he'll throw everything he's got at you.

1332
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:14,630
You're right.

1333
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,317
Um, hi, Millie,
and other person I can't see,

1334
01:16:18,342 --> 01:16:21,411
I have an idea. 
What if he has nothing to throw?

1335
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:26,124
Everyone! Gather round!

1336
01:16:27,362 --> 01:16:28,781
Thank you for coming.

1337
01:16:29,937 --> 01:16:31,146
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

1338
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,673
Hi, Guy.

1339
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:34,451
Hi.

1340
01:16:35,217 --> 01:16:38,107
What I'm about to say
may be hard to understand.

1341
01:16:38,887 --> 01:16:40,318
Really hard to understand.

1342
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:45,169
But, are you sick of 
living in the background?

1343
01:16:46,678 --> 01:16:48,430
Aren't you sick of being shot at?

1344
01:16:48,455 --> 01:16:49,456
Enough.

1345
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,108
- Taken hostage?
- No more.

1346
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:52,626
- Run over?
- We done with that.

1347
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,736
Robbed? Stabbed?
Used as a human shield?

1348
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:56,421
We are tired of being stabbed!

1349
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:57,693
- Buddy!
- Sorry.

1350
01:16:57,718 --> 01:16:59,443
What are you trying to say, Guy?

1351
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:02,678
I'm tryin' to say that things in
this city don't have to be this way.

1352
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:03,887
Things can be different.

1353
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:04,955
Different how?

1354
01:17:05,094 --> 01:17:07,599
For starters,
you can put your arms down.

1355
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:08,625
Yeah.

1356
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:13,522
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

1357
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:15,185
Keep pushing. There you go.

1358
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,962
- Breathe through it. There you go.
- Do it. Do it. Do it.

1359
01:17:16,987 --> 01:17:18,576
- No, not gonna happen.
- Nope.

1360
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:19,943
That feels unnatural.

1361
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,137
I mean, what about when someone
runs in with a gun?

1362
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:24,741
Having my arms up
is just a real time saver.

1363
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:29,479
Except, what if the guy with the gun
doesn't come?

1364
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:30,991
- What?
- What?

1365
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:34,223
- There's always a guy with a gun.
- So many guys with guns.

1366
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:38,108
People, what if our world
doesn't have to be so scary?

1367
01:17:39,176 --> 01:17:40,886
What if we can change it?

1368
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:46,199
Millie! How many times a day
are the banks robbed in your world?

1369
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:47,792
Hardly ever, Guy.

1370
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:50,959
What about corpses, Millie?
You see a lot of those?

1371
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:53,905
- How many an hour?
- None per hour, Guy.

1372
01:17:54,204 --> 01:17:55,749
What about gun violence?

1373
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,758
See a lot of gun violence in your world?

1374
01:17:57,783 --> 01:18:01,030
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy.
It's a massive problem.

1375
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,156
I didn't see that coming.

1376
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:05,432
It's true. It really sucks.

1377
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:10,854
The point is, we don't have
to be spectators to our own lives.

1378
01:18:11,482 --> 01:18:13,327
We can be whatever we want.

1379
01:18:13,352 --> 01:18:14,854
We can't all be you, Guy.

1380
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,291
That's not true.

1381
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:21,089
What's inside of me is inside of you, too.

1382
01:18:21,118 --> 01:18:22,119
What?

1383
01:18:22,144 --> 01:18:25,241
It's inside of each 
and every one of you. You're growing.

1384
01:18:25,266 --> 01:18:28,394
I need more in my life than drip coffee.
I want to make...

1385
01:18:28,419 --> 01:18:29,601
A cappuccino.

1386
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,398
...a goddamn difference in the world.

1387
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,702
Much, much better.

1388
01:18:32,727 --> 01:18:33,728
And a green tea boba.

1389
01:18:33,753 --> 01:18:34,738
Holy shit!

1390
01:18:34,762 --> 01:18:35,729
That's right!

1391
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,172
You go, girl.

1392
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:38,301
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

1393
01:18:38,326 --> 01:18:40,226
If I could just make it out
past that water,

1394
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:42,374
there's a world out there
where we can be free.

1395
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:44,546
Where we get to decide who we wanna be.

1396
01:18:44,558 --> 01:18:47,101
Where we can matter.
But we have to fight for it.

1397
01:18:47,126 --> 01:18:48,927
We have to fight together.

1398
01:18:48,952 --> 01:18:50,245
Yeah!

1399
01:18:50,972 --> 01:18:53,694
You guys have always done
what's expected of you.

1400
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:55,221
But that shit ends today.

1401
01:18:55,246 --> 01:18:56,247
Yeah!

1402
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:59,632
I don't even know 
what's happening right now! But I love it!

1403
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,356
I love it!

1404
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,390
- I love it!
- I love it, too!

1405
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:07,052
Come on, guys, get in here!

1406
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:09,955
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do!
Everyone in!

1407
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:17,879
Everybody get down on the ground!

1408
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:24,010
Hello?

1409
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,459
Where the hell is everybody?

1410
01:19:28,246 --> 01:19:29,569
Hello?

1411
01:19:40,422 --> 01:19:42,382
Where are all the NPCs?

1412
01:19:50,982 --> 01:19:53,921
Look, I've been playing Free City 
for, like, three years now.

1413
01:19:53,946 --> 01:19:55,437
I've never seen anything like this.

1414
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:59,615
Up until recently, I don't even know if 
I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing.

1415
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,921
And I don't know if this is just
some whack Reddit theory

1416
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,778
but some people are saying that
Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.

1417
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:08,769
That he's actual AI.

1418
01:20:08,793 --> 01:20:09,656
AI?

1419
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:13,143
Actual AI. You know, alive.

1420
01:20:13,168 --> 01:20:15,704
It's why Blue Shirt Guy
is trending everywhere.

1421
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:18,607
Antwan, if you're watching this,
please fix the game.

1422
01:20:18,632 --> 01:20:21,209
- Most of all, bring back Blue Shirt.
- Oh, my God. My God!

1423
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:22,670
Antwan, you should see this.

1424
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:28,200
And you, you tried to steal it
from me with that Molotov chick.

1425
01:20:28,225 --> 01:20:29,342
- Her name's Millie.
- Who?

1426
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:30,368
Millie.

1427
01:20:30,564 --> 01:20:32,191
Got her. Got her!

1428
01:20:32,215 --> 01:20:33,655
Got you! Got you!

1429
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,224
Mouser! Put him up on the screen.
Now. Put him up.

1430
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:38,140
That's it. Come on, quicker.

1431
01:20:38,165 --> 01:20:39,218
Yes, there he is.

1432
01:20:39,243 --> 01:20:42,976
He's joyriding around Free City
with some player called Molotovgirl.

1433
01:20:44,028 --> 01:20:46,312
AKA Millie Rusk.

1434
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:48,640
Millie Rusk? Isn't that Keys' old partner?

1435
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:49,666
Yeah.

1436
01:20:49,691 --> 01:20:51,999
Also the one who's trying to hit me
with this bogus lawsuit

1437
01:20:52,024 --> 01:20:54,318
'cause she's desperate
for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

1438
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,203
Boot Molotovgirl now.

1439
01:20:56,228 --> 01:21:00,232
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I can,
but her account's spoofed.

1440
01:21:00,257 --> 01:21:01,530
This woman is exceptional.

1441
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:02,973
Then kill her in the game.

1442
01:21:03,143 --> 01:21:05,898
"What?" Yes, I said that. Kill her.

1443
01:21:05,923 --> 01:21:09,508
Throw everything at them, all right?
Five badges, G.

1444
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:11,034
Yeah, just one problem.

1445
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:12,761
We don't have anything.

1446
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:15,539
- Whatchu talking about, Willis?
- We don't have any defences.

1447
01:21:15,564 --> 01:21:18,901
We don't have police, military,
no nothing.

1448
01:21:19,162 --> 01:21:20,894
It's what I've been trying to tell you.

1449
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:24,422
It's like every NPC went on strike.

1450
01:21:26,192 --> 01:21:30,054
Got a tall, half-caf, double foam
oat milk, matcha latte with cinnamon!

1451
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,555
- That's me.
- Hey.

1452
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,007
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1453
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,307
Cheers.

1454
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:38,657
Go get 'em, Guy!

1455
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:42,407
It's like a digital walkout.

1456
01:21:42,843 --> 01:21:44,491
No, it's not.

1457
01:21:44,763 --> 01:21:46,882
They're doing this on purpose,
it's part of their plan.

1458
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:49,069
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna kill them in the game.

1459
01:21:49,094 --> 01:21:51,187
Turn off respawn, kill them dead, now.

1460
01:21:51,212 --> 01:21:54,921
But that means any players who die
will be done for good. They'll freak out.

1461
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:59,421
I don't care.

1462
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:04,175
Sir? Sir, just to be clear,
are you telling me that it's go time?

1463
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,548
Are you looking for some sort of banter
thing 'cause you think we're friends now

1464
01:22:06,573 --> 01:22:08,191
and we're in some sort of gang together?

1465
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,176
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

1466
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:12,640
Cool, we're a team.
We should come up with a catchphrase.

1467
01:22:12,665 --> 01:22:13,755
- Okay?
- All right.

1468
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,218
- On three. One, two, three,
- One, two, three...

1469
01:22:15,243 --> 01:22:17,120
Get back to work!

1470
01:22:17,964 --> 01:22:19,413
Someone find me Keys!

1471
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:26,655
All right, people, you heard him.
It's go time!

1472
01:22:31,483 --> 01:22:33,460
Okay, that's not good.

1473
01:22:35,081 --> 01:22:36,851
He knows where we're going.

1474
01:22:42,766 --> 01:22:45,069
All right, I got him. I got him.
Don't worry.

1475
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:46,938
Want some four wheels to the face?

1476
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:48,131
Take that. Boom!

1477
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:54,291
Rabbit's coming for you. Apex predator.

1478
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:57,042
Whoa!

1479
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:06,875
Here we go. Y'all watching this?

1480
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,193
I'm about to end this fool.

1481
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:12,739
Come on, come on, come on.

1482
01:23:12,764 --> 01:23:14,687
Keys, if you're there, 
a little help, please.

1483
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:26,923
God!

1484
01:23:26,941 --> 01:23:30,366
Okay, who did that? Who is doing that?

1485
01:23:30,391 --> 01:23:34,061
Don't play with me! Seriously!
I'm under way too much pressure!

1486
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,641
Come on!

1487
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,896
Go, go, go!

1488
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:02,858
I just checked with security.
Keys hasn't left the building.

1489
01:24:02,883 --> 01:24:04,199
Oh, sounds like
you've done everything possible.

1490
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,225
Time to give up? You wanna give up?

1491
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,251
No, I'm sensing you want me
to keep looking.

1492
01:24:06,276 --> 01:24:07,477
- Go.
- I'll be back.

1493
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:09,713
I have no idea
where these fools are running to.

1494
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:14,226
I do. Southern shore. Hitman's Beach.

1495
01:24:14,357 --> 01:24:16,632
Well, that's stupid.
There's nothing out there but water.

1496
01:24:16,657 --> 01:24:19,242
Game physics won't even let you
get past the shoreline.

1497
01:24:20,892 --> 01:24:22,894
Unless there is something out there.

1498
01:24:24,195 --> 01:24:25,905
Antwan, is there something there?

1499
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:28,439
Screw it.

1500
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,778
Art nerds.

1501
01:24:29,804 --> 01:24:31,084
Time for Dude.

1502
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:32,293
We're still working on him.

1503
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:36,030
I worked on him myself. He's perfect.
Drop in Dude now.

1504
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:38,562
Just do it. He's got, like, half a brain,

1505
01:24:38,587 --> 01:24:41,788
he's barely written, 
but, sure, start the upload.

1506
01:24:49,525 --> 01:24:50,854
What are we supposed to do now?

1507
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:52,672
Now Keys finds us a bridge.

1508
01:24:54,174 --> 01:24:57,010
Come to collect those knives
you stabbed in my back, bro?

1509
01:24:58,785 --> 01:25:00,739
You've been helping Millie Rusk
this whole time.

1510
01:25:00,764 --> 01:25:02,171
She's looking for your build.

1511
01:25:02,196 --> 01:25:03,572
What build, Antwan?

1512
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,952
It's not like you used
our code anyway, right?

1513
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,257
And if you didn't use our code

1514
01:25:07,282 --> 01:25:09,851
then how can our original build
be in the game, right?

1515
01:25:10,435 --> 01:25:12,194
Or am I missing something?

1516
01:25:14,227 --> 01:25:15,228
Leave us.

1517
01:25:18,869 --> 01:25:22,331
Okay, Keys, let's have a real talk.

1518
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,351
If I'd put out your dumb game,
it would have bombed.

1519
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,748
Antwan, you don't know it would've failed.

1520
01:25:26,773 --> 01:25:27,974
Yeah, I do know.

1521
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,002
I looked at the numbers,
the tracking, the focus groups.

1522
01:25:31,027 --> 01:25:34,921
Has it ever occurred to you that
some things matter more than numbers?

1523
01:25:34,946 --> 01:25:37,444
What matters more than numbers?
Money?

1524
01:25:37,469 --> 01:25:40,273
Yo, news flash, bro,
money is still numbers.

1525
01:25:40,298 --> 01:25:41,863
Nothing matters more than numbers!

1526
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:43,382
You should be thanking me!

1527
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,851
I should be thanking you? What about
the profits that you got from our work?

1528
01:25:46,876 --> 01:25:49,054
You chose your side, little Padawan.

1529
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:52,777
And now, it's time for you to take
your place next to the Emperor.

1530
01:25:52,802 --> 01:25:54,015
You get me, bro?

1531
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:57,124
Yeah, I get you. Bro.

1532
01:25:58,154 --> 01:26:00,573
Which leads me to this.

1533
01:26:15,839 --> 01:26:17,090
Thanks, Keys.

1534
01:26:21,721 --> 01:26:23,348
What the hell was that?

1535
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:26,187
Hey, Antwan, things are getting hectic.

1536
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,539
Oh, I thought 
you were smarter than this, Keys.

1537
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:34,649
You're obviously fired, you know that.

1538
01:26:34,674 --> 01:26:37,919
And, you, what is she still doing
in the game, man?

1539
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:38,945
Boot everyone.

1540
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:41,332
Hold up.
You want me to boot all the players?

1541
01:26:41,351 --> 01:26:43,103
Boot them out of the game, now!

1542
01:26:43,128 --> 01:26:44,762
Cancel every player account!

1543
01:26:44,953 --> 01:26:46,663
And where the hell is Dude?

1544
01:26:46,688 --> 01:26:49,590
Security! Kick this punk out.

1545
01:26:55,503 --> 01:26:56,504
Guy!

1546
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:58,523
- Millie!
- They're taking me out.

1547
01:26:58,548 --> 01:26:59,549
What's happening?

1548
01:26:59,574 --> 01:27:02,010
It's on you now. Everybody's watching. 
You gotta keep going.

1549
01:27:02,035 --> 01:27:04,442
Wait, wait, wait! Will I see you again?

1550
01:27:04,467 --> 01:27:06,371
You will if you make it
across that bridge.

1551
01:27:06,396 --> 01:27:08,356
Show the whole world our build.
That's the proof.

1552
01:27:08,381 --> 01:27:10,299
You do that, Antwan is done.

1553
01:27:11,013 --> 01:27:12,014
I'll make it.

1554
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:17,066
I'll make it.

1555
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:19,235
What the hell?

1556
01:27:21,216 --> 01:27:22,634
What's going on?

1557
01:28:02,218 --> 01:28:06,025
All right, let's all remember this moment, 
before we were fired.

1558
01:28:07,009 --> 01:28:07,736
Oh!

1559
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:09,661
Wow.

1560
01:28:14,562 --> 01:28:15,730
Catchphrase.

1561
01:28:16,015 --> 01:28:17,016
Catchphrase?

1562
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:19,424
What? I haven't had time
to think one up yet.

1563
01:28:19,449 --> 01:28:22,807
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase
is a pretty cool catchphrase.

1564
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:32,562
Get up, Guy. Get up.

1565
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:46,971
Oh, no, no, no.

1566
01:28:51,397 --> 01:28:53,588
Guy, I came to save you.

1567
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:57,858
Who is this?

1568
01:28:57,882 --> 01:28:58,924
I don't know.

1569
01:28:58,949 --> 01:29:00,159
He's glorious.

1570
01:29:01,864 --> 01:29:03,398
I mean, he's just like you,

1571
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:04,841
but way better.

1572
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:09,017
Way, way better.

1573
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:10,635
- Thank you.
- No, that's not a compliment.

1574
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,186
I wouldn't touch him if I were you, Buddy.

1575
01:29:12,191 --> 01:29:13,635
What do you mean
you don't think I should touch him?

1576
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:15,025
You don't mind this, do you?

1577
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:16,978
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

1578
01:29:20,775 --> 01:29:21,885
Yeah, I think he's gonna...

1579
01:29:22,526 --> 01:29:23,418
...hit you.

1580
01:29:23,443 --> 01:29:25,570
He punches so hard.
But yet his hands are so soft.

1581
01:29:25,595 --> 01:29:26,971
- Be strong.
- Okay, bye.

1582
01:29:26,996 --> 01:29:28,956
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

1583
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:36,664
Oh...

1584
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:42,670
No, no, no! No!

1585
01:29:42,837 --> 01:29:45,381
Get up, Guy, get up!

1586
01:29:46,039 --> 01:29:48,718
- Playtime's over. Catchphrase.
- I don't know what that means.

1587
01:29:51,455 --> 01:29:52,947
Come on, man. Get up!

1588
01:29:52,972 --> 01:29:53,973
Get up.

1589
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:57,935
There are three things I love in life.

1590
01:29:58,102 --> 01:30:02,565
Kickin' ass, TBD, third thing here.

1591
01:30:07,163 --> 01:30:08,717
Oh, shit!

1592
01:30:10,656 --> 01:30:12,200
Activate death blow.

1593
01:30:12,447 --> 01:30:13,448
Bye, Guy.

1594
01:30:18,081 --> 01:30:19,957
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

1595
01:30:22,055 --> 01:30:22,968
Get up!

1596
01:30:22,993 --> 01:30:25,453
Mum, he's coming in with a death blow!

1597
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,757
Get up, Guy.

1598
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:40,686
What the shit?

1599
01:30:48,236 --> 01:30:49,487
That was dope.

1600
01:31:05,653 --> 01:31:06,519
Hold on. Is that...

1601
01:31:06,543 --> 01:31:07,438
That's a...

1602
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:10,476
Yes! That's a lightsaber, Dude.

1603
01:31:10,501 --> 01:31:11,586
Mm-hmm.

1604
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:18,933
- Is that a lightsaber?
- It is.

1605
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:55,771
Oh!

1606
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:03,436
Guy!

1607
01:32:06,111 --> 01:32:06,956
Yes!

1608
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:09,483
Yes! That's right. Get up, Guy. Come on.

1609
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:31,556
There you go.

1610
01:32:32,298 --> 01:32:34,091
Do you see them all now? Yeah?

1611
01:32:34,116 --> 01:32:35,492
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

1612
01:32:35,517 --> 01:32:38,353
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

1613
01:32:39,889 --> 01:32:43,434
Yeah, there you go. Go get it.
Just lots of little snacks.

1614
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:50,058
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

1615
01:32:50,693 --> 01:32:52,603
Run free, better me.

1616
01:32:53,738 --> 01:32:54,906
Let's go.

1617
01:32:54,931 --> 01:32:56,391
Where are we going?

1618
01:32:56,614 --> 01:32:58,369
We can't let them get across that bridge.

1619
01:32:58,783 --> 01:33:00,681
You wanna finish this out with me?

1620
01:33:00,706 --> 01:33:03,667
Look, I don't even know what's going on,
but, hell yes, I'm with you.

1621
01:33:05,343 --> 01:33:07,053
Let's go!

1622
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:35,882
Antwan, come on, man.
What are we doing here?

1623
01:33:37,042 --> 01:33:38,881
Where are the servers to Free City 1?

1624
01:33:38,906 --> 01:33:41,659
No. Antwan,
what the hell are you doing?

1625
01:33:41,993 --> 01:33:45,335
If they get past that horizon
to the build, I lose everything!

1626
01:33:45,631 --> 01:33:47,233
Wait, so you did steal their code.

1627
01:33:47,258 --> 01:33:49,718
Welcome to the conversation, genius.

1628
01:33:49,743 --> 01:33:50,869
Now, where are those servers?

1629
01:33:50,894 --> 01:33:53,104
It's all of these, but hold on.
I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

1630
01:33:53,129 --> 01:33:55,413
- This one? 
- Yeah. How did you-

1631
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:03,117
Run.

1632
01:34:08,046 --> 01:34:09,047
Antwan!

1633
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,364
Stop!

1634
01:34:23,409 --> 01:34:24,660
Officer Johnny!

1635
01:34:24,685 --> 01:34:25,936
- Come on!
- Come on!

1636
01:34:29,516 --> 01:34:32,018
Which server has the ocean
and the rest of the bridge?

1637
01:34:32,043 --> 01:34:34,170
I'm not gonna tell you.
You're just gonna destroy it.

1638
01:34:34,195 --> 01:34:35,688
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

1639
01:34:35,713 --> 01:34:38,966
Except it's not. It's Keys' game.

1640
01:34:38,991 --> 01:34:40,614
You didn't do shit.

1641
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,559
And guess what? Keys is my boy.

1642
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:45,222
Security!

1643
01:34:45,395 --> 01:34:48,909
Please escort this former employee
off the premises.

1644
01:34:48,934 --> 01:34:50,936
He can call you by your real name.

1645
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:11,332
Guy!

1646
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:13,934
- Buddy! Buddy!
- No, no! Keep going!

1647
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:15,378
Go without me!

1648
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:18,005
I've been scared my whole damn life.

1649
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:21,448
But I'm not scared anymore.

1650
01:35:24,762 --> 01:35:25,930
I'm sorry.

1651
01:35:26,617 --> 01:35:27,869
I'm not.

1652
01:35:30,733 --> 01:35:32,652
It's been the best day of my life.

1653
01:35:33,429 --> 01:35:35,223
You get to that build.

1654
01:35:36,675 --> 01:35:38,134
You show 'em we matter.

1655
01:35:44,046 --> 01:35:48,634
That security guard right there
was a goddamn hero.

1656
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:30,098
You did it!

1657
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:41,536
Yes! Yes!

1658
01:37:41,813 --> 01:37:44,149
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

1659
01:37:45,504 --> 01:37:46,964
Antwan, stop!

1660
01:37:47,869 --> 01:37:49,120
It's over.

1661
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:52,873
He made it.

1662
01:37:53,142 --> 01:37:56,840
Got your game's original build out there
for everyone to see.

1663
01:37:57,209 --> 01:37:58,973
Probably win your lawsuit, huh?

1664
01:37:59,565 --> 01:38:00,566
Looks likely.

1665
01:38:00,818 --> 01:38:02,028
Cool.

1666
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:04,215
And here's the thing, bro.

1667
01:38:04,525 --> 01:38:05,825
Here's the thing.

1668
01:38:06,215 --> 01:38:09,090
Right here, I've got everything 
you care about.

1669
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:13,322
The sliver that's left of Free City,
all your little background friends.

1670
01:38:13,347 --> 01:38:15,512
Including your digital boyfriend,

1671
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:17,601
Last server.

1672
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:23,570
Look, I just want the world that I built
and the people in it.

1673
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:25,200
What's in it for Antwan?

1674
01:38:25,377 --> 01:38:26,503
Everything else.

1675
01:38:26,528 --> 01:38:28,606
Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb.

1676
01:38:28,631 --> 01:38:30,800
You have the rights to our code,
keep all the profits,

1677
01:38:30,825 --> 01:38:32,708
just give me what's left of Free City.

1678
01:38:33,242 --> 01:38:35,119
Let me build my own world from there.

1679
01:38:35,144 --> 01:38:38,814
What about Free City 2? Free City 3?

1680
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:40,618
And all pursuant spin-offs?

1681
01:38:40,643 --> 01:38:43,189
All yours. Just put down the axe.

1682
01:38:43,754 --> 01:38:47,965
You know that this is, like, the dumbest
deal in the history of dumb deals, right?

1683
01:38:48,942 --> 01:38:51,212
I mean, you're talking about giving up
millions of dollars.

1684
01:38:51,237 --> 01:38:53,197
Why would anyone do that?

1685
01:38:53,222 --> 01:38:55,501
'Cause Keys and I made something great.

1686
01:38:57,891 --> 01:39:00,351
And I don't need money or fame
to prove that to myself.

1687
01:39:00,756 --> 01:39:03,829
I'm done playing your game, Antwan.

1688
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,946
It's time I played mine.

1689
01:39:09,445 --> 01:39:10,738
Deal?

1690
01:39:19,973 --> 01:39:22,146
Popping today and not in a good way.

1691
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:24,674
Sales for Free City 2 continue to slip

1692
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:29,062
with numerous reports of bugs
in the code and lagging online play.

1693
01:39:29,087 --> 01:39:32,901
Embattled Soonami game founder Antwan
Hovachelik finds himself in the crosshairs.

1694
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:36,196
Crosshairs. He's in the crosshairs 
and embattled.

1695
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:37,448
We're too busy to gloat.

1696
01:39:37,473 --> 01:39:39,475
I'm a victim! I'm a victim!

1697
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:43,479
Speaking of busy, we just doubled the
amount of unique visitors we can handle.

1698
01:39:43,504 --> 01:39:46,210
It's amazing.
Who'd have thought that so many people

1699
01:39:46,235 --> 01:39:49,196
would just wanna watch video game
characters instead of shoot at them?

1700
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:50,865
Hmm.

1701
01:39:51,879 --> 01:39:54,015
- Oh, yeah, we did.
- Yeah.

1702
01:39:55,751 --> 01:39:58,128
You know, you're pretty cute
when you brag.

1703
01:39:58,564 --> 01:39:59,773
Antwan out!

1704
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:04,296
Meanwhile, the game Free Life is quickly
becoming the little indie that could.

1705
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:07,699
Players are swarming to this
observational, fishbowl game

1706
01:40:07,724 --> 01:40:10,906
where they interact peacefully with
the one and only Blue Shirt Guy

1707
01:40:10,931 --> 01:40:13,976
and his now no-longer-in-the-background
a digital friend.

1708
01:40:14,001 --> 01:40:15,031
Uh, hey, Mills.

1709
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:19,660
Do you wanna come grab a coffee with me?

1710
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,929
Actually, I'm gonna jump back
into the game.

1711
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:24,785
Oh.

1712
01:40:24,809 --> 01:40:25,888
Coffee?

1713
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:28,374
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

1714
01:40:28,941 --> 01:40:30,648
I'll just, uh, grab you one.

1715
01:40:30,959 --> 01:40:32,049
Oh, Keys, uh...

1716
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:34,789
- I know, medium coffee, cream, two sugars.
- Yeah.

1717
01:40:45,128 --> 01:40:46,370
Hi, Randy.

1718
01:40:46,387 --> 01:40:47,515
Milton.

1719
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,004
Hmm.

1720
01:40:51,747 --> 01:40:53,742
I was wondering when I'd see you again.

1721
01:40:54,683 --> 01:40:56,671
Yeah, life has been pretty crazy lately.

1722
01:40:57,219 --> 01:41:00,640
You should see it in here. We're
talkin' free bubble gum ice cream for life.

1723
01:41:00,665 --> 01:41:01,921
Wow.

1724
01:41:05,096 --> 01:41:06,097
Hey, guys.

1725
01:41:15,844 --> 01:41:17,106
Look, Guy...

1726
01:41:17,994 --> 01:41:20,163
Wow, this is harder than I thought.

1727
01:41:20,734 --> 01:41:22,402
Then let me do it for you.

1728
01:41:23,306 --> 01:41:24,661
Guy,

1729
01:41:27,403 --> 01:41:30,864
you are dreamy.

1730
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:37,139
Your taste in blue shirts
and five-octave musical superstars,

1731
01:41:37,164 --> 01:41:41,376
it's deeply, deeply attractive to me.

1732
01:41:41,401 --> 01:41:43,528
But I can't keep spending
all my time with you.

1733
01:41:44,344 --> 01:41:49,091
I created this world,
but I can't live my life in it.

1734
01:41:53,764 --> 01:41:56,225
See? Was that so hard?

1735
01:41:57,193 --> 01:41:59,028
So, what are you gonna do?

1736
01:42:00,036 --> 01:42:02,880
Anything I want. Thanks to you.

1737
01:42:04,064 --> 01:42:05,786
I'm not stuck in a loop any more.

1738
01:42:05,811 --> 01:42:07,313
Neither are you.

1739
01:42:09,606 --> 01:42:11,316
I love you, Millie.

1740
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:16,005
Maybe that is my programming talking,
but, guess what,

1741
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:19,286
someone wrote that program.

1742
01:42:21,545 --> 01:42:23,588
I'm just a love letter to you.

1743
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:27,286
Somewhere out there is the author.

1744
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:49,081
You brought him to life.
You brought him to life.

1745
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,463
And he was alive because
he met the one person

1746
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,286
he'd been waiting for his whole life.

1747
01:42:53,311 --> 01:42:55,708
And I had to make it realistic, so...

1748
01:42:57,391 --> 01:42:59,226
...I based it off of...

1749
01:43:01,265 --> 01:43:02,266
...you.

1750
01:43:04,307 --> 01:43:06,372
The woman of his dreams,

1751
01:43:09,067 --> 01:43:10,819
she was the same as mine.

1752
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:17,072
So she liked bubble gum ice cream
and swing sets and she had this very cute

1753
01:43:17,092 --> 01:43:21,075
but oddly specific habit of always humming
this classic Mariah Carey track.

1754
01:43:21,967 --> 01:43:25,012
Like, all the time, she would repeat.

1755
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:29,454
Finally!

1756
01:43:36,213 --> 01:43:37,214
Keys!

1757
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:46,630
What are you...

1758
01:44:27,922 --> 01:44:29,495
You okay, little guy Guy?

1759
01:44:29,845 --> 01:44:31,768
You seem adjective.

1760
01:44:31,793 --> 01:44:34,651
I'm great. I'm great.
You could put me down, by the way.

1761
01:44:34,676 --> 01:44:36,345
Thank you. That was nice.

1762
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:39,956
No, I'm great. You're great, Dude.

1763
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,126
I just miss my best friend.

1764
01:44:44,636 --> 01:44:47,956
We used to do the same walk together 
every day.

1765
01:44:47,981 --> 01:44:51,370
Except he wore a shirt.
And could complete a full sentence.

1766
01:44:51,395 --> 01:44:53,105
I can bench press a sentence.

1767
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:56,634
Yeah, that's totally not
the same thing at all.

1768
01:44:57,487 --> 01:44:58,786
Harder laughter!

1769
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:00,612
Oh.

1770
01:45:00,637 --> 01:45:01,682
Guy?

1771
01:45:04,675 --> 01:45:05,541
Buddy!

1772
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:06,467
No!

1773
01:45:06,513 --> 01:45:07,862
Oh, my God! Guy!

1774
01:45:07,887 --> 01:45:09,487
Buddy! I thought I'd lost you!

1775
01:45:09,513 --> 01:45:10,514
You didn't!

1776
01:45:10,539 --> 01:45:12,823
One minute, I'm running
on a crazy bridge to nowhere,

1777
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:15,284
thinkin' my sweet mundane life is over.

1778
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,522
The next minute,

1779
01:45:16,546 --> 01:45:20,315
I'm like in some type of flyin'
and some, like, fairy dust, pixie dust,

1780
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:24,094
and then I plopped down
into this slice of heaven.

1781
01:45:24,335 --> 01:45:26,612
Man, I love it here.

1782
01:45:27,385 --> 01:45:29,324
In fact, a couple of days ago,
I rode a centaur.

1783
01:45:29,349 --> 01:45:30,717
Now, it might sound weird,

1784
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:34,121
I took a piggyback ride on a half-dude
and a half-horse,

1785
01:45:34,146 --> 01:45:36,399
whatever a centaur is, I did it.

1786
01:45:36,424 --> 01:45:37,932
I rode a dude, too!

1787
01:45:37,964 --> 01:45:39,112
Friendly gesture!

1788
01:45:39,137 --> 01:45:40,305
So friendly!

1789
01:45:41,122 --> 01:45:42,457
Come on, bring it in!

1790
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:43,803
- Are we gonna hug?
- I'm coming for you!

1791
01:45:43,828 --> 01:45:45,338
- No, you're not. I'm coming for you.
- Yes, I am!

1792
01:45:45,363 --> 01:45:46,817
You come here! I'm coming to you!

1793
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,468
I'm reeling you in. I'm reeling you in.

1794
01:45:51,477 --> 01:45:52,937
Buddy, I missed you!

1795
01:45:52,962 --> 01:45:55,308
Hey, so where's the bank?

1796
01:45:56,716 --> 01:45:57,967
There is no bank.

1797
01:45:58,173 --> 01:45:59,424
So what do we do?

1798
01:45:59,768 --> 01:46:01,811
Whatever we want.

1799
01:46:10,777 --> 01:46:12,385
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Guy.
