1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:01,595
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:03,253
You're no longer you.

3
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:05,750
You're a part of a negative force.

4
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:08,460
Thawne's Speed Force is
fueled by negative emotions.

5
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:09,824
- What do you do?
- Trust me,

6
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:11,346
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,970
You're not super satisfied
with your secret identity.

8
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,206
Are you saying I don't want to be Vibe?

9
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,300
There won't be any future for any metas

10
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:19,810
if we don't get rid of that dagger.

11
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,803
If anything's gonna destroy that dagger,

12
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:22,976
it's this Mirror Gun.

13
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,027
It works.

14
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,482
Follow my instructions

15
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,641
and we'll defeat Cicada,

16
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:27,726
destroy her dagger,

17
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,002
and save your father.

18
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:31,252
Thawne is manipulating her.

19
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:33,762
He's on death row, how
is he manipulating her?

20
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:35,372
Something doesn't add up.

21
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,293
The dagger is Thawne's plan.

22
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:40,007
Don't shoot it!

23
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:45,266
I always wanted to be a hero,

24
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:50,240
to use my extraordinary
abilities to help people.

25
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:52,092
That's why I came here.

26
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:56,079
To meet my family, to stop Cicada,

27
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:58,248
help fix the Flash's legacy,

28
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,174
and save him from
disappearing in the future.

29
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:04,129
I believed I could do the impossible,

30
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,369
but I never imagined it
would turn out like this.

31
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,662
No, no! What's he doing?

32
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,222
Cicada... Thawne, dagger.

33
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,672

34
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,710
How's Ralph?

35
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:51,033
I've never seen anything like it.

36
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:52,394
I can't quite figure it out.

37
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:54,198
His cells are kinetically inverted.

38
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,972
It's like they're the
reverse of themselves.

39
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,774
Should've spent more
time trying to figure out

40
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:58,900
how this thing works.

41
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,502
I just don't understand
why he would jump

42
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:01,644
in front of that blast.

43
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:02,830
I mean, why would he do that?

44
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,665
That's the question, isn't it?

45
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,525
That's the question.

46
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,716
In other news, Cicada
deuce is still MIA.

47
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,488
All right, we should get to CCPD,

48
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,158
see if we can find anything
that could help us track her.

49
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:21,089
What?

50
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,041
I'm supposed to meet
up with Kamilla later.

51
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,083
I thought things were going
really well for you two.

52
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:26,186
They are.

53
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,546
I just haven't told her about

54
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,882
my vibratory alter ego yet.

55
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,435
Cisco, if you're serious
about being with her,

56
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:35,237
you have to tell her the truth.

57
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,848
I know.

58
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,760
All the metas that we couldn't cure,

59
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:44,138
we got safely evacuated
and they're waiting

60
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:45,780
at a protected holding facility.

61
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,565
Nice work, both of you.

62
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,783
Well the work's not done yet.

63
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,210
I mean, the metas are safe for now,

64
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,620
but Cicada's still out there,

65
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:53,196
so the people are still in danger.

66
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:54,789
Fill me in on the details.

67
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm ready for this nightmare to end.

68
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:59,077
It should've been over already.

69
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,629
Nora, look,

70
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:03,131
I'm sure Ralph had a good reason.

71
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,133
Until we figure out what
it is, we just gotta

72
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,144
concentrate on this, all right?

73
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,567
Wait a second.

74
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,761
What is that?

75
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,646
Looks like wood.

76
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:19,681
From what?

77
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:21,169
I mean the floor is marble,

78
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:22,420
furniture's untouched,

79
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:24,119
and the skylight's made
of glass and metal.

80
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,353
Well if it didn't come

81
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:26,750
from Cicada's point of entry...

82
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,837
She must've brought it
from somewhere else.

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,385
What do we do now?

84
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:33,700
You know what to do.

85
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:37,090
Hit them when they least expect it.

86
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,575
When they least expect it.

87
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,764
The Time Sphere.

88
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,290
If I repair it,

89
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,417
I can bring the last of the virus back

90
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,794
to the night of the
Particle Accelerator.

91
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:54,299
When meta-humans first
appeared in Central City...

92
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,302
And the Flash becomes a hero to stop me.

93
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:02,115
Destroy the meta-humans
before they destroy the world.

94
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:06,662
They'll be born only to die.

95
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,532
Definitely some kind of wood fragment.

96
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:13,217
And you think those will lead
us to where Cicada's hiding?

97
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,861
We can find out.

98
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,463
We can cross-reference this,
see what kind of wood it is,

99
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,024
then see where we end up.

100
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,618
Is there any progress on Ralph?

101
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,620
No, he's still unconscious,
and I can't figure out

102
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,181
a way to reverse his cells.

103
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,957
So I guess that means
we still don't know why

104
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,797
he jumped in front of
that Mirror Gun, do we?

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,262
We do.

106
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:33,748
We do...

107
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,466
because Dibny solved the
greatest mystery of all.

108
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:39,319
The Flash legacy, how to stop Cicada,

109
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,637
repentance for his past sins...

110
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,390
all the reasons Eobard
Thawne was helping you.

111
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,827
And stopping Dad from
disappearing in the future.

112
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,945
Disappearing in the
future is part of it, hmm?

113
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:51,331
But this has nothing
to do with your father.

114
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,578
The real reason that Thawne
wishes to defeat Cicada

115
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:57,987
and destroy Cicada's dagger

116
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:00,865
is because this dagger

117
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,160
is the only thing keeping
the Reverse-Flash in prison.

118
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,836
Guess this is it.

119
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,097
Looks like it, doesn't it?

120
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,673
Mm.

121
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:26,700
I almost forgot.

122
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,777
I contacted the Flash Museum,

123
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,946
had them send something over for today.

124
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,449
I thought it should
be buried for good...

125
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,057
along with you.

126
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,015
Consider it a parting gift.

127
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:54,636
Destroying Cicada's dagger in the past

128
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,256
will save Thawne from
dying in the future?

129
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,390
That's right.

130
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,368
Cicada's dagger has been dampening

131
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,519
Thawne's powers all this time.

132
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,733
So if we get rid of the dagger now,

133
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:06,374
it disappears in the future?

134
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:08,084
And Thawne gets out of Iron Heights.

135
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,027
A reverse time hack.

136
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,363
Everything you said
about Thawne is true.

137
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:15,022
The only person he
ever helps is himself.

138
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,432
Nora, this is not your fault.

139
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:17,869
Yes, it is.

140
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,959
Now the question we have to ask...

141
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:28,729
do we stop Cicada or do we stop Thawne?

142
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:31,683
No, we're not gonna let
thousands of meta-humans die,

143
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:33,008
now or in the future.

144
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,256
We find Cicada.

145
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,594
We destroy the dagger once and for all.

146
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,319
You gotta get out of here.

147
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,413
No, we gotta wait for the results...

148
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:47,314
We can handle it until you get back.

149
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,149
Go see Kamilla.

150
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,398
How do you choose?

151
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,958
That's more of a question
for Iris than for me.

152
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,085
Hey.

153
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,438
Hey.

154
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,590
She seems to be happy with my photos.

155
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:16,006
I was kinda hoping she'd
send me over to CCPD

156
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,427
to take photos of the meta-humans

157
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,929
when they were getting that cure.

158
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:22,116
Can you imagine being there
when that Cicada guy attacked?

159
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:26,362
Cicada woman, actually.

160
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,706
A woman?

161
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:34,203
Her name's Grace Gibbons.

162
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:36,655
Her uncle was the first Cicada.

163
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:42,453
She killed him after he
took the meta-human cure.

164
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:44,163
The cure that I made.

165
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:46,165
The cure you made?

166
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,505
You're serious.

167
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,150
That's the scientific project
you've been working on?

168
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:58,987
At S.T.A.R. Labs.

169
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:02,898
You never told me your
lab was S.T.A.R. Labs.

170
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,809
There's a lot I haven't told you.

171
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:07,903
What is that supposed to mean?

172
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,018
You're Vibe.

173
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:38,841
Look, Kamilla,

174
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:41,855
I've seen firsthand how hard it is

175
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,692
to have two lives like this.

176
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,412
And I tried to separate you from that,

177
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:49,871
but I don't want to keep
this from you anymore.

178
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,615
I can't keep lying to you like this.

179
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:55,001
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:00,456
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,175
Cisco, wait.

182
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:06,470
I totally get it.

183
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,680
I've read a lot of comic books.

184
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,233
I know all the tropes that go with

185
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,519
revealing secret identities.

186
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:16,396
But in real life, I
would never expect you

187
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:18,518
to tell me something
like this right away.

188
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:24,363
You're amazing, you know that?

189
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,490
Cisco, this isn't about me.

190
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,367
It's about you.

191
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:32,013
If being Vibe is a part
of the life you want,

192
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,173
I would never get in the way of that.

193
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,928
You know you really are a lot like me.

194
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:42,047
Trusting.

195
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,300
And you always blame
yourself when things go wrong.

196
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:47,361
How do I fix this?

197
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,923
I don't know if you can, Nora.

198
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,776
You made a mistake,

199
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,369
you know?

200
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:58,021
A big mistake.

201
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:00,857
Sometimes in life, all we can do is just

202
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,901
live with the consequences.

203
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,287
So what you have to ask yourself is

204
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,739
what kind of hero are you gonna be?

205
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,702
One who takes a do-over
after every mistake,

206
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:15,798
or one who lives with
it and moves forward?

207
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,409
Nothing?

208
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,816
Nope, I still cannot
figure out how to reset

209
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:39,152
his cells back to normal.

210
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,588
He's till Humpty Dumpty'd, huh?

211
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:41,520
Yep.

212
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:42,883
He hasn't been this much of a mess

213
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:44,697
since he first got his powers.

214
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,235
Since...

215
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:50,164
And what did you do to help him then?

216
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,618
We introduced a stabilizing
enzyme that reset

217
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,954
his body back to its original
form using vulcanization...

218
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:56,931
and muscle memory.

219
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,549
Muscle memory.

220
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:01,126
Well then it appears
all that we need to do

221
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,166
is wake him up.

222
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,604
How would you suggest we do that?

223
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:06,015
Simple.

224
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:07,633
We blast him.

225
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:09,335
We blast him?

226
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:12,438
If you blast him, the vibrational jolt,

227
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,932
it will be more than enough to
kick-start his consciousness.

228
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:16,763
I'm sure of it.

229
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,454
Can't we just play some Gaga

230
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:19,621
and hope he wakes up?

231
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:21,598
Gaga is not the solution to everything.

232
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:22,522
You have to blast him.

233
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,000
Allez, young Ralph Macchio, please.

234
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:26,123
Be careful. This could
get a little ugly.

235
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,959
Okay.

236
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:32,472
Sorry, deuce.

237
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:45,712
WrestleMania!

238
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:47,930
Voilà! Good as new.

239
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,493
Blasted why you happen what?

240
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:50,676
Hmm?

241
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,752
B-b-blasted why you happen what?

242
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,179
Except for the language skills.

243
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,640
Those will return, probably.

244
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,903
Everybody going, where is?

245
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:03,854
Everybody going where... every...

246
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,315
What is it?

247
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:07,074
It's the wood particles you guys found.

248
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,118
"Swish ash".

249
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,787
Part of the flowering ash
trees indigenous to Europe,

250
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,132
but also make up our biggest wood space

251
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,508
not 12 miles from Central City.

252
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:16,684
Kolins Woods.

253
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,167
That's where Cicada almost killed me.

254
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:20,489
That's also one of the largest
wooded parks in the country.

255
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:23,314
- We need a better plan.
- I've got one...

256
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:26,327
that can stop Cicada and Thawne.

257
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,758
Out to sniff? So really
we're using her Cecile?

258
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:37,221
Well, she is a highly sensitive empath

259
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,349
and Cicada emanates hate.

260
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:40,892
DA Cecile Horton will serve

261
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,417
as our early warning detection system.

262
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,374
If we're lucky, Cicada
won't see what's coming.

263
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:48,942
Then once we find Cicada to entrap her,

264
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:51,169
we give Young Grace the
choice to take the cure.

265
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,405
And hopefully, when
she's no longer a meta...

266
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,737
That bitch will cease to exist.

267
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,024
That way we can stop
her without destroying

268
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,244
the dagger and Thawne never goes free.

269
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,686
Now all you have to do is help Grace

270
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:01,663
make the right choice.

271
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,132
What do I say?

272
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,352
Whatever's in your heart. She'll listen.

273
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:07,043
What a bunch of sentimental crap.

274
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,118
You two sound like a
friggin' Hallmark movie.

275
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,471
I hear ya, sister.

276
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:12,281
I think we're close.

277
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:13,425
You good?

278
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,762
Oh, yeah, jeez, sorry.

279
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:19,431
Uh, this way.

280
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,316
Here we go.

281
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:24,078
The Sphere is ready.

282
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,320
We can leave.

283
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,382
Guys, we found her. Get ready.

284
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:46,707
I'm actually glad you
found me before we left.

285
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,919
Now I can end your lives twice today.

286
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,896
Not on my watch.

287
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,099
- We got her.
- Nora, you're up.

288
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,024
If you can connect to Grace as an adult,

289
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,547
you can connect with her as a child.

290
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,661
You just have to tap into her anger.

291
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,080
You can do this.

292
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,210
You shouldn't have come back here, Nora.

293
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:31,555
I had to, Grace,

294
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,939
because a lot of people are
gonna die unless you help me.

295
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:37,985
If I can help it, you'll
be the first to die.

296
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,513
Uh, the force field's integrity

297
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:44,399
just went down to 86%.

298
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:47,995
Grace, I know you think your
uncle wanted all metas dead,

299
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:49,521
but he was a meta.

300
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,022
That's why he took the cure

301
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,482
and why he wants you to have it too.

302
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:55,085
You're a meta, just like your uncle.

303
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,996
No I'm not! Take it back.

304
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,178
70%... 52...

305
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,872
Don't listen to her, Gracie.

306
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:09,165
This hate. It's consuming you,

307
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,759
turning you into a monster.

308
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:12,924
And what's worse, you're all alone.

309
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:14,868
Uncle Orlin wouldn't leave me.

310
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,381
He had no choice.

311
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,675
Take the cure just like your uncle did.

312
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:20,385
No.

313
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,179
40%.

314
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,903
Nora's gotta convince Grace now.

315
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:41,456
Metas killed your parents, Gracie.

316
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,866
They all deserve to die.

317
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:45,327
Don't believe him, Grace.

318
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,703
This is just in your mind.

319
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:47,921
She's right, Gracie.

320
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:49,623
It's why you created him.

321
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,041
He's the man who took care of you.

322
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,860
19%.

323
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:58,663
I know a part of you
knows that this is wrong.

324
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:00,737
But the other dark part
of you is out there

325
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,895
in the real world
killing innocent people.

326
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,721
You can make a choice to stop it.

327
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:05,653
How?

328
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,723
Wake up and take the cure.

329
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:08,808
Shut up.

330
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,160
You can do this, Gracie.

331
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,562
Get ready.

332
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:18,338
Grace.

333
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:19,535
- Gracie.
- Grace.

334
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:20,990
- Grace. - Grace.
- Grace.

335
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:22,172
Grace!

336
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,973
Okay, I don't want people to die.

337
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,342
I'll take the cure.

338
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:43,235
Thank you.

339
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,850
Here she comes.

340
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:52,828
Okay.

341
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,455
Did it work? Guys, what's happening?

342
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:17,853
Joe, no!

343
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,682
Now I'll finish what I started.

344
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:38,876
It didn't work.

345
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:40,503
That shard in her head.

346
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,336
It's still part of the dagger.

347
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,579
Its dark energy is enough
to counteract the cure.

348
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:47,800
If we want to cure Grace,
we must destroy that dagger.

349
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:05,576
You took my family away from me, Flash.

350
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,987
Now watch me take yours.

351
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,345
No!

352
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:10,444
Barry!

353
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,479
Just in time.

354
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,474
Gentlemen.

355
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:38,828
I hate to inform you, but...

356
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:43,082
You're all dead.

357
00:19:57,622 --> 00:19:59,747
Thawne...

358
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:02,041
I... I can help you.

359
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:05,479
Isn't this ironic?

360
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:12,486
Time to repent.

361
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:25,722
Consider this a parting gift.

362
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,415
Just... in...

363
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:18,868
Well, well.

364
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,162
It appears as if someone has figured out

365
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:24,165
how to reverse time.

366
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,976
Clever girl.

367
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:27,636
We figured out everything.

368
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:30,805
Oh, really?

369
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:32,399
What have you figured out?

370
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:35,903
We figured out why you sent Nora back,

371
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:38,647
why you had her punch
DeVoe's satellite...

372
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:40,932
to create a Cicada we could stop.

373
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,150
Right?

374
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:43,343
A dagger

375
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:44,912
we could destroy.

376
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:46,747
It was the dagger that was keeping you

377
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:48,356
in prison all along, wasn't it?

378
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:49,416
That's right.

379
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:50,992
15 years.

380
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,532
The second time I've
been stuck somewhere

381
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:56,420
against my will for 15 years.

382
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,156
Boring.

383
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,051
Except for your visits, of course.

384
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:04,246
You're leaving out the
most delightful part:

385
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:06,623
how you both helped me escape.

386
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,176
We helped you?

387
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,627
That's right. When you traveled

388
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,337
to the Time Vault, remember that?

389
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,423
Oh, we need help trying to figure out

390
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:15,060
how to drain dark energy

391
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:17,218
from the "one who got away".

392
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,020
Cicada!

393
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:22,932
Remember that? When you blurted that out

394
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:25,193
in the middle of the Time
Vault, so that years later,

395
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,270
when I ended up with
Cicada's dagger strapped

396
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:30,773
to my chest, I knew
exactly what I had to do:

397
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,701
get Nora Allen to trust me.

398
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:33,803
Easy.

399
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:37,487
Just like when I got you to trust me,

400
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,642
and then everything
starts falling into place.

401
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:42,160
Why?

402
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:45,663
Because I am the only speedster

403
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:48,499
that knows how to
manipulate the timeline

404
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,645
to get what I want,

405
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:54,723
orchestrate the changes that I need,

406
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:57,244
some of which...

407
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:58,885
are happening right now,

408
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:00,845
to ensure one thing:

409
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,992
that I go free.

410
00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:07,352
We don't need a dagger to stop you.

411
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,329
Well then,

412
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:13,649
let's just see how much
your father taught you.

413
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:53,998
I guess you're not as
good a teacher as I am.

414
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,025
You can't save him, Nora.

415
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:58,194
No matter what you do,

416
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:03,241
no matter what you try, the
Flash will always vanish.

417
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:06,428
That is his legacy.

418
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,164
Isn't this nice?

419
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:48,786
Team Flash, back together again...

420
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,621
with a new guy.

421
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:51,789
Ralph Dibny.

422
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,434
Welcome. You should be dead.

423
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:56,294
Yeah, I guess we have that in common.

424
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,464
We'll take care of that in a moment.

425
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,090
Iris.

426
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:02,467
Always a pleasure.

427
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:03,985
Frost.

428
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:09,098
Cisco.

429
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,267
It warms my heart to see you again.

430
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,644
I want to apologize for...

431
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:16,272
But had I not done that,

432
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:21,461
you never would've had the
means to become extraordinary.

433
00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:23,112
I don't need powers for that.

434
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,317
Now!

435
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:15,590
It's not my father's legacy
that's gonna disappear, Thawne.

436
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:17,091
It's yours.

437
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:18,852
- Nora!
- Hey!

438
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:22,838
So close, Little Runner.

439
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,266
It was never going to work anyway.

440
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:31,180
Mom? Dad?

441
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:34,159
- No, no, no, no.
- Mom, what's happening?

442
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:38,253
- A new timeline is setting in.
- What?

443
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:41,022
A new timeline that you created

444
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:43,043
when you destroyed the dagger!

445
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:46,079
I'm sorry, Little Runner,

446
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:48,197
for trading you in like this.

447
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:52,618
But I had to be sure
that I could go free.

448
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:56,213
You can still save her, Barry.

449
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,059
There's still time.
You can still save her.

450
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:01,085
How?

451
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,920
The Negative Speed Force.

452
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,547
She has to go there.

453
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,217
It's the only place immune
to timeline changes.

454
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:10,237
But you have to go now.

455
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,072
You have to go, Barry!

456
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:14,711
Or we lose her forever.

457
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:20,071
That's right. I've
grown fond of her too.

458
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,498
In many ways.

459
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:25,794
She's shown me what it's
like to have a daughter.

460
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:31,331
See you in our next crisis.

461
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,323
I can't do this.

462
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,311
Yes you can, yes you can.
You have to, all right?

463
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:01,646
Just hold on a little longer.

464
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:03,456
No, Dad, I can't.

465
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,940
Nora!

466
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:07,370
I can't.

467
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:11,905
- Nora, what are we doing?
- It's too late.

468
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:13,314
No, it's not. We gotta go back.

469
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,575
- Dad, no.
- Barry, you have

470
00:28:14,578 --> 00:28:16,159
- to take her back.
- I know, I know.

471
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,745
- Mom, Mom.
- I know, I know.

472
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:19,246
Nora, you have to go back now.

473
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:20,790
No!

474
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:26,220
If I go back in, the
Negative Speed Force

475
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:27,870
will be a part of me forever.

476
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,233
No, we'll get it out of you, Nora.

477
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,799
We can get it out. We can save you.

478
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:33,733
- Please, I promise.
- Mom, you can't.

479
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:36,230
Mom, you can't.

480
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:39,475
None of you can.

481
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:40,872
It's making me like Thawne.

482
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,905
Full of anger and hate.

483
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:46,565
I... I don't want that to be my legacy.

484
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,001
- This is all on me.
- No.

485
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:49,860
All of it.

486
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,245
My mistake.

487
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:54,332
And I'm not gonna make another one.

488
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:57,886
Sometimes all you can do is
live with the consequences.

489
00:29:03,093 --> 00:29:04,625
Oh my God.

490
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:07,378
It's okay. It's okay.

491
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:10,565
It's okay.

492
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,861
We love you.

493
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:18,073
Thank you for everything.

494
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:53,257
We're so sorry.

495
00:29:57,555 --> 00:30:00,931
We have to believe that
we'll see her again.

496
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,201
We will.

497
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:09,249
Nora...

498
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:12,693
made sure that we didn't
lose everything tonight.

499
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:14,495
She saved every meta in the city.

500
00:30:14,497 --> 00:30:16,497
And she gave Grace a new future.

501
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:17,987
Gave all of us, right?

502
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,979
Especially me.

503
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:21,001
Without Nora, I never would've met

504
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:23,096
the love of my life, Renee.

505
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,915
And you wouldn't have
stopped your 38th Cicada.

506
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,184
Or your 39th.

507
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,614
Right.

508
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:33,923
It's been quite a journey.

509
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:38,093
Plaisir.

510
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:40,563
An honor, Flash.

511
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:43,191
We never could've solved
this mystery without you.

512
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:45,526
Well, don't be too sure.

513
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:48,529
You already have a master
detective in your midst.

514
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:52,125
Congratulations, Adult Giraffe.

515
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,541
Well done, Sherloque.

516
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:01,294
Sherlock.

517
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,541
Well, all right then.

518
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:07,216
Without further ado.

519
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:15,172
Mes amis.

520
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:17,390
Good luck, Team Flash.

521
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,068
It's Singh.

522
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,404
Yeah, he, uh... he wants
us to meet him in CCPD

523
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:31,956
and bring Barry.

524
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,860
Yeah, go.

525
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:38,713
I kinda want to be alone anyway.

526
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:27,988
Is everything okay?

527
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:35,379
What Thawne said...

528
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:38,332
I don't want that.

529
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:41,245
I don't want the extraordinary thing

530
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:44,677
about my life to be my powers.

531
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,340
No one feels that way.

532
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,751
Here's the thing.

533
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:50,927
I do.

534
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:02,689
All these years I thought that Vibe

535
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:06,067
was the person I was supposed to be.

536
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:12,282
I think it's time Cisco
finally got his turn.

537
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:15,679
So what does that mean?

538
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,119
It means I want to take the cure.

539
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:32,928
- If you do this...
- There's no going back.

540
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:41,436
I know.

541
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:57,281
Killer Frost and I are
really gonna miss Vibe.

542
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,745
Me too.

543
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:28,889
How do you feel?

544
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:34,172
Scared.

545
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:37,742
But I'm hopeful.

546
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,982
Before I forget,

547
00:34:44,984 --> 00:34:47,818
I left you something in the workshop.

548
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:53,466
Just, you know, my way
of saying thank you.

549
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,382
For what?

550
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,729
Being a great friend.

551
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,626
Well, Grace Gibbons
is currently scheduled

552
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:20,988
to meet with our county counselor.

553
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:22,820
And as soon as possible,
we'll get her in with

554
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:24,322
a good foster family.

555
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:26,449
Look, I won't keep you long,

556
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:27,969
but I just want to thank you

557
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:29,746
for being at the forefront with Cicada.

558
00:35:29,749 --> 00:35:31,801
Just doing our job, sir.

559
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:35,215
Well, you went way beyond
just doing your job.

560
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:37,668
And I know you did it
because of how much

561
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,837
you care for the people of this city,

562
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,217
which is how I know I can
leave it in your capable hands.

563
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:46,093
What do you mean, leave it?

564
00:35:46,095 --> 00:35:48,416
The mayor's offered me the job

565
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:51,212
as the new chief of police.

566
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,514
What?

567
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,993
- Dave.
- David.

568
00:35:53,996 --> 00:35:55,937
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

569
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:57,828
Thank you, thanks.

570
00:35:57,831 --> 00:36:00,167
Of course that leaves me
responsible for finding

571
00:36:00,169 --> 00:36:01,910
my own replacement.

572
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:04,579
And, uh...

573
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,340
I would like that to be you, Joe.

574
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:11,169
Re... replace you?

575
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:12,471
As... as captain?

576
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:14,380
Captain Joe West.

577
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:16,057
Oh, I like the sound of that.

578
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,875
And don't worry.

579
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:20,503
If things get dicey, as
they tend to around here,

580
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:23,264
you'll have plenty of help.

581
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,649
Isn't that right, Flash?

582
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,638
Oh come on, Barry.

583
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:32,558
I'm a detective too.

584
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:34,370
Sir.

585
00:36:38,898 --> 00:36:40,188
Congratulations.

586
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:42,121
I'll do my best.

587
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:54,168
Hey.

588
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:08,955
Now I know what my
dad meant when he said

589
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,570
being a parent is like
wearing your heart

590
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:12,981
on the outside of your body.

591
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,891
Yeah.

592
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:17,935
Thawne got away.

593
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:20,563
Again.

594
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:25,493
Nora's gone.

595
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:29,998
Should feel like a loss but,

596
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,847
I also feel...

597
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,434
- Pride?
- Pride, yeah.

598
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,124
She did good.

599
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:45,346
Yeah.

600
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:49,276
She was the best of both of us.

601
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:53,262
She was my legacy all along.

602
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:57,311
And us, together, as a family,

603
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:59,915
that's how I want to be remembered.

604
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:02,985
As a good man,

605
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,922
a loving husband...

606
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:10,613
A supportive father.

607
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:14,876
You're already all of those things.

608
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,219
Nora felt that way too.

609
00:38:30,843 --> 00:38:32,603
- Time language.
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,231
No matter what changes
with the timeline,

611
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,742
that'll never change.

612
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:45,749
We'll always have this to remember her.

613
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:08,062
Hi, Mom and Dad.

614
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:09,448
If you're watching this,

615
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:12,691
it means that something went wrong.

616
00:39:12,694 --> 00:39:15,195
But I don't want you guys to be sad.

617
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:16,863
I'm not.

618
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:20,725
I always wanted to be a hero,

619
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:24,329
to use my extraordinary
abilities to help people.

620
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,159
That's why I came here:

621
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:29,376
to meet my family, stop Cicada,

622
00:39:29,378 --> 00:39:31,878
help fix the Flash's legacy,

623
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,796
and save him from
disappearing in the future.

624
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:39,217
I believed I could do the impossible,

625
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,681
but I never imagined it
would turn out like this.

626
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:46,160
I'm glad it did.

627
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:48,895
I wouldn't change anything

628
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:51,386
about my time with you,

629
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,298
my sweet parents,

630
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:57,736
the most important people
to me in the world.

631
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:05,561
I wish I could be there to
celebrate every new chapter,

632
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:08,915
to witness every success.

633
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,833
Just know...

634
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:17,497
that no matter where I go in my life,

635
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,003
you'll always be my side.

636
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,690
Because of you,

637
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:34,715
I know I will never,
ever, truly be alone,

638
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:39,930
and I will feel your love
and support like a warm hug

639
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,517
comforting me,

640
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,981
wishing me to be the
best person I can be.

641
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,671
Thank you for everything...

642
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,836
For making me a hero

643
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:00,892
and for loving me even
if I wasn't perfect.

644
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:04,137
Please remember that I love you both

645
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,825
and I always will,

646
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:10,142
no matter what the future brings.

647
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,549
