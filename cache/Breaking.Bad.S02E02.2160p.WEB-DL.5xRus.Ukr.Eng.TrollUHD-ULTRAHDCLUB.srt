1
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,979
All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:39,719
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning

3
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:42,096
we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:44,140
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:48,436
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:52,232
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,070
So study the face. Study the file.

8
00:01:57,278 --> 00:01:59,656
Get a big old raging hard-on

9
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:03,159
at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

10
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,079
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

11
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:10,124
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

12
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,876
All right.

13
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:14,003
On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,297
Reputed to have whacked one "Dog" Paulson

15
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:19,383
back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away

16
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,010
from the SoCal biker gangs.

17
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,639
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:28,476
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals

19
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:31,435
I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance

20
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,773
of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:36,943
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:39,278
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that,

23
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:40,988
but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:43,658
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

25
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:48,017
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:51,332
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,334
We sure don't want it going on up here

28
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:55,218
which brings us to the good news.

29
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,924
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:04,012
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

31
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,770
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law

32
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,559
a.k.a. Gonzo.

33
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:14,230
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body...

34
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,939
Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

35
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:20,486
When he got his arm crushed clean off.

36
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:23,745
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

37
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:25,909
Anyway. The upshot is

38
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:31,456
we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint

39
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:35,084
which belongs to Señor Tuco.

40
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,880
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:42,550
That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,054
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

43
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,765
- Yes.
- Yes.

44
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:50,473
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,102
Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:56,522
- Do you wanna find this guy?
- Yes!

47
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:59,275
- Are we going to find this guy?
- Yes!

48
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:00,777
- Louder, damn it!
- Yes!

49
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:02,904
- Give me a "hell, yeah!"
- Hell, yeah!

50
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,822
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

51
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:08,535
<i>Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.</i>

52
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:14,624
They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:17,043
<i>Guy is in México by now.</i>

54
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:20,255
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:24,925
Listen, I gotta take some personal time.

56
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,719
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:31,474
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

58
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:34,935
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,981
Damn. You don't think he...?

60
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,568
Holler if you need me.

61
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:44,654
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:05:56,517 --> 00:06:00,897
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so...

63
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:05,235
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:07,779
Without the hair.

65
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:11,699
Hey, it's me.

66
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:15,411
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,039
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:20,500
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,086
- What about height and weight?
- Five eleven

70
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:25,421
most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:30,051
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,096
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:36,558
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:39,102
What about other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,604
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:46,859
- Anything that might help us.
- Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:48,862
That's fine.

78
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,030
- Is that the list of medications?
- Yes.

79
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:53,741
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:57,537
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,248
Has he been depressed?

82
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:10,216
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,135
Yeah.

84
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:16,639
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:17,974
Agitated?

86
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:22,645
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:26,566
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:35,325
When I asked him what was wrong, he said:

89
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,077
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:42,289
Then he just walked out of the room...
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,000
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,253
And when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:50,048
Nothing else missing?

94
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:55,261
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:59,140
But... What about the phone call?

96
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:02,685
I'm looking into it.

97
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:06,814
- What phone call?
- Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:11,361
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,198
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

100
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:17,200
I mean

101
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,244
couldn't that be

102
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,329
important, right?

103
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,960
Anything else you can think of?

104
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,712
Anything else.

105
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:32,048
No. I called
the credit card providers,

106
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:37,387
and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:41,933
I... Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

108
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,227
Every police station. Every morgue.

109
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:47,105
So, no, I really don't...
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:50,817
I was actually hoping
that you had something else

111
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,528
being that you're the expert.

112
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,367
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,910
No worries.

114
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:04,873
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,586
- Mrs. White.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:12,213
- Walter.
- Thank you.

117
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:25,268
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

118
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:27,395
- And?
- Never happened.

119
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:29,063
No record of it.

120
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:31,566
- Second cell phone.
- Yeah. I'm thinking.

121
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,084
I understand.

122
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,880
Out.

123
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,048
Get away from me!

124
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,220
Settle down, bitch.

125
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:28,725
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me in here!

126
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,227
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

127
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,479
That way, you have to clean it up!

128
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,860
It's your ride, retard.

129
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,018
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.

130
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,208
Get up.

131
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,752
Get up.

132
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:06,471
Oh, my God.

133
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,765
Don't do this, Tuco.

134
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:35,518
No more posters?

135
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,813
Walter Jr.'s making more.

136
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,527
Thank you, Marie.

137
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:51,117
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

138
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:54,871
I mean, he just doesn't strike me
as the type.

139
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,706
He'll turn up.

140
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:09,052
Okay, the whole tiara thing

141
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,805
- I just find it bewildering that...
- Marie.

142
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:15,892
- ...you didn't believe that...
- Marie.

143
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:19,562
Not now.

144
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:54,490
Empty your pockets.

145
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,688
Thought your name was Heisenberg

146
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:28,691
"Walter Hartwell White."

147
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,111
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

148
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:36,866
You know, a business name.

149
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:45,500
Yeah.

150
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:53,424
I like doing business with a family man.

151
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:56,219
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,965
Answer me one thing.

153
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:38,636
Can I trust you?

154
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:43,099
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

155
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:54,861
Sit down.

156
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:05,496
DEA...

157
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:09,959
...hit my place of business
this morning.

158
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,378
About a hundred cops looking for me.

159
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:17,091
- You two haven't been talking, right?
- No.

160
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,718
No.

161
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:23,806
Picked up my whole crew, top to bottom.

162
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:27,060
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,312
That's weird, right?

164
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,982
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

165
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,902
It's weird. Yes.

166
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,487
Unusual.

167
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,073
Unusual.

168
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,995
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

169
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:50,500
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

170
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,212
Explain to me.

171
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:59,509
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

172
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,351
I saw this coming.

173
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,146
I can see the future, you know?

174
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:17,026
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

175
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,770
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

176
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:23,366
Gonzo.

177
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:30,957
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

178
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:37,881
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

179
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:41,676
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skin him,

180
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:45,388
and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag,

181
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:49,726
and every time I hit him,
it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!

182
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:53,980
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

183
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:06,201
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

184
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:08,328
What?

185
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,664
You're saying, Tuco...

186
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:14,667
You're saying that Gonzo

187
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:19,172
is currently operating
as a police informant

188
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,590
as far as you know?

189
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:26,262
I'm very sorry to hear that.

190
00:20:27,472 --> 00:20:29,307
That's disappointing.

191
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:30,934
Yeah.

192
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,103
- I'd waste him too, yo.
- Shut up.

193
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:35,688
Okay.

194
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,775
They're out there looking for me
right now.

195
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:41,778
They got ghetto birds and black ops.

196
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:46,115
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

197
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:54,082
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

198
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:58,336
No, it's... It's killer.

199
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:00,088
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:07,637
So I was thinking last night.

201
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:09,472
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:18,398
- Mexico?
- We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

203
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:20,358
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,069
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:25,279
And no Federales are gonna mess with us

206
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,574
because I got my people there.

207
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:29,576
Connections.

208
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:33,997
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

209
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,291
Tuco, I...

210
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,127
I have a wife and family.

211
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,505
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:46,759
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just

213
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:49,345
uproot my life like that.

214
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:51,514
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,269
Who's talking to you?

216
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:02,650
You need me, man

217
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:06,029
because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

218
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:10,366
Yeah.

219
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:12,160
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:15,205
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,540
Stink or no stink

222
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:22,212
one bump, you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:27,884
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:30,428
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:22:30,637 --> 00:22:33,473
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

226
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:39,062
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:42,857
What secret ingredient?

228
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,860
Chilli powder.

229
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:54,494
I hate chilli powder.

230
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,543
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:05,838
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

232
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:13,263
We're gonna rewrite history with this.

233
00:23:17,392 --> 00:23:21,437
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:25,567
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:27,777
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:31,281
He's my partner.

237
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:36,578
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:41,958
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now

239
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,085
to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset,

240
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:48,631
and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,176
And you...

242
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:56,389
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

243
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:15,992
- Where are you going?
- Louis is taking me to the train station.

244
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:17,952
We'll put these up.

245
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:22,165
- No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
- He wants to help, let him help.

246
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:25,793
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

247
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:30,089
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:33,760
For chrissake, you got a bun in the oven.

249
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,262
I got my cell if you need me.

250
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,556
- Okay?
- Okay.

251
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:43,645
- Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
- All right. Bye.

252
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:51,069
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet

253
00:24:51,277 --> 00:24:53,112
bodes well.

254
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:58,576
Well, I mean, if he... You know.

255
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:02,664
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,458
There's got to be something.

257
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,717
Some detail that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:12,131
- What about the second cell phone?
- Jesus.

259
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,969
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:19,472
Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:27,897
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:30,406
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

263
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:33,361
No incoming, no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,613
But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:42,036
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

266
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,833
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

267
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,086
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,966
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,094
What does it mean?

270
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:00,553
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:04,767
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:08,813
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

273
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:13,943
- Okay. Everyone. Okay.
- Skyler, come on.

274
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:18,072
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:23,912
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,539
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

277
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,083
Walt? Please.

278
00:26:33,463 --> 00:26:39,093
- What about the marijuana?
- He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:41,304
Says who? Him?

280
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:43,640
Chemotherapy and marijuana go together

281
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:47,769
like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:52,649
Maybe he's addicted to the pot,

283
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:55,025
and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:58,196
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:26:58,404 --> 00:27:01,604
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:06,329
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:08,122
He may know something.

288
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:17,340
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:21,344
Then grasp.

290
00:27:31,104 --> 00:27:32,856
Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:27:33,815 --> 00:27:36,943
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,529
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:42,657
- Why?
- I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:47,287
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:50,707
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

296
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:54,252
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,088
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes, ma'am.

298
00:27:57,297 --> 00:28:00,967
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:04,095
- Really?
- Yeah.

300
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,684
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

301
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:12,228
He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,814
He was one of the few teachers who cared.

303
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:16,923
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,569
I'm so sorry to hear about his illness.

305
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:21,477
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,949
I certainly will, as soon as he turns up.

307
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:26,367
He's missing, actually.

308
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:28,828
Just kind of walked off, or...

309
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,332
Anyway, which is why I'm going around

310
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,292
trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,086
That's terrible.

312
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,589
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:42,759
Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son...

314
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:46,012
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:50,266
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:54,604
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:58,775
I don't necessarily. I just...

318
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:01,483
- Are you with the police?
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

319
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:08,576
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:10,328
Oh, my God.

321
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:11,621
Is my son in trouble?

322
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:14,290
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,001
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,860
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this

325
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:22,548
coming here and asking questions
about my son and...

326
00:29:22,632 --> 00:29:25,051
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,930
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:30,938
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:36,145
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:40,191
I'm sorry. I would like to help you,

331
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,902
but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

332
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:46,489
I don't expect to see him anytime soon.

333
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:51,411
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,667
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:02,255
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:07,886
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education

337
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:12,307
as he has
on that ridiculous bouncing car...

338
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:15,685
Low rider, huh?

339
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,479
Gomey, hey.

340
00:30:18,688 --> 00:30:21,638
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out

341
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,818
a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo

342
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:28,448
registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.

343
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:31,784
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:35,538
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:39,083
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

346
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:08,029
Chilli powder.

347
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:12,075
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

348
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:13,618
Whatever, man.

349
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,578
At least I tried something.

350
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:17,705
Hey, it almost worked too.

351
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:21,000
How's about you leaving my gun, huh?

352
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:24,045
First you boost it,
then you leave it in your house.

353
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:25,922
My gun.

354
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:32,762
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

355
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:36,140
Well, at least he wants you alive.

356
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:11,968
Hey, I don't get it.

357
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:15,179
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo, then who did?

358
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:17,098
I don't know.

359
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:19,642
I don't know.

360
00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:22,937
Does it really matter?

361
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:27,108
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant

362
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:29,402
who does he automatically blame?

363
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:31,446
Us.

364
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,825
We need a plan.

365
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:41,331
- Think, think.
- Let's just bum-rush him, man.

366
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:43,791
You crack him over
the head with something,

367
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,044
and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:53,635
Crack him over the head with something?

369
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:59,515
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man, all right?

370
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,517
You're as good as checked out already.

371
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:05,688
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

372
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:07,315
Just...

373
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,445
Oh, so my life is not the priority here

374
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:15,198
because I'm gonna be dead soon anyway.

375
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:17,200
That's your point?

376
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,410
Yeah.

377
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:50,108
We gotta get him to take this.

378
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:52,694
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chilli P.

379
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:54,737
That much has been established.

380
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:57,907
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump...

381
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,875
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

382
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,687
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

383
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:31,149
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

384
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,482
<i>Take it easy, Tio.</i>

385
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,986
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

386
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:26,663
What?

387
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,339
I get it, I get it, I get it.

388
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:40,760
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

389
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:43,179
I tell you, Heisenberg.

390
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,349
Old people.

391
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:49,185
You feed them, huh?

392
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,021
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country,

393
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,608
and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

394
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,070
You better eat every bite of that.

395
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:25,054
What did you do that for?

396
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:27,181
God!

397
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:13,770
Hey, look. Look.

398
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:15,605
There's nothing left.

399
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:45,677
What? What do you want?

400
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,351
No.

401
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,813
Don't even tell me that you're hungry.

402
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,273
Don't go there.

403
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:13,580
<i>Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?</i>

404
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,501
What, you don't like them?

405
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:21,838
One ding.

406
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:25,425
<i>That means yes. Tio don't like you.</i>

407
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,515
<i>Why don't you like them, Tio?</i>

408
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:37,854
You don't trust them?

409
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:49,866
<i>- Why don't you trust them, Tio?
- Tuco, come on. He's...</i>

410
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:54,037
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

411
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,219
<i>Did they do something to you, Tio?</i>

412
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:14,682
Something that you don't like?

413
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:25,735
<i>What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?</i>

414
00:39:25,944 --> 00:39:27,237
Nothing. Nothing.

415
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:32,242
<i>- Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
- I don't know. I swear. I don't know.</i>

416
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,247
No, I... Maybe it was... I did change
the channel on his TV, but...

417
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:39,707
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking

418
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:43,419
he was watching one of those telenovels

419
00:39:43,628 --> 00:39:46,380
with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

420
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:48,257
I told you not to change the channel.

421
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:51,344
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

422
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:00,979
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

423
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,606
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

424
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:06,766
Did they change your mamitas?

425
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,037
<i>What are you telling me, Tio?</i>

426
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,125
Are they punking me?

427
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:39,934
Hey. No.

428
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:43,563
No, man. No.

429
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:45,231
- Come here!
- No.

430
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,985
No, no, Tuco.

431
00:40:55,825 --> 00:40:58,828
Tuco, no. Tuco.

432
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,001
Shut up!

433
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:20,975
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

434
00:41:21,184 --> 00:41:23,686
No, God. I don't wanna die.

435
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,855
Tell me what you did, Walter!

436
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:29,359
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

437
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:33,321
- No!
- Tell me what you did!

438
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:41,412
We tried to poison you.

439
00:41:42,997 --> 00:41:45,124
We tried to poison you

440
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:51,047
because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth,

441
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:53,216
and you deserve to die.

442
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:38,052
Who's the bitch now?

443
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:00,533
Let him bleed.

444
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,137
The keys.

445
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:23,723
Tuco.

446
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:26,184
Oh, my God.

447
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:29,646
The cousins?

448
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:27,878
What the hell is going on?

449
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:41,551
Jesse Pinkman.

450
00:44:42,302 --> 00:44:44,512
You're a hard man to find.

451
00:44:52,604 --> 00:44:54,939
Oh, shit.

452
00:45:06,284 --> 00:45:07,911
Easy.

453
00:46:24,737 --> 00:46:26,906
Oh, my God.

454
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:32,036
Oh, God. Hank.

455
00:46:32,245 --> 00:46:33,663
- Who?
- Hank.

456
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:35,248
What?

457
00:46:35,456 --> 00:46:37,166
- Oh, my God.
- What?

458
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:40,545
- Oh, my God.
- Stay. What are you doing?
