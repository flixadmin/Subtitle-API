1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,920
<i>You have five minutes, quiz kids.</i>

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,160
A weapon is en-route
to destroy the city.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,960
I can't take on Nygma
and Barbara

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,520
and the rest of
them by myself.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,880
You said you wanted to build an army,
right?

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,440
What about an army of freaks?

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,040
Who ordered the hit on my father?

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,080
Frank Gordon. Your uncle.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,000
You have the right to remain silent.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,080
Dock 9C.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,520
It's where
the weapon will be arriving.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,920
Jim, do I hear
a favor coming on?

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,200
What is coming into Dock 9C?

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,520
Now, I know who I am,
I'm the Riddler.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,960
It's good to see you too.
How'd things go with Selina?

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,880
- This is what I was made for.
- The clone is in place.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,040
Good evening, Alfred.

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,120
And to you, Master Bruce.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,760
You need to join
the Court of Owls, Jim.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,720
A woman named Kathryn
is going to call.

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,720
- He would have been so proud of you.
- No!

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,080
Kathryn, I presume.
I killed my uncle.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,720
I make no apologies for it.

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,480
- Maybe it's time we meet.
- My thought exactly.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,600
Hello?

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
Anyone home?

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,520
When this guy gets home, we got
to ask him to kick on the heat.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,440
It's colder in here
than it is out there.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,200
Fascinating.

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,440
I know you're hell-bent
on getting revenge on Nygma and all,

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
and forming an army
of freaks is a great plan, I mean,

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,640
it was my idea, but...

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Quiet.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,080
I think I hear something.

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,400
Do you think it's him?

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,360
Mr. Fries.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,240
Welcome home.

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,560
I see you still hold me responsible
for all of that

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,760
awful monster rhetoric

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,280
- I spewed during my campaign.
- You ran people like me

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
out of Gotham.

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,400
We both know I only said those things

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,240
because that's what
the voters wanted to hear.

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,720
Your experiments, Mr. Fries.

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
You're trying to reverse
your condition, aren't you?

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
I can help you.

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
And why would you do that?

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,600
My enemies took everything from me.

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,280
Tried to murder me.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,280
You help me get my revenge

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,720
and when I take back my throne,

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,360
I will give you every
resource you need

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,120
to free yourself from
this icy prison.

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,960
Even if I wanted to say yes,

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,200
I can only survive a few hours
outside the cold without my suit.

58
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
And you don't have it

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,400
because it's been locked away
in a Wayne Enterprises black site

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,000
ever since you escaped Indian Hill.

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Ivy?

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
My suit.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
So, Mr. Fries...

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Will you join us?

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
{\an5}Where are we?

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,680
{\an5}Where we are is not important,
James.

67
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,400
{\an5}What matters is why you're here.

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,840
{\an5}- You know why I killed my uncle.
- Yes, I do.

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,600
{\an5}Frank murdered your father.

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,120
{\an5}What I need to know is if you hold us
accountable for his action.

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,400
{\an5}Frank acted alone.

72
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,160
{\an5}He admitted as much to me.

73
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,480
{\an5}Good.

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,760
Then we can proceed.

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,320
{\an5}The city needs you now,
more than ever, James.

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,880
{\an5}There's turmoil ahead,

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,280
{\an5}and good men like you are going
to be needed to hold it together.

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,280
{\an5}But make no mistake,

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,320
{\an5}the Court
and the Court alone, can save Gotham.

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,120
{\an5}So, what do you want me to do?

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,080
{\an5}Prove your loyalty to
the Court.

82
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,880
{\an5}- Killing my uncle wasn't enough?
- That was between you and Frank.

83
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,600
{\an5}It had nothing to do with us.

84
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,080
{\an5}When the time is right,
we will call upon you.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,080
{\an5}And Frank's body?
It's still in the brownstone.

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
We've already taken care of it.

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,800
{\an5}- Who is the stiff?
- Jim's uncle, Frank Gordon.

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
{\an5}- Never met him.
- They were estranged.

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
Have you seen Jim?

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,480
{\an5}He's working a case.

91
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,280
{\an5}Or he's walking in
the door as we speak.

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,560
{\an5}Hey, Jim. Come in,
we have some bad news for you.

93
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,080
{\an5}- What's going on?
- I'm sorry.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,400
{\an5}We found your uncle's body
this morning.

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
He was pulled out of the harbor.
I did my prelim.

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,920
The burns on his left temple suggest
he was shot at close range.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,640
Lab is running ballistics.

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,400
You saw him at
the cemetery yesterday.

99
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
He seemed on edge.
Did he say anything?

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,640
No. He just stopped by
to pay his respects.

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,880
We didn't talk much.

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
Thanks, Lee.
I'll take it from here.

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
That's it?
That's your reaction?

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
What do you want me to say?

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
I know you.

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,720
You're hiding something.

107
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
- You know something.
- Lee, come on.

108
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
- The man just lost his uncle.
- Yeah, Harvey,

109
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,920
you just keep covering for him.

110
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,360
My condolences.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,280
She is right.
You do know something, don't you?

112
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
Uncle Frank shot himself.

113
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,240
He said it was the only way
to get me inside the Court.

114
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,480
Did it work?

115
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,280
I met with a woman named Kathryn.

116
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,960
She says I have to prove my loyalty
to the Court first.

117
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
Look, I see
the need for playing it cool.

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,240
But right now, the Court is readying
a weapon that could destroy the city.

119
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,160
We don't have time
to sit on our thumbs

120
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
- and do nothing.
- I don't like it any more than

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,920
you do,
but if I push too hard

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,760
we might blow the only chance
we have at stopping this.

123
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,800
And Uncle Frank
will have died in vain.

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,400
Okay, so, what do we do now?

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,440
Kathryn said to get back to work.
Keep up appearances.

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
That shouldn't be too hard.

127
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
Look who resurfaced.

128
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,160
Hello?

129
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,440
Ed?

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,920
It's Barbara.

131
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,920
Your old friend you've
been blowing off.

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,120
I'll allow you to call me Ed
because we have history.

133
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,560
But my name...

134
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,360
is the Riddler.

135
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,680
So the headlines say.

136
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,120
Now, why are you here?

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,080
When Penguin was mayor,
did he mention a mysterious group?

138
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,840
One that controlled the levers
of power in Gotham from the shadows

139
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,160
with total impunity?

140
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,640
- No.
- See, I didn't claw my way

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,560
to the top only to find out there
was someone above me.

142
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I've been trying to find out
who they are,

143
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,240
but no one in this town seems
to know anything about them.

144
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,680
And how is it
that you know about them?

145
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,400
Jim Gordon put me onto them.

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,240
And what is his interest in all this?

147
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,400
He didn't say.

148
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,000
But he did ask me to investigate

149
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,200
a shipment coming
into Dock 9C yesterday.

150
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,000
The harbormaster was protecting
a crate from Indian Hill.

151
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,040
- What was inside?
- I don't know.

152
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,520
Before I got a chance to find out,

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,280
some masked assassin slaughtered
half my men.

154
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,480
What do you know?

155
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,520
When I was at Indian Hill,

156
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,160
Professor Strange hinted at some...

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Powerful, secret group,
but he didn't tell me who they were.

158
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,040
This is the one riddle that got away.

159
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,200
I will get you the answer you seek.

160
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,640
But I will do it in my own way.

161
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,360
You're gonna make a big production
of this, aren't you?

162
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,920
Only someone with power
and connections

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,480
would have information on this group.

164
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,120
I need to speak
with Gotham's elite.

165
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,120
And nothing brings out
the bourgeoisie quite like

166
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,160
opening night at
the theater.

167
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,080
Where wilt thou lead me?

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Speak,

169
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,960
for I will go no further.

170
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,080
I say, Ghost,

171
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,200
speak your business
or I shall go no further!

172
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,840
My business is not with you,
Prince of Denmark.

173
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,800
But with your audience.

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,440
I've come to address you,
the ruling class of Gotham.

175
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,280
You've kept a secret
for far too long.

176
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
But tonight,

177
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
I will kidnap...

178
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,600
and torture one of you
to expose the truth.

179
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,200
So spread the word to all your
friends, the Riddler is coming.

180
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,880
Also I found your performance
to be wooden and unrealistic.

181
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,880
And scene.

182
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,600
And that, my old mucker,
is checkmate.

183
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
Good game, Alfred.

184
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,560
You let me win, didn't you,
Master Bruce?

185
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
- No way, Alfred.
- No way, my foot.

186
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,680
That's very unlike you, isn't it?

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
And to be honest, I mean,
you haven't been yourself these

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,960
past few days, have you?

189
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,280
I don't know
what you're talking about.

190
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
I think you do know
what I'm talking about, so come on.

191
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Out with it.

192
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,120
The other day when I came home,

193
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,680
you asked how things
were with Selina.

194
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,360
I made it sound like things
were hopeful.

195
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I lied.

196
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
She said she never wanted
to see me again.

197
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,960
I was embarrassed.

198
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
I was afraid...

199
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
you'd ask me about seeing Selina
and I'd lie and...

200
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,360
- I just didn't wanna talk about it.
- Well...

201
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
Then I understand, Master B.

202
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
And thank you very much
for being so candid.

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,160
And I really wouldn't worry
about Ms. Kyle.

204
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,920
You know, time has a way of sorting
these things out, doesn't it?

205
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,960
Talking of which,
I should check on the dinner.

206
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,320
Alfred.

207
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,600
Sir?

208
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
Thank you.

209
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,120
You're a good friend.

210
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,000
Glad to hear it, Sir.

211
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
It's me.

212
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,040
It's happening again.

213
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Hey.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,120
So the audience has
been accounted for.

215
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,800
Is this Hamlet?

216
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,520
I guess he wasn't meant to be.

217
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,440
You crossed paths
with Nygma recently.

218
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,840
Any idea what this secret is
he's talking about?

219
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
No, I have no clue.
My guess is he just made it up.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,480
- Captain, we got the all clear.
- All right.

221
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,880
This is all that's in there.

222
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
It's a riddle. Shocker.

223
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,200
Written in iambic pentameter
like a Shakespearean sonnet.

224
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,760
<i>"I am a man who holds
a high position,"</i>

225
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,320
<i>"who shows two faces
to all those he rules,"</i>

226
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,560
<i>"a fraud, criminal
and sometime politician."</i>

227
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,040
<i>"Gotham, my constituency of fools."</i>

228
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,120
A two faced politician whose
constituency is Gotham.

229
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,800
- The mayor?
- "Fraud, criminal,"

230
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
sounds like he's describing Penguin,
but that doesn't make any sense.

231
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,000
Ed told Lucius he killed Penguin.

232
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,480
Aubrey James.

233
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,240
He was recently reinstated
and he's been mayor before.

234
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,080
"Sometime politician,"
but why not just grab him?

235
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,200
Why tell us in advance?

236
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,960
Because Nygma wants
to make a show of it

237
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,360
and make us look bad in the process.

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,320
Call the mayor's office.
Tell him we're on our way.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,120
We don't need Nygma for anything.
He should be dead by now.

240
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,840
He's obsessed with finding
the answer,

241
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,720
which is an easy solution for us.

242
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,760
Once he does, we'll get rid of him.
I promise.

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,360
And how's him causing
a scene at the theater help us?

244
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,960
It doesn't.

245
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,440
But it does help me more

246
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,040
fully announce myself on
the Gotham stage.

247
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,600
If you'll forgive the pun.

248
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,440
Do you wanna become famous?
Try dying.

249
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,520
- I can help you with that.
- Okay, that's enough.

250
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,960
What actually is your plan?

251
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Kidnap Mayor James.

252
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,560
The man ran this place for ten years.

253
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,200
If anyone knows about this
mysterious group,

254
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,160
- he does.
- You could have just said that.

255
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
I could have had him here,
being tortured.

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,200
Okay.

257
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,960
See, but first I had to tell
the G.C.P.D.

258
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
what I was going to do.

259
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,880
How else am I supposed to properly
embarrass them publicly?

260
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,080
My crimes must live up to my name,

261
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,600
- and this is no exception.
- And what if the mayor doesn't know

262
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,880
anything about this group?

263
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
What then?

264
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,440
I have a plan B to smoke
them out, but first...

265
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,480
I need something from you.

266
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,120
There's a biker bar on the corner
of Spaulding and Eighth.

267
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,920
It's full of brawlers, lowlifes.
I need a bomb to detonate there.

268
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,080
Tonight.

269
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,120
I'll let you know when.

270
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,360
So tell us, genius, how do you plan
to get Aubrey James

271
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,840
now, that you've told the G.C.P.D.
you're going after him?

272
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,160
Oh, that's simple.

273
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,520
They're gonna bring him to me.

274
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,280
You know how many crooked politicians
there are in this city?

275
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,760
This riddle could be for anyone.
Oh, my god, these are delicious.

276
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,960
All the same, Mr. Mayor,

277
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,440
we'd like to move you
to a safe house immediately.

278
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,000
Did you not see the muscle twins
over there?

279
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,920
I'm perfectly safe here.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Besides, what's the Riddler want
with me, anyway?

281
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,360
We're not really sure.

282
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,960
He did say something to the crowd
at the theater about a secret.

283
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,720
My life is an open book.

284
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,800
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mayor?

285
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,720
- You look a little...
- It's my blood sugar.

286
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,440
I've had too many of these Danishes.

287
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Where are my pills?

288
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
Wait a minute,
where did you get these?

289
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,920
An appreciative citizen. Why?

290
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,800
- Oh, boy.
- Nygma.

291
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,680
This is bad.

292
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,360
Coming through.

293
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,920
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

294
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,960
You cannot be serious.

295
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,760
I've seen mass graves more inviting
than this place.

296
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,520
Strange messed me up pretty good.

297
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
He convinced me
I was some sort of goddess,

298
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
and it took me a long time
to get over it.

299
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,400
Now, this place might be bad,
but Gotham is worse.

300
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,120
Hey, freak!
You're on company time.

301
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,480
Get back to work.

302
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,520
You don't have to take that.

303
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,560
You should totally kick his ass.

304
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,840
Yeah, but he's my boss.

305
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,400
Bridgit, there is nothing wrong
with being a freak.

306
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm a freak.

307
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,600
So is Penguin.

308
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
You belong with us.

309
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,120
We've met before, haven't we?

310
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, I'm Ivy Pepper.
Selina's friend.

311
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,960
Oh, I know.
I ran into one of Strange's puppies.

312
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,360
Kind of had a growth spurt.

313
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
Though, to be honest,
I'm not complaining.

314
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,640
Ivy.

315
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,320
And you're part of this?

316
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,480
Yeah.

317
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,320
It's almost like we're a family.

318
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,160
You don't have to be alone anymore.

319
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,680
I could kill your boss
just to sweeten the deal.

320
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
No.

321
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,800
Hey, you.

322
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
I quit.

323
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,560
Thank you for letting me come in.

324
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,560
The nosebleeds are getting worse.

325
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
You did the right thing coming here.

326
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,040
- What did you tell Alfred?
- Nothing.

327
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
I said I was tired,
then snuck out of my room.

328
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,480
I'm dying, aren't I?

329
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,880
Yes.

330
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,800
The process that brought you
into this world was flawed.

332
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,080
Will I die before Bruce returns?

333
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,280
No, Bruce Wayne will be back
in Gotham well, before then.

334
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
I know we've asked a lot of you.

335
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,800
After Indian Hill I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

336
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,040
You gave me a purpose.

337
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,000
That's more than
most people could say.

338
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm glad you see it that way.

339
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,480
When Bruce returns...

340
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,560
People are going to die,
aren't they?

341
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,680
A lot of people.

342
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,720
You haven't gotten attached
to anyone, have you?

343
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Alfred, perhaps?

344
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,440
- You've spoken fondly of him.
- No.

345
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,800
I just want to know.

346
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,560
The number is immaterial.

347
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,240
What matters is
that Gotham must fall.

348
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,480
And because of your sacrifice,
it will.

349
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
Can we count on you?

350
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Yes.

351
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,120
His BP is dropping.

352
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,360
- We need to stabilize him!
- I want this ER secured.

353
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,840
Badge access only.
No one gets in...

354
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
- Unless they're sick or dying.
- Ten-four.

355
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,360
Nygma knows this is
the closest hospital to

356
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,400
the mayor's office.
We brought him right to him.

357
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,080
Great, let him show his face.
I got unis all over the place.

358
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,960
But what are we missing, Harvey?

359
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,320
What could Aubrey James know
that's so important to Nygma?

360
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,800
<i>Paging Detective James Gordon.
Paging Detective James Gordon.</i>

361
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,520
- Where is that coming from?
- Communications room.

362
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,040
- Second floor.
- It's a trap.

363
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,560
<i>Please don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!</i>

364
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Stay here.

365
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,600
<i>So, Jimbo, I know you must be
wondering what I want from</i>

366
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,480
<i>that ding-dong Aubrey James.</i>

367
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,040
<i>Well, turns out, he has answers
to a riddle,</i>

368
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,360
<i>one that you put into motion
when you sent Barbara down</i>

369
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,520
<i>to Dock 9C.
The question being, who runs Gotham?</i>

370
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,160
- I got to get out of here.
- No.

371
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
Mr. Mayor, you're in no condition
to go anywhere.

372
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,960
- Jim, tell me you got him.
- He wasn't there.

373
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,080
But the secret he's after,
it's the Court.

374
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,080
<i>Lidocaine and an IV push.</i>

375
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
<i>- You better get back here quick.</i>
- What is it?

376
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,400
There was some kind of explosion.
A lot of victims.

377
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,760
I got a bad feeling.

378
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,000
<i>- It's him.</i>
- Don't leave the mayor's side.

379
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
Authorized personnel only.

380
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,800
Hell with that.
My friends got blown up!

381
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,360
Hello, Aubrey.

382
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
We got company.

383
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,320
Where is she?

384
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,400
Not here.

385
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,920
I know she
and Nygma kidnapped Mayor James.

386
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,960
Nygma mentioned Dock 9C
and she's the only one I told.

387
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
Nygma's got a big mouth.

388
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,560
Wait, wait, wait,
let me get this straight.

389
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,720
You mean this whole stupid riddle
thing with Nygma is real?

390
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,960
What? He clearly knows
everything already.

391
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,400
I heard a rumor he hurt you
pretty bad a while back, both of you.

392
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,920
Surprised you're defending him.

393
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,840
Listen, you tell me where they are,
I'll take Nygma down.

394
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,040
But I'll give Barbara a free pass.

395
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,200
It's true. I hate him.

396
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,760
But I don't know where they are.

397
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,160
Harvey?

398
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,880
Okay, I'll be right there.

399
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,880
Nygma sent another riddle.

400
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,160
Never should have brought Barbara
into this.

401
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
You better hope I get to her first.

402
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,520
You should have given that freak up.

403
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,880
No one wants Nygma dead more than me.

404
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
But I can't betray Barbara.

405
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,440
Yeah.

406
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,640
Because she's always got
your best interests at heart.

407
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,320
Listen.

408
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,440
You're in way over your
head on this one.

409
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,480
You don't wanna mess
with these people.

410
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,320
You see, everything that you say...

411
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,000
just makes me more intrigued.

412
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,360
And determined.

413
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,040
I will be the one who unmasks them.

414
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
You're insane.

415
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Remember me, Aubrey?

416
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,480
I know that voice.

417
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm so glad.

418
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,840
I thought maybe it got muffled.
We put that box on your head.

419
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,520
That was fun. We should do
that again for old times' sake.

420
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,680
You don't get it, do you?

421
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,320
These people, they,
they're like God.

422
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,760
They see and hear everything.

423
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,120
They'll know I talked.

424
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,800
- Then it's the box.
- No, no, no.

425
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,200
Please, anything but that.

426
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
They call themselves the Court.

427
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
And?

428
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,800
That's all I know.

429
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,880
I've never met these people.

430
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,640
I just did what they asked me to,
I swear.

431
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,640
Very good! Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

432
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,600
You've been very helpful.

433
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,360
Helpful?

434
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,760
All he gave us was "the Court."

435
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,440
He gave us tangible evidence
of their existence.

436
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,280
Now, they'll know I'm not bluffing.

437
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,400
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going to force the Court

438
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
to reveal themselves.

439
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,040
What is the one thing that every
secret organization is afraid of?

440
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,720
Being exposed.

441
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Bingo.

442
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,400
Finally. Did you bring
what I asked for?

443
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
It's time to get
the Court's attention.

444
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,560
Baby...

445
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,600
Gordon came to the club.
He knows everything.

446
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,040
You should have never gotten Nygma
involved.

447
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,360
I boosted the premium stuff, Otto.

448
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,320
You're welcome.

449
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Hello, Selina.

450
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
What the hell are you doing here?

451
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
I wanted to see you.

452
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,320
I missed you.

453
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,680
Did you fall on your head?

454
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,680
- I told you to stay away.
- You did?

455
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
I forgot.

456
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,240
Why are you acting so, weird?

457
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,520
I'm sorry, I...

458
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,000
I didn't sleep well, last night.

459
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,440
Well, I just came to feed my cat.
So if you're not gonna leave, I am.

460
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,120
I promised myself I'd stay away.

461
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,480
That it would be safer
that way, but...

462
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,160
Things have changed.

463
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,760
What are you talking about?

464
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
You know what? I don't care.
Just don't be here when I get back.

465
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
Selina, wait.

466
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
I'm not Bruce.

467
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,360
Jim?

468
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,240
- Lee, now, is not a good time.
- Your uncle's autopsy.

469
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
Ballistics came back negative.
No match.

470
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,480
But there were microscopic
tears along

471
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,160
the entry wound, made post mortem.

472
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,560
What are you saying?

473
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,960
Someone removed the bullet
that killed your uncle

474
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,800
and replaced it with another one.

475
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,720
It's an old mob trick to cover up
a murder.

476
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,840
- You're reaching, Lee.
- I don't think so.

477
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,640
And I think you know what happened.

478
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Listen to me.

479
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
You need to drop this.

480
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,720
- You could get yourself hurt.
- You think I care

481
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,120
what happens to me?

482
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,880
I am sick of watching you destroy
people's lives and get away with it.

483
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,560
When I find out what you did,
I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.

484
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,560
- And I'm gonna enjoy it.
- Jim, hey.

485
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,040
- Where is the riddle?
- Me and Lucius took a crack at it,

486
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,440
but maybe you'll have better luck.

487
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,160
<i>You can see me,
but you cannot touch me.</i>

488
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,800
<i>The flick of a switch,
I enter your home.</i>

489
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
<i>With another, I leave you alone.</i>

490
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,840
<i>- Where am I?</i>
- He's taunting us.

491
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
If he kills James,

492
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,720
the press is gonna hand us our asses
on the six o'clock news.

493
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,400
Harvey, you're a genius.

494
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,840
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

495
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,680
<i>I have a question.</i>

496
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,920
<i>What is this mysterious Court</i>

497
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,880
<i>that controls the levers
of power here in Gotham?</i>

498
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,600
Alvarez, go to Channel 7!

499
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,760
Find out where Nygma's

500
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,520
- broadcasting from.
<i>- And will they let our</i>

501
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,280
<i>dear mayor's head be blown to bits</i>

502
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,560
<i>in order to keep their anonymity?</i>

503
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
<i>- Are you watching the television?</i>
- I am.

504
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,440
The Court cannot be exposed.

505
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,440
We would clean this up on our own
but there are too many eyes watching.

506
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,600
<i>However,</i>

507
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,560
<i>this does afford us
an opportunity, James.</i>

508
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,800
To prove my loyalty.

509
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,880
You want me to find Nygma
and bring him to you?

510
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,120
I understand this puts you
in a difficult position.

511
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,960
He's a cop killer.
He belongs in prison.

512
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,560
<i>If you decline, this conversation
will be our last.</i>

513
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,880
The choice is yours.

514
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
That was the Court.

515
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,280
- If I hand him over, I'm in.
- They'll probably kill him.

516
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,000
And if I don't, we'll never stop them
from destroying the city.

517
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,320
<i>I know what you're thinking,
Aubrey.</i>

518
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,120
That the police are gonna somehow
find you, rescue you.

519
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,920
But I gave the G.C.P.D.
every chance to save you.

520
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,600
<i>But they're no match for me!</i>

521
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,600
We're both dead men.

522
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,560
You don't get it, do you?

523
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,320
The Court isn't gonna bargain
with you.

524
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,600
You underestimate me, Mr. James.

525
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,720
- Hello.
- Nygma.

526
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,960
<i>Jim, I'm so sorry.</i>

527
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,440
We can't be clogging up the lines.

528
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,080
I'm actually expecting
an important call.

529
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,920
<i>You want to know who runs Gotham?</i>

530
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,560
<i>I have the answer.</i>

531
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,720
Come by the G.C.P.D.
I'll tell it to you.

532
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,120
Yeah, I think I'll pass on that.

533
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,920
<i>Then you'll never know the truth.</i>

534
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,720
You think I told Barbara everything
I know?

535
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,800
You always were clever, Jim.
I respect that.

536
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
<i>Empty out the G.C.P.D.</i>

537
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,280
<i>I want it to just be you and me.</i>

538
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
<i>Alone.</i>

539
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,160
<i>Well,</i>

540
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,680
<i>and this idiot with the bomb
around his neck.</i>

541
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,600
You think he'll show?

542
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,600
The thing that drives Nygma
is also his weakness.

543
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,600
- He'll be here.
- It's not like every man,

544
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,720
woman and child in Gotham
isn't depending on you to succeed.

545
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,040
Yeah, no pressure.

546
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,920
- Good luck, pal.
- Thanks.

547
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,040
Where is Ed?

548
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,320
That lunatic dropped me off.
Sent me in alone.

549
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,480
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Sit down and shut up.

550
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
Ed?

551
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,360
It's just the two of us in here.

552
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,240
Just wanted to make sure
I wasn't walking into a trap.

553
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
No, oh, oh.

554
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Sit down, Aubrey.

555
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,200
You said you have
the answer I was looking for, Jim.

556
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,200
It would be incredibly disappointing
if this was all a ruse.

557
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,440
- More so for Mayor James.
- Just tell him what he wants.

558
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,840
He talks too much.

559
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,600
You should probably just go
ahead and blow him up.

560
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,200
I'll have your badge, Gordon.

561
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,400
I'm not bluffing, Jim.

562
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,840
Neither am I.

563
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,280
What's the blast radius on
that thing?

564
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,480
Am I good here
or should I duck behind a desk?

565
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,920
I want the answer, Jim!

566
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,080
I kill him,

567
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,920
I still walk out of here
with you as my hostage.

568
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,320
No! No!

569
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
No!

570
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Oh, come on.

571
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,520
There's a radio frequency jamming
the signal between

572
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,680
- the detonator and the bomb.
- How?

573
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,000
Tabitha.

574
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,920
She holds quite
the grudge against you.

575
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,120
She called me.

576
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,920
Told me how to disarm the bomb.

577
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,040
I'll admit, I didn't see this coming.

578
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,680
But that doesn't change anything.

579
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,520
I want to know...

580
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,480
...who the Court is.

581
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
Or Aubrey dies.

582
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Don't!

583
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,120
You want to know who runs Gotham?

584
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,800
Then let Mayor James go.

585
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,960
Take a ride with me.

586
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,800
But if you pull that trigger,

587
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,480
you'll never get
the answer you're looking for.

588
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,560
You fool me once, Jim,
shame on you.

589
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,640
You fool me twice...

590
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,440
Well, that's just not gonna happen.

591
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,360
Then the riddle will go unsolved.

592
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,000
Fine!

593
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Let's go.

594
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,840
Let me get this straight.

595
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,840
So this limo pulls up literally
out of nowhere,

596
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,640
and this creepy lady tells you
to get in

597
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,040
because "you could be
so, much more?"

598
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,880
And you did?

599
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,880
I had nowhere else to go.

600
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,760
So, where have you been
the last few months?

601
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,080
It's not important.

602
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
What matters is you need
to leave Gotham.

603
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,440
- Right away.
- Why?

604
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,640
Because the city has been judged.
And something bad is going to happen.

605
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,080
Judged by who?

606
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
The people who took you?

607
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,880
Wait a minute,
your clothes, your hair,

608
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,480
the way you talk.

609
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,000
- Where is Bruce?
- Selina...

610
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,680
- What did you do to him?
- He's fine. He's not in Gotham.

611
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,240
But nothing bad is going
to happen to him.

612
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
- Then where is he?
- It doesn't matter.

613
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,960
You just have to trust me.
You need to leave Gotham today.

614
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,320
Trust you?

615
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,640
- I don't even know you.
- Where you going?

616
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,240
To tell Alfred.

617
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,280
- Selina...
- Now, let me go!

618
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,680
- Selina, you can't tell anyone.
- Then why the hell did you tell me?

619
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,200
Because I care about you.

620
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,240
And if there's one person I want
to save, I want it to be you.

621
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,680
That's the difference between you
and Bruce Wayne.

622
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,920
He would try
and save everyone.

623
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,400
You can pretend all you want
but you will never be him.

624
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,040
You're nothing.

625
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,440
You're not even a real person.

626
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
You don't matter.

627
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,360
You're wrong about me.

628
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,720
I do matter.

629
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,480
- And I won't let you tell Alfred.
- Oh, yeah?

630
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,800
How you gonna stop...

631
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,760
You remember the night...

632
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,760
You came over to Lee's for dinner?

633
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,240
It was like a lifetime ago.

634
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,760
Leslie made fondue.

635
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,360
The wine was a Bordeaux.

636
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,240
Well, aged. Smooth tannins.

637
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,720
Ms. Kringle wore a black dress
with pink trim.

638
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
I tried like hell to get out of it.

639
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,440
But Lee insisted.

640
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,120
The truth is, I had a good time.

641
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,640
I considered you a friend.

642
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,960
I can sneak up on you
or be right in front of you

643
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,240
without you even knowing.
But when I reveal myself.

644
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,120
You will never be the same.

645
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,800
- What am I?
- I don't care, I...

646
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Betrayal.

647
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,920
That's how every friendship ends.

648
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,240
So...

649
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,880
So, what good are friends anyway?

650
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,720
- Who are they?
- The answer to your question.

651
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,080
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

652
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,040
I hear you've been asking about us.

653
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,880
How do I know you're real?

654
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,880
Isn't that the point
of a good mystery?

655
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,840
You're never quite sure what
to believe until the end.

656
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,480
Gordon could have put you up to this.

657
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,920
I assure you, Detective Gordon had
to be convinced to bring you here.

658
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,160
But let me put it like this,

659
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,960
that question Professor Strange
had you ask Bruce Wayne

660
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,840
and Lucius Fox last year
at Indian Hill,

661
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,640
the one that has tortured you,

662
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,680
the one you'll never be
able to answer.

663
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,240
That answer is with me.

664
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,040
- What now?
- Get in.

665
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,920
And all your questions
will be answered.

666
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,760
You won't be needing the gun.

667
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,160
You've made us proud,
Detective Gordon.

668
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,280
What are you going to do with him?

669
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,240
A man with Nygma's intellect
could be quite useful to us.

670
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,800
I'm sure we'll find something
for him to do.

671
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,760
We'll be in touch.

672
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,800
<i>Till the fearless come</i>

673
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,800
<i>And the act is done</i>

674
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,160
<i>A love like blood</i>

675
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,080
<i>A love like blood...</i>

676
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,320
Good evening, Ms. Kean.
May I offer you a drink?

677
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,800
Something went wrong.

678
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,680
Gordon took down Nygma
before he could find out

679
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,680
the truth about the Court.

680
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,000
Probably because I told Gordon
how to disarm the bomb.

681
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
What?

682
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Why?

683
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,520
You promised that when Nygma
handed over the underworld,

684
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,680
I would get to kill him.

685
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,400
Sealed it with a kiss, remember?

686
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,680
Don't you get it?

687
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,720
As long as the Court is out there,

688
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,080
I'll never be in control!

689
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,320
Don't you mean
we'll never be in control?

690
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,400
Seen it a thousand times.

691
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,720
Ambition, power.

692
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,760
People can't help themselves.

693
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,760
She's changed, baby.

694
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,200
- When are you gonna see that?
- Shut up, Butch!

695
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,240
Move!

696
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,640
This is trouble.

697
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,720
It's good to be home.

698
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,120
FYI, I've been to Wayne Manor.
It's way cleaner.

699
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,960
You never said anything about Fries
being a part of this.

700
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,880
You're a little hot.

701
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,800
Maybe you need to cool off.

702
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,120
Oh, come on, you guys.
We're on the same team now, remember?

703
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,400
A family?

704
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,600
Keep him away from me.

705
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,920
There's a question mark on your face.

706
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,080
You can sleep in the freezer.

707
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,320
<i>The study speculates</i>

708
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,440
<i>that widespread chemical dumping
is to blame.</i>

709
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,120
<i>And this just in we now, go</i>

710
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,840
<i>- to breaking news...</i>
- Hey, Pengy. Check it out.

711
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,520
Do not call me Pengy! My...

712
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,400
<i>A.k.a. Edward Nygma, was apprehended
by the G.C.P.D this afternoon</i>

713
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,800
<i>after kidnapping
Interim Mayor Aubrey James.</i>

714
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,040
<i>However, while en route to
Arkham Asylum, he managed...</i>

715
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,160
- Riddler.
- <i>to escape police custody</i>

716
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,800
<i>and is now, at large.</i>

717
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,080
How long did he have to think
about that one?

718
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,200
Rest up, everyone.

719
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Tomorrow is going to be a busy day.

720
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,680
I'd like to introduce our
newest member,

721
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,440
James Gordon.

722
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,160
Welcome to the Court of Owls.
