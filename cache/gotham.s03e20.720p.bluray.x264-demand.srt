that could destroy the city.

You've done it.
You've weaponized the virus.

We have to escape.

- There's only one way that's gonna happen.
- We work together.

31

Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered.

Thomas Wayne stood against The Court.

36

He threatened to expose us.

37

39
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,865
She had to die as well?

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,406
Why is Bruce Wayne here?

41
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,076
He has come to pass judgment.

You are the leader of The Court.
No one disputes that.

But you absent yourself from Gotham
for years at a time.

If Master Bruce was in that room,
he's being held prisoner or something.

he had anything to do with that carnage.

So what's the next step?

Because we hit every spot
on that crystal owl

and all we got were dead people
wearing owl masks.

126
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,500
your partner's backstabbing actually
led to an answer you were seeking.

Who controls Gotham?

It's an organization calling themselves
The Court of Owls.

And?

Who are they? What do they want?

131
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,973

was limited to a woman named Kathryn

there's no interest in the underworld.

So at least for now,
you shouldn't worry about them.

to help me murder him.

164

DR. THOMPKINS: Hello, Jim.

165
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,709
I knew you'd come.

166
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,713
Are you surprised?

167
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,174
You look surprised.

168
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,471
There's been a squad car
outside my house all morning.

169
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,065
That tells me you knew I stole the virus.

170
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,643
Thought you'd assume I'd inject myself.

171
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,362
I'd hoped I was wrong.

172
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,564
That'll teach you.

173
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,659
Can I get you something?
I know how you like your whiskey.

174
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,994
Why did you do this?

175
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,154
You know why, Jim.

176
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,117
JIM: You blame yourself
over what happened to Mario?

177
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,748
You didn't shoot him.
You didn't infect him.

178
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,496
It wasn't your fault.

179
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,840
I'd have to disagree with you on that one.

180
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,836
But, honestly, the whole argument
is moot at this point.

181
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
No, it isn't.

182
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,132
Barnes was infected for weeks
before the virus fully took hold.

Don't you wanna know what
the virus has brought out in me, Jim?

190
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,192
What it's shown me?

191
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,152
No.

Why would she be been drawn
to a man with so much darkness?

196
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,801
Such an appetite for violence?

197
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,382
Unless something inside her

198
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,138
liked it.

199
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,895
Craved it.

200
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,231
Needed it.

201
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,067
That's not true.

202
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,735
The virus has shown me
how to give in to my deepest desires.

203
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,822
And I will no longer deny myself

There is a problem though, Jim,
isn't there?

You know what the problem is, don't you?

Yeah. You need help.

- No. The problem...
- (CHOKING)

209
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,432
Is that you are always denying yourself
who you really are.

The place where Bruce and I
found the original crystal owl

should be here. Marked.

But it's not.

221
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,538
Or maybe it's an old owl
that hasn't been updated.

No, mate, no.
You're missing the point. No, look.

The Court hasn't marked all the hideouts.

when you stole the Owl?

Pengy disappeared the other day,

he wasn't coming back, so they split.

What's he done to you?

327
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,976
He has lifted the burden of my past.

328
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,138
Revealed my true destiny.

329
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,775
Gotham must fall by my hand.

330
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
No.

331
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,652
Bruce.

332
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,406
(GRUNTING)

333
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,414
- Dwayne.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,045
Hey. Steve.

335
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,747
Put this animal in a cage.

336
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,087
I'll be back to bust your head
in a minute.

337
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,224
Alfred, hey.

338
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,890
You Okay?

339
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,394
Far from it.
I mean, the leader of The Court

340
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,400
has turned Bruce into
some kind of weird zombie zealot.

341
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,148
I mean, I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

342
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,908
I think he wants Bruce
to detonate the bomb.

343
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,066
What?

344
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,701
Bruce said something about
it being his destiny.

345
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,122
How Gotham must fall by his hand.

346
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,657
This is bad.

347
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,617
We gotta find that frigging bomb.

348
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,123
Let's go see baldy-locks
and see what he can tell us.

349
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,287
CAMPOS: Harvey.

350
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,750
Heard from the unis at Doc Thompkins.
No sign of her or Gordon. Or his car.

351
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,092
Put a BOLO out on Jim Gordon.

352
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,595
And put one out on Lee Thompkins, too.

353
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:32,968
I'm right here, Harvey.

354
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,267
Lee.

355
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,977
Hey.

356
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,769
It's good to see you.

357
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,858
You wouldn't happen to know
where Jim is, would you?

358
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,408
As a matter of fact...

359
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,362
He's probably waking up.

360
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,406
Right about

361
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,282
HOW.

362
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,685
(GASPING)

363
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,007
Lee?

364
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,798
Lee?

365
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,552
Lee!

366
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,263
Lee!

367
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,189
Lee! Lee!

368
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,647
Lee!

369
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,868
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

370
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,162
Take it easy, everybody.

371
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,538
Guns down, people.

372
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,207
It's all right. Everybody just step back.

373
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,371
You really did it, huh?

374
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,382
You injected yourself with the virus?

375
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,884
You're just like Jim.
You seem to think it's a bad thing.

376
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,548
Where is he?

377
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,458
He went to see you at your brownstone,
and now we can't get in touch with him.

378
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,139
Well, look at you,
all worried about your hero.

379
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,053
You put him up on this pedestal.

380
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,685
Forced him to deny his true self.

381
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,527
I am going to free Jim
and show everyone who he really is.

382
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,732
Where the hell is he?

383
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,942
He's in a coffin.

384
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,906
Six feet underground.

385
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,780
Did you kill him?

386
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,871
(CHUCKLES)
Who said anything about killing him?

387
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,581
Bloody hell.

388
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,380
I said he was in a coffin.

389
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,964
He's not dead.

390
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,416
Not yet.

391
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,254
Oh! Geez...

392
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,717
I forgot how jumpy everybody is
around here.

393
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,557
Jim? Are you there?

394
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,017
(STATIC CRACKLING)

395
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,723
DR. THOMPKINS: Jim, you there?

396
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,068
Lee, what the hell are you doing?

397
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,234
DR. THOMPKINS: Stay calm.
You've gotta conserve your air.

398
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,616
- Listen to me.
- (LAUGHS)

399
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,114
Little late for that.

400
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,997
Why don't you say hi to
Harvey and the gang?

401
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,492
Harvey? You there?

402
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,583
We're here, buddy. Where are you?

403
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,544
JIM: Harvey, she's got the virus.
She's buried me alive.

404
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,704
(SHUSHING)

405
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,255
I do the talking.

406
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,125
Now, if you're quiet, I'll let you listen.

407
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,381
So here's the deal.

408
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,765
I buried Jim Gordon alive

409
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,992
in a location that you might find
if you looked long enough.

410
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,928
But certainly
not before he runs out of air.

411
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,148
Meaning I'm the only one
who knows where he is.

412
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,318
But... Now, here's the kicker.

413
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,317
I left him a way out.

414
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,528
You hear that, Jim?

415
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,661
I left you an escape hatch.

416
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,078
Have you found it yet?

417
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,576
You should have found it by now.

418
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,638
You left me the virus.

419
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,798
(LAUGHS)

420
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,219
I told you
I would help you find your darkness.

421
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,220
Now...

422
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,189
I can't do it for you.

423
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,142
You've gotta do it yourself.

424
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,111
I won't. I won't do it, Lee.

425
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,319
You've got two options.

426
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,275
You can take the virus.

427
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,944
And find the strength
and get out of there.

428
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,539
Or you can make
that coffin your permanent home.

429
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,415
Lee, please. Please.

430
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,370
In the name of all that is holy
and not insane,

431
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,673
tell us where he is.

432
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,255
I swear to God,
I'll let you walk right out of here.

433
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,212
Tell us where you buried him.

434
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,546
Why would I wanna
walk out of here, Harvey?

435
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,430
I'm gonna miss the look
on all of your faces

436
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,435
when he takes that virus.

437
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,438
And seeing that he's got roughly
an hour left of oxygen,

438
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,066
I'm not gonna have long to wait.

439
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,984
Can I get a cup of coffee?

440
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,862
Get the lady a cup of coffee.

441
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:49,989
Put her in a cell.

(LAUGHS) Don't worry. I'm not gonna bite.

444
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,540
All right, everyone.
Bruce Wayne is still missing.

445
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,752
There's still a freaking terrorist attack
that could go down at any minute!

446
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,637
So get back to your jobs.
Do what you're supposed to be doing.

447
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,511
Let me worry about Jim Gordon.

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

450
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,121
Harvey, these radios
run on a shortwave frequency.

451
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,489
I've gotta be close.
Get it over to Lucius.

452

He should be able
to run down a general fix.

- Hang tight. We're on it.
- Let's go.

Stay calm.

458
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,141
I'm not working for Penguin.

459
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,151
So you were just
holed up together for kicks?

460
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,481
No. Ivy just asked me to come by.

461
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,689
Why?

00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,408
None of your business, lunk.

So now I gotta take lip off a kid?

You're friends with that firebug,
aren't you?

465

And he needed your help finding them.

469

You're gonna tell Penguin
that you know where this Bridgit is,

and that you'd like to meet.

Hello again, Oswald.

649
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,210
OFFICER: Captain, over here.
I think they found something.

650
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,437
See?

651
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,503
We gotta get to Union Station.

652
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,466
That was Bullock.

653
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,677
Gordon's on his way to Union Station.

654
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,679
He's infected with the virus. Come on.

You must be very proud of yourself, Ed.

660
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,950
Thinking you outsmarted me.

661
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,199
Well, frankly,
it wasn't really a challenge.

662
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,581
Now, you're gonna do one thing
before you die.

No.

666
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,879
You have a choice, Oswald.

667
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,390
This can happen real quick,
or it can take hours.

668
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,721
- Days. It will be...
- I’ll take option B, Ed.

669
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:31,314
Since saying that ridiculous name
would be torture itself.

670
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,817
Very well.

Hello? Do I get no say in all this?

676
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,660
- See how it feels?
- Guys,

Hello, Oswald.

684

Now, see that there?

685
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,435
That's a look of respect.

686
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,363
Or is it fear?

687
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:18,857
Hi, Fish.

688
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,694
- How have you been?
- Well, let's see.

689
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,908
I was alive.

690
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,572
Then I was dead.

691
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,741
Then I was alive.
