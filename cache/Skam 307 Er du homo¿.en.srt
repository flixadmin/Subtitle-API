1
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,873
From an evolutionary standpoint,
homosexuality is a genetic dead end.

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,555
I...

3
00:00:09,784 --> 00:00:11,800
Have told Sonja about you.

4
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:14,506
We've decided to take a break.

5
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:17,443
There were people, over the years, who
have chosen to withstand harassment.

6
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:19,148
People who have been beaten and killed.

7
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:22,760
And that's not because they
really want to be different.

8
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:27,455
But because they would rather die, than
to pretend to be someone they're not.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,862
(Hi. It was nice seeing you as well.
I don't know, but things might have

10
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:32,332
gone a little too quickly... I know
it's my fault, but I need time, sorry.)

11
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:34,720
You know that thing about me
being a little weird lately...?

12
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,173
It's because of a person I like.

13
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:39,360
It's not a girl.

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,860
What's his name?

15
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:42,026
Even.

16
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,970
Like, he's got to break up
with his girlfriend.

17
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:49,881
That's Alex.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,341
Wow. He's got a guitar and stuff.

19
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,055
Can you swipe right, don't click on the...

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,167
He looks cool, though.

21
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,714
The point is that you can pick
for yourself, when you get Tinder

22
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:57,739
You can log on, uh...

23
00:00:57,778 --> 00:00:58,778
Excuse me...?

24
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:00,640
Meet a lot of nice people

25
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:02,030
And do what you want with them.

26
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm not getting Tinder. No.

27
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:04,736
Why not?

28
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,387
Why not? Isn't that quite obvious?

29
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:11,950
When I've kind of got a guy already.

30
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,649
Yeah, but he lives in London, Noora.

31
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:14,593
Now you're just being mean.

32
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:16,228
No, I just mean that...

33
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:19,038
You're the kind of person who
always does the right thing...

34
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,212
Who always has to be so good.

35
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,736
Can't you just jump into it?

36
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:25,252
You know...

37
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:26,673
No.

38
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:27,990
Do like this, "wuh".

39
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:30,274
Wuh, yeah. Exactly.

40
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,585
Now I feel like you're on the...

41
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,084
Yes, ok...

42
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:32,617
Noora!

43
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,030
Bye, Eskild!

44
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:35,331
Love you!

45
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,725
Difficult! Jesus Christ.

46
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,701
Everyone knows that William
isn't going to come.

47
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,280
Jesus...

48
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Eskild?

49
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:51,477
Can I ask you a question?

50
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,374
Isak, seriously! Now...

51
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,104
Yes, I accept your apology.

52
00:01:58,129 --> 00:01:59,680
It's okay. I mean...

53
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:02,238
For the last time, I'm not mad at you.

54
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:03,896
Okay? I...

55
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,228
I understand why you said
what you said, and now

56
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:08,307
I'm done with it.

57
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,807
So now you don't have to

58
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:12,972
Walk around here like a...

59
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:13,998
You're driving me crazy!

60
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,751
That's not it.
I seriously need an advice...

61
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,338
From me?

62
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,894
Okay, you want an advice from 'moi'?

63
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,036
Yes.

64
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:30,703
You want that?

65
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:32,133
Because...

66
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:34,006
You trust me?

67
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,895
And look up to me?

68
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:38,387
Yes.

69
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:41,733
Because I'm your guru?

70
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,883
Sure.

71
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,621
Say it.
Say that 'Eskild is my guru.'

72
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:49,439
Fuck this.

73
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,228
Say it! 'Eskild...'

74
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,546
No. No, just forget about it.

75
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,141
Fine, fine, fine. Fine, Isak. Okay.

76
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:55,546
What...

77
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:56,894
What is it you're wondering?

78
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:04,806
You...

79
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:06,743
You know that guy, Even?

80
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,354
Yup. What about him?

81
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:13,874
Nah, we had a thing, you know...

82
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:18,358
And he said that he would
break up with his girlfriend.

83
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:22,434
And then suddenly

84
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,180
He says that things happened too fast

85
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:25,855
And...

86
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,918
Then he's back together
with his girlfriend.

87
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,601
And then...

88
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,725
And then a while after that
he gives me this drawing.

89
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,989
And I'm thinking, "Okay, cool," and I send

90
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:38,915
him a message thanking him for the drawing.

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,828
But then he doesn't answer...

92
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:47,270
But he has a girlfriend?

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Yeah.

94
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:56,099
Okay. For how long have they been together?

95
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,671
For about four years.

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
Okay?

97
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,455
That's not good, or?

98
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:11,082
I mean, yeah. Or, I don't know, how...

99
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:13,320
How honest would you like me to be?

100
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,395
Not too honest, maybe.

101
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,768
No, you know what, fuck it.
Just say it like it is.

102
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,720
Yeah, I mean. I...

103
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,703
I mean, I know a lot of...

104
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,346
Guys in heterosexual relationships

105
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:29,989
Who sleep with guys.

106
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:32,013
That's pretty normal, but...

107
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:37,847
Not a lot of guys leave their
girlfriends to be together...

108
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,479
I think... Or, I mean...

109
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:48,677
It's...

110
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:54,804
Or they might, I mean it's just my advice.
That's just my opinion.

111
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,911
My... My guru-advising.

112
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:59,657
Kinda. And I'm not Buddha.

113
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,371
Or...

114
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:05,220
I'm not God. Kinda, or...

115
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,379
So...

116
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:10,649
Was that helpful?

117
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,106
Okay, Sana.

118
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:21,209
What is excretion? Task fifteen.

119
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,593
A, excretion of nitrogenous waste.

120
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,665
B, excretion of carbon dioxide.

121
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,831
C, excretion of excess
matters in the body, or...

122
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:34,196
D, excretion of wastes.
Yes, it's that one!

123
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,347
I read it last week.

124
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:37,538
What, D?

125
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,030
No, no, no. It's A.

126
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:42,552
A?

127
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:44,179
No!

128
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,251
It's A?

129
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,394
Where did you get D from?

130
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,606
Nitrogenous waste?
We haven't read about that.

131
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:49,433
Nitrogenous waste...

132
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,085
Well, we definitely haven't read about
excretion of waste from their organs.

133
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,276
That doesn't even make sense.

134
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,387
What do you mean, it doesn't make sense?
This is what we've covered in class.

135
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:00,180
Organs don't excrete waste?

136
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:02,505
Why not?

137
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,228
Anyway, it's not A.
That has nothing to do with anything.

138
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:05,918
Nitrogen?

139
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:07,664
Don't joke around with me right now.
It's A.

140
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,561
Jesus Christ.
Why are we having this discussion?

141
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:15,530
Just... Just trust me, Sana.

142
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:18,149
I trust myself, and it's A.

143
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,855
Like, this is my subject.
I know what I'm doing.

144
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,934
It's my subject as well.

145
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,665
Can you just circle A? It is A!

146
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,838
Let's just Google it.

147
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,116
I'm not being bothered
by your stubbornness.

148
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,965
If you're so insecure that you
have to Google it, go ahead.

149
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,187
But I know that I'm right,
and I know that it's A.

150
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:38,577
I'm not insecure,
I know that I'm right as well.

151
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,133
But I'm not going to answer A on it.

152
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:43,958
So... Yeah. What are we going to do?

153
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:45,823
Hello?

154
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,550
Excuse me?

155
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:48,526
Yes, Sana?

156
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,566
What do we do if we
can't agree on an answer?

157
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,748
Then you'll circle both alternatives.

158
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,026
And then write your names next to
the one you think is the correct one.

159
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:57,871
Easy.

160
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:00,736
D, Isak.

161
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,919
A, what's your name again?

162
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,129
What's the next question?

163
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:16,844
How does...

164
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,955
The transportation take place in animals...

165
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,506
Without a circulatory system?

166
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:28,339
Can all duos please write their
names at the top of their paper?

167
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,561
I'll do it.

168
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:44,629
(I hope you don't find this question to
be rude, but is it true that you're gay?)

169
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:47,839
(Where did you hear that?)

170
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,886
(It was just somebody saying that you and
that Even guy from third year had a thing?)

171
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,513
(Who said it?)

172
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:12,193
(Someone in first year who'd heard it
from Emma who knows his girlfriend.)

173
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:20,093
(Sorry if it's not true.)

174
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,903
(But it's really cool if you are.)

175
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,331
(I love gays!)

176
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:31,505
Where IKEA get all of the
names for their furniture from.

177
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:35,354
If they, like, just go to a Swedish
name registry and take some from there?

178
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,379
Hi, Isak.

179
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:38,465
Who is she?

180
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:40,461
I don't know.

181
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,866
Hey, what's up?

182
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
'Sup?

183
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:53,046
What's this?

184
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,149
I think that guy's found his song.

185
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,927
I have. Fuck, it's so nice.

186
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,471
Ey, what's up?

187
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,828
Nah, not much.

188
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,661
Isak said he'll be hosting
a pre-drink on Friday.

189
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:12,419
I am with you, man. I'm in!

190
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:13,609
You'll join, right?

191
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:14,910
Yeah. Yeah, of course we're in.

192
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:18,268
I'm not going to get violent again.

193
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,601
Okay, that's chill.

194
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:23,871
Oh! Did you hear the rumor that you guys
fought at Emma's party because Isak is gay?

195
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:24,815
What? No?

196
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,125
Yup. It's hilarious! Haven't you heard?

197
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,013
What did you say we fought about?

198
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,068
That he's gay.

199
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,822
Yeah, why would we fight about that?

200
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,814
You were a Muslim.
I don't fucking know.

201
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:36,719
I'm not even a Muslim?

202
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,362
I know, it's fucking hilarious!

203
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,561
Is it hilarious that the entire school
thinks I'm a homophobe?

204
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:46,831
Homophobe?
(Magnus making fun of Mahdi's pronunciation.)

205
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:47,752
Homophobe.

206
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:48,641
Yeah, but...

207
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,029
Yeah, okay. But that's not hilarious...
Like, is that funny?

208
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:54,133
No... But it's hilarious that
people think that Isak is gay!

209
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:56,084
You did tell them that it's bullshit?

210
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:59,220
I said they should watch out, 'cause you
would 'jihad' the entire school, bro.

211
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:06,598
Just kidding. I told them Isak
was going to a family dinner.

212
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:08,359
That you fought because...

213
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,836
We didn't even fight?!

214
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,915
Relax, man. It's okay.
It's only a rumor, okay?

215
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,169
Chill.

216
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:26,639
Uh, guys...

217
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:29,600
Do you remember...

218
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,869
Do you remember when we were
watching those girls dance?

219
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:35,671
Bro, every time I close my eyes
the only thing I see are those girls.

220
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:37,077
Fuck, they were hot.

221
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:40,022
Yeah, but do you remember...

222
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,506
That a guy came up to us?

223
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:46,387
That gay guy?

224
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,649
Why do you think he's gay?

225
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,204
You're the one who said he was gay?

226
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,530
No, no! Not him, not him. I'm talking about
the other guy who came over.

227
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,165
Yeah, maybe...?

228
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:02,163
The guy who...

229
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:06,830
The guy who said I'd forgotten
my hat in the cafeteria.

230
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,362
Yeah, I think I remember him.

231
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:11,815
Yeah.

232
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:13,315
What about him?

233
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:20,411
We've had a thing.

234
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,066
A thing?

235
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,312
A thing.

236
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,581
The fuck, are you gay?

237
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:33,188
I'm not gay.

238
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,553
Well, maybe I'm a little gay, but

239
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:38,498
It's not as though... Yeah.

240
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,744
I'm not keen on you guys, for example.

241
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,339
It's not as though I'm keen on
all guys all the time.

242
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:47,288
But... You hook up with
chicks every weekend?

243
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:51,209
Yeah, but maybe he's pansexual.

244
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:52,177
What's pansexual?

245
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,637
It's when you like both.

246
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:55,193
That's bisexual?

247
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:56,847
Yeah. I think that's bisexual.

248
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,482
Yeah, but like, pansexual is
also that you like both.

249
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,847
What the fuck is the difference
between pansexual and bisexual?

250
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:03,895
There's no difference.

251
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,300
Well, anyway... Pansexual,
bisexual, gay or not.

252
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:09,038
He's said he'll host on Friday.

253
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:10,863
Sweet.

254
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,958
Maybe we'll get some chicks for once,
seeing as you suddenly became a fag.

255
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,442
Doesn't mean you've got
any more game, though.

256
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:18,871
Huh?

257
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,289
(1: Hi Even. Thanks for the drawing.
It was nice.

258
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,430
When did you actually manage
to put it in my jacket?)

259
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,476
(2: Meanwhile, in another universe:
Glad you liked

260
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,323
it. Put it there when you had P.E.
Miss you.)

261
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:22,394
You don't get in the mood.

262
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,648
No, you don't... Because, like,
there are ten people in a huge apartment

263
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,823
And then they play 'Russ' music
to get the mood going.

264
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,093
'Russ' music is fucking pumped!

265
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:30,640
When you don't get in the mood and so

266
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,466
you're like,
"Let's put on some 'Russ' music."

267
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:33,934
They do that at the parties I go to.

268
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,196
The girls go crazy!

269
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,997
But it's so often that it
doesn't fit to play 'Russ'

270
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:40,251
music where they play
'Russ' music, all the time.

271
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:40,911
You get that, right?

272
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:43,419
Yeah, okay. Fine.
So what do you wanna listen to then?

273
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,973
I don't know, but if I go
to parties I'm keen on

274
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:48,562
listening to some old-school
hip hop, some 90's shit.

275
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:49,141
Nate Dogg.

276
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:50,887
Yeah, Nate Dogg!

277
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,393
He's sick.

278
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:53,418
Who's Nate Dogg?

279
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:54,426
Who's Nate Dogg?

280
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:55,641
Man, are you serious?

281
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,871
I haven't heard of Nate Dogg.

282
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:58,379
Uh, do you know who Snoop Dogg is?

283
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,815
I know who Snoop Dogg is!

284
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:00,848
What's up, man?

285
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,490
Nothing, I guess.

286
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:06,647
Nothing?

287
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:10,425
Anything new with that guy Even, or what?

288
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,330
No.

289
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:14,528
Well, I got a new drawing.

290
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:17,942
A new draw...

291
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,998
What's his deal?

292
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:22,196
I don't know. He's...

293
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,498
Yeah, all over the place.

294
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:25,783
What are you talking about?

295
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:29,736
Are you talking about Even?

296
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,004
What's going on between
the two of you, really?

297
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:35,782
There's nothing going on...

298
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:37,552
He's got a girlfriend.

299
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:40,640
Oh, he's pansexual as well?

300
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:43,093
I don't know.

301
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,522
Just one thing...

302
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:49,212
I've been thinking about something,
sorry if it's rude, but...

303
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:50,950
Gays, when they have sex...

304
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,903
Who's the man and who's the woman?

305
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,958
- Dude...
- What?!

306
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:56,728
What?

307
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,573
Funny you should ask,
because I was going to

308
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,403
ask you the same thing
for when you have sex.

309
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,822
Who's the man and who's the woman?

310
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,568
But then I remembered
that you don't have sex!

311
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
Holy fuck.

312
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,314
Wow. Where did that come from?

313
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:10,806
That's a stab in the heart.

314
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,472
It wasn't that bad of a question, was it?

315
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,791
I was just seriously wondering, but okay...

316
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,038
Okay, okay. But honestly...

317
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:22,609
I feel like you're letting
him play you, kinda.

318
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:24,577
Play me?

319
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:27,172
That like, he keeps you going.

320
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:28,379
And then nothing happens.

321
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,291
And he's still together with that chick.

322
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:33,522
Yeah.

323
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:35,322
But I can't control what he does.

324
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,220
Yes, you can!
If you're like...

325
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:40,927
Completely straight-up,
send him a text and

326
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:42,553
say, "Hey dude, stop
what you're doing!"

327
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:45,871
"Yo dude, stop what you're doing!"?

328
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:48,402
- Yeah. Or, maybe not that, but...
- Nah, that's not like me.

329
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:50,228
No, but like...

330
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:52,673
Okay, "Text me..."

331
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,022
"Stop texting me. Call me when you've
broken up with your girlfriend."

332
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,657
Straight-up.

333
00:15:59,038 --> 00:15:59,967
That's what works.

334
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,347
And if he's interested, he's gonna get
stressed out. We've all been there.

335
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:04,514
Yeah, exactly!

336
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:09,665
Like, if you're fooling around with a girl,
or you're just keen on hooking up with her

337
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,887
But you're not keen on
being in a relationship with her

338
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:14,712
But like, she texts you,

339
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,752
"What's up? Let's meet, I'm tired of
you not taking this seriously."

340
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,363
Then you become serious right away.

341
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:23,657
Yeah! And you get really shocked.

342
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,244
Yeah, you get shocked.
And you don't fuck with her after that.

343
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,513
It's worse when she doesn't
answer you when you text her.

344
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:30,895
When it says like,
(Hi, thanks for the drawing, but if...)

345
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,864
That they've seen your text like, an hour ago.
(you're not interested in something...)

346
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:37,420
Yeah, but only sneaky people do that. (more, you can just let
it be. Call me when you've broken up with your girlfriend.)

347
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,133
Girls do it all the time with me.

348
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,530
Like, girls?

349
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:45,593
Maybe you should start hitting
on a different kind of girl.

350
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,998
I'm hitting on the best there is, though.

351
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,165
I did it.

352
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:50,696
I sent the text.

353
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,879
No way?!

354
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:53,903
That's not too bad.

355
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:56,776
Cheers!

356
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:58,751
Brothers.

357
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,188
That really surprised me.

358
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:05,553
Is it him?

359
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:06,672
(What are you doing now?)

360
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:07,743
He answered.
(Can we talk?)

361
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,331
"What are you doing now?
Can we talk?"

362
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:11,776
Seriously?

363
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:13,903
What should I reply?

364
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:14,609
Call him.

365
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:16,514
No, don't call him.

366
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,871
Write, uh... "Chilling at home."

367
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,069
"Chilling at home"?

368
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,442
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

369
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,248
"Chilling at home."

370
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:30,637
"Just call."

371
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:34,696
No! You want him to call, but like...

372
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:39,974
You have to write it as though you...
don't want that? You get me?

373
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,323
So just write "chilling at home", and done.

374
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:43,267
"Chilling at home."

375
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,307
"Chilling at home", okay.

376
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:47,665
"Chilling at home", smiley?

377
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,736
No!

378
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:50,180
"Chilling at home", done.

379
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:51,474
No feelings.

380
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:52,077
Okay.

381
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:53,180
Completely... straight-up.

382
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:54,038
Chilling at home.

383
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,077
Yeah.

384
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:57,188
Sent.

385
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,379
He's going to call.

386
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,958
Check if there's a...

387
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,053
Bubble. If he's writing something.

388
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:38,615
No bubble.

389
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:41,655
He's not going to answer.
That's just the way he is.

390
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,252
Maybe he's at a place where he's,
like, unable to talk right now.

391
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,990
Maybe...

392
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,557
The beer didn't taste good today.

393
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:04,815
What are you drinking?

394
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,418
Tuborg. In a bottle.

395
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,458
It tasted like plastic, or something.

396
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,061
Is it... Has there been
too much yeast, or what?

397
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:14,053
Probably...

398
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:15,315
Oh, fuck!

399
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:17,411
Yeah. Yo, yeast...!

400
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:20,632
This person I know, knows someone...

401
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:29,077
And he told me that someone had put
yeast inside a carton of apple juice

402
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:31,625
and put it in his locker at school,
to make beer...?

403
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,212
At school?

404
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,220
Yeah?! Isn't that weird.

405
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:33,632
Huh?

406
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,497
It must have stunk
like shit in that school.

407
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,807
That's what they said.
It smelled like shit!

408
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:39,355
He probably wanted to party at school.

409
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:45,077
What the fuck, it must be completely...
Do you know him?

410
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:45,879
No.

411
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:47,869
- It's a friend of a friend, like he said.
- Yeah.

412
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:50,188
But... But, uh...

413
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,212
What's up?
Did you invite someone?

414
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,339
No. You're the only friends I've got.

415
00:19:56,712 --> 00:20:00,807
It's probably Eskild. He forgets his
keys every fucking day.

416
00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:04,212
It's Even.

417
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,109
- Huh?
- It's Even?

418
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:07,300
Seriously? He's here?

419
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:08,918
I'm not fucking around, it's Even.

420
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:10,546
Is it Even? Let's meet Even, you guys!

421
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:12,093
- Yeah. Yeah, we gotta do that.
- Yeah.

422
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:12,680
No!

423
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:14,022
Why can't we meet Even?

424
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,887
Seriously, I'm not fucking around.
Out, out, out, out, out, out!

425
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:16,831
Why can't we meet Even?

426
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:17,728
Where are we supposed to go?

427
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:19,436
You can't meet Even, what
are you talking about?

428
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,806
Do you have my phone?!
I can't find it!

429
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,411
Your phone?! Why would
I have your phone?!

430
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:23,887
Yeah, but where are we supposed to go?

431
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:26,394
Have the pre-drinks outside then,
you do have a party to go to!

432
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:27,776
It's fucking freezing!

433
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,474
Remember the alcohol!

434
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:32,673
No, you're going to bump into him.
You'll go out the back door!

435
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,680
The shoes are on the other...
I'll get your shoes, fine!

436
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:40,077
Shoes?

437
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:40,964
Shoes?

438
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,663
Isak, I need the shoes now, buddy!

439
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,478
Get them, for fucks sake!

440
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:48,930
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

441
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,414
They're not even my shoes!

442
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,380
You... You put on my shoe!

443
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:56,117
Come on, guys! The most important
thing is that we're leaving!

444
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:14,744
Hey.

445
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,450
Hey.
