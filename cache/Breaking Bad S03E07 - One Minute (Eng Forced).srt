1
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,909
Why?

2
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,414
Why is this stilI under discussion?

3
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,670
I don't like him.

4
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,339
I don't care who he knows.

5
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,094
We're supposed to trust him with our products.

6
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,056
Big man.

7
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,891
Big Generalissimo!

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,019
Big fry cook is more like it.

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,731
The "Chicken Man."

10
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,941
You wiIl do what you want.

11
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,277
But you have my vote.

12
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,454
Never trust a South American.

13
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,123
Dirty, dirty people.

14
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,298
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

15
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,634
He was just having fun.

16
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,804
You'll get over it.

17
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,932
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

18
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,580
Grab your oId uncle a beer, would you?

19
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
No, no. A cold one.

20
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,222
This is what you wanted.

21
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,099
Your brother dead. Right?

22
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,356
You're going to have to try harder than that...

23
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,150
...if you want to save him.

24
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,447
How much longer do you think he has down there?

25
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,827
One minute? Maybe more? Maybe less?

26
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,846
Family is all.

27
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,934
Finish him.

28
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,300
Too easy.
