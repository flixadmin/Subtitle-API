one of the Anti-Villain
League's most wanted.

39

And trust me, a real jerk.

00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:55,172
So, there is no room for error.
Got it?

41
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:57,406
Si, boss.

00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,187

47
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,209
Looka! Looka! Oh!

48
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,656
Yummos!

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,639
Come here, come here.

50
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,897
Jello

51
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,382
Ah.

52
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,137
Pusha. Pusha.

53
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,663
Ah...

54
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:26,539
-Helpa. Ah, helpa.
-Ah.

55
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:28,940
Ah. Oh, helpa.

56
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:31,713
Kids can be so cruel,

57
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:34,614
but Maxime can be even crueler!

58
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:39,849
Oh!

59
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,559
Well, well, well.

60
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,936
Look who it is.

61
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,897
If it isn't Gru-ser the Loser.

62
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,525
Well, if it isn't Maxime Le Mal.

63
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:49,693
You look...

64
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,146
Magnificent?

65
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,529
Yes, I know.

66
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:57,444
What did you think, huh? I was going
to look like a bald loser with a dad bod?

67
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:59,934
Oops, looks like
you beat me to it, no?

68
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,752
Well, that's not...

69
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:05,731
Ooh!

70
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:06,668
Oh.

71
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,818
It's good to laugh, no?

72
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:13,049
Anyway, you remember
my girlfriend, Valentina?

73
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:16,177
She was captain of
the Femme Fatales cheer squad

74
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:19,764
and the most popular girl
in school, huh?

75
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,423
I remember.

76
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,949
Good to see you, Valentina.

77
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,500
What happened, Gru?

78
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:33,343
All your dreams of becoming a
famous villain, they go poof-poof, huh?

79
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:35,989
Well, I don't know if you know,

80
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:38,222
but I did manage to steal the moon.

81
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,331
Really?

82
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,899
You mean that moon?

83
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,874
Is this on?

84
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:48,293
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

85
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:53,613
Good evening, and welcome,
Lycee Pas Bon alumni.

86
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,504
Now, we're going to kick off
the festivities

87
00:04:56,528 --> 00:05:00,430
by announcing the winner
of our most coveted award,

88
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:03,039
the Golden Alumni.

89
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,353
And so, without further ado,

90
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:13,234
the winner of this year's
Golden Alumni is, uh...

91
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:17,739
oh, my favorite student,
Maxime Le Mal!

92
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,407
-What? What?
-Oh, thank you.

93
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:20,742
Are you kidding me?

94
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,619
Thank you. Merci.
Merci beaucoup.

95
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:24,436
Mais non, you don't have to.

96
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:32,242
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.
-♪ You're unbelievable. ♪

97
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,266
Thank you.

98
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,964
I'm sure you all know
that I have

99
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:38,016
something very big in the works.

100
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,806
Now, some of you laughed at my
childhood obsession with cockroaches.

101
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,808
But I quickly learned

102
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:47,959
that they are a miracle
of evolution.

103
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:53,316
And I have found a way
to harness the strength

104
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,194
and the speed and the--
what is the word?--

105
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:59,781
unsquishability of
the most powerful creature

106
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:01,324
on the planet.

107
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:06,579
Which makes me indestructible
and unstoppable!

108
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,664
Maxime!

109
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,958
Maxime! Maxime!

110
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:14,778
Behold, the power
of the cockroach!

111
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:27,837
Oh!

112
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,216
Ah.

113
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:35,256
Ah.

114
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:39,529
Aah, aah! Stop! Oh, oh, stoppa!

115
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:41,823
Aah! Stoppa!

116
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,825
So, my sad little friend,

117
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,952
what do you say about that, huh?

118
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:50,369
Well, I'd say
you're under arrest,

119
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:53,126
courtesy of
the Anti-Villain League.

120
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,962
Oh, I don't think so, mon ami.

121
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,196
Oh, yeah? Goop Grenade!

122
00:07:09,915 --> 00:07:11,019
Move in.

123
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,687
-AVL!
-Stay where you are!

124
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,254
Move, move, move!

125
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,224
Stay there!

126
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:28,921
Freeze!

127
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,877
Gotcha.

128
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,337
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!

129
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,690
This is not happening.

130
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,634
C'est impossible.

131
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:42,784
Get your hands off of me!

132
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:45,894
I...
I am commanding you to let...

133
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,547
So long, Maxime.

134
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,032
Who's the loser now?

135
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,658
Loser!

136
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:53,017
Loser! Loser!

137
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:05,103
This is not over!

138
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:09,816
You won't always have the AVL
to fight your battles, you coward.

139
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,719
Mark my words,
I will exterminate you!

140
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:15,376
What?

141
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,321
Not, uh... not scary at all.

142
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:27,408
Despicable Me

143
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,688
Despicable Me 4

144
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,274
Hello, everybody.

145
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,110
-Gru, what's up?
-Hey, Gru!

146
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:44,070
-Hey, Gru.
-I'm so happy you're here!

147
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:46,155
What's shaking in the Gru house?

148
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,324
Look what I taught Lucky.

149
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:51,518
Lucky, sit.

150
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:56,356
Aw, Lucky. I said "sit."

151
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:02,338
Well, it is only
his first lesson.

152
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:04,882
Uh, maybe we practice outside
from now on.

153
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,260
There's my favorite husband.

154
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:08,671
Did you remember
to get the milk?

155
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,264
Well, yes. They had a few kinds.

156
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:13,641
They got the almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk,

157
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:16,266
oat milk, goat milk,
chocolate milk, half-and-half,

158
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,101
powdered and of magnesia.

159
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:21,265
What about regular milk?

160
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:23,776
Uh, they don't make that
anymore.

161
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,986
Oh.

162
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,571
Wait a minute.

163
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:29,365
One, two, three girls.

164
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,582
One wife.

165
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:33,415
Something is missing.

166
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,372
No, I think that's all of us, yeah.

167
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:38,129
You know what, I keep forgetting--

168
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:39,566
this guy!

169
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,743
Oh!

170
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,352
There's my boy!

171
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,174
There he is.

172
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,009
A-coochie-coochie-
coochie-coochie.

173
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:51,012
Where is Daddy's hug?

174
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:53,705
Oh, looks like somebody's
a little cranky.

175
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:56,768
Behind that sourpuss,

176
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,270
I know you love your dada!

177
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,731
Go on, say it. "Dada."

178
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:03,357
"Dada."

179
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:04,817
Yes, of course he loves you.

180
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:08,071
He just... he just doesn't
show it on his face.

181
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:10,013
Or with his body language.

182
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,116
Right, Gru Jr.? Come on.

183
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,260
Show Daddy
how much you love him.

184
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:17,872
Oh, I know what
will make you happy.

185
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:20,690
Mmm. Bahama Medley.

186
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:23,969
No?

187
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,749
It's from the Bahamas--
all of them.

188
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:30,027
Look. Oh, so yummy.

189
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:31,844
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

190
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:37,449
Oh, that really tastes
like the Bahamas.

191
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,102
See? He loves his daddy.

192
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:40,778
He's sharing.

193
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:45,673
Phil, Ralph, Ron.

194
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:13,526
Thanks, guys.

195
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,728
Ramsbottom?

196
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,385
"Bottom."

197
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:22,979
I need a word with you both.

198
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,003
-Sure, but what...
-I'm sorry,

199
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,857
there's no time for chitchat.

200
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:29,264
Maxime Le Mal has sent you
a message from prison.

201
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,530
Bonjour, Gru.

202
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:35,318
I know you can hear me,
so hear this.

203
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:39,140
You think you can humiliate me
and get away with it, yes?

204
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,607
But no!
When I break out of prison,

205
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:43,583
I'm coming for my revenge, Gru,

206
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:47,443
but this time,
I won't go so easy on you.

207
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,339
And I know where you live,

208
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:52,383
so you'd better sleep with one eye open,

209
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:55,136
'cause you can't hide from me.

210
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,370
Sweet dreams, Gru-ser!

211
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,809
Don't worry,
he can't get out of there.

212
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,478
It's a maximum security prison.

213
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:06,778
Ah, yes, well, um...

214
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:08,295
he escaped yesterday.

215
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,734
What?!

216
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:11,284
Leave our home?

217
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,945
Oh, no, you're gonna love it.

218
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,530
It's-it's called the safe house,

219
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,449
and it's fun, and it's safe,

220
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,576
and it's fantastic,
and we're going.

221
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,644
Yeah, you'll get a new room,
go to a new school.

222
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,853
That'll be fun, right?

223
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,767
Everything's gonna be new.
We love new.

224
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,253
What about all my friends?

225
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,322
You'll make new friends,
probably better ones.

226
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:31,900
I can't believe this.

227
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:34,686
Yes, yes. Lot of emotions, big life change.

228
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,385
Less talking, more walking.

229
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,661
Come on. Here we go.

230
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:51,382
I'm sorry you can't go with us, Lucky.

231
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:56,387
Take good care of him.

232
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,673
Be good, Lucky.

233
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,860
Don't forget to practice
your tricks.

234
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,841
We'll arrive at the AVL
safe house in a few hours.

235
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:10,951
Mayflower is a lovely town.

236
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:13,589
A lovely, safe, boring town.

237
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,466
Trust me, it is for the best, Gru.

238
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,352
And what about Grandma?

239
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:18,661
And Uncle Dru?

240
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:21,738
I'm sorry, no one can know
of your whereabouts.

241
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:22,993
Not even family.

242
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,892
Bingo, there's your silver lining.

243
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,687
And you promise to take care
of the other Minions?

244
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:30,726
They'll be safe and sound
at AVL headquarters.

245
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,913
I have big plans for them.

246
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,686
Good luck with that.

247
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:41,534

That is it!

251
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:07,166
Quiet!

252
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:11,314
You are now on Carl's bus.

253
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:14,692
And Carl is
a longtime AVL employee

254
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:17,783
whose retirement benefits
are almost vested,

255
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,656
so while on Carl's bus,

256
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,942
you follow Carl's rules.

257
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:27,246
No shenanigans, no antics
and no tomfoolery.

258
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,397
Tom?

259
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:31,667
So this ends now,
or you're gonna see

260
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:35,338
a side of Carl
you do not want to see.

261
00:14:35,362 --> 00:14:38,424
Do I make myself clear?!

262
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:40,283

00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:51,240
Watch your hands.
What are you doing?

266
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,099

269
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:02,490
Here we are,
the town of Mayflower.

270
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:03,699
The safe house has been used

271
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:06,535
to protect our agents
for decades now.

272
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,454
Oh, look at that place.

273
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:10,915
Wow, look at these lawns,
the flowers.

274
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,292
Whoa, that is cool!

275
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:14,585
Are we really gonna live here?

276
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,893
-Look at that fountain!
-Whoa.

277
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,506
Awesome.

278
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,007
Oh, is that one ours?

279
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:22,176
-Uh, uh, looka.
-Whoa! -Look at that!

280
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,677
Oh, that's pretty!

281
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,245
I could get used to this.

282
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:32,050
Ooh, it looks like
a princess lives there!

283
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,596
And here it is.

284
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:38,007
Your new home.

285
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,031
Oh.

286
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,741
Hmm. No fountain.

287
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:48,412
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

288
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:50,269
Come on.

289
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:05,159
Wow, it's so...
cold and uninviting.

290
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:06,702
But in a homey kind of way.

291
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,320
What?

292
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:10,641
Yes, everything here is AVL standard.

293
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,017
What it lacks in comfort,

294
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,363
it more than makes up for
in functionality.

295
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:17,982
Th-There's even a fully
automated lockdown mode.

296
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:19,442
Isn't that fun?

297
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,527
Ooh, full lockdown mode.

298
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:22,869
Yay.

299
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:25,506
It has a vending machine!

300
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,764
I love this place!

301
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,356
Uh, uh, looka.

302
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,677
This will be great.

303
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,464
All right, now down to business.

304
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:45,468
For your own safety, you'll all
be assuming new identities.

305
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,928
New identities?
Is that really necessary?

306
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:49,972
It's not up for debate, Gru.

307
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:52,831
Now, you are
a solar panel salesman.

308
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:56,435
Lucy, you're a hair stylist
at an upscale salon.

309
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,355
A hair stylist?

310
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,239
Yes! Jackpot!

311
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:02,994
Silas, did you choose that
because you knew I cut my own hair

312
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:05,161
and that I would totally rock at this?

313
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:06,662
No.

314
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,657
"Chet Cunningham."

315
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:11,494
Da, that's got
a nice ring to it.

316
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,060
Girls.

317
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:13,874
Cool.

318
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,998
I'm Blair.

319
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,333
Britney?

320
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:18,876
My name is Bree?

321
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,302
Oh, come on. There are
worse names than Bree.

322
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,636
Yeah, like Blanche.

323
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,051
Yes, Margo.

324
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:27,953
Blanche?
Oh, that is a terrible name.

325
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:30,888
Imagine being named Blanche.

326
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:33,729
Truly, I cannot think
of a worse...

327
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,351
My name's Blanche, isn't it?

328
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,644
Yup.

329
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:38,620
Well, I'll get used to it.

330
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:41,690
Well, why don't you girls go and pick out your rooms

331
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:44,550
while I have a word
with your parents?

332
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,447
Yes, I-I didn't want to frighten the girls,

333
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:50,032
but it is absolutely crucial

334
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:52,360
you keep your true identities
under wraps.

335
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:55,495
Gru, you're going to have to try to not be so

336
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,664
Gru-ish.

337
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,249
What is that supposed to mean?

338
00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:01,877
Well, I'm just saying you tend
to stand out in a crowd.

339
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,837
That's all. You know, you, uh...

340
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:06,173
Like the way you're always
cranky and irritable

341
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:08,634
and, uh, how you make things
a bit awkward

342
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,219
for everyone around you.

343
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:11,845
You do do that.

344
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,847
-I mean, you, you know, you...
-Okay, enough.

345
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:16,959
I don't make people awkward
or uncomfortable.

346
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,769
I'm very comforting.

347
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,771
Like a nice meat loaf.

348
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:23,589
I'm pretty delicious.

349
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,070
This is not awkward.

350
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:29,933
You're the ones
who are making it awkward.

351
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:32,204
Gru, you have to blend in.

352
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,227
Your family's lives are at stake.

353
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,494
You understand?

354
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,204
Of course. Yes.
Fully understand.

355
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:40,263
We would do anything to keep
our family safe. Yeah.

356
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,627
Right, well, I'll be in contact when this is all over.

357
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,505
Until then, capturing Maxime Le Mal

358
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,448
is our top priority.

359
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:52,118
Stay safe.

360
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:56,391
You know what, Gru? Maybe this isn't so bad.

361
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,641
We need a break from chasing down villains and

362
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:00,728
dangerous missions, right?

363
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:03,546
We can actually be
a normal family for once.

364
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:08,439
And I can finally spend some
little bonding time with the baby.

365
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:11,071
It's gonna be great, right, pal?

366
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:13,073
Who's got your nose?
Who's got...

367
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:16,517
Aah! He's got my nose!

368
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,503
Quite the grip there.

369
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,361
The kid is strong.

370
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,657

And a special merci beaucoup

to everyone who helped me
break out of AVL prison.

383
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,526
Todd and Linda, where are you?
Where are you?

384
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,468
Yes. For distracting the guards.

385
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:35,012
Oh, très magnifique.

386
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,448
Now, silence!

387
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:41,350
We must make Gru suffer for arresting me.

388
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:45,427
And what better way
than to take away from him

389
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,287
his precious little baby?

390
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:50,272
Oh, I want to take that baby!

391
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,591
-Oh, Maxime.
-No, no, wait, wait.

392
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:55,682
Not Maxime.

393
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:59,054
What if I start going
by Cockroach Man?

394
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:02,057
Huh? Little on the nose,
but it is very clear, huh?

395
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:03,569
It's good, no?

396
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:05,978
I'm not calling you
that stupid name,

397
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:08,436
but I love this evil plan.

398
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,149
Well, Gru has it coming.

399
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:13,500
He humiliated me
in front of the whole school.

400
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,280
I had my trophy and everything.

401
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:19,658
But now the game begins!

402
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:21,744
He runs and hides like the mouse,

403
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:24,856
and we find him like the cat!

404
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,340
Game on.

405
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,671
Stoppa. Stoppa.

406
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:36,073
Stoppa. Stoppa.

407
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,012

Britney.

412
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:52,941
Wait.

413
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,652
I can't say my name is Britney.

414
00:21:55,676 --> 00:21:57,529
That would be a lie.

415
00:21:57,553 --> 00:21:58,797
Yes.

416
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:01,617
But we aren't "stupposed"
to lie.

417
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:03,285
Don't think of it as lying.

418
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:05,829
Think of it as high-stakes pretending.

419
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:07,998
Well, I'm not going to.

420
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:10,636
-Ah, just a little white lie.
-Nope.

421
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,084
Agnes, as your father, I command you to lie.

422
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:15,047
No.

423
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,248
Yes, lie.

424
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:17,322
Mm-mm.

425
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:20,177
You are walking on thin ice, little lady.

426
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,535
Hmph.

427
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:24,973
Why can't you be more like
your sister Edith?

428
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:26,850
She lies all the time.

429
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:29,051
-No, I don't.
-See? See?

430
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:30,443
She's lying right now.

431
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,137
Beautifully, I might add.

432
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:33,273
Okay, you guys.

433
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:35,150
This is our first big day
in Mayflower,

434
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:37,653
and I say we make it
a great one.

435
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:39,279
Right, Chet Jr.?

436
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:40,906
Woo-hoo! Mayflower!

437
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,922
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

438
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,493
We're gonna be late for karate.

439
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:46,204
-And you have to get Margo to school.
-Ah.

440
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:47,788
It's gonna be awesome.

441
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:49,289
-Yay.
-Hey.

442
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:52,600
You just have to put yourself
out there, and I promise,

443
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:55,045
Mayflower will love
Chet Cunningham.

444
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:57,155
Well, they're gonna love him
just as much as I do.

445
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,587
Mm.

446
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:02,409
And you, little man, are gonna have
so much fun with your daddy today.

447
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:06,807
Yep, just you and Dada.

448
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:08,809
Come on, say it. "Dada."

449
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,627
"Dada."

450
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:16,381
Gonna be a fun day.

451
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:37,361
Okay.

452
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,251
Thanks a lot, guys.

453
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:49,604
All right.

454
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,046
-Thanks, hon. Bye.
-Bye.

455
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:54,646
Look, Margo. Neighbors.

456
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,880
Hello!

457
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:57,691
Hmm?

458
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:58,817
Come on.

459
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:01,135
You got this, Chet.

460
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:05,657
I'm your new neighbor,
Chet Cunningham.

461
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:07,242
Uh-huh. Perry Prescott.

462
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:11,705
So, what, uh, brings you
to the neighborhood, Chet?

463
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:14,606
Well, uh...

464
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,001
Solar panels.

465
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,890
That's it. I sell solar panels.

466
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:21,757
Have you joined
the solar revolution?

467
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:23,575
Yeah, no.

468
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,421
Uh, I think I'm good.

469
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:26,572
Good to know.

470
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:28,597
So, uh, what do you do, Perry?

471
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:30,307
I own Prescott Motors,

472
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:34,224
the largest auto dealer
in the state.

473
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:36,647
Wow. That's impressive.

474
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:38,690
This is my daughter Margo.

475
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:40,382
Bree, Dad.

476
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:41,777
Ah, yes.

477
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:43,445
Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

478
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:45,864
It's funny because
I was thinking...

479
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:47,282
I was thinking about a fish

480
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,451
I once had as a pet named Margo,

481
00:24:49,475 --> 00:24:54,396
who lived in the pond and, uh, then died.

482
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,418
Anyway, I, uh...

483
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:02,263
I am about to take Bree
to school for her first day.

484
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:05,232
Yeah, I was about to take Poppy
to school, so...

485
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:07,515
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

486
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,637
That's a fun name to say.

487
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:11,954
You want to carpool with us?

488
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,058
No.

489
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:15,018
You can be friends with Bree.

490
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:16,311
Right, Bree?

491
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:18,367
You don't have any friends.

492
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:24,356
Well, love the chitchat, Chet,
but she's got school,

493
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,009
and I'm meeting some pals
over at the country club, so...

494
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,319
Ooh, country club.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

495
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:35,866
If I were ever invited to a country
club, I am sure that I would love it.

496
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:39,167
Yeah, well, we really
have to get going,

497
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,669
so nice meeting you, Chet.

498
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:42,504
♪ I'm too sexy... ♪

499
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:44,133
Okay, cool.

500
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:48,349
Anytime you want to hang out,
just hit me up with a text.

501
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:50,212
He's gonna text me.

502
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:51,935
That was painful.

503
00:25:56,795 --> 00:25:59,552
You'll see, by lunchtime,
you will have forgotten

504
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:02,190
all about your old,
lousy friends.

505
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:04,701
Mm, not so sure about that.

506
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,739
Hey, honey, you got this.

507
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:19,041
You are smart. You are funny.

508
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,240
What's there to worry about, right?

509
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:24,308
They're gonna love you.

510
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,712
Thanks, Gru.

511
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,056
Buh-bye.

512
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:33,575
Oh, please let them love you.

513
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:40,922
Hey, Poppy.

514
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:46,766
Uh...

515
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:50,238
Move it!

516
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:51,907
Sorry. My bad.

517
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:55,851
I'm going. All right, I'm going.

518
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,818
Ooh. Glassos.

519
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:29,093
All right, gentlemen, fall in.

520
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:33,537
Some of you may be wondering
why you're here.

521
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:35,117
-Uh...
-Si.

522
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:36,945
As you may or may not know,

523
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:38,662
I was recently called out of retirement

524
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:41,832
to head up the AVL's
new top secret initiative

525
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:44,209
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

526
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,128
And that's where you come in.

527
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:48,278
We need volunteers.

528
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,008
We are looking for the strong,
the mighty...

529
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:53,260
-Oh.
-Uh...

530
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,594
-...the fearless.
-Uh, nope.

531
00:27:54,618 --> 00:27:57,305
-We need the best of the best.
-Uh...

532
00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:00,791
So, who's it going to be?

533
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,318
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

534
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:07,130
Uh, blumach.

535
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:09,526
The AVL is known

536
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,053
for cutting-edge weapons
and vehicles,

537
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:15,347
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents,

538
00:28:15,498 --> 00:28:18,999
and I can think of no better
guinea pigs than you.

539
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:21,107
Guinea pig! Yeah!

540
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:25,462
You will be the first
to test our Super-serum,

541
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,752
designed to transform you
into elite agents

542
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,031
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal man.

543
00:28:33,908 --> 00:28:36,136
Or you might just explode.

544
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,784
We don't really know.

545
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,601
Uh, uh, huh?

546
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:44,761
Ah...Hey!

547
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:24,124
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Mega Minions.

548
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,360
Cool!

549
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:35,570
Aw, you guys look adorable.

550
00:29:35,594 --> 00:29:37,697
And-and really tough
and-and scary.

551
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:40,075
I'll look even better
when I have a black belt.

552
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:41,035
Hi-yah!

553
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:44,354
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break
a brick with my head.

554
00:29:44,436 --> 00:29:47,105
That's the spirit. Oh!

555
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,092
Oh, okay, now, go have fun
while I'm at work.

556
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:52,934
Blair and Britney, right?

557
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,627
-Mm...
-We will!

558
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:56,591
Okay. Bye, Mom.

559
00:29:56,615 --> 00:29:58,058
Bye!

560
00:29:58,082 --> 00:29:59,600
Gotcha.

561
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:01,085
Hi-yah!

562
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:03,319
Circle up, people.

563
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:07,957
Show respect for your sensei.

564
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:10,405
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan!

565
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,407
Hai!

566
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:19,364
You, Moscovitch, didn't I
tell you to cut that hair?

567
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:21,116
You look like a sheepdog.

568
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,016
Sorry, Sensei.

569
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:27,931
Now, we have two new students
today ready to begin their journey--

570
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:31,426
hi-yah!-- to awesomeness.

571
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:33,461
You, tiny girl.

572
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:36,192
Step forward
and tell us your name.

573
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,638
Um...

574
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:40,028
It's Britney.

575
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:41,177
Uh...

576
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,271
m-my name?

577
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:46,458
I can't...

578
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,861
There's no "can't" in karate.

579
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:51,521
Ten push-ups after class!

580
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,964
Hey, that's not fair.

581
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:58,067
You better not be talking back to your sensei.

582
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:04,073
Now, are you ready to tell us
your name and participate?

583
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:05,610
Mm...

584
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:07,761
I guess not.

585
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,916
Then why don't you go sit in the
corner of disgrace and reflection

586
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,018
and think about what kind
of person you want to be?

587
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:23,828
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

588
00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,136
Yeah, probably.

589
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,890
Excuse me?

590
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:29,559
If you think I'm above
fighting children,

591
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:32,961
you picked the wrong dojo.

592
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:51,563
That was for my sister.

593
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:57,485
You broke my pinkie toe.

594
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:01,489
That's gonna be a lot of push-ups.

595
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:04,719
Okay, put this over here.

596
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:05,853
Hair gel.

597
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:07,254
-Hairspray.
-Oh, uh, Mrs. Cunningham.

598
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:09,281
Oh, yeah, uh, yeah? Uh, um, hi.

599
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:12,394
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

600
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:14,312
Well, what can I say?

601
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,971
I'm good at what I do.

602
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:18,733
Well, you are exactly what we need here.

603
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:21,718
Lot of vain, demanding divas
in this town.

604
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:26,760
I have a hair emergency, people.

605
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,718
Where's what's-her-name?
Remy? Rhonda?

606
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,958
Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

607
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:33,498
Rachel's on maternity leave.

608
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:36,180
What?! Oh, that is unacceptable.

609
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:41,256
But you are in luck, because
Blanche here is fantastic.

610
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,115
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

611
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,511
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

612
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:48,912
♪ Let's go! ♪

613
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:54,102
So, Melora,
what are we thinking?

614
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:57,147
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

615
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,906
Let nature do
its "thang," you know?

616
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,789
No, no, no, no, that style is dead to me.

617
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:05,238
It's-it's time for a whole new Melora.

618
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:07,486
I want this.

619
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,129
Wow.

620
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,661
Wow. Um...

621
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:15,623
Okay. Let's start with color.

622
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,984
Yes, color, 'cause that's
what you start with.

623
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,338
A little of this.

624
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:24,132
Some of that.

625
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:25,651
And, ooh, that's pretty.

626
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:27,802
This isn't so hard.

627
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:31,796
Uh...

628
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,225
What?

629
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,981
Should it be smoking?

630
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:41,054
Yes, uh-huh.

631
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:43,371
Smoking means it's working.

632
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:52,702
What's going on?

633
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,270
Perfect. No one panic.

634
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,564
Call 911!

635
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:04,696
Quickly, quickly.

636
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:05,923
Oh.

637
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,157
Wonder where they're going.

638
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:14,796
Voilà.
My latest creation.

639
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,478
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

640
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:19,979
Ay, I love it.

641
00:34:20,003 --> 00:34:21,853
Oh, and look at the little antenna.

642
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:23,066
That's so cute.

643
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,068
It's not supposed to be cute, no!

644
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:28,595
I'm going for intimidating. Terrifying, even.

645
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:32,541
Now, all I have to do is
find that walking bald potato,

646
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,869
and his baby is mine.

647
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:37,520
Check this out.

648
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,471
No, I kid you not. I'm being...

649
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:55,413
Whoa!

650
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,816
Whoa!

651
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:14,424
Oh, this is going to be so good!

652
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:29,139
Okay, Daddy is officially exhausted.

653
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:30,318
I changed your diaper.

654
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:32,518
I've got your bottle, your Binky.

655
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,934
And here are your balloons.

656
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,097
There you go.

657
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,842
You like those, right?

658
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:40,743
All right, a little bit of me time.

659
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:02,087
Mmm, mmm.

660
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,471
Someone put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

661
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:19,622
Ugh, teenagers are the worst.

662
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:23,960
Yeah, babies are no picnic, either.

663
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:31,969
Junior!

664
00:36:45,774 --> 00:36:47,984
Ah, okay, okay.

665
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:51,519
Dua Lipa. Prosciutto.

666
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:01,789
Fire in de bowl!

667
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:05,418

00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:17,508
Hello, Gru.

671
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:21,434
Hello. Wha... Hey.
What. What the...

672
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:24,455
Oh. Hello, Poppy.

673
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:25,797
Did you say something?

674
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:28,584
Wha... My name's Chet,
by the way.

675
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:30,211
Chet Cunningham.

676
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:31,154
Gru?

677
00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:34,306
Wha...
What does that even mean?

678
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:38,539
It means you're bad at lying.

679
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:40,421
Hey, that's not nice.

680
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:42,724
Ever hear of respecting
your elders?

681
00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:44,991
I don't respect boomers.

682
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,016
I just mock them.

683
00:37:47,502 --> 00:37:50,523
Is that, like, a joke
you read on the Web?

684
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:52,922
Wow. "The Web"?

685
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:54,573
How old are you?

686
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:57,933
Well, old enough to know
that you are a rotten little...

687
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,659
You better watch yourself.

688
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:03,077
Ooh.

689
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:05,747
You used to be a master villain.

690
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,957
That's not me.

691
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,917
I don't even see a resemblance.

692
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:12,574
Clearly, you have the wrong guy,

693
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:15,923
as I sell... mm, solar panels.

694
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:18,646
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna expose you.

695
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,678
Because you're gonna help me
pull a heist.

696
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,597
We start planning tomorrow.

697
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:24,747
You want to pull a heist?

698
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:26,934
Listen, kid, I'm not going to...

699
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:29,353
-No, you listen, old man.
-Ow.

700
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:31,355
I own you.

701
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:36,117
And I promise,
you do not want to cross me.

702
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:37,487
Okay.

703
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:41,324
All right, but tomorrow
is-is not really good timing.

704
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:42,875
Bummer for you.

705
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:44,844
Because this is happening,

706
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:51,316
unless you want the whole world
to know exactly who you are...

707
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,564
...Gru.

708
00:38:56,345 --> 00:38:58,587
She's terrifying.

709
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:04,134
Ah.

710
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:06,827
Oh, looka!

711
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:12,128
Bello. Bello. Thank you.

712
00:39:13,672 --> 00:39:15,465
-Ow!
-Ooh!

713
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:19,480
Give me, Give me hi five

714
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:23,825
Got you.

715
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:25,350
Oh, thank you.

716
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,455
Yay!

717
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,648
Oh, blumach.

718
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:33,841
Hey, Jiminy! Tu cafe le colda?
No problemo.

719
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:58,091
Thank you.

720
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:02,071
All right, all right,
s-settle down.

721
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:04,140
Settle down!

722
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:05,491
Thank you.

723
00:40:05,515 --> 00:40:08,226
It's time to get you out
for some real-world training.

724
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:12,290
And if you do well out there,

725
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:16,165
you'll be the AVL's
new secret weapon.

726
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:17,941
Pomodoro!

727
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:31,916
I'm quite sure I won't regret this.

728
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,768
No, the painters canceled.

729
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:35,997
-Uh-huh.
-True story.

730
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:36,346
Wow.

731
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,222
-I don't know what is the deal with these...
-Morning, neighbors! -Uh...

732
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:40,802
Hey there!

733
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:43,455
Still waiting on that invite,
Perry.

734
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:44,947
-Uh...
-Oh!

735
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:47,207
-No. No. No, no.
-Yoo-hoo!

736
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:48,743
-Patsy.
-Oh, neighbors.

737
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,745
-Oh, Patsy.
-Hi there.

738
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:52,788
I'm Perry's wife Patsy.

739
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:53,998
Oh. I'm Blanche.

740
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:55,625
And this is Chet.

741
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:59,128
Hi. So I look over here,
and I see you, and...

742
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,779
I have one of
my brilliant ideas.

743
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,425
Perry needs a fourth
for tennis tomorrow.

744
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:05,801
Oh, honey.

745
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:07,386
I... I don't know.

746
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,972
He doesn't seem like
much of a tennis guy.

747
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:11,265
Much of a tennis guy?

748
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:13,017
I am too much of a tennis guy.

749
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,792
I'm Mr. Tennis.

750
00:41:14,816 --> 00:41:18,189
It's my favorite
of all the sports games.

751
00:41:18,213 --> 00:41:21,192
With the racket and, uh,
with the balls.

752
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:23,497
So yellow and fuzzy.

753
00:41:24,091 --> 00:41:25,524
Oh, then we're all set.

754
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,597
See you two at the club
tomorrow.

755
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:29,158
Toodle-oo.

756
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:32,059
Okay. Toodle-oo to you two, too.

757
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:34,997
So, you-you play tennis?

758
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:37,766
Yes, yes, I play tennis.

759
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,252
I'm pretty fantastic, actually.

760
00:41:40,276 --> 00:41:42,453
Well, at least I was at summer camp.

761
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:44,041
Wow, that's great.

762
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:44,880
Here you go.

763
00:41:44,904 --> 00:41:47,155
Mwah. Okay, bye.

764
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:49,643
Have fun.

765
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,366
There you go.

766
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:54,480
Okay.

767
00:41:55,957 --> 00:41:57,738
Huh?

768
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:05,092
What the...

769
00:42:05,116 --> 00:42:07,890
Meet me in my treehouse

770
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:22,549
Gru.

771
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,908
You can't hide from me, Gru.

772
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,301
Ay, my back is killing me.
How long is this gonna take?

773
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:31,971
It will take as long as it takes.

774
00:42:31,995 --> 00:42:35,164
Mark my words, Gru will not win.

775
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,810
This won't be like
the ninth grade talent show.

776
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:40,104
Ay, again with this.

777
00:42:40,128 --> 00:42:42,773
Yes, again.
It was a pivotal moment.

778
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:45,132
Why can't you indulge me?

779
00:42:47,052 --> 00:42:49,220
It was the night of the big show.

780
00:42:50,638 --> 00:42:52,533
I had practiced for weeks,

781
00:42:52,557 --> 00:42:56,162
perfecting a number that would
blow my classmates away.

782
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:58,873
♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon... ♪

783
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:00,929
I was about to go on when...

784
00:43:01,226 --> 00:43:02,834
-What?
-I heard it.

785
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,734
Wait. Oh.

786
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:10,134
♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon... ♪

787
00:43:10,158 --> 00:43:12,558
There was that little jerk

788
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:17,361
-doing my big number.
-♪ You come and go... ♪

789
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:19,592
He ruined everything.

790
00:43:19,616 --> 00:43:21,145
I couldn't go on after him.

791
00:43:21,169 --> 00:43:22,980
I would've looked like a fool.

792
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:24,940
Like I was copying him.

793
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:27,193
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

794
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:29,001
That was a very popular song.

795
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,312
Oh, no, no, no, no. He knew.

796
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:32,948
He did it on purpose.

797
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:35,312
He reveled in humiliating me.

798
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:36,134
Huh?

799
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:39,260
-What now?
-Ugh, we're low on fuel.

800
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,034
It's always something.

801
00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:44,358
Look, I can never focus
on just being evil.

802
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:47,455
Okay. Pull over.

803
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:17,785
Okay, let's see.

804
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:19,340
Regular unleaded.

805
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:20,871
Ooh. Wow.

806
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:22,456
It is expensive, no?

807
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,210
Okay. Insert card
and remove rapidly.

808
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:28,861
"Card not read."

809
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:32,534
-Oh, come on.
-Did you pull it out rapidly?

810
00:44:32,558 --> 00:44:35,435
Yes, yes, very rapidly.

811
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:45,909
Ay, get me a slushy.
It's my cheat day.

812
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:50,642
Hey, you, your stupid machine
won't read my card.

813
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,544
Did you remove it rapidly?

814
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:53,878
Yes.

815
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:56,240
Well, sometimes it's too rapid.

816
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:58,809
You should probably try again.

817
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,167
I don't have time for this!

818
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:03,289
Whoa!

819
00:45:03,313 --> 00:45:07,418
I'm trying to destroy
my archnemesis.

820
00:45:07,442 --> 00:45:10,546
Now, give me 900 gallons
on pump four, you idiot.

821
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,257
Please don't hurt me.

822
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:15,866
Oh, I'm not going to hurt you.

823
00:45:16,816 --> 00:45:18,888
Wha...

824
00:45:18,912 --> 00:45:22,081
Ow!

825
00:45:25,543 --> 00:45:27,962
Oh, look at you.

826
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:30,065
Much better.

827
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:32,466
Now, get me a purple slushy!

828
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,571
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know.

829
00:45:35,595 --> 00:45:37,071
So there.

830
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:38,805
I know I'm so bad.

831
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:48,563
Hmm. Okay, why don't you guys
pick out a healthy cereal?

832
00:45:48,798 --> 00:45:52,077
This was Lucky's
favorite cereal.

833
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:55,979
You don't think
he'll forget me, do you?

834
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:59,183
Oh, sweetheart,
that's impossible.

835
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:01,675
You play with Lucky
and-and dress him up.

836
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,489
And you guys have your podcast.

837
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:06,872
There is no way in this world
he could ever forget

838
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:09,421
his best friend.

839
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:11,690
Thanks, Mom.

840
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:13,572
Oh, look it!

841
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:15,862
This one has extra marshmallows!

842
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:17,388
Double Frosted Choco Clusters.

843
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:20,159
-Yeah.
-Yeah, let's go with those.

844
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:22,558
All right, what else do we need?

845
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:26,094
Oh, no.

846
00:46:26,378 --> 00:46:28,939
Nobody see. Nobody notice.
Nobody notice.

847
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,045
-Whew.
-What's wrong?

848
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:34,338
Huh?

849
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:36,027
Oh, nothing. Just, uh...

850
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:39,346
ooh, stretching
before we hit the aisles.

851
00:46:39,408 --> 00:46:42,880
Shopping is the number one
cause of pulled hamstrings.

852
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:45,406
Probably didn't know that.

853
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,645
Okay, all stretched.
Let's go. Quickly.

854
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:51,355
Quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

855
00:46:51,379 --> 00:46:53,339
Okay. Coast is clear.

856
00:46:56,175 --> 00:46:57,802
Uh... oh.

857
00:46:59,055 --> 00:47:01,098
You!

858
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:03,592
You did this to me!

859
00:47:03,616 --> 00:47:05,201
You fraud.

860
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:07,511
Come on, girls.
Clean up on aisle nine!

861
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:08,739
I've always wanted to say that.

862
00:47:08,763 --> 00:47:11,307
Just hide over here.

863
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:13,419
What does that lady want?

864
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:15,861
Lady? I didn't see a lady.

865
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:19,633
Lady!

866
00:47:19,657 --> 00:47:21,218
Come on, let's go.

867
00:47:21,242 --> 00:47:23,137
-Faster.
-Aah! -Whoa!

868
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:25,246
You're no hairdresser!

869
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,831
I'm onto you!

870
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:30,543
-Get back here!
-Got to get out of here.

871
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:48,384
Okay.

872
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:56,672
Come back here!

873
00:47:57,653 --> 00:47:59,371
Whoa!

874
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:05,077
Hey! No, no, no, no, no!

875
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:07,181
-You can't just...
-Open! Open!

876
00:48:07,205 --> 00:48:08,577
Open!

877
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,722
Whoa!

878
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:18,539
Let's go.

879
00:48:22,428 --> 00:48:25,472
Stop! Come here, you!

880
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,466
No!

881
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,537
Whew.

882
00:48:30,561 --> 00:48:32,276
That was a close one.

883
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,583
Always a fun time
when you go shopping with Mom.

884
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,059
-Yeah!
-Best shopping trip ever!

885
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:39,002
I feel so alive!

886
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,186
Perfecto.

887
00:49:12,756 --> 00:49:14,104
Poppy?

888
00:49:14,146 --> 00:49:15,686
Poppy!

889
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:21,094
I don't see her, Junior.

890
00:49:21,118 --> 00:49:22,563
Look up, genius.

891
00:49:22,587 --> 00:49:24,672
-Huh?
-You're late.

892
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:27,742
How do I get up there?

893
00:49:27,766 --> 00:49:29,436
Use the trampoline.

894
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,596
Huh?

895
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:37,314
Here we go.

896
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:47,638
Whoa! Aah!

897
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:52,817
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

898
00:50:04,821 --> 00:50:06,633
It is I,

899
00:50:06,657 --> 00:50:08,635
Poppy Prescott,

900
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:11,054
villainess.

901
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:12,514
Have a seat, Gru.

902
00:50:12,538 --> 00:50:15,040
All right, I'll sit...

903
00:50:15,674 --> 00:50:17,926
Okay. Why am I here?

904
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,022
Because, like you,
I was born to be bad.

905
00:50:23,046 --> 00:50:24,412
And now...

906
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:28,178
it's time to discuss
our big heist.

907
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:31,598
"Heist."
Please, you're just a child.

908
00:50:33,124 --> 00:50:35,503
All great villains start young.

909
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:39,114
Didn't you steal the
Crown Jewels when you were 12?

910
00:50:39,153 --> 00:50:41,001
I was a lot younger than that.

911
00:50:41,025 --> 00:50:43,112
And no offense,
but you're not me.

912
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:47,132
Oh, I plan on being a lot better than you.

913
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:49,510
Check this out.

914
00:50:49,534 --> 00:50:51,970
Hey, is that my old school?

915
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:53,281
Bingo.

916
00:50:53,305 --> 00:50:57,310
Which I have expertly modeled
with glue and Popsicle sticks.

917
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:00,604
And it's where
we are going to steal...

918
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:03,232
the school mascot.

919
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:05,076
You want to steal Lenny?

920
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,209
Exactly.

921
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:09,344
Lycee Pas Bon has always been
my dream school,

922
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:10,745
and this heist
will look so great

923
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:12,647
on my villain transcripts.

924
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:14,590
That is a terrible idea.

925
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:17,788
Have you ever even seen
a honey badger?

926
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:20,123
They are vicious little monsters.

927
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:24,194
They literally eat bees
and cobras for breakfast.

928
00:51:24,218 --> 00:51:26,276
Honey badger don't care.

929
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,757
No way. No way am I helping you.

930
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:31,700
Well, that's the thing with blackmail.

931
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,578
You kind of have no choice.

932
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:51,053
Come here. Come here!

933
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,798
Ah, uh...
Tim.

934
00:52:09,822 --> 00:52:11,425
Tim, uh, tu le do it.

935
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:14,159
-Go, go, go.
-P-P-Porque meo?

936
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:17,703
Chihuahua.

937
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:24,617
Bas enough!

938
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,607
No! Tu le stronga.

939
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:27,920
Tu le forta.

940
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,612
Tu le besta!

941
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:31,778
Les salami!

942
00:52:31,802 --> 00:52:33,614
Les salami!

943
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:36,723
Aah! Suppository!

944
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,842
Hey! Police!

945
00:52:43,866 --> 00:52:45,992
No problemo.

946
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,218
Ow!

947
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:54,676
Ooh. Uh...

948
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,619
Piña colada.

949
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:05,079
Help!

950
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:08,982
Please, can you help me?

951
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:11,633
Oh, si, si.

952
00:53:18,035 --> 00:53:19,451
Hey. All is goot.

953
00:53:19,475 --> 00:53:21,101
Ciao!

954
00:53:23,562 --> 00:53:25,332
Smudge, Smudge, come down.

955
00:53:25,356 --> 00:53:27,316
Hey!

956
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:31,948
Les gato.

957
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:35,782
Thank you. Thank you.

958
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,965
Ooh, smoocha.

959
00:53:39,495 --> 00:53:41,663
Oh!

960
00:53:50,448 --> 00:53:51,733
Help!

961
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:54,927
Bazooka!

962
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,779
Ah. Uh...

963
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,679
Hey, hey. Stoppa. Stoppa.

964
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:22,829
Muy risky. Lemme do it.

965
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:34,758
Ciao, bellos!

966
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:41,158
There they are.
Those guys crushed my car.

967
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:42,951
They destroyed the coffee shop!

968
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:44,202
Yeah, get out of here!

969
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:45,746
They're ruining everything.

970
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:47,330
I'm sick of superheroes.

971
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:49,398
-Yeah.
-Let's get 'em.

972
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:53,595
Get in.

973
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,048
Gentlemen...

974
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:03,209
our experiment has failed.

975
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:06,129
You are officially going to be retired.

976
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:08,089
Yeah! Retirement!

977
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:10,907
Uh, uh, no?

978
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:27,720
Whoa. There it is.

979
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:35,446
The castle.

980
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,201
The gargoyles.

981
00:55:37,225 --> 00:55:39,379
I can't believe I'm really here.

982
00:55:46,759 --> 00:55:47,923
Okay.

983
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:51,423
Voilà.

984
00:55:51,744 --> 00:55:53,593
Okay, let's get this over with.

985
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:56,262
-Ron, hand me my gear.
-Voilà.

986
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,313
-Keep a close eye on him.
-Okay.

987
00:55:58,337 --> 00:55:59,808
If you need anything,
I brought formula...

988
00:55:59,832 --> 00:56:02,185
-Uh-huh. Formula. Diapers.
-...extra diapers,

989
00:56:02,209 --> 00:56:03,353
-his favorite Binky.
-Come on.

990
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:05,795
Let's go, let's go.

991
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:16,687
And now we cut
through the glass with my...

992
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:17,985
Diapers?

993
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:19,136
What?

994
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,037
You've got to be kidding
with me.

995
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:25,803
Hey, guys. Guys.

996
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:27,230
Guys? Guys.

997
00:56:27,254 --> 00:56:29,847
Guys, where is the other bag,
with my gear?

998
00:56:29,871 --> 00:56:32,048
Ah, in le balloon.

999
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:33,586
Ah, uh...

1000
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:34,889
Oops.

1001
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,287
What? How...

1002
00:56:40,873 --> 00:56:43,323
All right, all right.
Let's see what I got in here.

1003
00:56:43,347 --> 00:56:44,849
Uh... come on.

1004
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:46,501
Come on, come on, come on.

1005
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:48,652
Aha.

1006
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:55,511
Thank you.

1007
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:00,096
Easy peasy.

1008
00:57:13,989 --> 00:57:15,107
Huh?

1009
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,000
That's Mr. Friendly.

1010
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,905
No, no, no, no, no!

1011
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:35,958
Whew.

1012
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:46,072
Ha, ha, ha.

1013
00:57:50,836 --> 00:57:52,423
That's Dr. Destructo.

1014
00:57:52,447 --> 00:57:53,884
He was just a kid.

1015
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:56,657
And there's Killer Driller's
original helmet.

1016
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,008
Come on. Stay focused.

1017
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,462
Diaper.

1018
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:26,019
I need something like...

1019
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:28,546
-something that I can...
-How about this?

1020
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,780
Nice.

1021
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,406
Yes!

1022
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:40,272
We're in.

1023
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:41,010
Wait.

1024
00:58:41,034 --> 00:58:42,929
No, no, no, no, no.

1025
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:43,946
Baby powder.

1026
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,570
Ah, si, si. Yeah.

1027
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,002
Whoa.

1028
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:54,903
You know, the most important
part of a heist

1029
00:58:54,937 --> 00:58:57,763
is being constantly aware
of potential danger.

1030
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,070
Le baby!

1031
00:58:59,094 --> 00:59:00,382
La la! Tiramisu!

1032
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:02,532
No, no! Le baby! Komay le!

1033
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,450
No. Junior.

1034
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,601
Junior, come back here.

1035
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:10,643
So, what's your plan now?

1036
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,283
I am dealing with it.

1037
00:59:16,184 --> 00:59:17,443
Don't touch anything.

1038
00:59:17,467 --> 00:59:21,637
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no!

1039
00:59:23,161 --> 00:59:24,271
Good job, Junior.

1040
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:26,964
Way to go.

1041
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:31,023
Aw, he's having fun.

1042
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:33,257
Eh, too much fun.

1043
00:59:34,364 --> 00:59:36,396
-Ah, stoppa.
-Blah, blah, blah.

1044
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,544
Please, Junior, Daddy needs
to steal a honey badger.

1045
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:45,889
Whew. Okay.

1046
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:49,261
I know they keep Lenny here at night.

1047
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:54,859
And if memory serves, there is a
hidden switch around here somewhere.

1048
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,885
Ah. Aha.

1049
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:58,945
Yes.

1050
01:00:00,913 --> 01:00:02,664
Ooh.

1051
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,672
I'll hit him with this.

1052
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:15,470
Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

1053
01:00:15,494 --> 01:00:18,246
That fuzzy demon will sleep
like a baby the whole...

1054
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:27,076
Okay, he's still asleep.

1055
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:39,256
I tranked myself.

1056
01:00:39,627 --> 01:00:40,977
Ow!

1057
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:48,009
Hey! Hey!

1058
01:00:49,936 --> 01:00:52,479
Gru, what do we do?

1059
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:54,581
No!

1060
01:00:57,379 --> 01:01:00,221
Oh, no! I ruined our heist.

1061
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:05,548
What? Who dares?

1062
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:12,723
Intruders!

1063
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:17,473
Intruders!

1064
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:31,245
Wake up!

1065
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:33,729
No!

1066
01:01:38,587 --> 01:01:39,838
What?

1067
01:01:42,593 --> 01:01:44,177
Hmm.

1068
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,209
Aw.

1069
01:01:48,233 --> 01:01:49,634
Aw.
Aw.

1070
01:01:49,658 --> 01:01:50,640
Give me a hug too.

1071
01:01:50,664 --> 01:01:52,540
No. Nope.

1072
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,880
Come on. We have to go.

1073
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:07,293
Intruders, you messed with the wrong principal.

1074
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,044
Here we go.
Come on. Come on.

1075
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,867
Go, go, go!

1076
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:22,523
Come on! Come on!

1077
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:24,664
Ooh, you won't get away with this.

1078
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:50,345
Prepare to feel the wrath of Ubelschlecht.

1079
01:02:53,794 --> 01:02:55,532
Diaper rash cream.

1080
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:59,351
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

1081
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:01,956
Oh, dear.

1082
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:05,916
Get back here, you!

1083
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,438
I want my Lenny!

1084
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:14,373
How are we getting out of here?

1085
01:03:14,397 --> 01:03:16,638
Follow me.

1086
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:18,058
Get in.

1087
01:03:20,136 --> 01:03:22,263
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1088
01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:26,866
Mr. Friendly!

1089
01:03:27,797 --> 01:03:29,715
Whoa!

1090
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,836
I have to say,

1091
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,147
that was, without a doubt,
the coolest night of my life.

1092
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:58,507
I can't believe
we actually pulled that off.

1093
01:03:58,728 --> 01:04:01,521
Not gonna lie, that was pretty fun.

1094
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:03,791
Scusa. Scusa.

1095
01:04:04,785 --> 01:04:06,165
Thanks, Ron.

1096
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:07,837
Whew.

1097
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:11,814
And thank you for everything.

1098
01:04:12,235 --> 01:04:14,802
Oh, and hey, don't worry.

1099
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:18,347
Your secret is safe with me, partner.

1100
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:19,640
Thanks.

1101
01:04:19,664 --> 01:04:22,166
Good night.

1102
01:04:22,949 --> 01:04:26,202
Your dada did pretty good, huh, Junior?

1103
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:37,371
Hello, Maxime.

1104
01:04:37,395 --> 01:04:39,952
How's my favorite student?

1105
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:43,998
You know, I think you and I might
be looking for the same person,

1106
01:04:44,022 --> 01:04:47,630
and I know exactly where he is.

1107
01:04:54,915 --> 01:04:57,232
Thank you,
Principal Ubelschlecht.

1108
01:04:57,256 --> 01:04:59,009
We got him!

1109
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:01,849
Valentina, to Mayflower!

1110
01:05:01,873 --> 01:05:04,125
With pleasure.

1111
01:05:08,775 --> 01:05:11,444
Ah. Here we go.

1112
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,844
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1113
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,053
It's all coming back to me.

1114
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:20,641
Oops. Oh.

1115
01:05:20,678 --> 01:05:21,288
Okay.

1116
01:05:21,312 --> 01:05:23,155
See you later.

1117
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:24,606
Say, "Bye, Mommy and Daddy."

1118
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,824
Have fun at the club.

1119
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:28,166
Make good choices.

1120
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,193
-Bye, guys.
-Goodbye.

1121
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,386
Bye!

1122
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,037
Hey, Cunninghams.

1123
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:35,216
Um, hey, Poppy.

1124
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,480
I heard our parents are having a
playdate-- which is adorable, by the way--

1125
01:05:38,504 --> 01:05:41,368
and I thought you might want to hang out.

1126
01:05:41,392 --> 01:05:43,478
Oh. Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1127
01:05:43,502 --> 01:05:46,754
Let's get this party started, people!

1128
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,453
I like her.

1129
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,063
Yeah, most people do.

1130
01:05:51,093 --> 01:05:52,226
Sweet.

1131
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:55,658
So, have you guys ever seen
a honey badger?

1132
01:06:01,975 --> 01:06:05,278
Whoa, okay. These guys aren't messing around.

1133
01:06:05,302 --> 01:06:08,341
There are my favorite new neighbors.

1134
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:11,676
-Hi.
-I'm loving this whole vibe.

1135
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,244
You two look like a couple of pros.

1136
01:06:15,787 --> 01:06:18,287
Yeah, but we're not.

1137
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:20,748
Perry and the boys are waiting
for y'all on the court,

1138
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:23,317
and we are hitting the clubhouse.

1139
01:06:23,341 --> 01:06:26,761
And you're telling me where
you got that to-die-for outfit.

1140
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,106
Over here, Chet.

1141
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:35,924
Hello.

1142
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:38,419
Okay.

1143
01:06:38,443 --> 01:06:40,564
Skip, Chip, Chet.
Chet, Skip, Chip.

1144
01:06:40,588 --> 01:06:41,796
Hey there, fellas.

1145
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,183
-Hello.
-How are you doing, Chet?

1146
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:44,750
Okay.

1147
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:49,468
Chet here is gonna show
us fellas how it's done.

1148
01:06:49,492 --> 01:06:51,227
Right?

1149
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:53,963
Uh, hmm.

1150
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:57,168
Oh, I'm gonna smoke this guy.

1151
01:06:57,192 --> 01:06:59,277
Okay.

1152
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:06,494
Huh?

1153
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:09,854
What the...

1154
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:19,718
Okay. Let's do this.

1155
01:07:24,015 --> 01:07:26,851
Huh? You've got to be kidding.

1156
01:07:27,768 --> 01:07:30,145
Okay, okay.

1157
01:07:30,355 --> 01:07:32,315
Better?

1158
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:39,280
-What?
-Hmm?

1159
01:07:39,877 --> 01:07:41,310
That doesn't count.

1160
01:07:41,334 --> 01:07:42,648
And... oh! What?

1161
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:45,337
You can't just...

1162
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,035
This is ridiculous!

1163
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,395
Huh?

1164
01:07:52,942 --> 01:07:54,326
Ah.

1165
01:08:02,852 --> 01:08:03,974
Thanks, Ron.

1166
01:08:03,998 --> 01:08:05,624
Hey, no! Oh, no!

1167
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:09,338
Come and get it.

1168
01:08:09,362 --> 01:08:11,746
-Oh, it's so cute.
-Whoa.

1169
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:14,606
This is the weirdest dog ever.

1170
01:08:15,215 --> 01:08:16,813
I'll get it.

1171
01:08:26,282 --> 01:08:28,217
Well, hello, little one.

1172
01:08:28,241 --> 01:08:30,320
Is your daddy home?

1173
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:34,098
Sorry. I'm not "stupposed"
to talk to strangers.

1174
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:36,786
Oh. I'm not a stranger.

1175
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,480
Well, you look strange to me.

1176
01:08:40,861 --> 01:08:42,447
Who is it?

1177
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:44,102
I don't know.

1178
01:08:44,126 --> 01:08:47,949
But she's old and smells like pickles.

1179
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,645
Okay, I'm coming.

1180
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,184
Oh, no. Um...

1181
01:08:59,328 --> 01:09:00,881
I'll be right back.

1182
01:09:03,467 --> 01:09:04,800
Can I help you?

1183
01:09:04,824 --> 01:09:06,046
Well, I hope so.

1184
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:08,318
I'm an old friend of Gru's.

1185
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:11,901
Well, he's not here, so...

1186
01:09:12,123 --> 01:09:15,003
Oh, that's all right.

1187
01:09:15,027 --> 01:09:16,590
I'll wait.

1188
01:09:20,465 --> 01:09:22,299
Huh? What? No!

1189
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,738
Whenever you're ready, Perry.

1190
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:27,289
Um...

1191
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:29,336
Hmm?

1192
01:09:35,688 --> 01:09:41,256
Needless to say, Perry and I are no
longer welcome on the island of O'ahu.

1193
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,999
True story.

1194
01:09:43,624 --> 01:09:44,455
Honey.

1195
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,425
Oh, thank goodness.

1196
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:48,054
It's the children.
We have to go now.

1197
01:09:49,376 --> 01:09:50,471
Oh.

1198
01:09:50,495 --> 01:09:52,156
Thanks. Bye.

1199
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,098
-Our cover's blown.
-What?

1200
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:56,541
-Call Silas.
-Oh, no.

1201
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,778
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

1202
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:31,577
Ah.

1203
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:34,106
Gru's been compromised.

1204
01:10:34,154 --> 01:10:35,765
This is an emergency, people.

1205
01:10:35,789 --> 01:10:38,033
Retirement is officially over.

1206
01:10:38,057 --> 01:10:41,435
Assemble the Mega Minions.

1207
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:51,961
Pomodoro!

1208
01:10:59,641 --> 01:11:01,600
Pomodoro!

1209
01:11:06,738 --> 01:11:09,383
Shooshta, shooshta,
shooshta, shooshta,

1210
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:12,284
shooshta, shooshta, shooshta!

1211
01:11:13,093 --> 01:11:15,157
Hey.

1212
01:11:15,181 --> 01:11:17,724
Bello, busy bee.

1213
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:19,917
Aw.

1214
01:11:20,983 --> 01:11:22,817
Pomodoro!

1215
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,260
Yee-haw!

1216
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:31,894
Pomodoro!

1217
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:34,632
Pomodoro!

1218
01:11:34,656 --> 01:11:36,242
Yee-haw!

1219
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:38,559
Yippa, yippa!

1220
01:11:40,688 --> 01:11:41,641
Huh?

1221
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:43,235
Whoa.

1222
01:11:43,259 --> 01:11:44,968
Yeah!

1223
01:11:45,693 --> 01:11:47,101
Huh?

1224
01:11:54,322 --> 01:11:58,390
So, your father
has been naughty.

1225
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,951
Very naughty.

1226
01:12:01,516 --> 01:12:05,269
He took something of mine
that I desperately want back.

1227
01:12:09,884 --> 01:12:11,860
Principal Ubelschlecht?

1228
01:12:12,103 --> 01:12:15,323
Ooh. I know you took my Lenny.

1229
01:12:15,347 --> 01:12:17,033
-Now, hand him over!
-Ow!

1230
01:12:17,057 --> 01:12:18,414
Ow. That...

1231
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:20,940
-Actually very funny story.
-Zip it!

1232
01:12:20,964 --> 01:12:24,208
I don't want to hear your excuses.
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

1233
01:12:24,232 --> 01:12:25,843
Let's go, tough guy.

1234
01:12:25,867 --> 01:12:26,626
Okay.

1235
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,795
I'm not going to fight an old lady.

1236
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:29,960
Oh, yeah?

1237
01:12:29,984 --> 01:12:32,858
Well, I'm gonna give you a
whupping for the history books.

1238
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,842
Whoa, whoa!

1239
01:12:37,428 --> 01:12:39,071
Take that!

1240
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:44,603
Yeah, go!

1241
01:12:44,955 --> 01:12:47,397
Girls, look out! Over here!

1242
01:12:47,421 --> 01:12:49,548
-Everyone, get down!
-Gru!

1243
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,907
Hey, back off, lady.

1244
01:13:04,015 --> 01:13:04,838
Stop it!

1245
01:13:04,862 --> 01:13:05,864
Let him go!

1246
01:13:05,888 --> 01:13:08,432
Take that!

1247
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:19,590
Now we have to get in there and find that baby.

1248
01:13:19,614 --> 01:13:20,811
What?

1249
01:13:24,336 --> 01:13:25,988
Oh! Jackpot, huh?

1250
01:13:26,012 --> 01:13:29,628
Ay, Maxime. This is too easy.

1251
01:13:29,652 --> 01:13:31,629
Come here, little baby.

1252
01:13:31,653 --> 01:13:33,141
Come to Maxime.

1253
01:13:33,165 --> 01:13:35,251
Yes. Coochie-coochie...

1254
01:13:35,275 --> 01:13:37,195
-Oh!
-Ay, Maxime.

1255
01:13:37,219 --> 01:13:38,930
You little...

1256
01:13:38,954 --> 01:13:41,956
You are in big trouble.

1257
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,736
Gotcha!

1258
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:54,662
Whew.

1259
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:57,176
Wait. Where's the baby?

1260
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,322
Where's the baby?!

1261
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:01,055
Junior?

1262
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:05,587
Lucy!

1263
01:14:05,611 --> 01:14:07,237
Go after the baby.

1264
01:14:09,753 --> 01:14:10,991
Maxime.

1265
01:14:11,015 --> 01:14:12,741
Say au revoir, Gru.

1266
01:14:12,765 --> 01:14:14,142
Oh, and don't worry.

1267
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:17,049
He will be very happy
with his new daddy.

1268
01:14:17,073 --> 01:14:18,322
Right? Look at him.

1269
01:14:18,346 --> 01:14:20,982
Oh, he loves his new daddy.

1270
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:23,216
Junior!

1271
01:14:24,258 --> 01:14:26,593
No!

1272
01:14:28,489 --> 01:14:29,935
Whoa!

1273
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:31,919
Get in.

1274
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,841
We've got a baby to save.

1275
01:14:41,909 --> 01:14:43,659
We got him!

1276
01:14:43,821 --> 01:14:47,283
Oh, who is ready to become
a little roach?

1277
01:14:47,307 --> 01:14:51,045
Ow! Let go!
Ow! Those are very sensitive.

1278
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:54,050
Aah! You squirmy little...
Oh!

1279
01:14:54,926 --> 01:14:57,613
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

1280
01:14:57,637 --> 01:14:59,973
You got pee-pee
all over my ship.

1281
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:05,567
Valentina, bring me the Roachification Ray.

1282
01:15:08,215 --> 01:15:10,300
There they are.

1283
01:15:12,104 --> 01:15:14,107
I'm on it.

1284
01:15:14,131 --> 01:15:17,050
Here we go!

1285
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:25,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1286
01:15:31,054 --> 01:15:33,462
What's that?

1287
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:35,546
Hello.

1288
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:36,876
Gru!

1289
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,694
Get me closer.

1290
01:15:41,105 --> 01:15:42,882
Almost there.

1291
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:45,757
Take them out!

1292
01:15:57,337 --> 01:16:00,048
You're doing great!

1293
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:06,742
Go get 'em, partner.

1294
01:16:23,017 --> 01:16:25,513
Ay! I can't see!

1295
01:16:40,919 --> 01:16:42,586
Junior.

1296
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,507
Don't worry, Gru.

1297
01:16:45,531 --> 01:16:47,471
The baby is fine.

1298
01:16:47,495 --> 01:16:49,663
See for yourself.

1299
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,463
Oh, Junior.

1300
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:55,588
And now he belongs to me.

1301
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:58,829
Isn't that right, Maxime Jr.?

1302
01:16:59,292 --> 01:17:02,592
Together, we will wreak havoc, cause mayhem

1303
01:17:02,616 --> 01:17:05,410
and have so much fun doing it, huh?

1304
01:17:06,474 --> 01:17:09,103
And best of all, he hates you!

1305
01:17:09,127 --> 01:17:10,562
He really does.

1306
01:17:10,586 --> 01:17:12,673
Let my son go.

1307
01:17:12,697 --> 01:17:14,279
No, I don't think so.

1308
01:17:14,303 --> 01:17:18,181
The fun is just about to start, huh?

1309
01:17:26,561 --> 01:17:30,690
Oh, look at what a coward your old daddy is, huh?

1310
01:17:56,907 --> 01:17:59,252
You crossed the line, Maxime.

1311
01:17:59,276 --> 01:18:01,142
Now, give me my son.

1312
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:05,169
I told you, he is my son now.

1313
01:18:15,756 --> 01:18:19,440
Watch your step, Gru.
It's a doozy!

1314
01:18:19,464 --> 01:18:21,569
Too bad you can't fly, huh?

1315
01:18:28,462 --> 01:18:30,297
-Let go!
-Ow!

1316
01:18:41,353 --> 01:18:43,438
This ends now!

1317
01:18:43,643 --> 01:18:45,979
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1318
01:18:51,337 --> 01:18:53,668
It's okay, Junior.

1319
01:18:53,956 --> 01:18:56,053
Dada loves you.

1320
01:19:20,564 --> 01:19:21,849
Get back here.

1321
01:19:21,873 --> 01:19:22,990
Bad baby.

1322
01:19:23,014 --> 01:19:24,224
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1323
01:19:24,248 --> 01:19:26,208
Get off me, you demon!

1324
01:19:26,692 --> 01:19:28,905
You are going to feel the wrath of...

1325
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:41,960
Whoa.

1326
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:54,491
See? Not a scratch.

1327
01:19:54,515 --> 01:19:56,493
Huh? Wha...?

1328
01:19:56,517 --> 01:19:59,770
Salami!

1329
01:20:01,105 --> 01:20:03,190
Pastrami!

1330
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:06,312
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1331
01:20:06,336 --> 01:20:09,005
Prosciutto!

1332
01:20:09,863 --> 01:20:11,550
-What?
-Prosciutto!

1333
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:13,385
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

1334
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:14,910
Gross.

1335
01:20:18,196 --> 01:20:21,355
Nice try. When I...

1336
01:20:23,242 --> 01:20:26,411
Antipasti.

1337
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:30,262
Oh!

1338
01:20:32,891 --> 01:20:34,435
-Gru! -Oh, Gru!
-You're here!

1339
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:35,624
Junior!

1340
01:20:39,758 --> 01:20:40,827
Yes!

1341
01:20:41,397 --> 01:20:42,141
-Yay!
-Holy cow!

1342
01:20:42,165 --> 01:20:44,292
-Are you guys okay?
-That was insane!

1343
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,876
Dada.

1344
01:20:54,635 --> 01:20:56,596
Aw.

1345
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,419
Aw. My boys.

1346
01:20:58,443 --> 01:20:59,988
Dada.

1347
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:06,503
You know something, today has
been a real roller coaster of emotion.

1348
01:21:09,475 --> 01:21:11,278
Uh, Gru?

1349
01:21:11,302 --> 01:21:13,380
Can we go back home now?

1350
01:21:17,965 --> 01:21:20,091
All right. There you go.

1351
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:22,001
Yay!

1352
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:23,818
Thanks, Dr. Nefario.

1353
01:21:24,562 --> 01:21:25,790
Good as new.

1354
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:29,192
No job too small or too mad.

1355
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:31,144
Bye, then.

1356
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:33,420
Bye.

1357
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:42,689
Hey. You okay, sweetie?

1358
01:21:44,048 --> 01:21:47,513
Agnes! Someone's here to see you!

1359
01:21:55,555 --> 01:21:57,141
Lucky?

1360
01:22:01,045 --> 01:22:02,754
Lucky!

1361
01:22:05,357 --> 01:22:07,567
Did you practice your tricks?

1362
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:10,347
Okay, play dead.

1363
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,437
Yay!

1364
01:22:16,461 --> 01:22:19,177
Ah, that was... disturbing.

1365
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:21,328
-Yeah, little bit.
-Lucky!

1366
01:22:23,588 --> 01:22:26,152
Hey, I'll, uh...
I'll be back soon.

1367
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,627
-Oh. Okay.
-Mwah.

1368
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:30,105
There's something
I need to take care of.

1369
01:22:30,129 --> 01:22:30,939
Mwah.

1370
01:22:30,963 --> 01:22:32,589
See you later, buddy.

1371
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:33,533
Love you, honey.

1372
01:22:33,557 --> 01:22:35,571
Da-da-da.

1373
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,369
How you doing, Maxime?

1374
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:46,363
What are you doing here, Gru?

1375
01:22:46,387 --> 01:22:48,014
You came to gloat, no?

1376
01:22:48,038 --> 01:22:52,443
Gloat? No, no, no, no. I just... I
wanted to get something off my chest.

1377
01:22:52,491 --> 01:22:55,962
And it concerns the ninth grade talent show.

1378
01:22:56,822 --> 01:23:00,079
Well, actually...

1379
01:23:00,281 --> 01:23:03,784
-I did steal your song.
-What?

1380
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,019
I knew it!

1381
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:06,513
I knew there was no coincidence.

1382
01:23:06,537 --> 01:23:08,580
You little liar!

1383
01:23:09,629 --> 01:23:10,986
Well?

1384
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:11,887
Well, what?

1385
01:23:11,911 --> 01:23:13,414
Well, where's my apology?

1386
01:23:13,438 --> 01:23:15,356
Apol... What are you talking about?

1387
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,004
I just apologized.

1388
01:23:17,028 --> 01:23:18,386
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1389
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,344
No, that was no apology.

1390
01:23:20,368 --> 01:23:22,496
You just wanted to rub it in.

1391
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,067
I can't believe you stole my song.

1392
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:30,203
Hey, I only did that to get back at you
for pantsing me at the homecoming dance.

1393
01:23:30,567 --> 01:23:33,232
Besides, you could've gone on after me.

1394
01:23:33,256 --> 01:23:36,231
It is not my fault that you were afraid.

1395
01:23:36,255 --> 01:23:39,150
Afraid because I killed it!

1396
01:23:39,174 --> 01:23:40,635
Afraid? Ha!

1397
01:23:40,659 --> 01:23:43,276
I could outsing you any day of the week

1398

1399
