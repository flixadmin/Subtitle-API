00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,720
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,880
What kind of egg is that?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,280
It's a dragon egg.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,200
Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,080
I can't stop.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,720
I give up. Do you hear me, Neron?

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,880
Spare Nate and I'll let you have me.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,840
- Neron?
- I can make you whole again.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,960
- My nipple.
- Gary, no.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,920
Nora, I need your help.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,080
I am asking you to face another demon
as a member of the Time Bureau.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,200
Let's do this.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,240
All right, enough of the sightseeing.
Can we go now?

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm a bit knackered,
to be honest with you, mate.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,920
We're not here as tourists, Johnny.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,840
Oh right, you're gonna get rid of me
in some dramatic fashion.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,000
Get on with it, will you?

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,960
I'm not gonna kill you.
Not yet, anyway.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,960
- I need you for a favor.
- Is that right?

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,320
I need you to open up
a doorway to hell.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,560
Oh, right.
Well, why didn't you say so?

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,560
I will gladly open up
a vortex right here

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
and give you the old heave-ho
to the great beyond.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,640
The door is not for me, Johnny.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,640
It's to bring someone here
from the other side.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,400
Tabitha. That's right.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,840
If she comes straight
through the doorway

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,000
she doesn't need a human vessel.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,400
And what in that demented
demon brain of yours

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,800
makes you think that I'm going
to open a vortex for you?

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,560
Unlike Gary,
I've still got both my nipples

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,200
so you don't have much
to bargain with.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,440
Speaking of which
what have you done with the Muppet?

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,680
Gary's just fine.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,160
He's back at the Time Bureau
taking care of business.

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,440
Okay, Nora, you can do this.

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,880
Just be normal.

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,320
You can be normal.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,240
Because you are normal.

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,320
- Next.
- Come on.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,440
That's your ID picture?

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
They wouldn't let me retake it.

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, it can't be that bad. Let me see.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,040
Maybe we'll just use your photo
from the wanted poster.

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,880
So your ID is in process.

46
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,360
And you have me to help you
with your orientation.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,600
All that's left is this.

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,160
- What the hell's that?
- It's your start paperwork.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,160
No, I should be out looking for Ray.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,840
- I really have to fill all this out?
- I know. I know, Nora.

51
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,480
But until we have a line on Neron,
there's really nothing we can do.

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
And let's be honest, Nora.

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
You have a storied history here.

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,920
I need you to prove that
you can be a team player.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Have fun.

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,480
Oh, and you know what, Nora?

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm really, really proud of you.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,360
Welcome to the Bureau.

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,480
Director Sharpe.

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880
I've been waiting for you.

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,360
Gary, I told you,
no playing with my chair

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,080
- until after hours.
- Oh, playtime's over.

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,600
Shut the door.

64
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
We need to talk.

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
If Neron wanted John dead
he would have killed him on the spot.

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,000
He must need something from him.

67
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,360
We have to find them before
he can get what he wants.

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,080
{\an5}Who knows what he's doing
in Ray's name

69
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,560
{\an5}or his perfectly grass fed
organic butter body?

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,880
If Haircut's even there.

71
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,200
We don't know that Ray is gone.

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,480
Look, everybody just breathe.
Gideon's already on it.

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,160
{\an5}<i>I've attuned the magic-o-meter
to Constantine's frequency.</i>

74
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,040
{\an5}<i>When he uses his abilities,
I can zero in on his location.</i>

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
And what do we do till then?

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,720
- Stress eat.
- Drink.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,160
Yeah,
how'd you lot survive until now?

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,400
Look, until we get an alert, we wait.

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,760
Right, we wait.

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,680
I gotta go clear my head.

81
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
What do you think this is about?

82
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,440
{\an5}With everything that's been going on
I bet Director Sharpe is about

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,440
to lay down the plan of attack.

84
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,120
{\an5}I've gathered you here because today
we're setting time aside

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,840
to conduct performance reviews.

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,920
{\an5}But this time,
I thought it would be useful

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,840
{\an5}if you were assessed
by one of your peers

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,360
- Agent Gary Green.
- Gary?

89
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Seriously?

90
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Thanks, doll.

91
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,720
How are my babies doing?

92
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,520
Let's rap for a sec.

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,320
{\an5}- Is Gary cool now?
- That's impossible.

94
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,640
{\an5}Now, I know performance reviews
can be quite a drag

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,240
{\an5}but this year's gonna be different
because you've got super-agent

96
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Gary Green in your corner.

97
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
{\an5}So no need to stress
unless your infraction

98
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,080
is looking too good in that suit.

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,920
{\an5}Agent Reyes knows
what I'm talking about.

100
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
Oh, my God. I think she just swooned.

101
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,160
This is a nightmare.

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
{\an5}So I'll be meeting
with agents one on one

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,880
and wait till I call your name.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
{\an5}Looking forward
to some good face time.

105
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,240
{\an5}Ava, are you sure this
is the best time

106
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,640
for performance reviews?

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,400
{\an5}There's no better time to assess
the performance of our operation.

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,320
{\an5}But are you sure Gary's qualified
for responsibilities?

109
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,440
Of course, Mona.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,640
Gary Green is all the man we need.

111
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,000
{\an5}Oh, my, what a big,
scary knife you've got.

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
{\an5}I'd sooner be filleted
than do your bidding.

113
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
This knife is not for you.

114
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
It's for Raymond.

115
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,360
The human body is fascinating.

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Delicate, fragile.

117
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,640
Did you know
that if I cut this artery right here

118
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,600
it will take only a matter of minutes
before Ray's body goes into shock

119
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
and eventually expires?

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey, big man.

121
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,360
Come on. I know you're in there.
Snap out of it?

122
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Ray's gone.

123
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,240
I've taken over his body.

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
We made a deal. And you of all people
should know what it means

125
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,840
to make a deal with a demon.

126
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,120
Now, if Ray was still in here
would he do this?

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,400
<i>Mallis in duris, pluma in metallum.</i>

128
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
I knew I could make you
use your magic.

129
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,040
Great, yeah. So you got me.

130
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
What's that big grin all about?

131
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Patience.

132
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
You'll see.

133
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
I always took you
to be more Springsteen

134
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,200
than "The Rite of Spring."

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,760
It's not for me. It's...

136
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,320
I read that classical music
is good for babies.

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,560
Wow, this is very, impressive.

138
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,040
{\an5}Yeah, I found a book about dragons
in Constantine's collection.

139
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,800
"The egg must incubate
under the mother

140
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,400
at her body temperature
lest the egg expire."

141
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,200
Yeah, I'm not gonna sit
on that thing.

142
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,320
I figured as much.
That's why I got a heat lamp.

143
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,920
We have to do everything possible,

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
to make sure nothing
bad happens to this egg.

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Hey.

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,760
The egg's gonna be okay. I know it.

147
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,240
Wait till Ray sees
that we have a dragon.

148
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,720
- He's gonna love it.
- Yeah.

149
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,240
<i>I've picked up an alert
with Constantine's magical signature.</i>

150
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
That's them.

151
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
<i>The signal is coming from
one point three million years ago.</i>

152
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
- That's the Ice Age.
<i>- He's in the part of North America</i>

153
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,840
<i>that would come to be
known as the Donner Pass</i>

154
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,280
<i>named after a doomed group
of settlers in the 1800s</i>

155
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,920
<i>who resorted to cannibalism
after their food supplies ran out.</i>

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,840
There is such thing as too much
exposition, Gideon.

157
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,920
There they are.

158
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,760
Our heroes.

159
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,680
Captain Lance,
thanks for coming all this way.

160
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,120
If you're looking for Ray,
he's, checked out.

161
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
Is Neron on comms?

162
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,520
But if you'd like to join him
I can make arrangements.

163
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,240
Sara, open fire now.

164
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,680
<i>This may be your only chance.</i>

165
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,000
We can't fire. That's Ray.

166
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,280
Ray made a deal with a demon.
He's gone.

167
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,200
We can't lose anyone else
to this bastard.

168
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,760
- Do it.
- What about you?

169
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,520
Blow us both to kingdom come.

170
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,280
I'll be happy to go to hell
for the cause.

171
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,920
- Gideon, ready the blasters.
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>

172
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Hold up,
If we kill Neron in Ray's body,

173
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
we lose Ray forever.

174
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
But if you let Neron walk,

175
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
then things are gonna get
much, much worse. Trust me.

176
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,360
Sara? Well, come on, boss.

177
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,960
- Something's wrong.
<i>- Awaiting orders, Captain.</i>

178
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Gideon.

179
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Fire.

180
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,880
It's a trap.

181
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,680
We got to move. They're getting away.

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,120
Get us out of here, Gideon.

183
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
That's not good.

184
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,680
<i>By my calculations
we're buried beneath</i>

185
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,040
<i>357 feet of ice and snow.</i>

186
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
<i>Plus, our primary temporal delineator
has been rendered nonfunctional</i>

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
<i>with the extreme weather.</i>

188
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, so that's it, then?
We're just snowed in?

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,560
Yeah, at the Donner Pass.

190
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,520
No one's turning me into beef jerky.

191
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
Everyone calm down.
Gideon, hail the Bureau.

192
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,960
Should we leave a voice mail?

193
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,960
Ava will get the alert.
In the meantime, we wait.

194
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,600
Gideon, how long until the ice thaws?

195
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,720
<i>The Ice Age ends in 11,121 years.</i>

196
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,000
All right, who we eating first?
Because shotgun, not.

197
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Captain, we're running
on reserve power.

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,040
<i>I recommend disabling
all nonessential functions</i>

199
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,880
<i>to conserve energy for life support.</i>

200
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,400
Do it. We need to be responsible
and conserve power.

201
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,400
Cut off the main generator,
the fabricator and the thermostat.

202
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,080
Neron is out there
with Ray and Constantine

203
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
all because we fell for his trap
because you fired on Ray.

204
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,680
And what was your plan, pretty?

205
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,840
Beat him to death
in a snowball fight?

206
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,400
We were supposed to take him in

207
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,680
- not take him out, Mick.
- Ray's gone.

208
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,000
When a team member goes dark,
you end them before they end you.

209
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,480
Rory, with me.

210
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,680
You made the call.
You're helping us get out of here.

211
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
No problem.

212
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,720
All right. Always assumed
I'd go out alone, anyway.

213
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
<i>Oh, just road.</i>

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,760
First you kill my friends
and now you bring me

215
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,400
to this miserable era.

216
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,840
Oh, Johnny,
quit being such a crybaby.

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,360
I just did what I had to do.

218
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,360
Can't have your friends
getting in the way of us

219
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
creating that door to hell.

220
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,240
There's still no way I'm helping you.

221
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,560
Besides, the vortexes
I make are strictly one-way.

222
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,840
They suck you in.

223
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,680
And don't you think,
if my magic was powerful enough

224
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,600
to stabilize a vortex
I wouldn't have saved

225
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,240
Desmond or Astra?

226
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Yes, and that's why we're here.

227
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,120
As powerful as your magic is,

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,760
you can always teach
an old dog new tricks.

229
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,680
And it's more than magic
that you need to learn.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, yeah, right.

231
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,680
So I'm supposed
to learn something off

232
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
one of these yokels, am I?

233
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,200
No, Johnny. Not from them.

234
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
From a king.

235
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,080
Hold on a minute.
That bloke's got my face.

236
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,480
That's because he's your ancestor.

237
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,720
King Konstentyn,

238
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,600
ruler of these parts and progenitor
of your magical bloodline.

239
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,680
What kind of creature
do you think they're hunting?

240
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,080
Can't be sure
but I'm guessing it wasn't rabbits.

241
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
Make way for your king.

242
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Start paperwork, am I right?

243
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,440
My forms keep getting rejected
because records show

244
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm 15 and living
in a mental institution.

245
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,920
I forget that we don't have
normal problems anymore.

246
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,600
Speaking of which, Ava's having Gary
do performance reviews.

247
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,960
Okay. I mean, he's not
my first choice for responsibilities,

248
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,960
- but don't we have bigger issues?
- Exactly.

249
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,240
And when I pointed that out,
Ava shut me down.

250
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,280
Not to stereotype but I think a clone
might have replaced her

251
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,600
and we need to look into it.

252
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

253
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
- No. No.
- Yes.

254
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,120
I just earned my freedom.

255
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,960
And I don't wanna get caught
going behind Ava's back.

256
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,480
You heard what she said.
I need to focus

257
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,640
on being a team player.

258
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,400
She said Gary is all the man we need.

259
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,120
That's not weird to you?

260
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Why is that weird?

261
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,600
Gary Green is all the man we need.

262
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,120
Okay, I will check on Gary
and you contact the Waverider

263
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,400
and see if Sara knows anything.

264
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
And then...

265
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,320
we're gonna find out
what form 37-C is.

266
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Okay.

267
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
This is useless.

268
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,320
Why don't we just blast a way out?

269
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,760
Using your heat gun in here,

270
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,040
Mr. Rory will deplete
our low supply of oxygen.

271
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Yeah, ease up, Mick.
Last time you pulled the trigger,

272
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,840
we ended up here.

273
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,400
You're pissed at me
for firing on Haircut.

274
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,920
Well, it's a good thing
that this Snart bloke

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,680
kept a supply of jackets,
though, isn't it?

276
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,160
They smell good too actually.

277
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,880
What is that? Is it sandalwood?

278
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,640
Look, I'm pissed at you because
that wasn't your call to make.

279
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,880
Someone had to make it.

280
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,840
It was our only chance
to take out Neron.

281
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,600
I made the call you should have.

282
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
All right, guys, come on.
Just pick away, will you?

283
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,840
No, this is good.

284
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,520
All of a sudden,
now you care about the mission?

285
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,200
Where were you when Neron
took Ray in the first place?

286
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, you're gonna put that
on me as well!

287
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,200
All right, as much as
I wanna watch you guys duke it out

288
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,520
let's save it for when we're not
freezing to death.

289
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,640
You know what?
Both of you off scamming people

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,720
at some book convention
while there is a demon on our ship.

291
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,000
Let me get this straight, Captain.

292
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,080
You're the only one
that can have fun outside of this

293
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,000
rusted bucket of bolts?

294
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,480
All you do is spend time
with the girlfriend,

295
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,240
and nothing's ever, ever your fault!

296
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,360
You know what?
You have all the answers.

297
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
You get us out of here.

298
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,360
{\an5}Oh, when I was a boy...

299
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,560
{\an5}we used to run wild
in these woods around the village.

300
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,720
Not a care in the world.

301
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,080
These same woods
where your children play today

302
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
and where my hunting party
just encountered

303
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,280
another dangerous beast
that threatens not just our safety

304
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,760
but our entire way of life.

305
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,040
Oh, this bloke is right tedious.

306
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,280
Why are we here?

307
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Because I want you to learn
that it was your ancestor

308
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,120
that created the rift between humans
and magical creatures.

309
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,840
And why would he do that?

310
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,680
Because fear is a powerful source
of energy for magic.

311
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,800
The more he exploits these creatures
to stir up fear in his people

312
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,000
the more powerful his magic becomes.

313
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,120
I come from a long line of bastards
but not even we would resort to that.

314
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,520
Because your kin are always so right.

315
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,640
Yes.

316
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,280
And if the king
is sending this creature

317
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,160
to hell then surely it deserves it.

318
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,320
Do you really think
that everyone in hell

319
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,560
deserves to be there?

320
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,360
What about Astra
or Raymond Palmer or my Tabitha?

321
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,320
This is your opportunity
to make things right

322
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
starting with her.

323
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,240
You know, if your plan is to guilt me
into doing what you want

324
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,720
by showing me the sins
of my forefather,

325
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,720
it ain't working, sunshine.

326
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,360
But to another.

327
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,480
Behold the unholy beast.

328
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,160
Hold on a minute. That's a Púca.

329
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,000
May not look threatening
but sometimes

330
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,880
in order to see the true nature
of a creature one must draw it out.

331
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
No, no, no. He's got it all wrong.
They aren't evil.

332
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,760
Guess your bloodline isn't
as righteous as you think it is.

333
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
He's clearly misinformed.

334
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,200
Well, if you think that,

335
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,680
maybe you should go
and have a chat with the king.

336
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,640
You are truly blessed that I am here
for I alone can save you

337
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,120
from these monsters.

338
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,160
And tonight at the rise
of the low moon

339
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,280
I will banish this creature
straight to hell.

340
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,720
<i>Agent Powell,</i>

341
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,320
<i>please report to my office
for your performance review.</i>

342
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,800
Just need a signal on the Waverider.

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
That's weird.

344
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,000
What are you doing in here?

345
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,920
Just thought
I would check on the timeline.

346
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,240
Yep, looks good.

347
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,840
Do you have clearance for this?

348
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,600
Have you completed
your performance review?

349
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,080
Yes, I've had my performance review.

350
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,360
And how did it go?

351
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,160
Gary Green is all the man we need.

352
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,240
Gary Green is all the man we need.

353
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,520
- Nora.
- You were right. We have to talk.

354
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,120
But we can't do it here.

355
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,840
The heat lamp must have turned off
when Sara shut down the generator.

356
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,600
It's okay, Wickstable.
You're gonna be okay.

357
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,720
What... what did you call it?

358
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Wickstable.

359
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,920
The drawing I made of Heyworld
when I was a kid,

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,080
the one that inspired my dad,

361
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,080
the dragon in it
I named it Wickstable.

362
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,680
I thought we could just name it that.

363
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
But I'm open to other ideas.

364
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,600
No, I like... like Wickstable.

365
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,880
Our little Wicksty.

366
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,600
I can't believe I'm about to say this
but I think it needs

367
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,480
skin to skin contact
like the book said.

368
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,320
I think it's working.

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,920
Hey, why does it feel
like we skipped past

370
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,200
all the fun stuff into,
you know, this?

371
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,120
We can still do the fun stuff.

372
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
What about the egg?

373
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,360
There's other ways
we could create heat.

374
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,680
- Seriously, dude?
- Yeah.

375
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Come on, Gideon.
There's got to be a way

376
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,280
to boost the engines.

377
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
Ray would know how to read this.

378
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,520
How much longer
do we have on life support?

379
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,920
<i>Power reserves
are at 34 hours, Captain.</i>

380
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,680
- Hey, you got a second?
- Not now, Rory.

381
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,600
I actually came here
to apologize for, blowing up before.

382
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Wow, that's...

383
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
thank you.

384
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,280
- And I should have never...
- And another thing!

385
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,000
Give it up, Charlie.

386
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,800
Why were you wearing my face?

387
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,920
And were you about to apologize?

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,040
Only because Charlie
was catfishing me.

389
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,240
All right, shut up.

390
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,200
Do you think Ray
would be fighting right now?

391
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,480
No, he would be trying
to get us out of here.

392
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah, you're right.

393
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,680
He's always got a plan.
It's annoying.

394
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,480
All right,
let's search Ray's quarters

395
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,000
see if we can find something helpful.

396
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Thanks.

397
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,280
I tried talking to Ava
and all she'd say was

398
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,080
"Gary Green is all the man we need."

399
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,360
Gary must be controlling
the Bureau somehow.

400
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,080
It's those performance reviews.

401
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,880
If we can find out how he's doing it
maybe we can find a way

402
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,040
to snap them out of it.

403
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,600
I can try tapping into my powers,
see if I can read him.

404
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,440
- If I can get to his office...
- No.

405
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,680
We're all we have left.
We can't risk losing each other.

406
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
I've got it.

407
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,320
We'll tell Gary
you found some security issues

408
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,640
in the containment cells.

409
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,480
You walk him over here like this.

410
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,480
Then I'll close the cell doors
and you courier out trapping him.

411
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,800
That's a great idea.

412
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,560
Yeah, just like that.

413
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,760
Okay, it works.

414
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
You can let me out now.

415
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm sorry. I can't do that right now.

416
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,960
Sure, you can.
Just use the hand thing.

417
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,520
No, Mona, you need a time-out.

418
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,680
Gary Green is all the man we need.

419
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
No.

420
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,920
Go and tell the others
to prepare the ritual for tonight.

421
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,200
As you wish, my lord.

422
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,960
You're wasting your time,
focusing on that monster.

423
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,600
A Púca only reflects
the person it's with.

424
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,920
It's only angry
because you scared the fur off it.

425
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,040
That creature
doesn't deserve to go to hell.

426
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,280
I see not why I should heed
the advice of a stranger.

427
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,160
Then perhaps you will heed
the advice of your kin.

428
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,280
I know not of any kin
outside of this village.

429
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,880
And yet the similarities
of your features...

430
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm a cousin from afar
and a practitioner of magic like you.

431
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,600
If you want to rid your village
of a real monster

432
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,640
then I know of a demon in our midst
that we can banish together.

433
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
A demon?

434
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,560
In my village?

435
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,520
Well, then lead the way, my kin.

436
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,000
Put this face stealer
with the other creature.

437
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
<i>Aye, my liege.</i>

438
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,000
Hell shall have two more guests
by the end of the night.

439
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,960
"Cards to Save the Timeline

00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,520
by Ray Palmer."

441
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,560
I miss hating him.

442
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,000
You remember that night
when we all met

443
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,320
standing up on that rooftop
and Rip told us

444
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,040
that we were gonna be legends?

445
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Embarrassing.

446
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
You know what?

447
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
We're the last of the originals.

448
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,280
- Weird.
- Yeah, weird.

449
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
Legends were different back then.

450
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,240
We were different back then.

451
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,920
Look, I know that book convention
was important to you.

452
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,760
And I'm really glad
that you got to go.

453
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,760
- I'm glad you have Ava.
- Thanks.

454
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,680
Guess we're growing up
and hopefully not growing apart.

455
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Here we are.

456
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,160
- What is it?
<i>- Ray Palmer's Survival Guide.</i>

457
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
Let me see this.

458
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,880
Oh, hey.

459
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,480
"What to do
if you're caught in an avalanche."

460
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,120
What does it say?

461
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,320
Yeah, we've already
tried all of these.

462
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
"If all fails, remember
you still have each other,

464
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
- We're dead.
- Yeah.

465
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Maybe.

466
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,240
Hey, it's all right, little one.

467
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,760
I don't bite.

468
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,920
I see your talk went well.

469
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Knew you'd be here.

470
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,040
So I come from a long line
of bloody bastards. Big reveal.

471
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,120
Have you even considered
what it's really gonna be like

472
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,840
for you in hell with all those
pissed off folks you sent there

473
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,200
just waiting for you?

474
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,040
- Including my Tabitha.
- Tabitha.

475
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,920
Who is this bird, anyway?

476
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
Why is she so important?

477
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,960
- Who is she?
- Yeah.

478
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Just like your ancestor.

479
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,920
So convinced you're always right.

480
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,080
You don't even know
who you're sending away.

481
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,640
Fitting that he's about
to do the same to you.

482
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,160
But once you see
how powerful magic can be

483
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,240
when fueled by fear
you can save yourself

484
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,800
from being sucked to hell.

485
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,880
Oh, you would love for me
to stabilize

486
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,400
that vortex wouldn't you?

487
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,560
You see, the thing is
I'm not afraid of going to hell.

488
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,640
I've always counted on the fact
that I'd end up there one day

489
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,240
no matter what.

490
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,680
And what about this
innocent creature beside you?

491
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,760
Well, I guess I'm just
a bloody bastard, then, aren't I?

492
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,040
- What's the bad news now?
- Oh, no bad news.

493
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,360
And no more fighting.

494
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,040
Gideon, fire up the ship.

495
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,360
<i>If I do that, life support capacity
will be reduced by half.</i>

496
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,680
You heard me, Gideon.

497
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,800
Turn on the fabricators
and turn on the heat.

498
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,840
I'm thinking s'mores,
maybe some hot cocoa.

499
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,120
The captain's gone mad.

500
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
She's not mad. She's right.

501
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
I could go for a s'more.

502
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,360
Look, Ray would want us
to have faith that we will escape.

503
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,560
He wouldn't want us
cold and miserable.

504
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,040
So right now, we are going
to enjoy our time together.

505
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Let's go.

506
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,480
Finally. Let's get some music going.

507
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,560
Who's gonna bring me food
if I'm stuck in here?

508
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,720
This is how I'm gonna die, isn't it?

509
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,840
Without any books or laughter
in the basement

510
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,720
of a government building?

511
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,520
You're right. I'm not alone.

512
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,280
I have you.

513
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm sorry you're stuck here with me,
little one.

514
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,480
You should be out there in the woods,
frolicking about.

515
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,840
Or whatever it is you Púcas
get up to these days.

516
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,800
You know, to tell you the truth

517
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
I'm bloody well terrified.

518
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
No.

519
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,160
It's not the eternity of torture
or the people

520
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,400
who are after my head, no.

521
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,880
It's that I'll have to watch
Raymond and Astra...

522
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,760
and all the others I've failed
be tortured along with me.

523
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,560
Even led the Legends to their death.

524
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,760
And you're next in line.

525
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, that's right.

526
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,200
You sense the rottenness inside me,
don't you?

527
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
No better than the bloody king.

528
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,560
Why would you heal a bastard like me?

529
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Up with you.

530
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,520
Time to see the king.

531
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,520
All right, then, little one.

532
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,240
Let's go see what this party's
all about, shall we?

533
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,840
We live in a world of wonder
and amazement.

534
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,240
At times, it's beautiful...

535
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,280
breathtaking.

536
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,120
At other times, cruel, dangerous...

537
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,400
and monstrous.

538
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,960
Before you are two foul
creatures of the dark

539
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,800
one a grotesque woodland creature
that would not hesitate

540
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,280
to tear out your heart,

541
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,240
the other an imposter
a wielder of the dark arts

542
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,880
that would usurp
my very body and soul.

543
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,200
Now, my people
I seek your wisdom in these matters.

544
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,160
What would you have me do
with such wretched beasts?

545
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,640
To hell!

546
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,840
To hell!

547
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,120
To hell!

548
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,440
To hell! To hell!

549
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,920
To hell! To hell!

550
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,560
To hell!

551
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,640
To hell! To hell!

552
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,960
To hell!

553
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,800
We're very excited for you
to receive your performance review.

554
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,960
But what actually happens
at the meeting?

555
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,840
Feel free to give me any spoilers.

556
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,440
Don't worry. I had my doubts too.

557
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,320
But then I met with Gary and realized
Gary Green is all the man we need.

558
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,800
Gary Green is all the man we need.

559
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Bye.

560
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,800
Please step forward, Miss Wu.

561
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,800
Take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

562
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
Mint?

563
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,360
- No, thanks.
- Don't mind if I do.

564
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,360
Let's see.

565
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,120
I see you've made quite an impression
in your brief time here.

566
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,720
But lately you've been slacking off.

567
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,600
It says right here
you've been very disloyal

568
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,800
to the Time Bureau.

569
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,280
Not yet, Wolfie.

570
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,920
Okay, I'll judge this round.

571
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,800
You and your team are stuck
in a trash compactor in an impromptu

572
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,760
and possibly fatal homage
to <i>Star Wars.</i> What do you do?

573
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,160
Boom, that's the one.

574
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Yep.

575
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,640
Oh, gonna have to go with
"Steel up as Sara scales a wall."

576
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,240
- Another point for me.
- Favoritism!

577
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,800
Why would I display favoritism?

578
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,520
Because you two
are obviously shagging.

579
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
What?

580
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,880
It... it's, yeah.

581
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,680
Yes, finally.

582
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,320
This is great.
Maybe you guys won't be so weird now.

583
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,680
Okay, I'll judge next.

584
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,120
A teammate turns on you,
lost to the dark side.

585
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What do you do?

586
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,000
"Escape via musical number."
Not this time.

587
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,160
"Fabricate evening wear
and infiltrate a party."

588
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,160
You guys know I love
a good party sneak.

589
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,720
"Don't give up on each other.
Work together.

590
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,320
You're more than a team.
You are a family."

591
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,520
Well, I guess that card's
the winner, then.

592
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,400
Point to Charlie. I'm on the board.

593
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,400
- The hell was that?
<i>- Due to your reckless use</i>

594
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,200
<i>of our rapidly depleting energy
internal temperature of the ship</i>

595
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,920
<i>has melted the surrounding ice enough
to shake the ship loose.</i>

596
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,640
- What do we do?
- We work as a team.

597
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,240
Zari, engine room.
Get the thrusters back online.

598
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,040
Seal the cargo bay. You two with me.

599
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,240
My dear people.

600
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,840
I hear your cries
and feel your anger.

601
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,160
And therefore, by your command
I send these creatures

602
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,400
where they belong.

603
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,720
Straight to hell!

604
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,200
Straight to hell!

605
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,600
Straight to hell!

606
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,080
Straight to hell! Straight to hell!

607
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:10,800
<i>Yn ol pwer eu of. Creaduriaid budr,
Yr wyf yn eich anfonwch chi i Ifell.</i>

608
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,760
<i>Yn mynd a byth yn dychwelyd.</i>

609
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,760
Begone, you unclean beasts!

610
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,640
Come on, Johnny.
You know what you need to do.

611
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,360
Oh, bollocks.

612
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,680
<i>Yn ol pwer eu ofn.</i>

613
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,360
<i>Chwistrell yn araf,
atal eich troelli, sefydlogi!</i>

614
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,920
Here. Run, run.

615
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,280
What have you done?

616
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,480
I've used your own magic against you.

617
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,880
Now, we may be kin,
but we are not the same.

618
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,760
Now, you may not agree
with my methods

619
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,520
but I will always protect my people.

620
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,800
Now, the question is,
Miss Wu what shall we do

621
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,920
about your disloyalty?

622
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,040
Maybe I lose my snack room
privileges for a week.

623
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,080
Oh, no. Not my almonds.

624
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,360
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about your almonds.

625
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,760
Because as I'm sure you've heard
Gary Green is all the man you need.

626
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,120
Now, gaze into the nipple.

627
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,400
Wolfie. Now.

628
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,920
What's a Wolfie?

629
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Wolfie?

630
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Bravo.

631
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,440
I knew you could exploit fear
to make yourself even more powerful.

632
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,360
Well, it looks like
you taught this old dog

633
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,840
some new tricks after all.

634
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,280
But now I'm gonna use those
new tricks to strike you down.

635
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,160
You know, I do have
a few tricks of my own.

636
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,960
<i>We're running on
very low reserve power.</i>

637
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
<i>The odds of us successfully
pushing through the avalanche</i>

638
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,520
<i>above us are 3,720 to one.</i>

639
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,400
Never tell me the odds, Gideon.

640
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,080
Everyone hold on tight.

641
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,680
- Oh, this better work.
- It will.

642
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,240
- You got Wicksty?
- Yeah, I'm not letting go.

643
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,280
Come on, come on.

644
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Boom.

645
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,960
- Yes.
<i>- All systems</i>

646
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,680
<i>- are back online Captain.</i>
- Fantastic, Gideon.

647
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,120
Now let's go find
Constantine and Ray.

648
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,120
Oh, damn executive privacy button.

649
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,960
Hey. Can you do me a solid
and press that button

650
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,080
over there, if you...

651
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,480
Do you really think I'm letting
you get out of here alive?

652
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Help.

653
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,280
Get away from him, you beast.

654
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,480
- What happened?
- I don't know.

655
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,160
But I'm guessing
he had something to do with it.

656
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,720
It may be too late to save Ray
or Desmond or the Legends.

657
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,160
But at least
I'll get to send you back

658
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,320
where you belong.

659
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
Oh, you bastards. You did it.

660
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,520
You bloody survived.

661
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,240
I've never been so happy
to be wrong in my life.

662
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,280
Don't do it, John. Don't kill him.

663
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,840
Don't give up on Haircut.

664
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,000
What are you gonna do, Johnny?

665
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,880
You're all out of moves.

666
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
No, I'm not.

667
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,720
I'll see you lovely lot at the end.

668
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,360
I'm gonna save Ray.

669
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
John.

670
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,360
<i>Quod perditum est, invenietur.</i>

671
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,240
The magic-o-meter's picking up
strange activity on the ground.

672
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,480
Tabitha, show yourself.

673
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,680
So wonderful to be back.

674
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,640
Brimstone was so awful
for my complexion.

675
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Oh, but you look ravishing, my love.

676
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,680
Hold on. Is he kissing...

677
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,360
Oh, the Fairy Godmother.

678
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,880
Is that tongue?

679
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,640
More singing.

680
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,760
We're so screwed.

681
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,440
Come with me, my pet.

682
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,400
Let's find you a new host.

683
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,600
It's his nipple.

684
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,120
He tried to hypnotize Mona
with his nipple.

685
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,400
His nipple?

686
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,480
Neron gave you back your nipple
which became bad in hell

687
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,680
which is now poisoning your mind
and making you evil

688
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,960
and that's why you came back
to the Time Bureau

689
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,160
so that you could nip-notize everyone
and Neron could take over.

690
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Yeah.

691
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,680
You will do no more harm
with your nipple.

692
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,560
No, no, no!

693
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,000
No, no, no, please no.

694
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

695
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,800
It wasn't me. It was my nipple.
I swear.

696
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,840
Save me.

697
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,800
As you wish.

698
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
You have to go.

699
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,960
Tell the Legends what's going on.

700
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,280
- Wait, what about you?
- I'm not leaving Mona behind.

701
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,120
Always knew you were a team player.

702
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,280
Ava. You okay?

703
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,600
It's a long story
but Gary took over the Bureau.

704
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,920
He nip-notized everyone.

705
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,360
Yeah, you're gonna have
to explain that.

706
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,000
The germ turned.

707
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,000
Well, it's not just him.
It's Neron and...

708
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,880
The Fairy Godmother, Tabitha.

709
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,000
- She's Tabitha?
- Yeah, you missed a lot.

710
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,320
And Ray is still in hell.

711
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,160
I know he hasn't given up,
so we're not gonna give up on him.

712
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,880
Now, let's do this for Ray.

713
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,200
Bloody hell.
