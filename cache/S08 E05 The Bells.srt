1
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,898
Come in.

2
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,943
And?

3
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,614
Nothing?

4
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,074
She won't eat.

5
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,414
We'll try again at supper.

6
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,251
I think they're watching me.

7
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,547
- Who?
- Her soldiers.

8
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,843
Of course they are. That's their job.

9
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,272
What have I told you, Martha?

10
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,652
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

11
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,073
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

12
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,390
Varys: The northern armies?

13
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,058
Jon: Just crossed the trident.

14
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,853
They'll be at the walls
of king's landing in two days.

15
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,522
How is she?

16
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,442
She hasn't seen anyone
since we returned.

17
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,445
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

18
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,656
She shouldn't be alone.

19
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,743
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

20
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,661
Aren't you worried for her?

21
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,997
I'm worried for all of us.

22
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,291
They say every time
a Targaryen is born,

23
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,544
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

24
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,338
We're not much for riddles
where I'm from.

25
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,716
We both know what she's about to do.

26
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,266
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

27
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,978
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

28
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,733
What do you want?

29
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,651
All I've ever wanted.

30
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,945
The right ruler on the iron throne.

31
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,950
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

32
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,287
But I'm quite certain about yours.

33
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,297
I don't want it.

34
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,673
Ineverhave.

35
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,971
I have known more kings and queens
than any man living.

36
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,141
I've heard what they say to crowds,
and seen what they do in the shadows.

37
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,062
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

38
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,898
But what I tell you now is true:

39
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,068
You will rule wisely and well,
while she...

40
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,194
She...

41
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,238
Is my queen.

42
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,052
Your grace?

43
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,621
There's something you need to know.

44
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,208
Someone has betrayed me.

45
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,924
Yes.

46
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,430
Jon snow.

47
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,729
Varys.

48
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,025
He knows the truth about Jon.

49
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,652
He does.

50
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,451
Because you told him.

51
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,830
You learned from sansa.

52
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,750
And she learned from Jon,

53
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,919
though I begged him not to tell her.

54
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,005
As I said...

55
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,424
He betrayed me.

56
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm glad sansa told me.

57
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,719
I am your hand.

58
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,472
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

59
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,475
And varys?

60
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,019
Your master of whisperers
needs to be aware too.

61
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,105
You spoke to him first.

62
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,191
Without coming to me.

63
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,609
Without asking my permission.

64
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,072
It was a mistake.

65
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,826
Why do you think sansa told you?

66
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,455
- What do you think she hoped to gain?
- She trusts me.

67
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,291
Yes, she trusts you.

68
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,588
She trusted you to spread secrets

69
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,216
that could destroy your own queen.

70
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,887
And you did not let her down.

71
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,644
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

72
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,856
Our intentions were good.

73
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,278
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

74
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,615
Varys as much as anyone.

75
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,127
But it doesn't matter now.

76
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,216
It doesn't matter now.

77
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,088
It was me.

78
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,679
I hope I deserve this.

79
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,430
Truly, I do.

80
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,015
I hope I'm wrong.

81
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,191
Goodbye, old friend.

82
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,817
Lord varys.

83
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,698
I, Daenerys of house Targaryen,
first of my name,

84
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,409
breaker of chains
and mother of dragons...

85
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,371
Sentence you to die.

86
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,508
Dracarys.

87
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,188
This was all she brought with her
when we crossed the narrow sea.

88
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,941
Her only possession.

89
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,238
It's all right, torgo nudho.

90
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,324
Let me speak with him.

91
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,871
What did I say
would happen if you told your sister?

92
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,606
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

93
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,942
She betrayed your trust.

94
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,320
She killed varys as much as I did.

95
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,199
This was a victory for her.

96
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,120
Now she knows what happens
when people hear the truth about you.

97
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,418
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

98
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,298
I don't have love here.

99
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,635
I only have fear.

100
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,306
I love you.

101
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,062
And you will always be my queen.

102
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,071
Is that all I am to you?

103
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,241
Your queen?

104
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,447
All right, then.

105
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,581
Let it be fear.

106
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,464
Tyrion: The people who live there,
they're not your enemies.

107
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,175
They're innocents, like the ones
you liberated in meereen.

108
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,194
Daenerys: In meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

109
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,096
and liberated the city themselves
the moment I arrived.

110
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,556
Tyrion: They're afraid.

111
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,142
Anyone who resists Cersei
will see his family butchered.

112
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,353
You can't expect them to be heroes.

113
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,647
- They're hostages.
- They are.

114
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,984
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

115
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,737
What does it matter whose fault it is?

116
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,656
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

117
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,076
Your sister knows how to use
her enemies' weaknesses against them.

118
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,704
That's what she thinks our mercy is:

119
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,830
Weakness.

120
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,707
- I beg you, my queen...
- But she's wrong.

121
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,627
Mercy is our strength.

122
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,339
Our mercy towards future generations

123
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,799
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

124
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,891
Ready the unsullied.

125
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,369
Tonight you sail for king's landing
to join the northern armies.

126
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,063
Cersei's followers will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

127
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,314
Give them that chance.

128
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,652
If the city surrenders, they will
ring the bells and raise the gates.

129
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,113
Please, if you hear them ringing
the bells, call off the attack.

130
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,768
Daenerys: Wait for me
outside the city.

131
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,377
You'll know when it's time.

132
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,493
Daenerys: Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

133
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,585
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

134
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,050
The next time you fail me...

135
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,846
Will be the last time you fail me.

136
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,114
Guard 1: Let them pass.

137
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,377
Guard 2: Through the gate.

138
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,962
Guard 3: Get going.

139
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,632
Davos: The rearguard
should be here by daybreak.

140
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,592
Tyrion: She wants to attack now.

141
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,346
Daybreak at the earliest.

142
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,724
Soldier 1: Careful with that.
Soldier 2: My lord.

143
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,020
Tyrion: Davos.

144
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,817
I need to ask you a favor.

145
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,613
You're the greatest smuggler alive,
aren't you?

146
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,409
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

147
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,246
Soldier 1: He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

148
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,249
Soldier 2: Problem is
when he's got drink in him.

149
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,261
- See what he did the other week?
- Soldier 1: Aye. Fighting as well.

150
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,923
Ay up. Where you going?

151
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,343
I'm Arya stark.

152
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,595
I'm going to kill queen Cersei.

153
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,312
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

154
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,607
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

155
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,141
I need to go talk to my captain.

156
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,781
Go ahead, talk to him.

157
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,910
Soldier 1: Where's he going?

158
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,677
I drink to eat the skull keeper.

159
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,099
I want to eat the skull keeper.

160
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,357
I want to see the...

161
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,241
Unsullied soldier:
We speak the common tongue.

162
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,154
Ah. Good.

163
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,864
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

164
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,492
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

165
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,595
Unsullied soldier:
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

166
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,287
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

167
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,498
Unsullied soldier: No.

168
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,458
Well, in that case,
as hand of the queen,

169
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,418
I outrank whomever gave your order.

170
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,128
Probably by quite a lot.

171
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,695
How did they find you?

172
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,456
Did you consider taking it off?

173
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,378
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

174
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,174
You're going back to her,
to die with her.

175
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,802
You've underestimated her before.

176
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,387
She's going to die.

177
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,724
Unless you can convince her
to change her course of action.

178
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,768
Difficult to do from here.

179
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,402
When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

180
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,573
If not for yourself, if not for her,

181
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,033
then for every one
of the million people in that city,

182
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,535
innocent or othennise.

183
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,538
To be honest,
I never really cared much for them.

184
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,331
Innocent or othennise.

185
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,668
You do care for one innocent.

186
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,170
I know you do.

187
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,755
And so does Cersei.

188
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,009
She has a reason now.

189
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,097
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

190
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,934
All the worst things she's ever done,
she's done for her children.

191
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,770
It's not impossible that she'll win.

192
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,188
She won't.

193
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,609
Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
as she said they would be.

194
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,320
Two of the three dragons are dead.

195
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,572
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

196
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,616
She has the Lannister army,
the golden company...

197
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,534
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

198
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,995
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

199
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,205
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow,
if not before.

200
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,757
Escape.

201
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,842
The two of you, together.

202
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,636
Remember where we met,

203
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,013
where they keep the dragon skulls,
beneath the red keep?

204
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,058
Take her down there.

205
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,186
Keep following the stainnays down,
down as far as they'll go.

206
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,605
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

207
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,106
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

208
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,318
Sail out of the bay.

209
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,071
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to pentos.

210
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,032
Start a new life.

211
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,790
Sail right past the iron fleet
and into a new life?

212
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,084
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war.

213
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,628
There won't be an iron fleet
for much longer.

214
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,422
Do it.

215
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:28,300
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

216
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,599
Swear to me.

217
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,896
You have my word.

218
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,528
If it works,

219
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,407
give the order to ring all the bells
in king's landing and open the gates.

220
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,610
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

221
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,415
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

222
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,959
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

223
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,586
Your queen will execute you for this.

224
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,150
If Daenerys can make it to the throne

225
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,298
without wading through
a river of blood,

226
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,260
maybe she'll show mercy
to the person who made that possible.

227
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,602
Tens of thousands of innocent lives...

228
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,690
One not particularly innocent dwarf...

229
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,652
It seems like a fair trade.

230
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,578
If it weren't for you,

231
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,663
I never would've survived
my childhood.

232
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,167
You would have.

233
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,010
You were the only one

234
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,930
who didn't treat me like a monster.

235
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,310
You were all I had.

236
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,341
Soldier 1: Eyes on the horizon!

237
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,803
Soldier 2: Load the scorpion!

238
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,026
Soldier 3: Archers, close up!

239
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,655
Soldier 4: Up to the espringal!

240
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,448
Soldier 5: To the back of it!

241
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,546
Soldier 6: Archers, line up!

242
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,306
Woman: This way! Come on!

243
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,807
Soldier 1: Clear the streets now!

244
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,185
- Woman: No!
- In, now.

245
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,437
- And you, come on.
- Soldier 2: Inside, now!

246
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,314
Man 1: Quickly.

247
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,233
Yes. Follow down there.
They're here. Get to the red keep.

248
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,862
Father: My son!
Soldier 1: Get inside!

249
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,243
Man 2: Just ahead of you,
I can see it!

250
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,828
Soldier 1: All right, move it!

251
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,663
Woman: Come on!
Soldier 2: Keep moving!

252
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,266
Soldier 3: Keep going!
Soldier 2: Keep moving!

253
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,375
Soldier 3: Quickly!
Soldier 2: All the way!

254
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,710
Man 3: Come on! Man 4: Come on!

255
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,643
Soldier 4: Keep moving!

256
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,021
Soldier 5: Make way
for the golden company!

257
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,365
Soldier 6: Close the gate!

258
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,098
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

259
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,517
Call off your men.

260
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,115
Soldier: Move along now, lads.

261
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,438
Soldier 1: That's it.
Soldier 2: Go on, move it.

262
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,362
Come on, move, move. Faster, faster.
Come on, move it.

263
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,364
- Keep going.
- Soldier 2: Keep moving.

264
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,370
- Move.
- Soldier 1: Stay with him.

265
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,331
Man: Hold on.
Woman: Hold my hand.

266
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,499
Nora: Get behind her.

267
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,209
Soldier 3: Close the gate!

268
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,925
- No.
- No, mommy.

269
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,886
- Girl: -Let me in! Please!
- No, please, sir!

270
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,097
Man 1: Open the gate!
Soldier 1: Close the gate!

271
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,224
Man 2: Open it!
Man 3: Open the gate!

272
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,061
- Soldier 2: Get back.
- Look, go over there. Go. Go.

273
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,860
Soldier 3: The gates are locked now!

274
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,531
Woman: Open! Open the gate!

275
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,992
Jaime: Soldier! Soldier!

276
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,370
- Man 4: Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!

277
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,955
Stay back! It's closed!

278
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,498
Soldier!

279
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,918
Soldier 1: Move away! Stop!

280
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,503
Man 5: Let us in!

281
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,091
Man 6: We're not leaving!

282
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,369
Turn!

283
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,352
- Turn it around!
- Soldier: Turn it around!

284
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,730
Euron: Get back! Back!

285
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,237
Fire!

286
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,969
Soldier 1: Ready!

287
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,345
Move!

288
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,682
Fire!

289
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,896
- Reload!
- Soldier 2: Reload!

290
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,648
Faster!

291
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,899
Hurry!

292
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,243
Fire!

293
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,820
Man 1: Go!

294
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,909
Man 2: Run!

295
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,048
Qyburn: Your grace.

296
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,510
All we need is one good shot.

297
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:27,180
The scorpions have
all been destroyed, your grace.

298
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,851
The iron fleet hold Blackwater bay.

299
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,688
Euron killed one of her dragons.

300
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:36,898
He can kill another.

301
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,442
Qyburn: Your grace,
the iron fleet is burning.

302
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,320
The gates have been breached.

303
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,571
The golden company...

304
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,783
Our men will fight harder
than sellswords ever could.

305
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,079
They will defend their queen
to the last man.

306
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,497
Qyburn: Yes, your grace.

307
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,207
The red keep has never fallen.

308
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,875
It won't fail today.

309
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,948
Man: No, no!

310
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,411
Jon: Move, move!

311
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,473
Man: Run.

312
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,768
Run!

313
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,852
Come on!

314
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,240
Soldier 1: Ring the bells!
Soldier 2: Ring the bells!

315
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,159
Man 1: The bells!

316
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,495
Man 2: Ring the bells!
Woman: Ring the bells!

317
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,665
Man 3: Ring the bloody bells!

318
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,501
Man 2: Ring the bells!
Woman: Ring the bells!

319
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,481
- Tell the queen to ring the bells.
- Man 4: Ring the bells!

320
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,673
Ring the bell!

321
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,641
Woman: This way.

322
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,606
Soldier: Ring the bell!

323
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,067
Man 1: Ring the bell!

324
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,569
Man 2: Ring them!

325
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,782
Woman 1: Ring the bells!

326
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,871
Man 3: Ring the bells!

327
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,250
Man 4: Ring the bells!
Man 5: Help us!

328
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,877
Man 6: In the name of the...

329
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,765
Man 7: Ring the bells!
Man 8: Now! Come on!

330
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,939
Man 9: Hurry up!

331
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,076
Woman 2: Ring the bells!

332
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,264
Get back!

333
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,432
Get back!

334
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,019
Stay! Stay!

335
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,448
Quickly. Quickly.

336
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,201
Stop!

337
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,725
- Come here!
- Woman: Get off him!

338
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,770
- Get off me! Get off, bitch!
- No, get off! Help! Help!

339
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,719
Find somewhere to hide.

340
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,849
Euron: The kingslayer.

341
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,813
Jaime: We need to get the queen
out of king's landing.

342
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:43,939
Euron: Listen.

343
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,693
That's the sound of a city dying.

344
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,447
It's over.

345
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,324
Well, maybe for you.

346
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,453
If you kill another king
before you die...

347
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,331
They'll sing about you forever.

348
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,042
You're no king.

349
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,585
Oh, but I am.

350
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,130
And I fucked the queen.

351
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,760
If iwin...

352
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:18,599
I'll bring your head to Cersei
so you can kiss her one last time.

353
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,622
Your grace, it isn't safe here
any longer.

354
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,790
The red keep is the safest place
in the city.

355
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,085
The unsullied have breached
the gates of the red keep.

356
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:23,182
Maegor's holdfast would be
a better place to wait out the storm.

357
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,096
You fought well...

358
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,932
For a cripple.

359
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,602
Another king for you.

360
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,827
But I got you!

361
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,123
I got you!

362
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,507
I'm the man
who killed Jaime Lannister.

363
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:45,991
Go home, girl.

364
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,537
The fire will get her,
or one of the Dothraki.

365
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,665
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

366
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,251
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

367
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,421
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

368
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,882
I'm going to kill her.

369
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,345
You think you wanted revenge
a long time?

370
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,055
I've been after it all my life.

371
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,307
It's all I care about.

372
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,434
And look at me. Look at me!

373
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,480
You wanna be like me?

374
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,324
You come with me, you die here.

375
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,798
Sandor

376
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:50,973
Thank you.

377
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,037
Your grace.

378
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,056
Hello, big brother.

379
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,648
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

380
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,326
Ser Gregor, I command you.

381
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,953
Obey your queen, ser Gregor.

382
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,971
Yeah, that's you.

383
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,058
That's what you've always been.

384
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,113
You're hurt.

385
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,366
It doesn't matter.

386
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,375
You're bleeding.

387
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,604
Man: Alanna!

388
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,857
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

389
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,776
Have you seen my wife?

390
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,527
- Arya: Let go.
- Have you seen my wife?

391
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,586
Man: Out of the way!

392
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:05,824
Man: No!

393
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,762
Nora: Take my hand.

394
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,013
Take my hand.

395
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,932
Get up. Get up.

396
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,152
- Nora: No. No.
- Wait! Wait!

397
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,032
Fucking die!

398
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,253
We need to fall back!

399
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,797
Fall back behind the wall!

400
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,926
- Fall back!
- Soldier: Fall back!

401
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,636
Jon: Get out of the city!

402
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,388
Fall back!

403
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,894
Fall back!

404
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,297
- Fall back!
- Soldier: Fall back!

405
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,013
You can't stay here.

406
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,515
You have to keep moving.

407
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,267
We can't go out there.

408
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,435
You have to.

409
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,146
Everyone out there is dead.

410
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,775
If you stay here, you'll die.

411
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,361
Follow me.

412
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,364
Follow me!

413
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:26,496
Man 1: Come on, quickly. Come to me.
Man 2: It's safer up there.

414
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,456
Man 1: Come on, quickly. All of you.

415
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:33,378
Run!

416
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,635
Run!

417
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,140
Girl: Mama!

418
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,434
Mama!

419
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,478
Mama! No.

420
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,522
Mama! Mama!

421
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:54,857
Mama!

422
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,322
Get up.

423
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,448
Get up!

424
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,037
We have to keep moving.

425
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,998
Take her.

426
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,417
Take her!

427
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,002
- Take her.
- Come on!

428
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,671
Come on!

429
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,818
This way.

430
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,536
Cersei: I want our baby to live.

431
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,833
I want our baby to live.

432
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,755
I want our baby to live.

433
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:43,942
Don't let me die, Jaime.

434
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,968
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

435
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,845
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

436
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,096
I don't want to die.

437
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,684
Just look... look at me.

438
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:55,812
- Look at me.
- Not like this.

439
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:59,232
- Not like this. Not like this.
- Look... look... look me in the eye.

440
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,733
Don't look away. Don't look...

441
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,027
Look at me! Just look at me.

442
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,742
Nothing else matters.

443
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,288
Nothing else matters.

444
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:15,748
Only us.
