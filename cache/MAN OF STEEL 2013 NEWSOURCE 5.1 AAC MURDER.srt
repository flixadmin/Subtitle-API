1
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:10,338
You don't understand.

2
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,580
Krypton's core is collapsing.

3
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,785
We may only
have a matter of weeks.

4
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:18,555
I warned you,
harvesting the core was suicide.

5
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,857
It has accelerated
the process of implosion.

6
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:25,627
Our energy reserves were exhausted,
what would you have us do, El?

7
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:29,191
Look to the stars.
Like our ancestors did.

8
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:31,223
There are habitable worlds
within reach.

9
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:33,300
We can begin
by using the old outposts.

10
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,803
Are seriously suggesting that
we evacuate the entire planet?

11
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,372
No, everybody here
is already dead.

12
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:46,010
Give me the control of the codex,
I will ensure the survival of our race.

13
00:02:46,077 --> 00:02:51,081
There is still hope,
I have held that hope in my hand.

14
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:09,662
- This council has been disbanded.
- On whose authority?

15
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,764
Mine.

16
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:18,279
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

17
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,673
What are you doing, Zod?!
This is madness!

18
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:26,909
What I should done years ago! These
lawmakers with their endless debates

19
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,278
have led Krypton to ruin!

20
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,214
And if your forces prevail?
You be the leader of nothing.

21
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:39,895
Then join me, help me
save our race, we'll start anew.

22
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:44,150
We'll sever the degenerated
bloodlines that led us to this state.

23
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,793
And who will decide
which bloodline survives, Zod?

24
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:50,895
You?

25
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:56,577
Don't do this, El. The last thing
I want is for us to be enemies.

26
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,602
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together,

27
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:02,871
You've taken up the sword
against your own people.

28
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:08,876
I'll honor the man you once were, Zod.
Not this monster you've become.

29
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,547
Take him away!

30
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:24,817
**Sir, is everything all right?**
- Out of the way! I said..

31
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,042
Jor! Behind you!

32
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:54,546
Lara, you have to ready the launch,
I will be with you as soon as I can.

33
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:51,358
- Have you seen the codex?
- It's just beneath the central house.

34
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:55,395
**But I'm compelled to warn you, reaching
the chambers is class B crime punishable**

35
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:59,998
Nobody cares any more, Keelex!
The world is about to come to an end.

36
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:08,953
Jor-el, by the authority
of General Zod, surrender the codex.

37
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:59,560
Easy, Harraka.

38
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:20,911
Did you find the world?

39
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:22,012
We have.

40
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:25,047
**orbiting main sequence yellow star**
**just as you said.**

41
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,581
Young star.
His cells would drink its radiation.

42
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:36,130
It has a seemingly
intelligent population.

43
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,984
He will be an outcast, a freak.

44
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:45,054
They'll kill him.
- How?

45
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,790
He'll be a god to them.

46
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,833
What if the ship doesn't make it?

47
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:54,063
He will die out there.

48
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:55,997
Alone.

49
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:59,166
I can't do it.

50
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,693
I thought I could, but...
now that it's here...

51
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:08,566
Krypton is doomed.
It's his only chance now.

52
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,676
It's our people's only hope.

53
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:12,987
What is it, Keelex?

54
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:15,561
**Five attack ships**
**converging from the east.**

55
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:18,148
**Citadel’s defenses**
**are being scanned and evaluated.**

56
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,735
I'll upload the codex.
- No, wait.

57
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,082
Lara...

58
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,820
Just... let me look at him.

59
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,992
I'll never get to see him walk.

60
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:36,462
Never hear him say our names.

61
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:44,869
Out there amongst the stars...

62
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:49,139
he will live.

63
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:48,553
Goodbye, my son.

64
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,884
I hope some dreams
travel with you.

65
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:32,689
Concentrate fire on the main door.

66
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:50,762
**Lady Lara, the phantom drives**
**are coming on-line**

67
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,587
Proceed to ignition.

68
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:57,608
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

69
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,958
A launch...

70
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:03,313
Hold this platform, Commander.

71
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:21,561
I know you stole the codex, Jor-el.
Surrender it and I'll let you live.

72
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:25,529
This is a second change
for all of Krypton,

73
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:28,307
not just the bloodlines
you deem worthy.

74
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:33,537
- What have you done?
- We've had a child, Zod.

75
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,605
A boy child.

76
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,841
Krypton's first natural
birth in centuries.

77
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:44,112
And he will be free.
Free to forge his own destiny.

78
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:46,614
Heresy!

79
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:49,683
Destroy it!

80
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,653
Lara, listen to me!

81
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:48,697
The Codex is Krypton's future.

82
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,365
Abort the launch!

83
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:47,877
Your son, Lara...
Where have you sent him?

84
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,119
His name is Kal.

85
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,417
Son of El.

86
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:02,917
And he is beyond your reach.

87
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:15,332
Bring that ship down.

88
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,305
**target locked**

89
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:39,018
Lay down your weapons,
your forces are surrounded.

90
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:53,423
General Zod, for the crimes
of murder and high treason,

91
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:58,266
the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow insurgents

92
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:02,418
to 300 hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

93
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:05,639
Do you have any last words?

94
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:11,548
You won't kill us yourself!
You wouldn't sully your hands,

95
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:15,080
but you'll damn us
to a black hole for eternity.

96
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:20,251
Jor-El, was right
you are a pack of fools,

97
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,886
every last one of you!

98
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,155
And you...

99
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,891
You believe your son is safe?

100
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,592
I will find him.

101
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,329
I will reclaim what
you have taken from us.

102
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,297
I will find him.

103
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,035
I will find him, Lara.

104
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,139
I will find him!

105
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:31,938
**Lady Lara,**
**shouldn't you find refuge?**

106
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:34,898
There is no refuge, Kelor.

107
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,728
Jor-El was right,

108
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,332
this is the end.

109
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:58,110
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

110
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,952
Watch it, dumbass! Keep your eyes open
or you are gonna get squashed!

111
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:38,824
Where the hell
did they find you, greenhorn?

112
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,317
Gentlemen, secure the deck!

113
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,853
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

114
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,157
Secure the deck!

115
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,869
All civilian folk, stand clear,

116
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,443
the sub-sea valve's failed
and the rig is about to explode.

117
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:58,111
Roger, coast guard. What about
the men left inside, over.

118
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:02,209
- Forget them, they are dead!
- Greenhorn, fetch me my binoculars.

119
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:05,978
Greenhorn!

120
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:15,773
This is the last of the oxygen!

121
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:18,169
I don't know how much longer
we can hold out!

122
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:28,923
This is coast guard 65-10.

123
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:31,874
We're gonna make one more pass
and then we're getting out of here.

124
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,070
Wait, wait,
I've got some guys on the heli-pad!

125
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:59,335
Get that last guy rolling,
we have got to go!

126
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,648
Hey, let’s go!
What are you doing!

127
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:49,068
When Kansas became a territory...

128
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,622
Clark!

129
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:55,683
Are you listening, Clark?

130
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:02,645
I asked if you could tell me
who were the first settlers of Kansas?

131
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:18,352
Are you alright, Clark?

132
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:27,597
Clark!

133
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:35,109
Clark!

134
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:41,136
- Clark, come out of there!
- Leave me alone.

135
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,504
Clark, I have called your mother.

136
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,897
I'm here!
Clark, honey, what's wrong?

137
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:57,004
Will you open the door?
- What's wrong with him, anyway?

138
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,829
- He's such a weirdo!
- Crybaby!

139
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,354
His parents won't even
let him play with other kids.

140
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:02,936
I know.

141
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:06,737
Sweetie! How can I help you
if you won't let me in?

142
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,081
The world is too big, mom.

143
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:12,102
Then make it smaller.

144
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:16,023
Just...

145
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:20,334
Focus on my voice.

146
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,625
Pretend it's an island.

147
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:26,389
Out in the ocean.

148
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,401
Can you see it?

149
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,696
I see it.

150
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:36,748
Then swim towards it, honey.

151
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:52,184
What's wrong with me, mom?

152
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,442
Clark...

153
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:23,137
Hey, asswipe! What do you think,
did you see the game?

154
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:26,901
Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

155
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:29,159
I want hear what he has to say.

156
00:26:30,604 --> 00:26:32,491
Come on, dick splash.

157
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:15,888
My son was there, he was in the bus.

158
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,582
He saw what Clark did.

159
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:22,518
I know he did. I'm sure
that what he thought he saw...

160
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,902
Was an act of God, Jonathan!

161
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:27,605
This was providence!

162
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,367
Well, I think you're blowing it
a little out of proportion.

163
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,059
No, I'm not.

164
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:38,606
Lana saw it too and the Forny boy.

165
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,443
And this isn't the first time
Clark's done something like this.

166
00:28:57,388 --> 00:29:02,192
- I just wanted to help.
- I know you did, but we talked about this,

167
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:03,924
Right?

168
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:07,263
Right, we talked about this,
you have...

169
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:11,199
Clark, you have keep
this side of yourself a secret.

170
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,903
What was I supposed to do,
just let them die?

171
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:22,141
Maybe.

172
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:27,745
There's more at stake here than just our
lives and the lives of those around us.

173
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:32,281
When the world...

174
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:36,953
When the world finds out what you can do
it's going to change everything.

175
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:39,054
Our believes, our notions.

176
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:42,824
What it means to be human, everything.

177
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:47,928
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?
She was scared of you, Clark.

178
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,297
Why?

179
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,067
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

180
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,269
Is she right?

181
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:01,172
Did God give this to me?

182
00:30:01,606 --> 00:30:02,806
Tell me.

183
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:21,422
We found you in this.

184
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:24,757
We were sure that the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep.

185
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:26,949
No one ever came.

186
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,506
This was in the chamber with you.

187
00:30:45,674 --> 00:30:48,443
I took it
to a metallurgist at Kansas State.

188
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:50,888
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even...

189
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:54,474
It didn't even exist
on the periodic table.

190
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,053
It's another way of saying
that it's not from this world, Clark.

191
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:05,456
And neither are you.

192
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:08,312
You are the answer, son.

193
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:12,195
You are the answer to
are we alone in the Universe.

194
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,263
I don't wanna be.

195
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:16,265
And I don't blame you son.

196
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:20,536
Be huge burden for anyone to bear,
but you are not just anyone, Clark.

197
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,316
And I have to believe
that you were,

198
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:26,431
that you were send here for an reason.

199
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,410
All these changes that
you're going through, one day,

200
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:32,578
one day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing.

201
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:35,148
When that day comes,
you'll have to make a choice,

202
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:39,951
choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not..

203
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:44,354
Can't I just
keep pretending I'm your son?

204
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:47,156
You are my son.

205
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,996
But somewhere out there,
you have another father too.

206
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:56,797
Who gave you another name.

207
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:03,369
And he send you here
for a reason, Clark.

208
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:06,833
And even if it takes you
the rest of your life,

209
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,631
you owe it to yourself
to find out what that reason is.

210
00:32:29,056 --> 00:32:33,160
They did find something strange in...

211
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:39,652
I know, it's crazy, right?
The Americans are there too.

212
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,370
Lots of them.

213
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:43,455
They are calling it anomalous object,
whatever that means.

214
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:45,904
back off rebel, I'm serious.
Oh come on, Chrissy.

215
00:32:46,871 --> 00:32:48,836
- Knock it off!
- Sit down.

216
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:52,871
- Let me go!
- Hey, leave her alone, man.

217
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:57,723
Or what, tough guy?

218
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:01,284
Or... I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

219
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:06,461
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

220
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,495
O, there he is.

221
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:27,403
It's not worth it, sweetie.

222
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:38,479
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.

223
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:33,156
Thanks,

224
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:34,843
Hi.

225
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:36,925
Miss Lane, how are you doing?

226
00:34:37,426 --> 00:34:41,996
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic cargo.
- How far to the station?

227
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:44,932
Camp is just over the rise,
I'll walk you over. - Great.

228
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:52,504
- Help her out.
- Careful with those, they are heavy.

229
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:59,143
I got to confess, Miss Lane,
I'm not a fan of The Daily Planet.

230
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,411
But those you pieces you wrote...

231
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:05,614
Well, they were pretty impressive.

232
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:10,585
Well, what can I say, I get writer's
block if I'm not wearing a flat jacket.

233
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:20,226
Miss Lane!
Hardy, US Northcom, dr. Emil Hamilton.

234
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:24,129
You are early, we were
expecting you tomorrow.

235
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:26,832
Which I why showed up today.

236
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:29,634
Look, let’s get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

237
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:32,237
The only reason I'm here
is because we are on Canadian soil,

238
00:35:32,336 --> 00:35:36,039
and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

239
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:39,041
So, if we are done
measuring dicks,

240
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:42,144
can you have your people
show me what you found?

241
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:47,127
NASA's EOS satellites
pinged the anomaly first,

242
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:48,697
the ice shelf's plates
held the echo soundings.

243
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,785
But, there is definitely
something down there.

244
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:54,389
- A submarine, maybe Soviet era?
- Doubtful, that's 300 meters,

245
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,290
considerably larger than
anything they build back then.

246
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,824
But here is the spooky part.

247
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,927
The ice surrounding the object,

248
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,662
it’s nearly 20,000 years old...

249
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:11,134
Miss Lane, you are not to wander.

250
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:13,736
Temperatures drops to
- 40 at night around here.

251
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:16,237
We couldn't find your
body until after spring.

252
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,377
There you go.

253
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:28,448
- What if I need to tinkle?
- There's a bucket in the corner.

254
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:05,493
Where the hell are you going?

255
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:54,226
It's all right, it's all right..

256
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:10,737
You are hemorrhaging internally

257
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:13,467
and if I don't cauterize this bleed...

258
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:18,490
I can do things
that other people can’t.

259
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,532
Now hold my hand.

260
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,379
This is gonna hurt.

261
00:42:23,597 --> 00:42:27,634
What Colonel Hardy and his team
surmised was a Soviet era submarine,

262
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:30,537
was actually something much more exotic.

263
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,372
An isotope analysis
of the surrounding ice bores,

264
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:36,007
suggests that an object
had been trapped in the glacier

265
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:38,409
for over 18,000 years.

266
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:42,746
As for my rescuer, he disappeared
during the object’s departure,

267
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,284
A background check revealed that his work
history and identity had been falsified.

268
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:52,621
The questions raised by my rescuer's
existence are frightening to contemplate,

269
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:55,523
but I also know what I saw.

270
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:58,549
And they've arrived
at the inescapable conclusion

271
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:00,786
that the object
and its occupant,

272
00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:03,229
did not originate on Earth..

273
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:07,599
I can’t print this Lois, you might have
hallucinated half of it.

274
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:10,691
What about the civilian contractors
who corroborated my story?

275
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:13,304
The Pentagon is denying that
there was a ship.

276
00:43:13,388 --> 00:43:17,357
Of course they are, that's what they
are supposed to do, it’s the Pentagon.

277
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:20,643
Harry come on, it’s me we are talking
about, I'm a Pulitzer winning reporter.

278
00:43:21,043 --> 00:43:23,579
- Then act like it.
- Print it or I walk.

279
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,782
You can’t, you are under contract.

280
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:32,820
I'm not running a story about
aliens walking among us...

281
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:40,845
Never going to happen.

282
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:45,363
That's a Scotch
straight up for the lady.

283
00:43:45,763 --> 00:43:48,565
I'm sending you the original article,
my editor won't print it

284
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:50,534
but, if it happened to leak online...

285
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:55,304
But, didn't you once
describe my site as a...

286
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:59,674
- "creeping cancer of falsehoods"?
- I stand by my words, Woodburn.

287
00:43:59,774 --> 00:44:02,710
- But I want this story out there.
- Why?

288
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:07,214
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

289
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:25,562
**Recursive diagnostics complete.
Guiding process authenticated.**

290
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:29,198
**All systems operational.**

291
00:44:40,797 --> 00:44:45,301
To see you standing there,
having grown into an adult.

292
00:44:47,002 --> 00:44:51,640
- If only Lara could witness this.
- Who are you?

293
00:44:52,037 --> 00:44:54,739
I'm your father, Kal.

294
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:59,209
Or at least a shadow of him,
his consciousness.

295
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:04,747
My name is Jor-El.

296
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:09,351
And Kal?

297
00:45:11,686 --> 00:45:12,887
It’s my name.

298
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:16,356
Kal-El, it is.

299
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:20,505
I have so many questions.

300
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:28,378
Where do I come from?
Why did you send me here?

301
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:33,049
You came from Krypton.

302
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:38,019
A world with a much harsher
environment than Earth's.

303
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:45,125
Long ago, in an era of expansion...

304
00:45:45,183 --> 00:45:48,286
... our race spread out
through the stars,

305
00:45:48,686 --> 00:45:51,488
seeking new worlds to settle upon.

306
00:45:52,587 --> 00:45:57,925
This scout ship was one of thousands
launched into the void.

307
00:45:58,725 --> 00:46:01,227
We build outposts on other planets,

308
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:05,030
using great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

309
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:12,703
For 100,000 years,
our civilization flourished,

310
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:17,907
- accomplishing wonders.
- What happened?

311
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:23,412
Artificial population control
was established.

312
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:27,615
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned,

313
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:32,252
we exhausted our natural
resources, as a result...

314
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:36,322
our planet's core became unstable.

315
00:46:37,122 --> 00:46:41,626
Eventually our military
leader, General Zod,

316
00:46:41,726 --> 00:46:44,062
attempted a coup,

317
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:47,925
but by then it was too late.

318
00:46:49,132 --> 00:46:52,068
Your mother and I
foresaw the coming calamity,

319
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,204
and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

320
00:46:56,838 --> 00:46:59,207
This is a genesis chamber.

321
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:02,409
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this,

322
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:06,379
every child was designed to fulfill
a predetermined role in our society,

323
00:47:06,646 --> 00:47:10,453
as a worker, a warrior,
a leader, and so on.

324
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,886
Your mother and I believed that
Krypton had lost something precious,

325
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:17,488
the element of choice, of chance.

326
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,280
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something other

327
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:22,452
than what society
had intended for him or her?

328
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:27,129
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

329
00:47:27,229 --> 00:47:29,275
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

330
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:31,972
Krypton's first natural birth
in centuries.

331
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,370
That's why we risked
so much to save you.

332
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,172
Why didn't you come with me?

333
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:44,676
We couldn't, Kal.

334
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:47,180
No matter how much we wanted to,

335
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:49,914
no matter how much we loved you...

336
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:51,815
Your mother Lara and I

337
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:55,076
were a product of the failures
of our world as much Zod was,

338
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,113
tied to its fate.

339
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:59,391
- So, I'm alone.
- No.

340
00:48:00,856 --> 00:48:04,559
You are much as a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

341
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:08,195
You can embody
the best of both worlds.

342
00:48:08,528 --> 00:48:11,831
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

343
00:48:16,635 --> 00:48:19,704
The people of Earth are different
from us, it’s true.

344
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,662
But ultimately I believe
that is a good thing.

345
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:25,798
They won't necessarily make
the same mistakes we did.

346
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,102
Not if you guide them, Kal.

347
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:31,769
Not if you give them hope.

348
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:36,827
That is what this symbol means.

349
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:40,076
The symbol of the House of El
means "hope".

350
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:42,488
Embodied within the hope
is the fundamental belief,

351
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,050
the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

352
00:48:47,627 --> 00:48:50,930
That's what you can bring them.

353
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:11,880
Why am I so different from them?

354
00:49:13,114 --> 00:49:16,917
Earth's sun is younger and
brighter than Krypton’s was.

355
00:49:17,484 --> 00:49:19,597
Your cells
have drunk in its radiation,

356
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:23,416
strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.

357
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:29,728
Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing,

358
00:49:29,794 --> 00:49:32,997
You've grown stronger here
than I ever could've imagined.

359
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,432
The only way to know how strong,

360
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,237
is to keep testing your limits.

361
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:34,927
You will give the people of Earth
an ideal to strive towards.

362
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,423
They will race behind you,
they will stumble, they will fall.

363
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:43,551
But in time...

364
00:50:44,685 --> 00:50:47,688
they will join you
when the sun comes.

365
00:50:48,822 --> 00:50:53,526
In time, you will help them
accomplish wonders.

366
00:52:15,735 --> 00:52:20,339
How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?

367
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:23,508
You start with the urban legends
that have sprung up in his wake.

368
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:26,777
All of the friends of a friend
who claim to have seen him.

369
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,246
For some, he was a guardian angel.

370
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:34,750
For others a cypher,
a ghost who never quite fit in.

371
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,056
As you work your way back in time,
the stories begin to form a pattern.

372
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:43,945
I'm looking for a Pete Ross,
do you know him?

373
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:45,993
Yes, he works at the I-Hop.

374
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,677
You go down the road...

375
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:50,891
Pete Ross?

376
00:52:52,188 --> 00:52:55,391
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
that occurred when you were younger,

377
00:52:55,424 --> 00:52:58,426
a school bus
that went into the river?

378
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:05,289
Rusty!

379
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:10,770
Mrs. Kent, I'm Lois Lane
from The Daily Planet.

380
00:53:10,818 --> 00:53:12,818
Quiet!

381
00:53:13,038 --> 00:53:16,641
I'm from The Daily Planet and I'd like
to talk to you about your son.

382
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:48,725
Where are you from, what are you
doing here, let me tell your story.

383
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:54,461
- What if I don't want my story told?
- It’s going to come out eventually.

384
00:53:54,582 --> 00:53:57,285
Somebody’s going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

385
00:53:57,585 --> 00:53:59,186
Then I’ll just disappear again.

386
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,422
The only way you can disappear for good
is to stop helping people altogether,

387
00:54:02,424 --> 00:54:05,226
and I sense
that's not option for you.

388
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:11,029
My father believed...

389
00:54:11,129 --> 00:54:14,031
... that if the world found out
who I really was...

390
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:17,974
they'd reject me, out of fear.

391
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,571
I'm tired of safe!

392
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:24,440
I just want do something
useful with my life.

393
00:54:24,506 --> 00:54:27,408
So farming, feeding people,
that's not useful?

394
00:54:27,502 --> 00:54:28,902
I didn't say that.

395
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:31,529
Our family has been farming
for 5 generations, Clark.

396
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:33,187
Your family. Not mine.

397
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:36,153
I don't know even why I'm listening
to you, you are not my dad,

398
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:37,984
you are just some guy who
found me in the field.

399
00:54:37,995 --> 00:54:39,296
Clark!

400
00:54:41,787 --> 00:54:44,155
That's all right, Martha.

401
00:54:45,223 --> 00:54:47,958
He is right, Clark has a point.

402
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:50,727
We are not your parents.

403
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:53,021
But we've been doing
the best we can,

404
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:55,089
and we've been
making it up as we go along,

405
00:54:55,164 --> 00:55:00,235
so maybe... maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

406
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:05,572
Look...

407
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:07,814
- Dad, please...
- Hold on.

408
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,192
Go for the overpass.

409
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:32,894
Go for the overpass!

410
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,663
Take cover! Take cover!

411
00:55:36,364 --> 00:55:38,265
Over there, just follow them!

412
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:43,970
She's stuck!

413
00:55:45,805 --> 00:55:47,506
You guys follow me.

414
00:55:47,706 --> 00:55:50,008
The dog's in the car!

415
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:54,778
I get him!

416
00:55:55,379 --> 00:55:57,781
Get your mom to the overpass.

417
00:56:26,858 --> 00:56:28,858
- Jonathan!
- It's okay!

418
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:50,689
- Jonathan!
- Ma, stay here.

419
00:57:16,218 --> 00:57:18,218
Dad!!

420
00:57:21,214 --> 00:57:24,116
I let my father die,
because I trusted him.

421
00:57:25,217 --> 00:57:29,020
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

422
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:32,423
That the world was not ready.

423
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:36,526
What do you think?

424
00:57:40,062 --> 00:57:42,331
You better watch out Lois.

425
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:44,254
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

426
00:57:44,954 --> 00:57:47,734
He knows you are Woodburn’s
anonymous source and he cannot wait...

427
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,798
... to rip you a new one.

428
00:57:54,507 --> 00:57:57,136
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

429
00:57:57,176 --> 00:57:59,878
You let Woodburn just shotgun it
all over the internet!

430
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:03,214
Now, the publishers want me
to sue you!

431
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,956
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

432
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:08,548
- Whoa, just like that?
- Yeah.

433
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,222
- What happened to your leads?
- They didn't pan out.

434
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:13,737
The story was smoke.

435
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,325
Or perhaps it just didn't get
the attraction you hoped it would.

436
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:21,428
2 weeks leave, no pay -
that's your pennance.

437
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:24,831
You try something like
this again - you're done here.

438
00:58:25,365 --> 00:58:28,000
No, let’s make it 3 weeks, since you
are so willing to agree with me.

439
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,344
No, no, don't.

440
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,672
I believe you saw something Lois,

441
00:58:33,705 --> 00:58:36,707
but not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold,

442
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:41,044
so whatever your reasons
are for dropping it...

443
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:43,413
I think you're doing
the right thing.

444
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,881
Why?

445
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:49,752
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

446
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,953
If...

447
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:56,157
they knew that there was
someone like this out there?

448
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,539
Go get him!

449
00:59:21,177 --> 00:59:23,178
Well, look at you!

450
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:42,093
A reporter came by here.

451
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,662
She is a friend, don't worry.

452
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:49,032
Mom.

453
00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:50,600
What?

454
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:53,736
- I found them.
- Whom?

455
00:59:55,037 --> 00:59:56,838
My parents.

456
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,807
My people.

457
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:03,011
I know where I come from now.

458
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:06,479
Wow...

459
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,581
That's wonderful.

460
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:12,484
I'm so happy for you.

461
01:00:21,692 --> 01:00:24,727
- What?
- Its nothing.

462
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:30,332
When you were a baby,
I use to lay by your cradle.

463
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:32,500
Listen to your breath.

464
01:00:33,534 --> 01:00:35,536
It was hard for you.

465
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:38,271
You struggled.

466
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:40,435
And I worried all the time.

467
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:43,236
You worried that the truth
would come out.

468
01:00:43,576 --> 01:00:46,645
No, the truth about you...

469
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,595
... is beautiful.

470
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,649
We saw that, the moment
we laid eyes on you.

471
01:00:54,618 --> 01:01:00,022
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

472
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:02,658
I'm just…

473
01:01:03,158 --> 01:01:06,121
I'm worried
they’ll take you away from me.

474
01:01:07,361 --> 01:01:09,830
I'm not going anywhere, mom.

475
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:13,566
I promise.

476
01:01:19,404 --> 01:01:23,207
- General Swanwick, sir.
- What am I looking at, doc?

477
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:25,742
Comet? Asteroid?

478
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:30,880
Comets don't make
course corrections, General.

479
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:36,502
I wanted you see this before
some amateur with a telescope

480
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:38,607
creates a worldwide panic.

481
01:01:39,587 --> 01:01:43,657
The ship appears to have inserted
itself into a lunar synchronous orbit.

482
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:45,850
Though I have no idea why.

483
01:01:46,433 --> 01:01:49,702
Have you tried...
communicating with it?

484
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:52,565
Well, they haven't
responded as of yet.

485
01:01:54,632 --> 01:01:56,834
I'm just speculating,

486
01:01:57,335 --> 01:01:59,155
but I think whoever is
at the helm of that thing

487
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,738
is looking to make
a dramatic entrance.

488
01:02:07,976 --> 01:02:10,984
Does anybody know where
we keep the toner cartridges?

489
01:02:11,012 --> 01:02:13,280
- What's going on?
- It’s all over the news.

490
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,482
You got to see this.

491
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:43,742
Clark!

492
01:02:43,819 --> 01:02:45,920
Yeah, coming.

493
01:03:30,685 --> 01:03:32,685
**You are not alone.**

494
01:03:34,535 --> 01:03:36,837
Yo*are* no* AL**0

495
01:03:38,853 --> 01:03:41,322
**you are not alone**

496
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:17,546
- It’s coming in on the RSS feeds.
- **you are not alone**

497
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,749
It’s on my phone, too.

498
01:04:23,504 --> 01:04:26,306
My name is General Zod.

499
01:04:27,974 --> 01:04:31,877
I come from a world far from yours.

500
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:37,180
I have journeyed across an ocean
of stars to reach you.

501
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:42,678
For some time your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.

502
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:45,321
I request that you return
this individual...

503
01:04:46,288 --> 01:04:47,989
... to my custody.

504
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:50,561
For reasons unknown,

505
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:54,526
he has chosen to keep his
existence a secret from you.

506
01:04:56,029 --> 01:04:59,332
He will have made efforts
to blend in.

507
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:01,968
He will look like you.

508
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:04,503
But he is not one of you.

509
01:05:05,871 --> 01:05:09,774
To those of you who may know
of his current location:

510
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:15,463
The fate of your planet
rests in your hands.

511
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,523
To Kal-El, I say this:

512
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,995
Surrender within 24 hours,

513
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:31,516
or watch this world
suffer the consequences.

514
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:50,871
If he truly means us no harm,

515
01:05:50,918 --> 01:05:52,754
then he'll turn himself in
to his people,

516
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,333
and face the consequences
and if he won’t do that,

517
01:05:55,393 --> 01:05:56,894
then maybe we should.

518
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,962
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane
knows who this guys is.

519
01:05:59,963 --> 01:06:01,865
And I think she’s the one
we should be questioning.

520
01:06:01,897 --> 01:06:05,199
Hold-on, you are saying
Lois Lane knows...

521
01:06:05,264 --> 01:06:08,002
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

522
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:11,606
For once I actually I agree with
Woodburn. Now, have you seen him?

523
01:06:11,618 --> 01:06:13,987
No, and even I did, I wouldn't say.

524
01:06:14,014 --> 01:06:17,717
The entire world
is being threatened here!

525
01:06:18,576 --> 01:06:21,479
This not the time for you to fall back
on your journalistic integrity!

526
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:27,443
This is serious, Lois! The FBI is here
hurling around words like treason.

527
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:28,847
I got to go.

528
01:06:45,206 --> 01:06:48,109
FBI, hands up!
Drop the bag, now!

529
01:06:55,424 --> 01:06:58,921
Regarding the visitors themselves,
we know very little at this point.

530
01:06:59,004 --> 01:07:01,204
According to
government officials I've spoken to,

531
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,625
the visitors do not represent a threat,

532
01:07:03,655 --> 01:07:06,055
despite the ominous tone
of their message.

533
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,611
Then, of course, there’s
the question on everyone's mind:

534
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,691
Who is this Kal-El person?

535
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:15,062
Does he actually exist? How could he
 have remained hidden for so long?

536
01:07:19,808 --> 01:07:21,809
Come on, Kent.

537
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:29,415
Come on, fight back!

538
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:31,717
Get up, Kent.

539
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:35,854
Is that it?

540
01:07:36,088 --> 01:07:38,190
Is that all you got?

541
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:41,179
Come on, Kent!

542
01:07:41,926 --> 01:07:43,527
Come on!

543
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,848
Did they hurt you?

544
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:16,283
They can't.

545
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:19,018
It's not what I meant,
I meant are you all right?

546
01:08:20,231 --> 01:08:23,086
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him so bad!

547
01:08:23,124 --> 01:08:24,625
I know you did, I mean...

548
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:29,026
Part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

549
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,462
Would it make you feel any better?

550
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:37,933
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, because...

551
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,103
whoever that man is -
good character or bad - he is...

552
01:08:42,837 --> 01:08:45,640
He is going to change the world.

553
01:08:50,287 --> 01:08:52,382
What’s on your mind?

554
01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:59,447
I don't where to start.

555
01:08:59,484 --> 01:09:01,685
Wherever you want.

556
01:09:03,254 --> 01:09:06,289
That ship that appeared last night.

557
01:09:06,523 --> 01:09:10,259
I'm the one they are looking for.

558
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:14,947
Do you know...

559
01:09:14,973 --> 01:09:17,331
- why they want you?
- No.

560
01:09:17,332 --> 01:09:19,490
But this General Zod,

561
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:23,687
even if I surrender, there's
no guarantee he'll keep his word.

562
01:09:23,778 --> 01:09:28,615
If there's a chance I can save
Earth by turning myself in...

563
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:31,243
... shouldn't I take it?

564
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,923
What does your gut tell you?

565
01:09:34,478 --> 01:09:36,980
Zod can’t be trusted.

566
01:09:38,749 --> 01:09:44,253
The problem is... I'm not sure
the people of Earth can be either.

567
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:55,629
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first,

568
01:09:56,563 --> 01:10:00,333
the trust part comes later.

569
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,452
All right, you got our attention.

570
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:29,089
- What it is you want?
- I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

571
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:30,924
What makes you think she's here?

572
01:10:31,068 --> 01:10:35,104
Don't play games with me, General,
I'll surrender.

573
01:10:35,227 --> 01:10:38,730
But only if you guarantee
Lois's freedom.

574
01:10:47,478 --> 01:10:50,414
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

575
01:10:50,778 --> 01:10:54,448
I’m surrendering to mankind,
there is a difference.

576
01:10:55,306 --> 01:10:57,741
You let them handcuff you.

577
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,915
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

578
01:11:02,215 --> 01:11:07,453
And if it makes them feel more secure,
then all the better for it.

579
01:11:11,623 --> 01:11:15,426
What does the S stand for?

580
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:18,895
It’s not an a S,

581
01:11:19,114 --> 01:11:21,679
on my world it means “hope”.

582
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:26,783
Well, here it’s an S.

583
01:11:28,378 --> 01:11:31,514
How about...

584
01:11:35,342 --> 01:11:37,509
Sir, hi.

585
01:11:37,677 --> 01:11:41,079
- My name is doctor...
- Emil Hamilton, I know.

586
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:43,748
I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket,

587
01:11:43,782 --> 01:11:46,784
along with a half eaten roll
of Wint-O-Green Life Savers.

588
01:11:46,848 --> 01:11:49,268
And I also see the squad
of soldiers in the next room

589
01:11:49,323 --> 01:11:51,641
preparing that
tranquilizing agent of yours.

590
01:11:51,796 --> 01:11:53,197
You won’t need it.

591
01:11:53,256 --> 01:11:56,859
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions,

592
01:11:56,892 --> 01:11:59,461
you could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

593
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:02,830
I’ve been here for 33 years, doctor,
haven't infected anyone yet.

594
01:12:02,863 --> 01:12:04,665
That you know of.

595
01:12:04,765 --> 01:12:06,967
We have legitimate
security concerns.

596
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,802
Now you revealed your identity
to Miss Lane over there.

597
01:12:09,869 --> 01:12:12,771
Why won't you do the same with us?

598
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:15,574
Let’s put our cards
on the table here, General.

599
01:12:16,308 --> 01:12:19,010
You are scared of me
because you can't control me.

600
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,045
You don't and you never will.

601
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,547
But that doesn't mean
I'm your enemy.

602
01:12:24,614 --> 01:12:27,817
And who is? Zod?

603
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:32,520
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Be that as it may,

604
01:12:32,621 --> 01:12:36,023
I been given orders
to hand you over to him.

605
01:12:36,324 --> 01:12:38,325
Do what you have to do, General.

606
01:12:43,343 --> 01:12:45,144
Thank you.

607
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:46,512
For what?

608
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,681
For believing in me.

609
01:12:51,983 --> 01:12:54,485
Didn't make much
difference in the end.

610
01:12:54,952 --> 01:12:56,754
It did to me.

611
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:19,171
They are coming.

612
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:21,195
You should leave now.

613
01:13:23,175 --> 01:13:25,276
Go, Lois.

614
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,803
Kal-El, I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

615
01:14:40,903 --> 01:14:44,906
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

616
01:14:49,744 --> 01:14:52,746
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

617
01:14:52,846 --> 01:14:57,417
General Zod, would like
this woman to accompany me.

618
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:00,486
You asked for the alien.

619
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:03,421
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

620
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:07,326
Shall I tell the general
you are unwilling to comply?

621
01:15:07,558 --> 01:15:10,160
I don't care what you tell him.

622
01:15:12,115 --> 01:15:14,415
It's all right.

623
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:16,332
I'll go.

624
01:15:58,629 --> 01:16:02,699
The atmosphere composition in our ship
is not compatible with humans.

625
01:16:02,799 --> 01:16:07,303
You will need to wear
a breather beyond this point.

626
01:16:31,495 --> 01:16:32,796
Kal-El.

627
01:16:33,978 --> 01:16:38,181
You have no idea how long
we've been searching for you.

628
01:16:38,448 --> 01:16:41,684
- I take it you are Zod.
- General Zod, our Commander!

629
01:16:41,766 --> 01:16:45,845
It's all right, Faora. You can
forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

630
01:16:45,988 --> 01:16:48,089
He is a stranger to our ways.

631
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:50,525
This should be cause for celebration.

632
01:16:51,492 --> 01:16:53,293
Not conflict.

633
01:16:57,197 --> 01:16:59,797
I... feel strange.

634
01:17:02,437 --> 01:17:04,437
Weak...

635
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:09,506
- What's happening to him?
- He is rejecting our ships atmospherics.

636
01:17:10,507 --> 01:17:13,218
You've spend a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology

637
01:17:13,223 --> 01:17:16,323
- but you never adapted to ours.
- Help him!

638
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,384
I can't. Whatever's happening to him
has to run its course.

639
01:17:21,769 --> 01:17:23,769
Help him!

640
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,850
Help him!

641
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:39,150
Hello, Kal.

642
01:17:41,152 --> 01:17:43,353
Or do you prefer Clark?

643
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:46,723
That's the name they gave you,
isn't it?

644
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:52,194
I was Krypton's military leader,
your father - our foremost scientist.

645
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:56,297
The only thing we agreed on
was that Krypton was dying.

646
01:17:56,364 --> 01:17:59,467
In return for my efforts
to protect our civilization,

647
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:02,369
and save our planet...

648
01:18:02,435 --> 01:18:06,038
... I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

649
01:18:09,174 --> 01:18:12,677
And then,
the destruction of our world...

650
01:18:12,777 --> 01:18:14,479
freed us.

651
01:18:19,716 --> 01:18:21,717
We were adrift.

652
01:18:21,985 --> 01:18:26,487
Destined to float among the ruins
of our planet until we starved.

653
01:18:28,056 --> 01:18:30,160
How did you find your way to Earth?

654
01:18:30,358 --> 01:18:34,461
We managed to retro-fit the phantom
projector into a hyper drive.

655
01:18:35,095 --> 01:18:39,498
Your father made similar modification
to the craft that brought your here.

656
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:43,368
And so
the instrument of our damnation...

657
01:18:45,236 --> 01:18:46,738
... became our salvage.

658
01:18:51,942 --> 01:18:56,301
We sought out the old colonial
outposts, looking for signs of life.

659
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:02,283
But all we found was death.

660
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:07,595
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts
withered and died long ago.

661
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,961
We salvaged what we could:

662
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:12,996
armor, weapons.

663
01:19:13,096 --> 01:19:15,098
Even a world-engine.

664
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:18,900
For 33 years we prepared,

665
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:23,038
until finally
we detected a distress beacon,

666
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:27,608
which you triggered when
you accessed the ancient scout ship.

667
01:19:28,309 --> 01:19:31,211
You lead us here, Kal.

668
01:19:32,645 --> 01:19:36,949
And now it's within your power
to save what remains of your race.

669
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:45,956
On Krypton, the genetic template
for every being yet to be born,

670
01:19:46,056 --> 01:19:48,458
is encoded
in the registry of citizens.

671
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:52,418
Your father stole
the registry's codex

672
01:19:52,444 --> 01:19:55,155
and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

673
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:57,399
For what purpose?

674
01:19:57,599 --> 01:20:01,001
So that Krypton can live again...

675
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:03,070
... on Earth.

676
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,687
Where is the codex, Kal?

677
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,530
If Krypton lives again,

678
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,292
what happens to Earth?

679
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:34,517
A foundation
has to be built on something.

680
01:20:35,829 --> 01:20:38,832
Even your father recognized that.

681
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:46,895
No, Zod.

682
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:52,467
- I can’t be a part of this.
- Then what can you be a part of?

683
01:20:55,069 --> 01:20:56,070
Stop!

684
01:21:06,677 --> 01:21:11,113
Your father acquitted himself
with honor Kal.

685
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:16,918
- You killed him?
- I did.

686
01:21:17,018 --> 01:21:21,555
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

687
01:21:21,905 --> 01:21:27,943
But if I had to do it again, I would.
I have a duty to my people.

688
01:21:27,994 --> 01:21:33,098
And I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

689
01:21:48,328 --> 01:21:50,528
What's the setback, Major?

690
01:21:50,645 --> 01:21:52,913
DSP pinged 2 bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

691
01:21:52,914 --> 01:21:55,289
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

692
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:57,142
There it is.

693
01:21:57,217 --> 01:22:00,487
Retask I-Com 4, give me
a closer look. - Yes, sir.

694
01:22:00,578 --> 01:22:03,113
Command, word of the day is "Trident".

695
01:22:03,213 --> 01:22:07,280
- We have 2 alien craft on aggressive
approach.  - I-Com 4 coming online.

696
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:12,810
- Air speed? - 380 knots, they are
not responding to our hails.

697
01:22:13,221 --> 01:22:15,457
You are wasting your efforts.

698
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,969
The strength you do have from
your exposure to the Earth's sun

699
01:22:18,995 --> 01:22:21,270
has been neutralized
aboard our ship.

700
01:22:21,308 --> 01:22:24,333
Here, in this environment,

701
01:22:24,877 --> 01:22:26,878
you're as weak as a human.

702
01:23:24,856 --> 01:23:28,359
- Where did you come from?
- The command key, Miss Lane.

703
01:23:28,726 --> 01:23:31,795
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
into the ships mainframe.

704
01:23:32,562 --> 01:23:35,565
- Who are you?
- I'm Kal's father.

705
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:40,902
- Can you help us?
- I designed this ship.

706
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:45,973
I can modify its atmospheric
composition to human compatibility.

707
01:23:46,577 --> 01:23:49,880
We can stop them, we can send
them back to the phantom zone.

708
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,556
- How?
- I can teach you.

709
01:23:53,712 --> 01:23:58,217
And in turn, you can teach Kal.
Will you help me?

710
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:13,981
The ship's crew are alerted.
We need to move quickly.

711
01:24:14,075 --> 01:24:16,075
Retrieve the command key.

712
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:25,986
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up the sidearm.

713
01:24:35,824 --> 01:24:37,824
What's happening?

714
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,384
To your right, fire!

715
01:25:01,487 --> 01:25:03,487
Behind you!

716
01:25:15,541 --> 01:25:18,041
Secure yourself inside the under pod.

717
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,560
Safe travels, Miss Lane.

718
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:23,681
It's highly unlikely
we'll be seeing each other again.

719
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:27,497
Remember, the Phantom Drive
is essential for stopping them.

720
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:30,630
Movie your head to the left.

721
01:25:56,999 --> 01:26:00,093
Is it true
what Zod said about the codex?

722
01:26:00,099 --> 01:26:02,099
Strike that panel.

723
01:26:05,556 --> 01:26:08,528
We wanted you to learn
what it meant to be human first.

724
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:11,936
So that one day,
when the time was right,

725
01:26:12,127 --> 01:26:15,388
you could be the bridge
between two peoples.

726
01:26:17,832 --> 01:26:19,832
Look.

727
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,560
Lois.

728
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,937
You can save her, Kal.

729
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:30,185
You can save all of them.

730
01:27:48,481 --> 01:27:51,184
You will be safe here.

731
01:27:52,384 --> 01:27:56,187
- Are you all right?
- Oh yeah.

732
01:27:58,322 --> 01:28:02,022
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna tell them
anything about you,

733
01:28:02,105 --> 01:28:04,471
but they did something to me,
they looked inside my mind...

734
01:28:04,518 --> 01:28:07,220
It's okay, Lois.
They did the same thing to me.

735
01:28:20,767 --> 01:28:22,767
Clark!

736
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:35,083
The craft he arrived in,
where is it?

737
01:28:36,585 --> 01:28:39,087
Go to hell.

738
01:28:49,061 --> 01:28:51,063
There.

739
01:29:21,765 --> 01:29:23,066
Where has he hidden it?

740
01:29:23,099 --> 01:29:24,400
I don't know.

741
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:26,568
Where is the Codex?!

742
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,928
You think
you can threaten my mother?!

743
01:30:24,681 --> 01:30:26,283
What have you done to me?

744
01:30:26,285 --> 01:30:30,288
My parents taught me
to hone my senses, Zod.

745
01:30:32,321 --> 01:30:34,322
To focus...

746
01:30:34,356 --> 01:30:36,384
... on just what I wanted to see.

747
01:30:36,441 --> 01:30:39,615
Without your helmet,
you are getting everything.

748
01:30:40,294 --> 01:30:43,797
And its hurts, doesn't it?

749
01:31:32,969 --> 01:31:35,171
Get inside, it’s not safe.

750
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:42,520
All clear, this is Guardian,
I'm airborne mission commander.

751
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:45,250
I have previously encountered
and observed

752
01:31:45,253 --> 01:31:47,934
the beings we are about
to engage at close proximity,

753
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:51,894
they are extremely dangerous,
we are authorized to use deadly force.

754
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,757
Roger, Guardian,
we're inbound to target.

755
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:05,413
- We're hot, weapons free.
- Copy One-One, weapons free.

756
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:10,969
Thunder One-One,
tally three targets.

757
01:32:27,286 --> 01:32:30,589
Thunder One-One, good hit,
request immediate re-attack.

758
01:32:30,871 --> 01:32:35,738
Roger, Guardian, we'll make a second
gun run ahead of you 2-1-2-3.

759
01:32:42,637 --> 01:32:44,839
Thunder One-One, eject, eject!

760
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:47,333
Thunder One-One, eject!

761
01:32:57,513 --> 01:32:59,981
I have a bogey incoming!

762
01:33:19,415 --> 01:33:21,917
You are weak, son of El.

763
01:33:21,934 --> 01:33:23,934
Unsure of yourself.

764
01:33:28,376 --> 01:33:32,980
The fact that you posses
a sense of morality and we do not...

765
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:36,482
... gives us
an evolutionary advantage.

766
01:33:39,558 --> 01:33:41,773
And if history has proven anything...

767
01:33:51,795 --> 01:33:55,498
it is that the evolution always wins.

768
01:35:02,045 --> 01:35:04,813
All Rangers,
I need you engage the targets.

769
01:35:04,878 --> 01:35:07,781
Guardian, this is Battle Zero One,
what about that guy in blue?

770
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,477
I said, engage all targets!

771
01:35:21,444 --> 01:35:23,444
Contact, contact!

772
01:35:32,764 --> 01:35:34,565
Are you okay?

773
01:35:39,336 --> 01:35:41,337
We're going in hard!

774
01:35:42,138 --> 01:35:43,840
Brace for impact!

775
01:35:43,962 --> 01:35:46,779
Brace for impact,
we're going in hard!

776
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,253
Fallen Angel, Fallen Angel,
Guardian is down.

777
01:35:53,282 --> 01:35:55,372
I repeat, Guardian is down!

778
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:21,383
Thunder One-Two calling Guardian,
Guardian, do you read?

779
01:36:21,404 --> 01:36:26,708
I want you to put down everything you got
at my position, this will be danger close.

780
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:29,142
Copy, danger close.
Good luck, sir.

781
01:37:10,005 --> 01:37:14,442
A good death is its own reward.

782
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:28,653
You will not win,

783
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,957
for every human you save,
we will kill a million more.

784
01:38:24,935 --> 01:38:27,757
We have an "All clear"?
Do we have an "All clear"?

785
01:38:28,013 --> 01:38:32,012
Alfa Team, stand fast.
Alfa Team, do you copy?

786
01:39:21,737 --> 01:39:23,737
This man is not our enemy.

787
01:39:26,262 --> 01:39:28,262
Thank you, Colonel.

788
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:47,940
Mom?

789
01:39:47,965 --> 01:39:49,965
I'm alright!

790
01:40:01,646 --> 01:40:03,646
Nice suit, son.

791
01:40:04,668 --> 01:40:06,668
I'm sorry.

792
01:40:06,907 --> 01:40:08,907
It's only stuff, Clark.

793
01:40:10,476 --> 01:40:12,876
It can always be replaced.

794
01:40:15,202 --> 01:40:17,202
But you can't be.

795
01:40:17,787 --> 01:40:19,287
Mom...

796
01:40:19,304 --> 01:40:22,956
Zod said this Codex he's looking for
can actually bring my people back.

797
01:40:23,172 --> 01:40:25,172
Isn't that a good thing?

798
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:32,127
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

799
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,037
Clark!

800
01:40:36,862 --> 01:40:39,309
I know how to stop them.

801
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:46,136
- What happened down there?
- He exposed a temporary weakness.

802
01:40:46,236 --> 01:40:51,874
It is of little consequence,
because I have located the codex.

803
01:40:53,008 --> 01:40:55,911
It was never in the capsule.

804
01:40:56,011 --> 01:40:59,814
Jor-el took the codex,
the DNA of an billion people..

805
01:41:00,114 --> 01:41:03,483
And he bonded it with
his sons individual cells,

806
01:41:03,584 --> 01:41:08,821
all Krypton's heirs,
living hidden in one refugee's body.

807
01:41:13,258 --> 01:41:18,996
Does Kal-el need to be alive, for us
to extract the codex from his cells?

808
01:41:19,897 --> 01:41:23,032
No.

809
01:41:27,002 --> 01:41:29,303
Released the world-engine.

810
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:02,497
What did just happen?

811
01:42:02,531 --> 01:42:04,832
The ships just split in 2,
track 1 is heading east,

812
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:07,201
track 2 is deploying towards
the Southern Hemisphere.

813
01:42:07,234 --> 01:42:11,571
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating.

814
01:42:11,604 --> 01:42:15,774
Looks like it’s going to impact
somewhere in the South Indian Ocean.

815
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:37,659
- The rest of the ship is descending.
- Put it on the board now.

816
01:42:38,493 --> 01:42:41,996
Oh my God!

817
01:43:20,493 --> 01:43:23,996
Bring the phantom drive on-line!

818
01:43:45,379 --> 01:43:48,070
We are now slaved to the world engine.

819
01:43:48,649 --> 01:43:50,750
Initiate.

820
01:44:23,376 --> 01:44:25,978
What have they hit us with?

821
01:44:26,012 --> 01:44:31,483
Looks like some kind of gravity weapon,
its working in tandem with their ship.

822
01:44:31,783 --> 01:44:34,435
Somehow they are
increasing the Earth's mass,

823
01:44:34,497 --> 01:44:37,415
clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

824
01:44:38,588 --> 01:44:40,657
Oh my God!

825
01:44:41,824 --> 01:44:43,526
They are Terra-forming.

826
01:44:43,559 --> 01:44:45,160
What's that?

827
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:48,897
Planetary engineering modifying
Earth's atmosphere and topography.

828
01:44:48,997 --> 01:44:51,799
And turning Earth into Krypton.

829
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:54,634
- But what happen to us?
- Based on these readings,

830
01:44:55,235 --> 01:44:57,337
there won’t be an us.

831
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:59,898
General Swanwick, sir.
I'm on with the control tower,

832
01:44:59,997 --> 01:45:02,843
Colonel Hardy is on his way in
and he got Superman in tow.

833
01:45:03,308 --> 01:45:04,976
Superman?

834
01:45:05,043 --> 01:45:08,445
The alien, sir. That's what
they're calling him, Superman.

835
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:17,720
- We have a plan, General.
- Is that what I think it is?

836
01:45:18,253 --> 01:45:19,855
It's the ship he arrived in.

837
01:45:21,656 --> 01:45:24,392
This ship is run by something
called a phantom-drive.

838
01:45:24,492 --> 01:45:28,156
Its bends space. Zod's ship
uses the same technology.

839
01:45:28,182 --> 01:45:30,955
if we can make the two drives
collide with one another...

840
01:45:30,963 --> 01:45:33,365
- A singularity could be created.
- Like a black hole.

841
01:45:33,379 --> 01:45:35,979
Yes. So if you open up this doorway,

842
01:45:36,076 --> 01:45:38,078
then theoretically
they should be pulled back in.

843
01:45:38,169 --> 01:45:40,571
So, you want us bomb them with that?

844
01:45:40,604 --> 01:45:44,228
General, if that craft
maxes at 17,000 pounds,

845
01:45:44,254 --> 01:45:47,746
we can drop it from a C-17.
It’s a viable plan.

846
01:45:47,781 --> 01:45:50,483
And if I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean,

847
01:45:50,546 --> 01:45:53,615
the gravity field
will continue to expand.

848
01:45:59,286 --> 01:46:02,922
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton,

849
01:46:02,924 --> 01:46:05,426
would you be weaker around it?

850
01:46:05,624 --> 01:46:11,162
Maybe, but I'm not gonna let that
stop me from trying.

851
01:46:11,262 --> 01:46:14,765
You may want
to step back a little bit.

852
01:46:15,532 --> 01:46:19,002
Maybe a little bit more.

853
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:52,467
Faora! Take command.
- Yes, sir.

854
01:46:52,537 --> 01:46:55,871
I need to secure
the Genesis chamber,

855
01:46:55,968 --> 01:46:58,771
and pay my respects
to an old friend.

856
01:47:06,073 --> 01:47:10,308
Guardian en route to Metropolis.
Package in tow.

857
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:09,790
**command key accepted**
**genesis chamber coming on-line, sir.**

858
01:48:09,890 --> 01:48:13,393
Stop this, Zod,
while there still time.

859
01:48:14,816 --> 01:48:18,485
Haven't giving up lecturing me
have you, even in death.

860
01:48:18,585 --> 01:48:20,454
I will not let you use
the codex like this.

861
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,589
You don't have
the power to stop me.

862
01:48:22,655 --> 01:48:26,091
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority,

863
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:28,627
this ship is now under my control.

864
01:49:00,419 --> 01:49:03,469
North Com, Lightning 1. Request
permission to unleash the hounds.

865
01:49:03,788 --> 01:49:05,790
North Com, Lightning 1,
you are clear to engage.

866
01:49:05,857 --> 01:49:09,092
Send battle damage
assessment when able, out.

867
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:23,551
Avionics are going haywire,

868
01:49:23,644 --> 01:49:27,002
the gravity field is pulling our
missiles down, we got to get closer!

869
01:49:31,977 --> 01:49:36,815
All right everybody, we are leaving,
we're leaving the building now!

870
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,140
We've lost our wingman!

871
01:50:02,941 --> 01:50:04,941
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

872
01:50:15,562 --> 01:50:18,162
Everybody, this way! Come on!

873
01:50:18,299 --> 01:50:22,569
Everybody, go!
Keep moving, keep moving!

874
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:49,839
Our people can co-exist.

875
01:50:49,906 --> 01:50:53,609
So we can suffer through years of
pain trying to adapt like your son has?

876
01:50:53,642 --> 01:50:56,144
You are talking about genocide.

877
01:50:56,145 --> 01:50:59,148
Yes, and I'm arguing
its merits with a ghost.

878
01:51:00,348 --> 01:51:04,084
We are both ghosts, Zod,
can't you see that?

879
01:51:04,185 --> 01:51:06,187
The Krypton you're clinging on to
is gone.

880
01:51:06,202 --> 01:51:09,502
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

881
01:51:09,589 --> 01:51:11,789
- I have.
- Then prepare to terminate it,

882
01:51:11,879 --> 01:51:15,763
- I'm tired of this debate.
- Silencing me won't change anything.

883
01:51:17,595 --> 01:51:19,616
My son...

884
01:51:19,992 --> 01:51:22,721
... is twice the man you were.

885
01:51:23,612 --> 01:51:25,580
And he will finish what we started.

886
01:51:26,788 --> 01:51:29,589
I can promise you that.

887
01:51:32,779 --> 01:51:38,951
Tell me, you have Jor-El's
memories, his conscience.

888
01:51:38,984 --> 01:51:42,920
Can you experience his pain?

889
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:47,324
I will harvest the codex
from your son's corps.

890
01:51:47,424 --> 01:51:53,062
And I will rebuild Krypton,
atop his bones.

891
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:52,776
Jenny, where are you!

892
01:52:52,859 --> 01:52:56,442
- I'm here!
- Hold on, hold on.

893
01:52:58,247 --> 01:52:59,782
I can't get free, I'm stuck.

894
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:01,917
We get you out there, all-right.
Just sit tight.

895
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,621
- No, no! Please don't leave me!
- I'm not gonna leave you.

896
01:53:06,287 --> 01:53:09,289
Robert, get your ass
over here and help me!

897
01:53:14,593 --> 01:53:16,195
Try this.

898
01:53:23,713 --> 01:53:25,414
It's getting closer!
Come on, push!

899
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:29,342
North Com, this is Guardian,
are we clear to make the drop?

900
01:53:30,173 --> 01:53:32,141
Negative, Guardian.

901
01:54:50,103 --> 01:54:52,104
He did it.

902
01:54:54,039 --> 01:54:57,540
Northcom, this is Guardian, we're passing
the phase line, we're good to go.

903
01:54:57,542 --> 01:55:01,146
Godspeed, Guardian. Arm the package.
You are cleared hot.

904
01:55:01,479 --> 01:55:04,381
We are lining up
for the final run.

905
01:55:04,448 --> 01:55:07,350
It’s up to you and Hamilton now.

906
01:55:45,894 --> 01:55:48,891
- Are you planning on getting me in?
- Load master, is the package armed?

907
01:55:49,139 --> 01:55:51,141
- You know we're ready to drop.
- Negative.

908
01:55:51,453 --> 01:55:53,655
There is something wrong,
it’s not  supposed to do this.

909
01:55:53,688 --> 01:55:57,424
- What is it supposed to do?
- It's supposed to go in all the way.

910
01:55:57,502 --> 01:56:00,504
- Let me take a look.
- Co-pilot's aircraft.

911
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:03,230
Co-pilot's aircraft.

912
01:56:09,514 --> 01:56:12,115
We are lined up for the drop,
what's the hold up?

913
01:56:12,256 --> 01:56:14,256
We have a slight set-back.

914
01:56:29,354 --> 01:56:31,590
Target that aircraft!

915
01:56:34,391 --> 01:56:36,192
**target locked**

916
01:56:45,849 --> 01:56:49,050
- Zod!
- If you destroy this ship...

917
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:51,738
... you destroy Krypton.

918
01:56:54,874 --> 01:56:57,276
Krypton had its chance!

919
01:59:52,249 --> 01:59:54,584
Are they gone?

920
01:59:55,086 --> 01:59:57,205
I think so.

921
01:59:58,254 --> 01:59:59,791
He saved us.

922
02:00:25,208 --> 02:00:29,157
You know they say it's all
downhill after the first kiss.

923
02:00:31,613 --> 02:00:35,761
I'm pretty sure it only counts
when you're kissing a human.

924
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:07,575
Look at this...

925
02:01:07,676 --> 02:01:11,812
We could have built a new Krypton
in this squalor.

926
02:01:11,912 --> 02:01:16,349
But you chose the humans over us.

927
02:01:16,449 --> 02:01:20,821
I exist only to protect Krypton...

928
02:01:22,403 --> 02:01:26,591
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born,

929
02:01:27,708 --> 02:01:32,145
and every action I take,
no matter how violent,

930
02:01:32,245 --> 02:01:37,616
or how cruel,
is for the greater good...

931
02:01:37,716 --> 02:01:39,920
...of my people.

932
02:01:44,054 --> 02:01:48,257
And now I have no people.

933
02:01:51,527 --> 02:01:54,763
My soul...

934
02:01:54,863 --> 02:02:00,067
that is what you have taken from me!

935
02:02:07,539 --> 02:02:11,676
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal,
these humans you've adopted.

936
02:02:11,776 --> 02:02:14,802
I will take them all from you,
one by one.

937
02:02:14,834 --> 02:02:16,544
You are a monster, Zod.

938
02:02:19,349 --> 02:02:22,085
And I'm gonna stop you.

939
02:04:02,131 --> 02:04:08,169
There is only one way this ends, Kal!
Either you die, or I do!

940
02:04:38,185 --> 02:04:41,788
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

941
02:04:41,888 --> 02:04:45,958
Trained my entire life
to master my senses.

942
02:04:46,058 --> 02:04:49,661
Where did you train? On a farm?!

943
02:09:00,523 --> 02:09:01,991
Are you F-ing stupid?!

944
02:09:02,024 --> 02:09:04,126
That's one of your
surveillance drones.

945
02:09:04,193 --> 02:09:08,630
That's a 12 million $
piece of hardware. - It was.

946
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:12,700
I know you are trying to find out,
where I hang my cape, you won't.

947
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:15,302
Then I'll ask the obvious question -

948
02:09:15,402 --> 02:09:18,671
how do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

949
02:09:18,771 --> 02:09:23,507
I grew up in Kansas, General.
I'm about American as its gets.

950
02:09:23,508 --> 02:09:28,813
Look, I'm here to help,
but it has to be on my own terms.

951
02:09:29,113 --> 02:09:33,650
- You have to convince Washington of that.
- Even if I was willing to try...

952
02:09:34,007 --> 02:09:39,344
- What makes you think they'd listen?
- I don't know, General.

953
02:09:39,444 --> 02:09:44,248
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

954
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:54,791
- What are you smiling about, Captain?
- Nothing, sir.

955
02:09:57,425 --> 02:09:59,464
I just think he's kinda hot.

956
02:10:01,395 --> 02:10:06,466
- Get in the car, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

957
02:10:13,438 --> 02:10:18,642
He always believed you were meant for
greater things, and when the day came,

958
02:10:18,742 --> 02:10:22,579
your shoulders will be
able to bare the weight.

959
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:25,681
I just wish he could have been here
to see it finally happen.

960
02:10:26,115 --> 02:10:28,917
He saw it Clark, believe me.

961
02:11:15,354 --> 02:11:18,623
What are you going to do, when
you are not saving the world?

962
02:11:18,657 --> 02:11:20,058
Have you given any thought to that?

963
02:11:20,125 --> 02:11:23,761
I have, actually.

964
02:11:23,861 --> 02:11:29,432
I'm going to find a job, where I can
keep my ear to the ground.

965
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:36,671
Where people won't look twice,
when I want go somewhere dangerous,

966
02:11:38,473 --> 02:11:42,509
or start asking questions.

967
02:11:53,351 --> 02:11:56,921
Come on Lois, when are you
going to throw me a bone?

968
02:11:57,788 --> 02:12:00,624
Courtside seats to the game
tonight, what do you say?

969
02:12:00,757 --> 02:12:04,096
I'd say, you should go back
to trolling the intern pool,

970
02:12:04,187 --> 02:12:06,050
you'll probably have more luck.

971
02:12:06,055 --> 02:12:08,055
Sorry.

972
02:12:09,422 --> 02:12:12,296
- Courtside?
- Don't, don't.

973
02:12:12,636 --> 02:12:15,321
Lombardi, Lane. Want you
to meet our new stringer,

974
02:12:15,393 --> 02:12:19,556
want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent. Good luck, kid.

975
02:12:21,674 --> 02:12:25,110
- Hey. Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

976
02:12:26,311 --> 02:12:30,614
Lois Lane, welcome to The Planet.

977
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:35,929
Glad to be here, Lois.
