1
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,000
{\an8}I can't fill another bucket.
You'll have to make do with this.

2
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,500
{\an8}<i>O Merciful Lord</i>
<i>You are the essence of the world</i>

3
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:46,541
{\an8}<i>With a snake around Your neck, </i>
<i>You are the purest One</i>

4
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,125
{\an8}<i>O Merciful Lord</i>
<i>You are the essence of the world</i>

5
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:55,666
{\an8}<i>With a snake around Your neck, </i>
<i>You are the purest One</i>

6
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,166
{\an8}Bunty!

7
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,125
{\an8}Yes, Mom?

8
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,083
{\an8}Come upstairs!

9
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,166
{\an8}<i>With a snake around Your neck... </i>

10
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:10,583
{\an8}<i>You are the essence of the world</i>
<i>With a snake around Your neck</i>

11
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:15,166
{\an8}<i>You are the purest One</i>
<i>O Merciful Lord</i>

12
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,958
{\an8}<i>You are the essence of the world</i>
<i>With a snake around--</i>

13
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,250
{\an8}So you'll ration my bathing water,

14
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,291
{\an8}but your Holy Basil will always
get its share of water, huh?

15
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,000
{\an8}Well, it doesn't need
four buckets of water to bathe.

16
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,291
{\an8}Right.

17
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,166
{\an8}In my next life,
I want to be a Holy Basil plant.

18
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,125
{\an8}Is it necessary for you
to come upstairs every day?

19
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,083
{\an8}Do you have to say this every day?

20
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,666
{\an8}Anyway, get ready.
We have to go meet Guddu.

21
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,000
{\an8}Don't forget your medicines.

22
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,791
{\an8}They are useless.

23
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,375
{\an8}I'm fed up of applying
them every day.

24
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,583
{\an8}And onions now cost Rs. 150 per kilo.

25
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,750
{\an8}Why don't you come to the point?
How much will you charge to take us there?

26
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,291
{\an8}Give me what you
had given me last time.

27
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,041
{\an8}-Thirty bucks.
-Fifty, sir.

28
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,583
{\an8}- Forty.
-Come on, forty?

29
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,458
{\an8}Fine, give me forty.

30
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,625
{\an8}-Come. Hop on.
-Let's go, mister.

31
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,250
{\an8}-Hop on.
-Let it go.

32
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:37,333
{\an8}How's your joint pain, ma'am?

33
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,666
{\an8}Look at the road, not her knees.

34
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,208
{\an8}-What are you doing?
-He's not driving fast enough.

35
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,875
{\an8}I'm pedaling quite fast.

36
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,958
{\an8}I'm not the one
who is suffering from joint pains.

37
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,791
{\an8}Make sure you discuss it with Guddu today.

38
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,625
{\an8}Who else will you tell,
if not your own son?

39
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,500
Slow down, slow down
or your knees will start hurting again.

40
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,916
{\an8}Go and sit there.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,416
{\an8}-Huh?
-Go, sit.

42
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,041
{\an8}-Good morning, sir .
-Good morning, good morning.

43
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,916
{\an8}-Help me find this address?
-Sure, let me have that.

44
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,250
-Is Ravi here?
-No.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,791
Remember to discuss it with him.

46
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,791
{\an8}<i>Hi, Mom. </i>
<i>Hi, Dad. </i>

47
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,791
Hi, son. How are you?

48
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:31,708
What are you doing?

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,333
{\an8}<i>What do you expect us to</i>
<i>be doing at 11 in the night, Dad?</i>

50
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,416
{\an8}<i>Can't you call at a better time?</i>

51
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,791
Your mom's joint pain is getting worse.

52
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,750
Well, it delays everything.

53
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,833
You have an excuse for everything,
don't you?

54
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,750
<i>Joint pain only gets worse with age. </i>

55
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,583
<i>There is no treatment</i>
<i>for that even in America. </i>

56
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,333
Even if there was,
what would we do in America anyway?

57
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,458
How would we even get there?

58
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:58,750
{\an8}<i>Tell me something, </i>
<i>why do you call on Skype every week?</i>

59
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,250
{\an8}<i>You can call on the phone too. </i>

60
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,583
We can't see you on the phone.

61
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,875
We get to see you on this.

62
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,625
{\an8}Look, Erica.

63
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,583
{\an8}Hey, Erica!

64
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,166
Hello. Look at your grandfather.

65
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,458
Look at your grandpa.

66
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,666
Keep it down.
You aren't the only one here.

67
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,958
-Hello.
-She should hear us.

68
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,125
She's so far away.

69
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,791
<i>Where's her mom?</i>

70
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,750
Her mom?

71
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,416
Here's her mom.

72
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,041
Why don't you make the presentation?

73
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,375
<i>She has to give a presentation</i>
<i>in her office tomorrow, Mom. </i>

74
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,916
<i>She is busy working on that. </i>

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,083
Oh, I see.

76
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,500
You're coming here for Diwali,
aren't you?

77
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,541
No Mom, I don't have the time.

78
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,000
-<i>It has been six years now. </i>
-Oh, my baby,

79
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,708
You always say you don't have the time.

80
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,000
You should take out
some time for your parents.

81
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:43,958
Right.

82
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,166
<i>She should also know</i>

83
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,666
that we have a house here.

84
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,833
-We will feed her delicious Indian snacks.
-<i>Baby, don't cry. </i>

85
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,250
Do you know how expensive
flights to India are?

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,958
<i>Diwakar, please calm her down. </i>

87
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,125
-Please take care of her.
-Come here, my baby.

88
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,333
-Talk to him.
-Let him come back on the screen first.

89
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,625
"Talk to him. Talk to him. "

90
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,416
{\an8}-Son, listen--
-<i>Dad, Erica is getting irritable. </i>

91
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,916
{\an8}<i>I'll call you back. </i>

92
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,958
They named
their child Erica Mishra.

93
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,833
What kind of a name
is Erica Mishra?

94
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,500
Is this supposed to be a name?

95
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,041
You should have talked to him.

96
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,208
You were there.

97
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,708
Erica Mishra was crying
and I was talking to my son.

98
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,000
He'll call back.

99
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,541
Let's go.

100
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,458
Erica is not such a bad name.

101
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,625
Erica Mishra.

102
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,083
-Say airplane.
-Airplane.

103
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,458
And what have you written here?

104
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,666
"Aerplane. "

105
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,750
It's airplane. "I", not "E".
Correct it.

106
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,916
-"Plants were seen. "
-Plants.

107
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,041
-Then...
-"Then suddenly... "

108
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,958
-Greetings, Granny.
-Bless you.

109
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,166
Hey. Stupid girl.

110
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,125
That's enough now.
Send her here.

111
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,291
-Go.
-Why are you so late?

112
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,750
Sorry, sir.

113
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,291
Dad had sent me to the market.

114
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,083
You and your father
will ruin your future.

115
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,708
Sit down and take out
your Maths book.

116
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,958
Granny, shall I come along
with you to the temple?

117
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,041
No need.
She has a lot of work to do.

118
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,708
You take your books out.

119
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,541
-15 times 2?
-30.

120
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,208
Then write 2 here.

121
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,208
I forgot to get a pencil.

122
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,875
"I forgot to get a pencil. "

123
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,041
"A small kid got stuck in the mud. "

124
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,500
Let's play hide and seek.

125
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,666
Look, he managed
to escape once again.

126
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,666
What happened?

127
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,416
Why do I need to worry
when I have a kitty.

128
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll teach this mouse a lesson.

129
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,333
I'm not Kitty, I'm Naina.

130
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,000
"I'm not Kitty, I'm Naina. "

131
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,500
Go, Kitty, do your homework.
Get up and get going.

132
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,166
"The news of a young man's death
was published along with his picture. "

133
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,125
"This news came from Vidhaura, Malwada... "

134
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,250
"When Tara showed Gunjan"

135
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,000
"the picture of the dead body,
she started crying. "

136
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,750
"She said that it was her son So... "

137
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,333
Bunty!

138
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,041
-Come down. The power is back.
-"... her son Sonu's. "

139
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,541
"After the corpse was identified,
the police... "

140
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,916
3000 on the 17th, 1500...

141
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,583
I'm going to the bank.
Do you need anything?

142
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,875
We have run out of wheat flour.

143
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,250
Lock the door.

144
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,583
Are you crazy? You want me
to do four rounds on my bike?

145
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,666
Am I your servant?

146
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,208
You should've sent a loader along.

147
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,291
There is a limit.

148
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,458
Sir!

149
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,875
-Morning.
-Morning.

150
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,291
Where are you off to?

151
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,833
Just some errands to run.

152
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,583
Running errands, where?

153
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,458
To the bank.

154
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,250
Bank!
Great.

155
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,250
Then your morning is indeed good.

156
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,375
Let me drop you.

157
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,083
No, I'll manage.
It's nearby.

158
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,125
Let me give you a lift.
Am I not like your son?

159
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,833
Come on, hop on.

160
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,625
Come, come. Hop on.

161
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,375
And what about these?

162
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,416
May I say something, sir?

163
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,708
Your good days are finally here.

164
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,000
You are going to the bank,
money is also coming in dollars.

165
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,250
It's perfect.

166
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,000
Let me tell you something.
I have applied for a passport.

167
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,375
I'll get it soon enough.

168
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,041
You should talk to Guddu.

169
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,500
What will you do in America?

170
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,958
The same thing I do here.

171
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,666
And Mr. Shambhunath Mishra,
everyone in Gwalior is wearing my brand.

172
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,250
There I'll make sure
that Trump also wears it.

173
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,958
By the way, how much money
did you spend to send Guddu there?

174
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,166
If I know how much it'll cost me I can
ask my father to break the fixed deposit.

175
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,458
It'll help me get married as well.
I want to get married there.

176
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,625
Look, we have reached.

177
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,166
We have reached our destination, sir.
This is as far as I'll go.

178
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,416
Here? Huh?

179
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,041
Yes.
Get down, please.

180
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,333
This is as far as I'll go.

181
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,708
Your bank is nearby.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,875
That way.

183
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,500
Go on.

184
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:17,875
Drop these two parcels at Rajni Textiles,
it's right next to Chourasiya Bhawan.

185
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,750
Tell them Bittoo sent them.

186
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,166
Go on.

187
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,208
Here you go.

188
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,750
{\an8}You have deducted a lot this time.

189
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,916
Don't blame us, blame the system.

190
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,791
{\an8}Everyone is bearing
the brunt these days.

191
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,208
Why did you take a loan
at floating interest rate?

192
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,416
Your loan will get approved as soon
as we are done with the formalities.

193
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,875
-Okay?
-Okay.

194
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,500
Your son is very intelligent.

195
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,000
Sir, please, I needed more money.

196
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,333
Diwakar, I told you what I can do.

197
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,791
<i>Pandit</i>, why are you
sending your son to America?

198
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,416
Our country has everything nowadays.

199
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,916
Why don't you mind
your own business?

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,041
Let me decide where
I want to go, okay?

201
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,000
Doesn't your board say,
"Study Now, Pay Later?"

202
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,541
We'll repay it.

203
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,583
You anyway have my father's
fixed deposit with you.

204
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,916
Diwakar, management makes
these posters, we don't.

205
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,541
And if anything goes wrong, we are
the ones who have to face the music.

206
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,208
Nowadays, help is only offered
to those who don't need it.

207
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,416
Listen, make it three kilos.

208
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Okay.

209
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,833
Why did you come?
You should've rung me up.

210
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,041
-I would've sent Lattu over.
-No.

211
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,916
You should let Lattu study.
Don't force him into these things.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,250
-Got it?
-Bye.

213
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,166
What is this?

214
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,458
What is this?

215
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,875
A mouse trap.

216
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,583
What have you brought?

217
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,541
We have a temple in our house.

218
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,500
You want us to sin
by killing another being?

219
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,458
The previous one was better.

220
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,958
It could trap them and
we could release them outside.

221
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,208
-Take it away.
-What are you saying?

222
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,125
We'll release them
and they'll come back inside.

223
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,083
They are incorrigible.
We should kill them.

224
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,833
Keep it away.
Get it out.

225
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,000
Whenever I try to do anything nice...

226
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,000
You threw it in the vegetable basket.

227
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,250
Take it away.

228
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,750
Keep it aside.

229
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,625
Freshen up, I'll serve dinner.

230
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,500
-This woman...
-And use soap.

231
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,791
I will.
That's the problem with you.

232
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,375
You never use logic.

233
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,833
You just keep saying "go wash up,
go wash up. " I...

234
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,750
Who is it?

235
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,958
Touch his feet.

236
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,375
Touch his feet.

237
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,666
Who is it?

238
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,166
Let her touch your feet.

239
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,041
She is just like your daughter.

240
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,333
Come.

241
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,083
Can I get a <i>roti</i>?

242
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,416
It's chicken.

243
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,125
We don't cook meat here.

244
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,250
My folks don't either.

245
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,041
That's why I brought cooked chicken.

246
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,166
Do you have a problem
serving it as well?

247
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,458
Go get a plate and a glass.

248
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,125
No, I'll get it.

249
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,833
-Want some?
-No.

250
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,958
What?

251
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,333
It's short by Rs. 2,000.

252
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,458
I'll pay it in a few days.

253
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,458
Okay.

254
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,208
Did they leave?

255
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,000
Shut up.

256
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,958
Get up now. Get going.

257
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,916
Come on.

258
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:05,958
Master,

259
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,166
you should pay
the interest on time.

260
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,625
I too have bills to pay, yeah?

261
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,833
{\an8}You go.

262
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,958
<i>Mom, I need Rs. 25 lakh even if I</i>
<i>stick to the bare minimum expenses. </i>

263
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,375
Rs. 25 lakh is a huge sum, son.

264
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,583
How will your father arrange it?

265
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,875
Then what is the point of this 10 lakh?

266
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,083
It won't even last me six months.

267
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,083
Fine! I'll also lead
a mediocre life just like him,

268
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,083
filling the cooler
with buckets of water.

269
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,625
He is doing his best.

270
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,083
He isn't doing enough, Mom.

271
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,541
I've studied in a government school.

272
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,541
I managed to become an engineer
without any coaching.

273
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,875
I did it all on my own.

274
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,208
And now when it's time
to do something, he isn't doing it.

275
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,125
{\an8}I'm doing what I can, son.

276
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,458
{\an8}I'm giving you 10 lakhs.

277
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,916
But you want 25 lakhs.

278
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,541
{\an8}From where do I get
the additional 1.5 million?

279
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,708
{\an8}Should I sell myself?
Mortgage the house? Tell me how?

280
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,083
Everyone does it, Dad.

281
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,708
Why do you worry?

282
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,958
I'll repay it.

283
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,666
{\an8}Heard that?

284
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,458
He's talking numbers with me.

285
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,458
{\an8}The oil massage has made him smarter.

286
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,541
See what you can do.

287
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,583
A cold winter night,
in the ruins of Chambal.

288
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,291
It gets quite cold out there.

289
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,916
There were three dacoits
in front of me and I was unarmed.

290
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,291
Why did you go there unarmed?

291
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,916
Even my department
didn't ask me that.

292
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,583
You should stick to grinding stones.

293
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,916
All I had was a matchbox,
so I started a fire.

294
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,625
Then all the three dacoits gathered
around the bonfire to warm themselves.

295
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,083
That gave me ample
time to do my thing..

296
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,291
He is waiting inside.

297
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,625
{\an8}-Who will grind the stones?
-No!

298
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,333
{\an8}Who will grind the stones?

299
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,375
Hey!

300
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,166
Who will grind the stones?

301
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,250
He is waiting inside.

302
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,166
{\an8}Get the big stones to the other side!

303
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,375
Sir, may I ask you something?

304
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,875
Why does a person become a dacoit?

305
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,625
Wait, asshole, I'll tell you.
Get lost.

306
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,166
Get lost.

307
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:23,416
The cop is waiting inside for you.

308
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,458
{\an8}He is waiting inside.

309
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,416
Why did you come here?

310
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,833
I would've come to you
in a couple of days.

311
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,041
It's less.

312
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,125
You can count.

313
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,333
I did.

314
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:39,250
It's not enough for the number
of businesses you are carrying out.

315
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,958
I need to give others as well.

316
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:47,583
All the boozing, womanizing,
pimping and money laundering,

317
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,791
you do all this in Shakti Singh's area.

318
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,958
Why? Do you have family
living in other areas?

319
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,875
Keep my family out of it.

320
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,791
What do I tell <i>Dada</i>?

321
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,375
Just tell him my name.

322
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,791
He won't question you.

323
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,666
Slowly.

324
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,958
My bones!

325
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,958
It hurts.

326
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:35,791
You climb 50 steps every day
to visit your deity.

327
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,083
It's all His mercy.

328
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:42,083
That's why I can climb
so many steps even with such knees.

329
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,458
Anyone else in my place
wouldn't even be able to move.

330
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,375
If He is so generous,

331
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,291
why don't you ask Him to come down
and visit you instead?

332
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:57,708
You want to test God as well, Master?

333
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,708
He is testing us, isn't He?

334
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,416
Guddu, here, talk to your father.

335
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:07,583
Here.

336
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,666
-Guddu?
-It's Guddu.

337
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,375
Guddu?

338
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,083
-<i>Hello?</i>
-What happened?

339
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,541
<i>Yes, Dad, tell me, </i>
<i>I got a missed call from you. </i>

340
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,750
-Missed call?
-Talk to him.

341
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,416
<i>I'll deposit Rs. 5,000 tomorrow. </i>
<i>I'm hanging up now. </i>

342
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:30,625
What did he say?

343
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,333
Hmm?

344
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,375
What did he say?

345
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,625
Your son will deposit Rs. 5,000 tomorrow.

346
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,166
What will you do with so much money?

347
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,125
Eat your ice cream.
I'll be back.

348
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:23,166
Two... this is interest amount,
Rs. 2,000, that you owe me.

349
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,333
Okay?

350
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:26,833
You can keep Rs. 500.

351
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:30,500
I'm a man of principles.

352
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,541
I had used your room the other day.

353
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:33,875
Rent for that.

354
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,666
What are you glaring at me for?

355
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,500
That's how much I pay at a hotel.

356
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:41,500
Understood?

357
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,916
{\an8}Did you have the ice cream?

358
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,583
{\an8}Good.

359
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,083
Give the car a push, it's stopped.

360
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,458
{\an8}She's my daughter.

361
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,500
Look, she's my daughter.

362
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,833
Do you want me to insult you
in front of her?

363
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,791
Go, give the car a push.

364
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:39,958
{\an8}Go, go, go...

365
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,083
{\an8}Go, go, go...

366
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,791
Go, go, go...

367
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,458
Stop, stop, stop!

368
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,791
What's going on, huh?

369
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,583
I'd prefer it if you stay
out of my personal business.

370
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,416
What happens inside
the house is your business.

371
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:27,125
What happens on the road is ours.

372
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,208
Sir, should we deflate the tires?

373
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,125
We've done enough damage.

374
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,125
"Sufficient to satiate my clan. "

375
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,041
Leave.

376
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:39,833
I'm being polite because
you have your daughter with you.

377
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,083
{\an8}Let's go, <i>Pandit</i>.

378
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,541
Let me know if he bothers you again.

379
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,916
-Okay.
-Okay?

380
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,458
Okay.

381
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,875
How much is this one?

382
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,041
Rs. 550.

383
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:06,208
-This one?
-This one?

384
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,375
It costs Rs. 700.
It contains exotic fruits.

385
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,833
How much for these small ones?

386
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,958
-These?
-70.

387
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,416
Can you write a name on them?

388
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:48,625
Why weren't we blessed
with her as our daughter?

389
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:52,958
You're right.

390
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,083
Things would've been very different
if we had a daughter.

391
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,916
You never celebrated my birthday.

392
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,333
Is it?

393
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:11,250
I didn't know the date
on which you were born.

394
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:15,625
Why not make one up?

395
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,375
Fine.

396
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,166
Let's celebrate Kitty's
and your birthday on the same day.

397
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,125
Happy birthday.

398
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,833
Big Kitty and Small Kitty.

399
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,958
Sir, you had told
me about a property.

400
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:39,916
Yes.

401
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,166
Why don't you show it to me?

402
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,833
Where have you been, sir?

403
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,083
We couldn't reach you
on your phone either.

404
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,250
My battery was dead.

405
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,083
I couldn't have plugged it in my back.

406
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,791
Here, charge it.

407
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,375
Okay.

408
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,166
<i>Dada</i> was here.

409
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,750
He waited for quite some time.

410
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,166
He was asking for you.

411
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,166
He seemed quite angry, sir.

412
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,500
Give me your phone.

413
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,083
Hello, <i>Dada</i>, my phone battery was dead.

414
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,500
<i>You should've charged it at that</i>
<i>whore's place, where you hang out all day. </i>

415
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,041
You can ask Sharma, I was with him,
tallying the accounts.

416
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,375
<i>I'll shove the account</i>
<i>books up your ass. </i>

417
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,083
<i>The inspector came</i>
<i>to my house in the evening</i>

418
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,583
<i>because your phone was switched off. </i>

419
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,458
He's an idiot, <i>Dada</i>.

420
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:28,791
He's a...

421
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,166
<i>He said things he shouldn't</i>
<i>have in front of other people. </i>

422
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,041
<i>What am I even paying you for?</i>

423
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:35,583
<i>He should never come</i>
<i>here again, Pandey. </i>

424
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,708
He won't.

425
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,791
I've found a solution.

426
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,083
I'll let you know once it's done.

427
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,625
Okay? Bye.

428
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,666
You are yet to finish
all the revision questions.

429
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,250
-You should--
-Come in.

430
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:14,375
Of all the lot,
this property belongs to him.

431
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,166
It's going strong since 100 years.

432
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,958
It's a prime property.

433
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,416
That's the bedroom.

434
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,750
It's okay.

435
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,083
Take a look.

436
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:33,166
-Pandey, this is my house--
-Yes, I know.

437
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,375
It will be as good as new
after a fresh coat of paint.

438
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,458
Go outside, I'm coming.

439
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,791
-I'm paying you back. Am I not?
-For how long will you keep paying me?

440
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,666
Why don't you get out
of this mess once and for all?

441
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,708
It will benefit both of us.

442
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,875
I don't have anything
other than this.

443
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,666
I don't have anything
other than this, either.

444
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,541
I'm done, master.

445
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:22,625
-Naina, you leave.
-Hmm.

446
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,166
Naina, hurry up.

447
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,083
Come here.

448
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,416
What is your name?

449
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,208
-Naina.
-Very good.

450
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,208
Here.

451
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,750
Master won't scold you.
Here, take it.

452
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,916
Bye, sir.

453
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,541
Vacate the place.

454
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,000
Vacate the place.

455
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,375
Start packing.

456
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,333
Motherfucker!

457
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,375
KOTWALI LASHKAR POLICE STATION
GWALIOR, MP

458
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,291
Sir, there was a call
from the Commissioner’s office.

459
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,541
What happened?

460
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,291
-Okay.
-Sir, this one too.

461
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:05,708
Sir.

462
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,500
Master!

463
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,000
You've come to file
a complaint against me?

464
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,291
You should have told me.

465
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,833
Make sure you note down
his complaint properly?

466
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,583
Have a seat.

467
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,750
What is it?

468
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:50,583
{\an8}He had come to my place last evening.

469
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,833
{\an8}He will come to your place if you've
taken a loan from him, <i>Pandit</i>.

470
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:57,958
Did he assault you?

471
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,291
{\an8}There is so much crime in the city.

472
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,291
{\an8}Should I handle that or your loan issues?

473
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,250
Here, have some water.

474
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:25,125
{\an8}Look, I'll suggest that
you somehow repay the loan.

475
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,625
He is an asshole.

476
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:12,916
You...

477
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,916
Everything was going smooth, right?

478
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,083
Why did you go to the police?

479
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,666
Stand up.

480
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,291
Get up and get me a glass.

481
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,875
Come on.

482
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,625
Get up and get me a glass.

483
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,125
Sit down!

484
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,125
Look, I can throw you out
whenever I want.

485
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,666
Who will come to save you?

486
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,291
That useless son of yours?

487
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,500
I'm a nice man.

488
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,375
A nice man.

489
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,208
Hey...

490
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,416
Sit over here.

491
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,500
Sit here.

492
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,333
Okay.

493
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,375
The interest....

494
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:33,916
I will forgo four months of interest.

495
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:40,333
And I'll also reduce around
Rs. 1,50,000 from the principal amount.

496
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:50,083
Once I sell the house,
I'll give you a few lakhs as well.

497
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,583
Your wife has gone to the temple, right?

498
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,916
She'll only come back
after the prayers are over?

499
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,791
She will not be back
for another hour or so, right?

500
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:09,875
Yes.

501
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,541
Go get Naina.

502
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:25,291
Tell her family that you're
taking an extra class today, okay?

503
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:27,083
Go.

504
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,791
I won't hurt her.

505
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:34,333
She won't feel any pain.

506
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,000
Go.

507
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,250
Go.

508
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,666
Listen... What is it called...

509
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:08,041
Yes, give me some
snacks before you leave.

510
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,541
Why are you sitting in the dark?

511
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,958
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

512
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,750
Where are you?

513
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,125
Are you sitting here?
Where are you sit--

514
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,666
The situation was such that...

515
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,541
Manju, Manju, Manju...

516
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,791
Calm down, calm down.

517
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,666
Relax, I'll handle everything.

518
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,583
Calm down.
Go inside.

519
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,291
Manju, go inside.

520
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,541
Manju, I said go inside!

521
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,333
Manju, go inside.

522
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:34,750
Come on.

523
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:43,916
Sit down.

524
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,333
Has everyone got their ticket?

525
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,541
Have you taken the ticket?

526
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,708
Mahinder! Mahinder!

527
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,416
Mahinder! Mahinder!

528
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:26,333
Good thing you started a fire.

529
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,541
There are a lot of mosquitoes out here.

530
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:39,916
{\an8}Damn it!

531
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:55,083
{\an8}I refueled it just yesterday.
Bloody thieves stole all of it.

532
00:54:56,041 --> 00:55:01,625
{\an8}TEACHERS COMMITTEE
FOR CHILD EDUCATION

533
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:49,750
Where is Lattu?

534
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:51,833
At home, studying.

535
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:01,416
I want wheat flour, five kilos.

536
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,875
I just installed a new blade,
Master.

537
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,916
I'll grind the grains finely.

538
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,416
You'll be very pleased
with the result.

539
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:11,833
Really?

540
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,750
Do you have...

541
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:26,916
Listen?

542
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:28,291
Yes?

543
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,958
Do you have change for Rs. 2,000?

544
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:32,916
Can you check?

545
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:35,250
I don't, Master.

546
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:40,416
Can you go and get
the change for me, please?

547
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:41,958
I'll go and try.

548
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,291
I couldn't get the change, Master.

549
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,541
Master?

550
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,125
I couldn't get the change.

551
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:27,375
Take the wheat flour.
You can pay me tomorrow.

552
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,291
No.

553
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,916
I don't like to take things on credit.

554
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,166
I'll take it tomorrow.

555
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,083
O Lord, have mercy on all of us.

556
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,166
O Lord Sri Ram...

557
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:17,500
<i>Dalit agitation is picking up pace. </i>

558
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:21,291
<i>There has been a curfew instated</i>
<i>in four sensitive areas of Gwalior. </i>

559
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,208
<i>Yes. There is a curfew</i>
<i>in four sensitive areas of Gwalior. </i>

560
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:28,166
<i>During the total shutdown in India, </i>
<i>the problem... </i>

561
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,041
-Hey!
-<i>I have a correspondent... </i>

562
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,458
<i>reporting live from... </i>

563
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,583
-Passport.
-Passport?

564
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,958
<i>We can see the effects of the shutdown</i>
<i>all across Madhya Pradesh. </i>

565
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,625
Stop watching the news.

566
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:42,125
Why did you turn it off?

567
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:43,750
Here's my breaking news.

568
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,166
My passport!

569
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,833
Here's my visa form.

570
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,666
Lose your life but
never lose your passport.

571
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,083
What should I do?

572
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:53,708
Not much.

573
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,958
Just call Guddu and ask him
how to fill up the form.

574
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:59,291
I don't want to feel embarrassed
in front of foreigners.

575
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:00,916
Come on, call him up.

576
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:02,291
Come on, hurry up.

577
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,083
Sure, take a look.

578
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,875
You must have filled one too.

579
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,708
I have mentioned
Guddu as my reference.

580
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,458
Check if everything is in order.

581
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,916
Buzz off, motherfucker.

582
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:24,583
You broke my heart.

583
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,416
Give me your passport.

584
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,083
Hey! Give it to me.
No.

585
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:31,875
No.
I said no.

586
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,083
"Thanking you, yours faithfully... "

587
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:35,333
"Thanking you. "

588
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:40,875
No one will leave until we are done
with our investigation.

589
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,291
"Sufficient to satiate my clan. "
Got it?

590
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:45,958
Come in, sir.

591
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:48,208
Who are you?

592
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,583
BKB.

593
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:52,833
Full name.

594
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,375
Brijesh Kumar Bittoo.

595
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,000
-Have a seat.
-Work?

596
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,208
Work?

597
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,666
-I run a business.
-Hello.

598
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,791
Business?

599
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:03,958
Of what?

600
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,833
Bra, panties, knickers, vests.

601
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:08,208
It's a big business.

602
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,625
-Of knickers and vests!
-You know Pandey?

603
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:13,458
Yes.

604
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,375
Sir, Pandey is the guy who
visits your place frequently, right?

605
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:18,708
Yes.

606
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,000
Yes.

607
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:22,666
A little.

608
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,250
Did he come here
day before yesterday?

609
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:25,708
The day before yesterday?

610
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,666
I don't know.
I wasn't here.

611
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:30,541
I wasn't here that night.

612
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,041
Where were you?

613
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:36,708
I was partying at Jagdamba Banquet.

614
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,208
You can ask them.

615
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:40,791
Should I give you their number?
You can confirm it.

616
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,333
I can confirm it on my own.

617
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,500
Go.

618
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,958
{\an8}Pandey has been missing
since three days.

619
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,166
{\an8}His phone is switched off.

620
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,666
And we tracked his last visited location
to this place.

621
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:57,958
He used to come here quite often.

622
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,958
When was the last time you met him?

623
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:08,458
He had come here the same night
I had come to lodge a complaint with you.

624
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:10,000
{\an8}Why had he come here?

625
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,416
{\an8}To collect the money.
I had told you that the money...

626
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,875
I paid him all the money,
with interest.

627
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,833
After that?

628
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:21,291
After that?
Oh that way.

629
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,500
After that he had some alcohol...

630
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:27,333
and left.

631
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:31,916
Did he come alone?

632
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,458
Or did he have company?

633
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,625
He had come alone that day.

634
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:37,708
{\an8}What do you mean?

635
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:40,666
He used to come with a woman.

636
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:42,875
{\an8}He used to introduce her
to me by different names,

637
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,541
{\an8}but it used to be
the same woman always.

638
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:57,166
Master, did Pandey talk to someone
on the phone in front of you?

639
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:02,500
Did he fight with someone over the phone?

640
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,375
Did you find anything
strange about Pandey that day?

641
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,500
No.

642
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:11,416
Master, you also read
<i>Manohar Kahaniyaan</i>?

643
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:13,291
I haven't read this one.

644
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:15,416
Can I take it
if you are done reading it?

645
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:20,125
-Won't be able to read it again.
-Who else stays in this house?

646
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:22,916
My better half.

647
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,875
My wife.

648
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,000
Call her.

649
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:30,500
-Okay.
-Sit down.

650
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:32,708
Call out her name.

651
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,833
Manju?

652
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,166
Manju?

653
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:50,625
She doesn't keep well.

654
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,125
Not much.

655
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,458
It's okay.

656
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,625
If you remember anything,

657
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:03,250
come to the police station
and let me know.

658
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,166
Okay.

659
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,458
-Got it?
-Bye.

660
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,333
You shouldn't have looked so scared.

661
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,041
The cops are suspicious now.

662
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:33,791
I could get caught because of you.

663
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,750
It won't happen again.

664
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,541
I won't let it happen.

665
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:16,041
Have you vowed
not to speak to me again?

666
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,208
You won't support me in this?

667
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:29,375
Mr. Shambhunath Mishra?

668
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:45,625
The cops told me
that he was with you that night.

669
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,833
Yes, he was.

670
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:57,666
Mr. Mishra,
I know he's not a nice man.

671
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:03,416
But that doesn't change
the fact that he is Munni's father.

672
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:06,458
She keeps asking me,

673
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,625
"When will Dad come back?"

674
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:11,791
What should I tell her?

675
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,500
I request you,
if you know anything at all...

676
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:24,708
How he behaves with me doesn't matter.

677
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,708
But he is very attached to Munni.

678
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:36,625
Ma'am, I'm approaching
everyone he used to meet.

679
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,166
Do you know anything?

680
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:43,458
Look, we have already
told the cops what we know.

681
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:47,208
We'll update them
if we have any other information.

682
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,583
Let me see you out.

683
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,000
This way, please.

684
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:04,166
We have committed a grave sin.

685
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,125
A grave sin.

686
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,416
A girl has lost her father because of us.

687
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:23,458
We had no right to punish him.

688
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:28,416
We didn't have faith in our God.

689
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,291
We have committed a grave sin.

690
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:37,833
A grave sin.

691
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,500
Hello, Detective Premchand.

692
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:04,875
Over here, please.

693
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:07,125
Where to, huh?

694
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,583
Come here.

695
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,625
Come here, pretty please.
Don't feel shy.

696
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:19,916
Well...

697
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,333
I wanted to meet the SP.

698
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:25,875
Mr. Shakti Singh.

699
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,750
Sitaram Gadariya.

700
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,916
Temporary station in-charge.

701
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,333
I plan to change the country.
"Sufficient to satiate my clan. "

702
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,208
{\an8}Mr. Singh has gone to Bhopal.

703
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,000
He goes there frequently.

704
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:40,250
You won't sit until I ask you to?

705
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,375
Sit down.

706
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,166
Sit.

707
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,500
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

708
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:55,333
Would you like some water?

709
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,541
-No, thank you.
-Fine.

710
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,791
So, do you have

711
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,458
any update on Pandey?

712
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,000
You won't get any update on him.

713
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,833
We won't?

714
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,916
You say it so confidently,
as if you've killed him.

715
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:16,166
Yes, I did.

716
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:19,041
With a knife?

717
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,666
Yes, with a knife.

718
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:25,958
Then you chopped his
body into small pieces?

719
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:28,000
Yes.

720
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,083
Well done.

721
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:32,166
And then you burnt his body?

722
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:35,166
Well done.

723
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,833
July Edition,

724
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:41,291
<i>Manohar Kahaniyaan</i>, Page 23...

725
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:44,541
"Chandan's affair
with his sister-in-law. "

726
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,916
The last line, "Chandan scattered
his brother's ashes in Haridwar. "

727
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,708
"And the police could
never catch them. "

728
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:56,500
I ground them.

729
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:57,875
Ground them?

730
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,583
Well done, boss.

731
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:04,583
That's an excellent twist.

732
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:06,416
"Sufficient to satiate my clan. "

733
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,708
I suggest you start
writing your own stories.

734
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:13,333
Don't bite more than
you can chew, okay?

735
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,958
Master, one guy was sentenced
for a bunch of years

736
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:25,791
for misleading and wasting the time
of some police officer.

737
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:27,375
"Sufficient to satiate my clan. "

738
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:28,833
You should get going, Master.

739
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:31,041
Go read the new edition.

740
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,875
Got it?

741
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:37,916
Otherwise, you'll get arrested
under all the possible sections.

742
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Buzz off now.

743
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,625
I did indeed kill him.

744
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,458
Oh, my God!

745
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:45,791
Hariya?

746
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:46,916
Yes, sir?

747
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,666
Will you respectfully
show Master the door?

748
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,875
No, I'll manage.
I'm going.

749
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,125
No, I'll go on my own.

750
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,541
Hey, why don't you say...

751
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:14,250
you chopped someone up
and then ground him?

752
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:15,625
You bloody...

753
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,291
I went to the police station.

754
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,458
Not because I have committed a sin.

755
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:55,375
I went there because you
think I have committed a sin.

756
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,041
Will you please sit
here for two minutes?

757
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:14,916
"I will forgo interest for a few months. "

758
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:21,458
"I'll also reduce a few lakh rupees
from the principal amount. "

759
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:26,500
"I'll give you a few lakhs
extra for this house as well. "

760
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:33,791
"Your wife's gone to the temple, right?"

761
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:38,250
"She will not be back
for another hour or so. "

762
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,208
"You have to do me a small favor. "

763
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:49,416
"Get Naina here for some time. "

764
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:56,000
"Don't worry. I won't hurt her. "

765
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:58,541
That's disgusting!
Why are you saying such things?

766
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,916
It made you angry, didn't it?

767
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:03,958
It had made me angry as well.

768
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,083
You too would have killed him,

769
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,333
just like I did.

770
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:15,291
I didn't kill him,

771
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:19,333
I slayed him.

772
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:20,625
I slayed a demon.

773
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,166
I don't care
whether anyone likes it or not,

774
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,041
I did what I thought was right.
That's it.

775
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:58,708
Don't drink too much.

776
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,458
I'm going to bed.

777
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:11,500
I did what I thought was right.

778
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,541
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is currently unavailable. </i>

779
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:34,166
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is currently unavailable. </i>

780
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:35,666
Come on, sir.

781
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:36,791
<i
...is currently unavailable. </i>

782
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:40,125
I wouldn't keep calling like this
even if my wife went missing.

783
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,083
You are taking this too seriously.

784
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,583
Have a drink.

785
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:52,500
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is out of coverage area. </i>

786
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:53,500
<i>The number you have called--</i>

787
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:56,125
Was he swallowed by the earth
or eaten up by the sky?

788
01:15:57,291 --> 01:16:00,416
Where did Pandey go, huh?

789
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:04,083
Did someone kill that asshole?

790
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,291
That reminds me, sir,

791
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:10,875
I thrashed my boy
black and blue yesterday.

792
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:14,083
He keeps singing the same
song day in and day out.

793
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:17,500
"My time will come. "

794
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,666
He doesn't study.

795
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:26,416
And yes, that reminds me,
Master had come over.

796
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,041
You know what he said?

797
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:30,500
He said that he killed Pandey.

798
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:34,375
Chopped him up, burnt his body
and then ground his bones.

799
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:40,166
I scolded him and asked him
to leave before I actually arrest him.

800
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:44,333
He was telling me a made-up story....
straight out of <i>Manohar Kahaniyaan</i>.

801
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,416
What's wrong?

802
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,958
He was telling the truth.

803
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:57,000
You better ask him to come to the
police station and record his statement.

804
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,791
"My time will come. "

805
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,416
I wonder when his time will come.

806
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,583
Yes?

807
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:17,625
Sign here.

808
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:19,375
What is this?

809
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:20,375
Statement.

810
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,041
Whose?

811
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:25,916
It just states what you
had told Sitaram the other day.

812
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:29,041
I didn't tell him anything.

813
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,208
He is the one who
made it up and wrote it.

814
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:42,041
I had come to give him the copy
of <i>Manohar Kahaniyaan's</i> yearly edition.

815
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:43,958
{\an8}Tell him.

816
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:48,000
{\an8}Sign it.

817
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,666
What is the official term for it?

818
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:56,333
The evidence list?

819
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,375
{\an8}Did you find the dead body?

820
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:01,791
{\an8}Did you find any murder weapon?

821
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:05,541
Or my fingerprints anywhere?

822
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,500
{\an8}Mr. Singh,
Pandey is an acquaintance.

823
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:19,500
{\an8}Do let me know... if you
get any information about him.

824
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:26,583
{\an8}SHAKTI SINGH
POLICE STATION IN-CHARGE

825
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:38,750
Asshole.

826
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:44,083
<i>Manohar Kahaniyaan, </i> motherfucker!

827
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,041
{\an8}Hurry up or the officer will leave.

828
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:51,958
{\an8}Hello?

829
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:53,750
{\an8}<i>Mr. Shambhunath Mishra?</i>

830
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,375
{\an8}Yes?

831
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,500
{\an8}<i>I want you to reach home in 20 minutes. </i>

832
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,250
{\an8}<i>I'm waiting for you downstairs. </i>

833
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,666
{\an8}Who is this?

834
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,333
{\an8}<i>That doesn't matter. </i>

835
01:19:02,416 --> 01:19:04,750
{\an8}<i>Do as you are told. </i>
<i>Be there. </i>

836
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,208
{\an8}-Hello?
-<i>Stop saying hello and get here. </i>

837
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,875
{\an8}-Hello?
-<i>Hurry up or I'll go upstairs. </i>

838
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:11,750
{\an8}Who is this?

839
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:29,125
I have gone through the books.

840
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,500
Hurry up.

841
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,583
-People haven't paid interest--
-Come on.

842
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,625
Some haven't paid the principal amount.

843
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,250
He had taken Rs. 5 lakh
for a loading depot 1.5 years ago.

844
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:38,583
He has repaid half of it.

845
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,375
But he hasn't paid interest
in four months.

846
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:41,458
What do we do with him, <i>Dada</i>?

847
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,750
If he doesn't pay the interest
in a week, shut his depot.

848
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:44,791
Okay, <i>Dada</i>.

849
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:45,833
Get going.

850
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:48,375
<i>Dada</i>, he is from Lashkar...

851
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,166
<i>Dada</i>, he is Mr. Mishra from Dana Oli.

852
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:54,916
Hello.

853
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,333
Pandey was personally
handling his account.

854
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,250
This is Mr. Sharma.

855
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,666
Yes, I know him.

856
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,666
Hi.

857
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,958
-I know him.
-He has repaid your loan in full.

858
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,083
But Pandey...

859
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,750
Pandey works for me.

860
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:22,083
Pandey never told me.

861
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:25,875
He was hired so that people
don't get to know that I'm involved.

862
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:29,750
You see,
people are quite scared of me.

863
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:36,041
But I have repaid
the loan in full to Pandey.

864
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:40,541
Pandey has gone missing.

865
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:42,708
Why don't you do something?

866
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:43,958
You find Pandey for me.

867
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,083
I'll get my money
and you'll get your house.

868
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,000
You have three days.

869
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:52,458
But... the whole family stays there.

870
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,333
-How can I--
-Who's next?

871
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,333
He's from Murar.

872
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:57,875
-Kashi...
-But...

873
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:59,041
Buzz off!

874
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:06,083
<i>Dada</i>, he owns Laxman Traders,
he had borrowed Rs. 10 lakh.

875
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:07,000
He owes...

876
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:09,125
Close all the pending accounts
of Pandey's at the earliest.

877
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:10,250
Okay, <i>Dada</i>.

878
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:38,083
Don't look so surprised.

879
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,583
You know why I'm here.

880
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:44,750
Though Master had confessed to Sitaram,

881
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,583
he later went back on his word.

882
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,833
He is trapped now.

883
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:52,625
He will get caught sooner or later.

884
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,875
You should tell him to cooperate with me.

885
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,791
I'm sure he listens to you.

886
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,750
Look, I understand your problem.

887
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:07,833
But Master...

888
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,833
Why are you troubling such a nice man?

889
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,250
Don't you have any shame?

890
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,875
I've known him for 40 years.

891
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:21,583
He has never done anything wrong.

892
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:24,625
Not now, not ever.

893
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:49,458
Are you alright?

894
01:22:57,666 --> 01:23:02,291
Well, that Inspector
approached me at the temple.

895
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,291
He tried to corner me
but I didn't get scared.

896
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,791
Don't worry.

897
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,791
Pandey used to work
for a guy called Rathore.

898
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,750
I met him today.

899
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:28,833
He said I'll have
to vacate the house,

900
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,833
if I don't give him
the money within three days.

901
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:34,000
How much do we owe him?

902
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:35,416
{\an8}<i>Rs. 10 lakh?</i>

903
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:38,916
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

904
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,750
{\an8}<i>From where will I get</i>
<i>that kind of money, Mom?</i>

905
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:48,625
{\an8}<i>I told you, </i>
<i>we just bought a house here. </i>

906
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:54,333
Son, we'll lose our home if your father
doesn't pay him the money in three days.

907
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:57,000
You guys will never stop asking,
will you?

908
01:23:57,541 --> 01:24:00,500
You need something every day.
A new excuse every time.

909
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:02,750
<i>Joint pain, house... </i>
<i>What is going on?</i>

910
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:04,291
<i>Would you like to talk to Erica?</i>

911
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:05,875
Erica?

912
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:07,833
<i>Erica?</i>

913
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,000
How much do we owe you?

914
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:23,000
Total 320.

915
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:26,083
{\an8}Pay him.

916
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,791
{\an8}And ask him to close our account.

917
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:39,041
{\an8}We won't be coming back.

918
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:52,833
You can stop here.

919
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:55,708
Wait, wait, wait.

920
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:00,833
Come.

921
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,958
Be careful, be careful.

922
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,708
I'm fine.

923
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,583
Forty.

924
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:22,958
Hello, sir.

925
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,208
For how long have
you known Mr. Mishra?

926
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:29,125
From the time I came from Morena.

927
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,166
I usually do my business in this area.

928
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:32,708
So I know him since then.

929
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:39,000
Did you take Mr. Mishra and his wife
somewhere, say about a week back?

930
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:43,583
Yes, sir. But only Mr. Mishra.

931
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:46,291
Where did he go?

932
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:49,000
I don't know, sir.

933
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:51,166
I had dropped him at the bus stand.

934
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,375
Do you know Pandey?

935
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,375
Which Pandey, sir?

936
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,541
Prajapati Pandey?

937
01:25:58,666 --> 01:25:59,666
No.

938
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:02,375
Okay, tell me everything
that happened that night.

939
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:07,708
Master, where are you
going so late in the night?

940
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:09,666
Shush.

941
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,083
Let's go.
Take me to the bus stand.

942
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,500
I'll take sixty bucks.

943
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,541
-Including the luggage charges.
-Okay.

944
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:18,875
<i>He behaved strangely. </i>

945
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,083
<i>How so?</i>

946
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,166
That was the first time
he paid me what I had asked for.

947
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:24,875
What happened after that?

948
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:26,208
After that?

949
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,875
<i>He had two sacks with him. </i>

950
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,833
<i>He loaded them</i>
<i>on the rickshaw and then we left. </i>

951
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,083
<i>What was in those sacks?</i>

952
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:33,791
<i>I don't know, sir. </i>

953
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:36,791
But I felt like I was carrying
two people including Mr. Mishra.

954
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:38,041
How do you know?

955
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:41,708
Sir, I have been pedaling
rickshaws for 15 years.

956
01:26:42,916 --> 01:26:46,833
I just know how much
weight I'm pulling.

957
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,208
Anything else?

958
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:50,791
Yes, sir.

959
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:53,208
He stopped at an ATM.

960
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:54,833
<i>Which ATM?</i>

961
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:59,125
The ATM before the bus stop.

962
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:00,833
He stopped there.

963
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:04,666
{\an8}Sir, I have heard about people
getting rid of a body in suitcases.

964
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:06,416
"Sufficient to satiate my clan. "

965
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:09,375
This is the first time I'm seeing
someone hiding it in a sack.

966
01:27:09,666 --> 01:27:12,625
I mean, we won't get
anything from this footage.

967
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:13,791
We will.

968
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:17,000
First we will get <i>Pandit</i> remanded.

969
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:21,666
Then we will get his confession.

970
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:25,916
Don't include
this in the evidence list.

971
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,958
Huh?

972
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,500
Yes, of course.

973
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:53,875
Yesterday, I saw your
footage from the ATM.

974
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,708
You were looking good.

975
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,541
Let me come to the point.

976
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:03,333
Where is Pandey's phone?

977
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:07,875
I have no information
about Pandey, or his phone.

978
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:13,583
Look, I have come here in civil clothes.

979
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,250
I won't beat around the bush.

980
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,833
I don't care if you killed Pandey,

981
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:24,333
chopped him up into pieces,

982
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:29,916
or put him in a sack and buried him.

983
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:36,083
If you know where Pandey's phone is,

984
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,458
if you have it,
then please give it to me.

985
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:41,833
Mr. Singh, like I told you earlier,

986
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:45,583
I have no information
about Pandey or his phone.

987
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:55,750
Look, I have enough evidence
to keep you in remand for seven days.

988
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,166
And even the mute
start talking there.

989
01:29:00,625 --> 01:29:03,166
Let's end this episode right here.

990
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,833
Just give me his phone.

991
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:10,583
I know nothing about it.

992
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,666
Let's meet tomorrow.

993
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:20,333
When I'm in my uniform.

994
01:29:43,875 --> 01:29:44,916
Coming.

995
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:46,583
What did the Inspector say?

996
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,666
-What did the Inspector say?
-Have you seen a mobile phone?

997
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:51,708
Didn't you take it with you?

998
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:54,333
Where did you keep it?

999
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,208
Why are you looking for it over there?

1000
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:00,791
Didn't you take it with you?

1001
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,125
At least tell me what you are looking for.

1002
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,375
Mobile...

1003
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:10,166
Why are you looking for it over there?

1004
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:11,750
It's not here either.

1005
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,333
Mobile...

1006
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,666
Come on, tell me.

1007
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:32,750
Hey...

1008
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,916
What are you looking for?

1009
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,291
I might know where it is.

1010
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,333
You should first check your
pockets for your mobile phone.

1011
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:49,250
Mobile...

1012
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:17,625
Whose mobile phone is that?

1013
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:19,791
How did it come here?

1014
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:24,333
Tell me, whose is it?

1015
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,750
Where are you going?

1016
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:31,833
Lock the door.

1017
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:33,291
-But where are you going?
-Lock the door.

1018
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:34,666
Tell me, where are you...

1019
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:41,833
<i>During the program... </i>

1020
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:43,291
Do you have its charger?

1021
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:46,500
Yes.

1022
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,125
Check it.

1023
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,166
It's connected.

1024
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,583
-Okay.
-Uncle, it costs 100 bucks.

1025
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:24,500
Oh, yes.

1026
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:30,916
Okay.

1027
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:45,500
Throw everything out.

1028
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:49,375
Hurry up.

1029
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:51,000
Okay.

1030
01:32:55,041 --> 01:32:56,208
Throw everything out.

1031
01:32:58,875 --> 01:32:59,958
Throw everything out.

1032
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:01,458
Move aside.

1033
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:02,625
Who is doing this?

1034
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,000
What are you doing?

1035
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:08,375
What are you guys doing?

1036
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,666
Manju!

1037
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:13,791
You... !

1038
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:16,000
What are you doing!

1039
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:17,166
Come on!

1040
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,833
{\an8}Come on!

1041
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:30,666
Master!

1042
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:32,458
{\an8}Throwing my things out, huh?

1043
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:33,750
Come on!

1044
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:36,875
Come on!

1045
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,375
Let him go.

1046
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,541
-Let him go.
-Buzz off.

1047
01:34:01,666 --> 01:34:03,041
Leave her alone.

1048
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,916
She will get hurt.

1049
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,500
Let me go.

1050
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:15,833
We'll pay you back.

1051
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:17,875
We'll vacate the house.

1052
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,333
We'll pay you back.

1053
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,291
Manju...

1054
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:25,125
-Raghu, get everyone with you.
-Manju...

1055
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,125
Hurry up.

1056
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:28,166
Manju...

1057
01:34:28,291 --> 01:34:29,250
Manju...

1058
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Manju...

1059
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:43,708
Everything will be fine.

1060
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,916
Everything will be fine.

1061
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,041
Everything will be fine.

1062
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:07,625
Where is it?

1063
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:10,125
-Guddu's number...
-What are you looking for?

1064
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:11,875
I'm looking for Guddu's number.
Where is it?

1065
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:13,375
I deleted it.

1066
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,375
-You deleted it?
-Yes.

1067
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:18,250
Don't call him even when I die.

1068
01:35:18,916 --> 01:35:20,500
The Science Teacher has a nephew,
he can...

1069
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:22,208
You will be fine.

1070
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:24,875
Just keep quiet and rest.
Your blood pressure is quite high.

1071
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,666
Looks like you have a death wish.

1072
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,333
I'm feeling itchy.

1073
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,458
Where?

1074
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:31,041
Here.

1075
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:38,875
Give us a minute.

1076
01:35:52,916 --> 01:35:54,041
Go.

1077
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,666
So Master,

1078
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,208
your life seems to be more
exciting than mine these days.

1079
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,708
What I was going to do
to you in the lockup,

1080
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,250
you've gotten it done to yourself.

1081
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:12,875
I had given you
a chance to save your skin.

1082
01:36:15,916 --> 01:36:21,791
Not me, you were giving yourself
a chance... to save your skin.

1083
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:31,250
I didn't know anything
about this phone.

1084
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,375
I found it yesterday.

1085
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:41,541
I had once slapped a kid in school.

1086
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,958
And I couldn't sleep
for a couple of nights.

1087
01:36:49,333 --> 01:36:55,333
I plunged a screwdriver
straight through Pandey's throat.

1088
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:04,916
I didn't even flinch.

1089
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:18,791
Naina just turned 12.

1090
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:27,375
How can anyone have such
disgusting thoughts about her?

1091
01:37:30,166 --> 01:37:32,625
She is just a 12-year-old kid.

1092
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:36,958
I won't hesitate to kill again
if someone has such thoughts about her.

1093
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,875
I won't hesitate to kill again.
I'll end his story.

1094
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:45,166
I had come to your office to confess.

1095
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,791
I have done what I had to.

1096
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:56,041
Now you decide what you wish to do.

1097
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:01,958
Son?

1098
01:38:07,916 --> 01:38:10,250
I have been with him for 40 years now.

1099
01:38:10,791 --> 01:38:12,833
I have never stayed away from him,
even for a day.

1100
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:16,208
If he goes to prison
then I too shall go with him.

1101
01:38:20,291 --> 01:38:21,583
You want more evidence?

1102
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:27,875
I'll tell you something
no one else knows.

1103
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:57,291
I've said it before
and I'm going to say it again,

1104
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,666
hotels are much safer.

1105
01:39:02,291 --> 01:39:04,916
You address me as your
sister-in-law in his presence.

1106
01:39:05,291 --> 01:39:07,958
You can always come over to ensure
your sister-in-law's well-being.

1107
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:12,916
I am, and I always will be
concerned about your well-being.

1108
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:16,750
I'm just worry about what the MLA would
do to my well-being if he finds me here.

1109
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:20,291
He always calls me
before he leaves Delhi.

1110
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:22,583
He is staying in Delhi until the 14th.

1111
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,583
Then it's all good.

1112
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:29,333
I want him to win
the next election as well.

1113
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:32,125
Great performance, I must say.

1114
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:43,125
The MLA loves such videos.

1115
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,125
Should I forward it to him?

1116
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:58,125
I know it is a good deed
to please someone.

1117
01:39:59,916 --> 01:40:01,750
You continue doing your good deeds,

1118
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:07,375
and stop bothering about my misdeeds.

1119
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,041
Master!

1120
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:39,625
SP!

1121
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:40,791
-<i>Dada</i>!
-SP!

1122
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:42,166
Let <i>Dada</i> go!

1123
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:43,666
-Come on!
-Call the SP!

1124
01:41:43,791 --> 01:41:44,666
-<i>Dada</i>?
-Hold this.

1125
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:46,250
-Give me a second.
-<i>Dada</i>!

1126
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:47,208
How dare you!

1127
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:48,250
This is not right!

1128
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:49,291
-Come on!
-Inspector!

1129
01:41:49,416 --> 01:41:50,916
Why are you taking him with you?

1130
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:53,250
Wait a minute!

1131
01:41:53,375 --> 01:41:55,375
-Don't force me to use the baton.
-<i>Dada!</i>

1132
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,583
<i>Dada!</i>

1133
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:01,458
This is not right, Shakti Singh.

1134
01:42:01,791 --> 01:42:02,791
This is not right.

1135
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:04,333
I know this is not right.

1136
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:06,083
I never do the right thing.

1137
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:10,625
Get in.

1138
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:19,583
You won't be able to keep me
in here for more than two days.

1139
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:21,416
Not more than two days.

1140
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,875
"Not more than two days. "

1141
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:25,458
Write the report.

1142
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:26,666
Yes, sir.

1143
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,541
We had received a tip off.

1144
01:42:32,416 --> 01:42:35,416
We searched Rathore's house.

1145
01:42:40,375 --> 01:42:45,583
We found Prajapati Pandey's
clothes and the murder weapon.

1146
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:48,833
Make sure to highlight these points.

1147
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:53,166
Thinks he'll be out in two days.

1148
01:42:56,208 --> 01:42:57,250
When did the robbery take place?

1149
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:58,750
-Around two o'clock.
-Okay.

1150
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:03,875
-During the day or at night?
-At night.

1151
01:43:05,791 --> 01:43:06,958
What was stolen?

1152
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:08,833
Everything that was in the shop, sir.

1153
01:43:10,958 --> 01:43:12,166
Mr. Gadariya?

1154
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,291
Huh?

1155
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:14,875
Shambhunath Mishra.

1156
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:20,958
New edition.

1157
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:24,541
"A dacoit in police uniform. "

1158
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:27,208
"Sufficient to satiate my clan. "
This is awesome.

1159
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:30,208
Only a scholar can teach another, Master.

1160
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,750
You should read it.
The story's on Page 28.

1161
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:35,791
"A dacoit in police uniform. "

1162
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:38,125
Forget the dacoit.

1163
01:43:43,125 --> 01:43:44,125
Hello.

1164
01:43:45,083 --> 01:43:46,458
Shambhunath Mishra.

1165
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:49,958
Here's what I owe you.

1166
01:43:55,583 --> 01:43:57,458
You were charging me
interest upon interest.

1167
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:00,833
Here's Rs. 10,000.

1168
01:44:02,041 --> 01:44:03,833
I cannot give it to you here.

1169
01:44:06,208 --> 01:44:07,625
I'll make sure your family gets it.

1170
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:10,416
Are you crazy?

1171
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:22,750
By the way...

1172
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:27,166
I'm the one who killed him.

1173
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,958
I had chopped him up into pieces.

1174
01:44:36,125 --> 01:44:38,625
Master, you motherfucker!

1175
01:44:38,791 --> 01:44:40,333
Hey, he's the one who killed Pandey!

1176
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:26,291
It's this way, right?

1177
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:27,875
-Is it that one?
-Yes.

1178
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,416
It's still not ready?

1179
01:45:33,791 --> 01:45:35,666
Yes, it's still under construction.

1180
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,333
Ganshu?

1181
01:45:44,833 --> 01:45:46,291
Naina?

1182
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,666
Master?

1183
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:51,541
Bless you.

1184
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,625
Where are you going, Granny?

1185
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,541
We are leaving.

1186
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:00,875
From now onwards...

1187
01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:01,958
This...

1188
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:03,541
This...

1189
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:04,750
Come on, tell them.

1190
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:07,500
From now onwards,
this house belongs to Naina.

1191
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:14,041
Please don't forget to water
my Holy Basil plant, okay?

1192
01:46:14,291 --> 01:46:15,791
Take care of it.
