1
00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:02,029
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:05,032
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:08,069
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:11,072
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:14,675
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,577
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:19,947
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,250
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:26,153
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:28,422
Previously, on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:29,957
Is this why you came to Central City?

12
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,525
This nonsense.

13
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:32,827
I don't actually
have to explain myself to you.

14
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:34,362
This is illegal. I'm a cop.

15
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,130
The detective who didn't know he had a son.

16
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:37,598
I saw Mom today.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,300
She says you haven't been by in a while.

18
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:40,434
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

19
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:41,736
I have every right to be angry.

20
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:43,704
- I'm leaving Central City.
- What?

21
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:45,740
I was accepted into
the Forensic Science program

22
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:47,008
at Midway City University.

23
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,743
Got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

24
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:50,878
All we got to do is use him
to figure out how to steal

25
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,080
Zoom's speed, and then
we'll get your daughter back.

26
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:55,049
That might take longer than we thought.

27
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,384
Because Turtle's dead.

28
00:00:56,386 --> 00:00:59,387
Now, decide in return

29
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,489
for your daughter's life.

30
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:04,525
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

31
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:09,497
People think of tar now
as mainly a roofing product.

32
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,700
Fun fact: it's also been used
as medicine and flavoring

33
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:14,402
for candy and liquor.

34
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:16,003
I bet what you're thinking right now

35
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:18,973
isn't "yummy", is it?

36
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,374
What I hope you're thinking is,

37
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:23,277
"Wow, Clay is serious
about wanting to know

38
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:24,879
"where I put that money.

39
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,680
"I think I'll give him
that account number now,

40
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:29,750
"so he doesn't drop me into
this vat of boiling tar."

41
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:31,352
Hmm?

42
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:33,087
I'm sorry, what?

43
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:38,793
Central City Bank account 5463728.

44
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:42,463
Please, please, pull me up now.

45
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:43,497
I'm so sorry!

46
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:46,667
Aah!

47
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:52,206
I thought you said
you weren't gonna kill him.

48
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,741
I say a lot of things.

49
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:57,845
Where's Joey?

50
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,280
Wishing he was somewhere else.

51
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:00,314
Let's go.

52
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,617
Dude, get in the car! Let's go!

53
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:05,352
Drive! Drive!

54

55
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:40,921
There's this song lyric I like.

56
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:43,991
"All the broken hearts
in the world still beat.

57
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:46,827
"Mine's beating, but bruised.

58
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,762
"Hopefully not for long.

59
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,297
"The one thing I do know is:

60
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:53,067
time changes everything."

61
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:55,536
I didn't think about how many

62
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:56,971
crazy things police see.

63
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,405
And can't unsee.

64
00:02:58,407 --> 00:02:59,907
You always wanted to be a cop?

65
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,475
Yeah, my dad was one.

66
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:03,677
He was my hero, so I never thought

67
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,712
of being anything else.

68
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:05,880
What about you?

69
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,482
No, I wanted to be an astronaut.

70
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,017
Wait, that's what Barry wanted to be.

71
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,285
Really?

72
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:12,520
Probably not for the same reasons.

73
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,188
Going to space is like the fastest

74
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,957
a human being can go,
so it was either an astronaut

75
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,326
or, like, have you heard of scramjets?

76
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:21,862
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, they're like

77
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:23,230
supersonic on oxygen, dude.

78
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:24,698
It's nuts.

79
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,500
You're right. Not the same reason as Barry.

80
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,869
You are really all about the speed, huh?

81
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,237
Yeah, I mean, it's what I love.

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,407
Is that why you're still drag racing?

83
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:36,810
You are, aren't you?

84
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,280
Isn't that a little dangerous?

85
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,715
Yeah, for the people that race against me.

86
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,684
Sure is.

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,086
Look, thanks for the hang,

88
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,354
but I got to go.

89
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:49,023
It's early. Don't leave yet.

90
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:51,258
No, I got some stuff to do.

91
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,794
I'll see you later.

92
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:02,102
Why'd you do that?

93
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:04,038
"Thanks for the hang?"

94
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,140
Is he your son or age-inappropriate buddy?

95
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:08,075
Look, I know the dynamic is weird.

96
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:09,877
I'm just trying to figure it out.

97
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,378
From my perspective, it seems like

98
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,813
you're ignoring something that could,

99
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,282
oh, I don't know, get Wally killed.

100
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:17,585
The fact that Wally
even wants to get to know me

101
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,753
is the big win here, so in the future

102
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:21,789
could you try not
chasing him out of the house?

103
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,325
Look, Dad, I'll play along
if that's what you want,

104
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:28,229
but which you exactly are you
trying to let him get to know?

105
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:30,798
Because the person that I saw tonight,

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,934
I don't recognize that dad.

107
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:40,574
Journal entry 1-14: Turtle's brain.

108
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:45,145
So, what I learned
from Turtle's brain matter

109
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:48,282
and the Reverse-Flash, as it turns out,

110
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:49,883
has allowed me to complete a device

111
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:53,954
that when installed inside The Flash's suit,

112
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:57,291
will let me harness his speed,
so that the next time

113
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:01,028
he taps into the Speed Force...

114
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:07,067
I could begin... collection.

115
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:12,373
I wish there were another way,
but there's not.

116
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,674
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

117
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:16,744
You're here late.

118
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:17,745
As are you.

119
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:20,281
Shouldn't you be out...

120
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,049
doing whatever it is that 26-year-olds do

121
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:23,484
on a Thursday night?

122
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:25,085
Um, I am recently single.

123
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,854
- Ah.
- So, I thought I would

124
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:28,555
tackle the breach problem.

125
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,891
See if I could figure out how to close them.

126
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,026
Looks like you had the same idea.

127
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:35,692
Right.

128
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:37,060
I work better alone.

129
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:38,194
Oh, no, haven't you heard the expression

130
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,229
"two heads are better than one"?

131
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:39,963
No.

132
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,239
Must be an Earth-1 thing.

133
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,240
You understand, for me,

134
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,875
that my Earth is Earth-1?

135
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,610
- Yeah.
- Your Earth has yet to create

136
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,546
CFL quark matter, and so
it would take you too long

137
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,548
to catch up on the science haul.

138
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,683
Do it by myself.

139
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,884
This science?

140
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,954
Yes, that science.

141
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,556
Watch this.

142
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,696
That's annoying.

143
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,932
Wow. All right, I'm all caught up

144
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,067
for the next, like,
30 minutes, give or take.

145
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,102
Looks like I missed one though.

146
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,071
All right, you can assist,

147
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,639
but I'm in charge.

148
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,208
Yeah, you're in charge.

149
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,187
Check that ass.

150
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,864
Hey.

151
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,298
What the hell are you doing here

152
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,367
aside from trying to send me to therapy?

153
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,202
I told you, I did some research.

154
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,271
I thought it would be a good idea

155
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,140
for a story for the paper,
plus I thought this would be

156
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,976
a great way for us to really
get to know each other.

157
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,245
I mean, I want to know
what's so great about this

158
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,281
that you can't let go, bro.

159
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,449
No one here is eager

160
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,483
to get their picture in the paper,

161
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,551
you got me?

162
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,819
And which part of the paper?

163
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,420
The front where they put

164
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,890
the mugshots or in the back
in the obituary section?

165
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,124
Yo, why don't you just take a page

166
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,425
out of your dad's book.

167
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,960
Let me do what I'm gonna do, okay?

168
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,328
I don't need a big sister.

169
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,197
I know, you're gonna need an undertaker.

170
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,532
Last race of the night, people.

171
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,335
Our reigning champ: Tail Lights.

172
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,176
Oh.

173
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,978
What?

174
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,713
No good luck?

175
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,305
We'll have the latest on Oliver Queen's

176
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,373
mayoral campaign coming up.

177
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,009
In local news, Roofing Tar Industries,

178
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,111
which was devastated by the S.T.A.R. Labs'

179
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,580
particle accelerator explosion
two years ago,

180
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,950
is finally set to reopen.

181
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:16,227
Guys, clean up before you leave!

182
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,481
Two years!

183
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,150
Two years I was trapped in the ground,

184
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,752
in that blackness.

185
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,287
I couldn't see,

186
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,089
I couldn't feel,

187
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,257
but I could still hate.

188
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,861
Joey?

189
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,363
Did you ever wonder what it felt like

190
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,332
when you dropped me in
that vat of boiling tar?

191
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,468
Since I went in headfirst,

192
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,437
I actually felt my ears and nose burn off.

193
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,140
The pain of my eyeballs
searing was unimaginable,

194
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,010
but it was the way that
it burned down my throat

195
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:09,714
as I tried to breathe that
I thought was really special.

196
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,816
Please.

197
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,686
Why don't I just show you?

198
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,707
Excuse me.

199
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,775
- Barr, you good?
- Hey.

200
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,443
Yeah, yeah, no, it's just, you know,

201
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,951
it's weird Patty's not here.

202
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:29,719
Oh, not for the same reasons,

203
00:09:29,745 --> 00:09:31,111
but I miss Patty too.

204
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,613
What do we got?

205
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,716
Victim's name is Daniel Burge.

206
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:37,685
Not exactly a Boy Scout,

207
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:41,889
but managed to buy
this garage two years ago.

208
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,692
It looks like he was dipped in a volcano.

209
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,727
Oh, yeah.

210
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,929
Actually the depth and uniformity

211
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,898
of the burn pattern
is something you would see

212
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,234
if the body was covered
in something like lava,

213
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:55,769
but with a lower burn temp

214
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:58,038
and an added chemical characteristic.

215
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,275
The fire investigator didn't
find a secondary accelerant.

216
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,477
Yeah, he probably wouldn't with a meta.

217
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,246
All right, I'm gonna take
a sample back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

218
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:07,948
Have Cisco run some tests.

219
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,883
Good, I'm gonna go meet Iris for lunch.

220
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,485
She wants to talk to me about Wally.

221
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,220
Yeah, how's that going, you and him?

222
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:15,556
Great. Well, good.

223
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:17,458
I don't know, baby steps.

224
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,659
I'm trying to give him space.

225
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,728
I mean, he just lost his mom.

226
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,463
Just met me and his sister.

227
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:23,564
He's got a lot on his plate.

228
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,598
Yeah, he just found the best dad

229
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,566
he could've wished for.

230
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:26,867
Oh, you say that now,

231
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:28,235
but you didn't always think that.

232
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:29,703
Well, you were pretty strict.

233
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:31,071
That's for sure.

234
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,639
But strict isn't always a bad thing,

235
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:36,276
especially when you know
it's coming from love.

236
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:38,479
- I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah.

237
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,049
It's disgusting.

238
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:58,499
Okay, now click here.

239
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,168
Bam, that's my app.

240
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,670
See, the app just went live.

241
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,844
So, you can sink up
all social media postings

242
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,079
about meta-human activity.

243
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:13,942
Somebody sees something
cray in Central City,

244
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,143
I get an alert about it.

245
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:16,711
Yo, man,

246
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,346
you have too much time on your hands.

247
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:19,848
Oh, I thought you were
gonna say it was cool.

248
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:29,858
I'm just saying, you can't judge me.

249
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,659
Didn't your girlfriend
just break up with you?

250
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:33,561
- Yeah?
- Pretty sure she just did.

251
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:35,230
Hey, Harry.

252
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:37,932
Wait, so if that app gives you
eyes and ears all over the city,

253
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:40,802
then why don't you use it
to find the next Ms. Right?

254
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:41,936
Did I just make the meta-human Tinder?

255
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:43,138
Mm-hmm.

256
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,439
Nope, not starting that fetish.

257
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:45,807
It's about checking your profile.

258
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,475
This is not a place for that.

259
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,979
Hey, baby.

260
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:52,514
Hey.

261
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,217
You look like you're working hard.

262
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:57,485
I am.

263
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:58,853
I'm researching a story.

264
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:01,890
One that you'll find interesting actually.

265
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,725
Mm.

266
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:07,028
This is Curran Roberts.

267
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,530
After his head went through the windshield

268
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:13,334
of his hot rod, he was
in a coma for six months.

269
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:16,437
This kid, he died.

270
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,373
He wrapped his car around a tree

271
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,508
at 110 miles per hour.

272
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,443
They were all street racers, Dad,

273
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:25,046
and Wally could be the next one.

274
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:27,715
What do you want me to do, Iris,

275
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:28,750
lock him up?

276
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:30,418
Or stop the races.

277
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,953
Look, I learned a long time ago,

278
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:33,988
you can't stop your kids
from being who they are.

279
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,924
Really?

280
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:38,893
Why won't you be his parent, Dad?

281
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,995
What are you so afraid of?

282
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:42,263
All right, you're right.

283
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:43,998
I'm afraid.

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,068
I'm afraid he'll reject me, us.

285
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,803
Like the last time I confronted him

286
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:50,805
about the races, it didn't
go so well, remember?

287
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,540
And I need it to go well with Wally.

288
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,576
I mean, after all these years lost,

289
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:57,912
I want him in our lives,

290
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:02,283
but let me get him to trust me,

291
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:05,887
then I can do something about it.

292
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,455
Okay.

293
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,529
What's the matter?

294
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,998
Um, not... I can't remember,

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,967
is the helicity of a particle left-handed

296
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,236
if its spin and motion
is the same, or opposite?

297
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:22,937
- It's...
- No, hold on, I got it.

298
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,272
Hold on, don't answer that.

299
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,213
Opposite. I knew that.

300
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:33,648
You know that's really annoying?

301
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,316
Uh, it's, you know, just got to...

302
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:36,951
Recharge the old short-term

303
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:39,954
every once in a while.

304
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,525
You know, this feels like old times.

305
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:45,727
Okay.

306
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:47,128
Yeah, I mean, I know, obviously,

307
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,563
this is our first time working together,

308
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:51,399
but I am learning a lot from you.

309
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:53,801
The last Wells was a real mentor.

310
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,571
He believed that I could do anything.

311
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:57,805
Made me believe it.

312
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,340
Okay.

313
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:01,342
He opened up whole new worlds to me.

314
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:03,578
Guess he really was like
another father almost.

315
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:06,948
Stop it, all right? What?

316
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,750
I did not ask for you help, okay?

317
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:10,652
I certainly did not ask to be your mentor.

318
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:11,653
Okay, relax.

319
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:13,021
I was just talking about...

320
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,255
Hey, you know what? I have a kid already.

321
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,690
I don't need another one, so scram.

322
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,825
Let me finish this by myself.

323
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,596
All right.

324
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:34,509
Hey, I ran your crime scene
samples six ways from Sunday.

325
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:35,510
What's wrong with you?

326
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:36,644
I was...

327
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:38,813
Uh, nothing. What's up?

328
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,315
Two things, very strange.

329
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,550
One, definitely meta-human cells in the oil.

330
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:44,585
And two, he didn't die from his burns.

331
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:45,753
It was suffocation.

332
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,555
Suffocation?

333
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:49,791
That makes sense actually.

334
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,993
The burns indicated that the
body was covered in something.

335
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:54,662
Cross-referencing O2 levels
in the organic matter,

336
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,864
I found a direct match to animals trapped

337
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,466
and preserved in an asphalt seep.

338
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:00,001
The guy was fossilized.

339
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,336
Whoa.

340
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,104
So whoever killed him

341
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:05,106
is like a walking...

342
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,341
- Tar pit.
- Tar pit.

343
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:08,042
Mmm, too slow.

344
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:09,310
It's okay.

345
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,245
So, he's basically

346
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:13,614
drowning them in tar.

347
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:15,416
God, that's a horror show.

348
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,385
Why did he target Daniel Burge?

349
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:21,456
Oh, that's my meta-human social media app.

350
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,124
That's right.

351
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:24,392
There's an attack in progress.

352
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:26,561
6th and Bell, downtown.

353
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:57,558
Remember me, Clay?

354
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:00,561
We killed you.

355
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:03,765
I bet right now you're not thinking...

356
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,701
"Yummy."

357
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,070
Yo, are you guys seeing this?

358
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:10,638
Oh, yeah, we see it.

359
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,647
All right, any ideas?

360
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,015
Viscosity of asphalt lowers

361
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:22,183
as its temperature lowers.

362
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:23,384
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it hardens.

363
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,486
Hey, find a way to cool him down.

364
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:33,161
Hey, barbeque!

365
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:34,862
Hit me with your best shot!

366
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:50,478
Oh, yeah!

367
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,047
Team Flash!

368
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,582
Hey, buddy.

369
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:56,017
I've got some questions for you.

370
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,652
Let's go.

371
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:05,393
You're coming home, Jesse.

372
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:06,727
You're coming home.

373
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,848
All right, so Tar Pit...

374
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:13,893
Tar Pit, that's what we're calling him?

375
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,358
- That's right.
- Tar Pit was after

376
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,326
one Clay Stanley.

377
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,594
Stanley, as it turns out,

378
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,666
is a suspected hit man that the CCPD

379
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:21,268
has been trying to track for a while,

380
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,970
but they haven't been able
to make anything stick.

381
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,305
No pun intended.

382
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:27,174
Do we know why he was attacked?

383
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,243
Uh, Stanley wouldn't
answer any of my questions.

384
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,210
He was pretty scared.

385
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:31,311
When a hit man is scared,

386
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,613
you know something's wrong.

387
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,348
Hey, did you get an ID on our meta-human?

388
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,283
Yeah, I'm running it through five different

389
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,018
facial recognition systems right now,

390
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,319
so it should take a minute.

391
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:41,722
And there it is.

392
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,624
Who's the best hacker in the world, people?

393
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,392
- Felicity Smoak.
- Felicity Smoak.

394
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:46,527
What is wrong with you two?

395
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,429
That's not friendship.

396
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:51,231
Our meta-human's name is Joseph Monteleone.

397
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:52,666
Oh, he looks friendly.

398
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:54,968
"Monteleone was reported missing."

399
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,737
Surprise, surprise, the night of the

400
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,205
particle accelerator explosion.

401
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,473
And what's the connection

402
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:01,508
between Monteleone and the two victims?

403
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,876
I'll call Joe.

404
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,545
Have him run background checks
on all three guys.

405
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,680
Okay, I'm gonna run some tests
on the tar samples.

406
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,183
See if I can find his weakness.

407
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,589
Hey, are you feeling okay?

408
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,324
Yeah. Why?

409
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:18,692
You're going slower than normal.

410
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:20,727
You clocked in at 1,450 miles an hour.

411
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:22,362
But, I'm sorry, how fast do I usually run?

412
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,431
1,500. Are you getting enough to eat?

413
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,366
Yes, yeah, dude, I'm fine, seriously.

414
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,068
The difference seems negligible.

415
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,404
Fast is fast, right?

416
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,740
See ya. Yep.

417
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:38,712
Harvick up to fifth place by Edwards.

418
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:39,847
A valiant effort.

419
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,549
Just overtake him, you idiot.

420
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,423
Clark Bronwen?

421
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:51,091
Who's asking?

422
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,501
You're that chick who was
hanging around Tail Lights.

423
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:03,437
I'm a reporter for CCPN.

424
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,472
I want you to stop holding the races.

425
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:08,041
Sweetheart, unless you could find me

426
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,210
another way to make five grand a night,

427
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:12,379
it ain't gonna happen.

428
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:18,185
Here's a preview of
the exposé that I am writing.

429
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:20,554
You are the star of the piece.

430
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:23,257
I had a little chat with some
of your previous associates

431
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:25,492
and dug up some revealing details about you.

432
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:26,894
Like the gambling rings you run

433
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:29,329
or the thefts you've been involved with.

434
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:32,566
I'm sure the CCPD will be
interested in this one.

435
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:36,169
You're forgetting something in here.

436
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:38,438
Aggravated assault.

437
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,040
You think you're the only one

438
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,942
that can play this game?

439
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,810
I could find out where you live,

440
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:46,713
what you eat, when you sleep,

441
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:50,384
every little detail about your life.

442
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:51,785
Hmm?

443
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,987
Publish that trash,

444
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:58,125
we'll see what happens to you, hmm?

445
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,795
This entire conversation

446
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:04,431
is being recorded and sent to CCPN.

447
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,600
If you or any of your people
lay a hand on me,

448
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:10,971
my colleagues will send this
to cops immediately.

449
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:13,240
Get out of my office.

450
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:24,785
You got a death wish?

451
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:25,919
You are not the first person

452
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:28,188
to accuse me of that, so maybe.

453
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,357
Going down there, threatening them?

454
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,392
These people, Iris, they live in the dark.

455
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,461
They're cockroaches,
except they don't scatter

456
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:35,529
when someone turns on the lights.

457
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:36,630
They're looking to bite.

458
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:37,931
If they are so dangerous, Wally,

459
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,167
then why are you in so deep with them?

460
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,702
I'm not.

461
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:42,769
I can stop when I want.

462
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:44,738
So why don't you?

463
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,373
You said that you were only street racing

464
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,675
to earn money for Francine's medical bills.

465
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:50,544
Well, there are no medical bills anymore,

466
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:52,546
so why are you still doing it?

467
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:55,148
Look, I am not going to pretend

468
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,651
that Francine meant to me
what she did to you,

469
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,319
but in the short time that
I got to spend with her,

470
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:01,822
I saw what kind of person she had become.

471
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:04,491
She was smart and kind and loving,

472
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,294
so I can't even imagine
how much you miss her.

473
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:09,930
You don't know what I'm feeling.

474
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:12,733
Well, let me tell you how I feel.

475
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,234
I know that you were trying really hard

476
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:15,936
to convince everyone that you were a badass,

477
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:18,171
but I know that you're a good kid, Wally.

478
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,107
And you didn't get that
way raising yourself.

479
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,209
You had a single mother who cared for you,

480
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,745
so my dad and I care whether
you wrap yourself around a tree

481
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:27,514
or get shot by one of these gangsters.

482
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:29,916
Having someone care about your well-being

483
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,386
cannot be a new sensation for you.

484
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,058
Show up there again,

485
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,961
and I won't be able to protect you.

486
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:53,106
Just going over some research.

487
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,442
Ten-year-old determination.

488
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,811
What?

489
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:01,748
When my daughter was ten she...

490
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,884
Science teacher had her
do a project, you know,

491
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:06,787
and this project...
I spent every waking hour

492
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,525
tinkering and perfecting
her solar-powered oven.

493
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:14,695
Anyway, ten-year-old determination,

494
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:17,264
you remind me of her.

495
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:25,105
Did you scold her as well?

496
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:27,641
- Yes.
- Mm.

497
00:22:28,877 --> 00:22:31,578
Look, I know that this
has been hard for you,

498
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,013
but you're not in it alone.

499
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:34,815
Yes, I am. Hell yes, I am.

500
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:37,951
I... as much as you all want me
to be part of your team,

501
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:39,486
that's never going to happen.

502
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:42,489
I'm always going to be a father first.

503
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:46,660
And one day, Zoom is gonna
make me choose between you

504
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:49,796
and my daughter, and every time,
unblinkingly, unflinchingly,

505
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:51,631
I would choose my daughter.

506
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:54,000
I will betray you.

507
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:55,402
That's binary thinking.

508
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:57,637
It doesn't have to be either-or.

509
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:00,874
Life is either-or...

510
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:05,445
yes/no, black/white, love/hate...

511
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:09,649
from the dawn of time
to this moment right now.

512
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:11,384
I guess I just have more faith in you

513
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:13,120
than you have in yourself,

514
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:17,457
and by the way, I came up with an idea or...

515
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:21,962
a notion rather, on how we could
close the breaches for good.

516
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,103
This is...

517
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:33,140
This... who wrote this?

518
00:23:33,142 --> 00:23:34,574
You did.

519
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:37,577
Yeah, the other you.

520
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:41,148
Evil, not stupid.

521
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,716
I think the answer might be in

522
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:46,453
the electromagnetic insulator
of the quark matter.

523
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:48,188
Like I said,

524
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,590
we are a team.

525
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:55,195
I'm gonna take a look at this.

526
00:23:55,197 --> 00:23:56,496
I'm going to stick around and run some

527
00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:59,666
computer sims on the formula.

528
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:02,202
I'll see you tonight.

529
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:05,372
Yeah, see you later.

530
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,291
Drink up.

531
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,267
Aah.

532
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:39,973
Had enough?

533
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:42,475
Not even close.

534
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:43,577
Give me back my daughter

535
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:45,011
and I'll get you the rest.

536
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:47,047
You're not in the position

537
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:48,982
to negotiate.

538
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:50,517
You won't kill me

539
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,085
and you won't kill my daughter

540
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:54,888
because if you do, then
you won't get what you want.

541
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,258
I don't need to kill your daughter.

542
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:02,229
I can torture her.

543
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:04,231
Bring her right up

544
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:07,100
to the edge of death,

545
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:11,004
so I can do it again the next day

546
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,139
and the next.

547
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:16,977
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

548
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:32,641
Hey.

549
00:25:32,662 --> 00:25:33,495
I ran background checks

550
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:34,959
on everyone involved in this Tar Pit mess,

551
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:35,960
came up empty.

552
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:37,395
I mean, they all have records,

553
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:39,464
but they're sealed, so I can't read them.

554
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:42,600
Well, that's 'cause you're
bound by ethics, Detective West.

555
00:25:42,602 --> 00:25:44,202
How many felonies are we committing

556
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:45,670
breaking into sealed court records?

557
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,438
Eh, three or four.

558
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,773
Nope, five.

559
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:50,275
Well, they were sealed because

560
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:52,177
the records are all juvenile offense.

561
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,211
They weren't arrested together.

562
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:54,746
No, but look at this.

563
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:56,915
They served in the same
juvenile detention facility.

564
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:59,884
Actually, Monteleone
and victim one were bunkmates.

565
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:02,587
Who do we have shacked up with vic two?

566
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:03,821
Bronwen, comma, Clark.

567
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:04,822
Good luck finding him.

568
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:06,191
He has a ton of addresses

569
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:07,992
and I can't seem to find anything current.

570
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:10,128
I'll run his picture
through facial recognition.

571
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,896
That won't be necessary.

572
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,998
In this case, I am facial recognition.

573
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,967
I know exactly where we can find that guy,

574
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,570
and, Dad, you are not gonna like how.

575
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:21,539
Okay, you can tell me about it on the way.

576
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:24,108
What is that?

577
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,810
Breach implosion reactor.

578
00:26:25,812 --> 00:26:27,145
Sorry I asked.

579
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:28,146
You ready?

580
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:29,480
Yeah, let's do it.

581
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:31,416
Have fun fixing the universe, you two.

582
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:32,784
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

583
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:33,952
You seem like you're in pain.

584
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:36,254
What? No, no, I have a...headache.

585
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:39,757
If our calculations are correct...

586
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,226
- And they are.
- And they are.

587
00:26:41,228 --> 00:26:42,794
When this device detonates,

588
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:44,729
it will collapse the event horizon

589
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:47,265
on this side of the breach,
thereby shutting off

590
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,500
any connection to Earth-2 permanently.

591
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:53,137
Are you okay?

592
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:54,305
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

593
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:55,340
I don't feel like myself.

594
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,609
I'm good though.

595
00:26:57,611 --> 00:26:59,077
Yeah.

596
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,180
- It's gonna work, Harry.
- Yep, yep. Okay.

597
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:04,582
You ready? Yeah, give it to me.

598
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:20,131
Come on.

599
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:28,373
We did it!

600
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,507
Come on!

601
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:31,042
You just rewrote the laws of physics!

602
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:33,011
Don't smile or anything.

603
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:34,345
I guess that was pretty cool.

604
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:35,980
Yeah, I'd say so.

605
00:27:35,982 --> 00:27:38,616
One down, 51 to go.

606
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:40,485
Yeah.

607
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:42,253
Allen...

608
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:43,755
Yeah?

609
00:27:43,757 --> 00:27:44,922
Thank you.

610
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:45,923
It's just the first step

611
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,760
in getting your daughter back.

612
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:50,928
Come on!

613
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:02,373
Welcome to the wrong side
of the wrong side of the tracks.

614
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,242
So where's Clark?

615
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:05,910
- That's him.
- Oh.

616
00:28:09,282 --> 00:28:10,882
Come on, man.

617
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:15,353
There's Wally.

618
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:20,858
Now, if our fly flag girl can step up,

619
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,527
we're ready to begin.

620
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:47,685
What the...?

621
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:53,624
- Call Barry.
- Okay.

622
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:56,160
We good?

623
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:57,829
Been a little quiet ever
since we closed the breach.

624
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:59,397
Listen, Allen...

625
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,733
Hey, sorry, it's... real quick.

626
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:05,236
Hey, let me call you back, Iris, I...

627
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:06,404
I got to go.

628
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,811
Iris!

629
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,579
Get her to the hospital!

630
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,675
Hey, baby.

631
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:40,943
Hi.

632
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:42,734
You all right?

633
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:44,626
What happened?

634
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:47,362
Piece of glass from that car
pierced your shoulder.

635
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:48,430
Mm.

636
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,866
But you're gonna be all right.

637
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:52,834
I hate hospitals.

638
00:30:57,775 --> 00:31:00,075
Wally, hi.

639
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:02,944
Hey, can I come in?

640
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:06,214
Uh... I got you some flowers.

641
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:09,885
I don't know what kind
or anything, I just...

642
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:13,555
Or maybe you're allergic...
is she allergic to flowers?

643
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:16,558
No, I'm not, Wally. Thank you.

644
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,760
Cool. Um...

645
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,031
I'll just leave them here.

646
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:34,543
It's okay, Wally.

647
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:39,614
Feel better.

648
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:42,951
I'll be back.

649
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:44,786
Hey, hey, hold up a minute.

650
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:45,787
I got somewhere to be.

651
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,155
Yeah, you do.

652
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,391
At your sister's bedside.

653
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:50,859
Iris came to that race last night

654
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:52,460
because she cares about you.

655
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:53,728
Look, man, this ain't on me.

656
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,063
I didn't tell her to go to that race.

657
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:56,097
Look, I know you didn't.

658
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,098
This ain't a blame thing.

659
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,668
Just hear me out, okay?

660
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:04,439
Look, I know you just lost your mother

661
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:06,641
and you just found us,
it's been like a whirlwind.

662
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:09,744
Now, I... I can't tell you
how to live your life,

663
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:13,048
but I can tell you this: you're not alone.

664
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,452
You have people that sit up
at night worried sick about you,

665
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:20,355
and they're not going to
stop worrying about you.

666
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:23,758
That's what a family does.

667
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,993
They put up with each other

668
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:26,294
and they put each other first,

669
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:28,163
before ourselves.

670
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:30,065
So you're not mad at me?

671
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,633
For being reckless with your life?

672
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:33,702
Yeah, hell yeah, I'm mad at you.

673
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,036
But I'm more mad at myself

674
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,204
for being something I'm not.

675
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,407
I'm not your friend, Wally.

676
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:42,110
I'm your father.

677
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:44,312
I ain't letting you go.

678
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,681
Okay.

679
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:52,020
Oh, it's Barry.

680
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:53,021
Go.

681
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:54,289
I'll stay with her.

682
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,925
You sure?

683
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:59,561
Well, she's my sister, right?

684
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,163
That's my boy.

685
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:08,637
Don't worry, we're gonna get him.

686
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:10,372
I'm sorry, dude. What?

687
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:11,406
Tar Pit.

688
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:12,507
You shouldn't worry.

689
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:14,910
We're gonna get him with these.

690
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,045
With these nitrous grenades.

691
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,480
Each of these has ten times

692
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:20,649
the concentration
of a hot rod's nitrous tank

693
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:22,450
and is triggered by extreme heat.

694
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:24,319
We're talking 650 degrees.

695
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:26,021
That's the boiling point of asphalt,

696
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:29,424
so one of these puppies makes contact,

697
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,960
you got a Tar Pit popsicle for dessert.

698
00:33:31,962 --> 00:33:34,429
All right, that's great. Um...

699
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,898
Hey, look, I think that

700
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,899
maybe you were right.

701
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:40,302
I felt slower tonight.

702
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:41,870
You know, not by much, but enough.

703
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:42,904
Well, do you think there's something wrong

704
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:43,939
with the suit maybe?

705
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,340
It's unlikely.

706
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:47,175
The readings from the suit are normal.

707
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:48,410
You know I take care of that thing.

708
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:50,779
Yeah, what? Am I sick?

709
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:51,780
I don't know, dude.

710
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,548
Feel any different?

711
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,749
No, not really.

712
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:57,085
I mean, I know that I'm slower

713
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:59,955
in the moment, but I can't tell by how much.

714
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,357
2%.

715
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,125
Tests on the components in your blood

716
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,094
show the Speed Force at a 100%

717
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:08,596
for the last 60 days until today,

718
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:10,031
it dropped to 98.

719
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:11,566
Zoom stole Jay's speed.

720
00:34:11,568 --> 00:34:12,901
Do you think maybe,

721
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:14,035
during your fight with Zoom,

722
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:15,036
yours might have diminished?

723
00:34:15,038 --> 00:34:16,504
But that was weeks ago.

724
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,907
Why would I just be feeling
those effects now?

725
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,575
Dr. Wells? Yeah.

726
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:22,911
You've studied the Speed Force
more than anyone.

727
00:34:22,913 --> 00:34:24,713
What do you think could have happened?

728
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:27,349
It could be any number of things.

729
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:29,017
Yeah. All right.

730
00:34:30,253 --> 00:34:31,586
I just looked, I mean,

731
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:34,322
Iris could have died tonight.

732
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,924
She's gonna be okay, Barry.

733
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:36,925
You know, this time,

734
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,460
but the fact is, she is hurt

735
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:39,761
right now because of me.

736
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:41,830
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris

737
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:44,199
just from some meta-human tonight.

738
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:46,501
When Zoom attacks again,

739
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:50,572
I need all of my speed and then some.

740
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:53,174
I can't lose anyone else.

741
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:56,945
You won't.

742
00:34:58,615 --> 00:34:59,714
I did it.

743
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:01,683
What?

744
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:08,223
Whoa, whoa, what is that?

745
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,197
I stole your speed.

746
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,699
I gave it to Zoom.

747
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,634
No, no, no, this isn't...

748
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:21,669
What... you're working with Zoom?

749
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:23,671
No, not at first.

750
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,740
We trusted you. I trusted you!

751
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:29,911
Joe, stop!

752
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,286
Why did you put him in there?

753
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:39,654
Because if I didn't, I would've kill him.

754
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:42,023
Let's go find this tar freak.

755
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:57,172
- Yeah, what the hell, man?
- Shut up.

756
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:58,774
I thought I was being transferred.

757
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:02,077
You're not being transferred.

758
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,679
You're the bait.

759
00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:05,447
What?

760
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:16,158
This is for two years ago, Clay.

761
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:37,746
Stay.

762
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,296
You know, it's ironic.

763
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:55,664
I was just saying

764
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,633
how much you remind me of the old Wells,

765
00:36:57,635 --> 00:36:59,435
and now, here we are,

766
00:36:59,437 --> 00:37:00,702
just like I did with him,

767
00:37:00,704 --> 00:37:02,504
standing on either side of this glass

768
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:05,574
with me asking you, "Why?"

769
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:06,742
I'm doing what I have to do

770
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:07,743
to save my daughter.

771
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:09,445
Yeah, at any cost, right?

772
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:10,546
The cost of Joe's daughter.

773
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:13,148
I told you, "I would betray you."

774
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,218
I told you, "I would have to choose."

775
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,586
You chose wrong.

776
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:19,087
Really, did I?

777
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:21,457
Because I just sacrificed my daughter.

778
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,325
Because I just sentenced
my daughter to death

779
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:24,493
to save your son.

780
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:25,994
You want a pat on the back?

781
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,363
I want you to send me home.

782
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:30,599
Send me back to Earth-2.

783
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:31,867
Think about it.

784
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,903
Zoom wants you to get faster.

785
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:37,272
He wants you to have
more Speed Force in you,

786
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:39,174
for when he finally takes it, send me back,

787
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,643
use the implosion reactor
to shut down the breach.

788
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:43,779
Shut down all the breaches.

789
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:46,415
Close them all

790
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:49,151
and Zoom will never be able to crossover,

791
00:37:49,153 --> 00:37:51,053
ever again,

792
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:52,788
and that'll be the end of it.

793
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,158
What about your daughter?

794
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,794
Jesse's my battle to fight, not yours.

795
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:22,384
Hey, how are you feeling?

796
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:25,387
Like I could use some pizza right now.

797
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:29,124
Well, they're letting you out tomorrow,

798
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:30,792
so I can get you any kind you want

799
00:38:30,794 --> 00:38:31,860
from anywhere you want.

800
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:33,962
Deal.

801
00:38:34,865 --> 00:38:38,200
You know... growing up,

802
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:39,902
we didn't have a lot of money

803
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:44,106
to go to the movies or buy toys.

804
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:45,774
Instead, she would just take me in the car,

805
00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:47,409
we'd would go for these long drives.

806
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:51,446
Just her and I and her music.

807
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:53,515
I remember being on the road with her

808
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:57,986
and just watching the scenery flash by

809
00:38:57,988 --> 00:38:59,421
and feeling so happy.

810
00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:05,527
And now, when I race,

811
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:07,262
feeling that rush of speed

812
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,398
it's like...

813
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,100
It's like I get to back

814
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,602
to those days.

815
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:18,507
I didn't want to stop

816
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:20,976
because if I do...

817
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:31,253
See, that wasn't so hard.

818
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,924
Actually, it was pretty hard.

819
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,296
This is a sample of Barry's cells

820
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,699
after whatever Harry did to them.

821
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:45,067
As you can see, not only is it

822
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:46,234
drained of the Speed Force,

823
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:47,803
but it's also presenting itself

824
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:49,571
as chromosomal damage.

825
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:52,741
If Harry kept doing what he was doing,

826
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:55,677
he could have taken your powers permanently.

827
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,846
Even Evil Wells couldn't
figure out how to do that one.

828
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:59,448
Well, look, somebody better
send his ass back

829
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,016
to where he came from
or I'm gonna shoot him.

830
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,285
- Amen.
- No.

831
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:05,988
What do you mean, no?

832
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,356
What would we have done

833
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:09,591
if we were in his position?

834
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:10,659
I mean, what would you do

835
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,427
if it was Iris, Joe?

836
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:14,997
And Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you,

837
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,231
threatened to kill your brother

838
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,532
unless you helped, you did,

839
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:20,068
and none of us judged you for that.

840
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,671
We still don't because
when it comes to family,

841
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:26,274
when it comes to the people
that we all love,

842
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,643
we're all vulnerable.

843
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:30,846
None of us are above
making a wrong decision.

844
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:31,913
He could have done it.

845
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:32,914
He could have stolen my speed,

846
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:33,982
gotten away with it.

847
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,617
None of us would have even known,

848
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:38,520
but he didn't, and now
his daughter's gonna die

849
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,188
and we're okay with that?

850
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,190
I can't just give up on her.

851
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,127
I can't give on a world.

852
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,029
This is a world full of people

853
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:49,464
who are facing death.

854
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:51,466
I don't know, I may not be fast enough

855
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:55,437
to beat Zoom yet, but I'm not gonna just

856
00:40:55,439 --> 00:41:00,308
close the breaches and forget about it.

857
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,512
We have to help Wells.

858
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,581
Look, guys, I...

859
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:09,518
I was the one that trusted him first.

860
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,519
I own that.

861
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:11,853
I let him stay

862
00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:14,189
when literally all of you told me not to,

863
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:15,257
so everything that's happened

864
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:16,625
up until this point, it's on me,

865
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:19,094
but this has to be a group decision.

866
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:27,035
Come on.

867
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:37,245
Well...

868
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,283
I guess this is good-bye.

869
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:44,219
No, it's not.

870
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:46,388
I told you, we're a team.

871
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,124
Now you're a part of it.

872
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,459
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

873
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:53,228
We're not sending you through alone.

874
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,263
We're going to Earth-2.

875
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,141
