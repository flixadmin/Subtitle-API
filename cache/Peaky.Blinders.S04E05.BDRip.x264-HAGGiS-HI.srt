You're drunk. Again.

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,196
I'm drunk again.

170

Tell me what you said to me
this morning.

173
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,550
Tell me... Tell me again.

174
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,394
Tell me.

175
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,434
Say it, say it, say it. Tell me.

176
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,829
We'll be back in our garden

177
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,152
before the time comes to plant
anything out.

178
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,393

No fucking way.

185

You've never eaten hedgehog, Michael?

186
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,913
I'm getting back in this car.

187
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,357
Michael, you're number two
on Luca Changretta's hit list.

188
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,193
Yeah, and I'll stay in a hotel.

189
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,318
If you stay in a hotel,
I'll know where you are.

190
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,914
So will the people who take you there.

191
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,912
So will the people
who work in the hotel.

192
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,316
And hotels don't move around.

193
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,391
They don't even know
where they'll be tomorrow.

194

They follow the patron and the crows.

195

And if anyone
should come for you, Michael,

196
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,199
the Palmers and the Boswells
will put up a fair fight.

Show some respect, Mr Gray.

202
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,231
They've agreed to welcome you
on account of your blood.

205
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,359
I won't be able to contact you,

206
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,360
till you phone me.

207
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,120
We'll make a plan.

208
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,278
Tommy says it won't be long.

209
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,274
Then we'll be free.

210

213

You're royalty up there, Michael.

Is that true, Mrs Gray?

215

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,159
Don't I look like royalty?

217
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,118
Well, now that you mention it, you do.

he used to take us out.

Yes.

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,633
Your wife's often around you.

She watches you.

when I put my head in a noose.

a window and seeing the whole world.

Tommy Shelby alive all these years.

250
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,792
How we've kept each other alive...

251
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,315
That I didn't just put my head
through that window.

252
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,159
I climbed through it.

253
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,794
First, I thought it was madness,
but, no.

254
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,191

out of that window,

Let me make one thing clear, Mr Gold.

267
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,554
I just gave Michael a little speech

268
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,836
about how no one would know
where to find him.

269
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,753
But you'd know how to get him.

If any harm comes to Michael,

271
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,117
you shall have me as your enemy.

272
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,234
And none of your knives can kill me.

273
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000

going to stop a revolution?

my invitation to dinner.

(SCOFFS) Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

491

Tommy Shelby is gonna stop
the revolution with his cock.

492
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,717
It's not her
the military are interested in.

493
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,280
It's the people around her.

494

The people like you used to be.
Like Freddie used to be.

of the instigators,

498

500
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,551

501
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,599
at the bottom of the Saltley Canal
want to help the British military?

Tommy, this can only happen
if you're still alive.

510
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,352
I'm planning on staying alive.

- No, we weren't.

All right, well, since I invited you

These two beauties
were shot this morning

545
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,273

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,717
at Lord Packwood's estate.

I thought you'd like that. These here,

these were stolen from under his trees.

Mr Shelby, I came to talk business.

00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,755
Yes.

551
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,913
So did I.

552
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,712
Wage cuts withdrawn, parity between
men and women guaranteed.

You can instruct your members
to return to work tomorrow.

00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,394
And all I have to do in return

555
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,597
is tell you everything I know
about socialism.

556

That's what your sister said.

It's okay.

What do you want to know
about the cause?

561
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,239
I'm approaching
the current political crisis

562
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,354
as I would approach a horse race.

563

Assessing the runners and the riders.

564
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,672
Now the favourite is,
of course, the King's horse,

565
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,752
but the King's horse
was also the favourite in 1913

566
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,594
when Emily Davison
threw herself in front of it.

567
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,717
You know the names of Suffragettes?

568

I'm impressed.

569
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,595
Ah, everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look,

570
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,750
women with serious faces everywhere.

571
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,595
When I study a horse race, I study form,

572
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,314
and on the other horse, the one
that wants to beat the King's horse,

573
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,236
let's call her "Dangerous", shall we?
She's no form.

574
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,230
- That's what makes her so dangerous.
- Russia.

575
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,072
- Isn't that form?
- Ah.

576
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,076
The Russians are not like the English.
We're beer, they're petrol.

577
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,437
So I invited you here for dinner,

578
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,237
because you know people.

579
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,673
People that want to make this fight
real with guns and ammunition.

580
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,680
So before I place a bet
on who's gonna win,

581
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,318
I need to know how strong they are.

582
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,240
How serious they are.

583
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,078
Your concern is
that if the unthinkable happened,

584
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,352
you would find yourself
on the wrong side of the barricades.

585
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,312
Well, as you can see,

586
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,637
my natural side of the barricades,
is the same as yours and, as you know,

587
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,119
I once believed...

588
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,919
But the war changed you?

589
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,595
Yeah.

590
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,510
Man I love couldn't speak
when he got back.

591
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,634
Not one word.

592
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,315

00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,752
- Well, well.
- Yes.
