1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,156
She's dead.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,896
You killed Alexa.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,724
Barry and I did it together.

4
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:11,030
That was the only way.

5
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:13,250
She was the strongest.

6
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:15,034
I needed every ounce of power,

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:16,557
including your
strength, to kill her.

8
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,430
I'm supposed to protect
lives, not destroy them!

9
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,301
I'm helping you clean
up your mess, Barry.

10
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,042
This is your fault.

11
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,374
The night you brought me
back, you created these monsters.

12
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:29,072
You and your lightning rod.

13
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,400
When you regained your speed,

14
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:36,360
I wasn't the only thing you
two willed into existence.

15
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:39,300
- That's impossible.
- Really?

16
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:44,044
Alexa was afraid to come
here, but she trusted you.

17
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:46,872
Why?

18
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,331
Because deep down, she
could feel a connection with you.

19
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:54,073
The same connection
that you feel with me now.

20
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:56,032
But, these new forces?

21
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,686
The way they've merged with
the people they chose as avatars?

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,800
It's corrupted them
because it's unnatural.

23
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,084
But once the other two are gone

24
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,043
I won't help you kill again.

25
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,376
My beautiful boy.

26
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,356
You have no choice.

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,923
Because if you don't,

28
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:22,145
those things will kill everyone
you've sworn to keep safe.

29
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,084
Is that what you want?

30
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:29,804
Then, please, Barry

31
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:31,308
help me.

32
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,594
No.

33
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,075
You have to help me, damn it!

34
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,188
Nora, stop.

35
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:47,257
I will destroy those
other forces, Barry,

36
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:50,477
with or without your help.

37
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,764
Then you'll see that I'm right.

38
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,813
What a day.

39
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,511
First, Frost is sent
to Iron Heights for life,

40
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,948
and now Alexa's dead.

41
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:28,950
I can't let this happen again.

42
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,865
I'll get to work. I
need to figure out

43
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,129
how Nora was able to...

44
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,608
Kill a god?

45
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:36,175
She could because she had help.

46
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,003
Barry, she tricked you.

47
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,265
No, she manipulated me,

48
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,745
just like she's been
doing the whole time.

49
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,922
Honey, I know how you feel, but

50
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,837
not everything she
did and said was a lie.

51
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,665
I mean, there were
moments that felt real too.

52
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:48,666
That must mean

53
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,171
Iris, we can't
trust her anymore.

54
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,847
What about what Nora said

55
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,743
about you two creating
the other forces?

56
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,939
I mean, there's no proof.

57
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:04,421
Well, what if we find out
if Nora's telling the truth?

58
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:06,510
If she is, then that
means the other forces

59
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,425
would have been born
the same day she was.

60
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:09,774
I'll pull satellite scans

61
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,167
from the night we
fought Mirror Monarch.

62
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,628
Please, and thank you.

63
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:19,740
Okay, you see that cluster
of kinetic energy readings?

64
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:22,221
Pretty sure that's
the Speed Force

65
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,528
being reborn in the Speed Lab.

66
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:27,270
Whoa. There they are.

67
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,601
Three brand-spanking-new
isotopic signatures.

68
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:35,147
Nora was right.

69
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,696
We created the forces.

70
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,286
Fuerza's dead.

71
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,070
Nora killed her.

72
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,159
She killed the Strength Force?

73
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:50,684
And now she wants to
kill the other two forces.

74
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,079
Maybe I should go
to San Francisco.

75
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,776
What?

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,126
My series of photos
on Eva's attacks

77
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,867
got accepted at a gallery there.

78
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,173
Babe, congrats!

79
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:03,219
Well, I was thinking of going

80
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,003
to help them
install the exhibition.

81
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:08,572
I'd ask you to come, but I
know you have your perfect job

82
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,922
at S.T.A.R. Labs and
your amazing friends.

83
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:13,731
I mean... you're an OG
member of Team Flash.

84
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:19,060
You okay?

85
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,279
Yeah...

86
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,629
Yeah, I'm fine.

87
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,937
This is an isotopic
scanning lens.

88
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,679
It can detect the
signatures of all four forces,

89
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,551
even kinetic signatures
from Speed Force Nora.

90
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,074
And if one's nearby...

91
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,729
It lights up like an
overexposed landscape.

92
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:38,471
In which case, you
run the other way.

93
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,498
Okay? I'm serious.

94
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,675
I just want you to be safe.

95
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,636
Are you sure you're okay?

96
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,052
It's Barry.

97
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,489
I gotta get backthey
could have found Nora,

98
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,646
or worse, she's come
back on her own.

99
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,322
How bad is it?

100
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,106
Okaydid Nora kill somebody else?

101
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,326
No, and I have a way to
make sure she never does.

102
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,241
Okay, how?

103
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,808
I'm here.

104
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,592
What's going on?

105
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:14,551
I spent all night

106
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,466
coming up with a
way to fix all this.

107
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,033
Okay, what's the solve?

108
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:22,341
We need to wipe the new
forces out of existence.

109
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:23,821
Barry, what are you saying?

110
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:27,414
I want to go back in
time... and uncreate them.

111
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,184
Barry, you're talking about
creating another Flashpoint.

112
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,620
You know we can't do that.

113
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,274
Not if I can figure
out a way to go back

114
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,928
that doesn't
affect the time line.

115
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,843
- Which would be impossible.
- Barry, look.

116
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,541
I know that you're
devastated about Alexa.

117
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:51,457
But uncreating forces?

118
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,893
That crosses a line.

119
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,156
I convinced Alexa to come here.

120
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,115
Her death is my fault.

121
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,596
If we don't get these new
forces out of Psych and Deon,

122
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,294
Nora will kill them, too,
so it's on us to fix this.

123
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:04,818
- By killing Deon and Psych?
- No, I'm not killing them.

124
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:07,386
I'm saving them from the
forces that took over their lives.

125
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,779
Whoever they were
before this, they can

126
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,476
go back to being those
same people again.

127
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,174
And what about the other
force that was born that night?

128
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:15,568
- Nora. If you uncreate her...
- We're only gonna target

129
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,875
the new forces, not
Nora. That's the plan.

130
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,659
But if something goes wrong,

131
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,661
Barry, you might
lose your speed.

132
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,924
Then I lose my speed. All right?

133
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,666
It’s it’s worth the risk
to keep everyone safe.

134
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,625
And what about the risk to Nora?

135
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,540
Does her life not
matter at all any...

136
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:34,152
Nora's not a person, Iris.

137
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,720
She never was.

138
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:39,810
Look, if we uncreate
these forces,

139
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,508
we can put everything
back to normal.

140
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,380
Hopefully that'll fix her too.

141
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,730
Hopefully?

142
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,906
Barry, do you hear
yourself right now?

143
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,257
Iris, I'm trying to save people.

144
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:55,739
How how do you not see
this is the right thing to do?

145
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:57,567
The right thing to do

146
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,743
would be trying to
get through to Nora.

147
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,222
Just like how we beat Eva,

148
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,920
just like how we talked
down Abra Kadabra.

149
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,923
- That is what we do.
- We tried talking to her.

150
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,055
All Nora did was double down.

151
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,797
There's no reaching her.

152
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,930
Obviously we disagree on this.

153
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,976
Yes, we do.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,437
I have to do it.

155
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:25,943
Then you'll be
doing it without me.

156
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:35,779
Wait... you want to go
after a force of nature?

157
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,651
Yeah, if I can convince Nora
not to kill Deon and Psych,

158
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,785
then... Barry will see that
she can be reasoned with.

159
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:43,177
But, how do we find her?

160
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,266
I mean, she's the
freakin' Speed Force.

161
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,529
Well, if she finds us first,

162
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,967
at least we'll
know she's coming.

163
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,820
Holy crap... you
guys gotta see this.

164
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,322
You see that bright
spot at the center of you?

165
00:07:57,346 --> 00:08:00,020
I think that's kinetic energy.

166
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:02,196
Guys, this is gonna
sound really wild, but...

167
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,286
Yeah, 'cause a ghost-hunting
lens isn't weird enough...

168
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,854
But, if Barry and I
created these forces,

169
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,640
what if there's a little bit of
each of them inside of us?

170
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,730
Like you're all connected?

171
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,732
Wait, Iris... when
you're over by the door,

172
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,211
your glow was brighter.

173
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,822
Like there's something
in that direction

174
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,606
that was intensifying it.

175
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,241
- What if...
- That something is Nora?

176
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:28,484
Guys, we can use me as a
divining rod to track her down.

177
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,728
Yup, that's weirder.

178
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,534
Elemental Force Particles?

179
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,797
They're the particles that
created the new forces.

180
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,712
The lightning bolt that
re birthed the Speed Force

181
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,758
- was full of them.
- Now if we can extract

182
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,368
a sample of these
force particles

183
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,674
from the lightning,

184
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,763
then we can send out
an electromagnetic pulse

185
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,678
that'll seek out
those same particles,

186
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,331
wherever they may be
along the temporal spectrum.

187
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:54,118
And you can erase the
new forces from existence.

188
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,076
That's not bad.

189
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,643
Small detail, though.

190
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,863
How in the world
are you supposed to

191
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:03,954
extract these particles
from a giant bolt of lightning?

192
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,739
A few weeks ago when
Barry was Spock-Flash,

193
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:09,133
he modified the Tachyon
Enhancer to siphon.

194
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:11,135
Mirror Monarch's
dark matter photons.

195
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,224
So all we have to do
is tweak the Enhancer

196
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:16,164
to siphon Force Particles
instead of photons.

197
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,273
Tweaking the Tachyon Enhancer,

198
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:22,450
and then send out an
EMP to eighty-six the forces.

199
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:25,565
That's genius. I mean
it's foolproof, even.

200
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,590
But it still doesn't answer
how we're supposed to do this

201
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:34,637
and protect the time line.

202
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,161
I'll figure out.
Somehow, I will.

203
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:38,728
I'll figure it out.

204
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:41,731
Man, I wish Nash Wells was here.

205
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,776
I mean, he came up with
most of these equations

206
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,125
for the A.S.F. Machine.

207
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,457
I feel like he'd crack
this easy peasy.

208
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,044
Modify the Particle
Harness Collector.

209
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,742
I'll be back as soon as I can.

210
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:56,006
Roger that, but
where are you going?

211
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,946
To get the one person
that can help us pull this off.

212
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:08,105
No... Tess.

213
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:10,324
President Bartlett
just mixed up his meds.

214
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:13,501
That's not gonna be
good, but... great TV.

215
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,615
Whoa!

216
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,664
Allen. Allen.

217
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,601
I'm guessing this
isn't a social call?

218
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,691
Not exactly. We need your help.

219
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,431
How bad is it?

220
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,346
- That depends.
- On...

221
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,678
Whether or not you can
help us do the impossible.

222
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,977
Well, well, well.
Honey, I'm home.

223
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:57,787
Holy deus ex machina...
Timeless Wells.

224
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,985
- Perfect timing.
- Always.

225
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,465
So, apparently, there's
danger in Central City.

226
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,816
- Apparently.
- Well, let's get busy.

227
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,252
Well, you really think

228
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,863
we can do this without
affecting the time line?

229
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,517
I know we can.

230
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,562
As long as we use
me as your guide.

231
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,347
Harrison was there when
the forces were created.

232
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,349
So if we used the other
"him" from that night

233
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:19,785
as a beacon to lock onto...

234
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:22,875
Hopefully I can go back
to that exact moment,

235
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:24,747
also bring Allen
along for the ride,

236
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,705
and he'll collect the particles.

237
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,187
Oof, wait, so you can travel
through time with a plus one?

238
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,189
It should work...

239
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,670
When Allen and I go
back to that exact moment

240
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,629
that those dangerous forces
were created 17 days ago,

241
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:41,589
I willl will create a
protective-time bubble

242
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:44,331
from that moment until now,

243
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,725
preserving those
days in this time line,

244
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:51,382
and preventing
anything from changing.

245
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:55,778
Which would also allow us
to wipe out the new forces

246
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,650
without altering
any of the events

247
00:11:58,674 --> 00:11:59,869
that have happened since then...

248
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:03,220
Yo! That is that is trippy.

249
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,961
Cisco, this will work.

250
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,571
What about Iris?

251
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,313
When she sees everyone
safe, she'll come around.

252
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,662
She has to.

253
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,709
You're not convinced.
I wasn't either,

254
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,431
when Allen told me about
this, I thought of Tess.

255
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:21,194
I thought of my wife, and
how my future with Tess was

256
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:23,153
ripped from me.

257
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,850
Until this gift

258
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:30,247
which has allowed me to
relive every single day with Tess,

259
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,076
but only

260
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,449
because I took a chance.

261
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,176
All right.

262
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,289
I'm in.

263
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,905
It's brighter. We
must be getting close.

264
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,800
She should be here.

265
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,653
Maybe it was a false positive.

266
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,937
Maybe since Nora
is the Speed Force,

267
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,504
her isotopic signature is
all over the city by now.

268
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,550
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

269
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,639
But we are running out of time.

270
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,684
Well, Cisco always says
you can't solve a problem

271
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,251
till you're asking
the right question.

272
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,993
Isn't "Where's Nora's
kinetic energy leading us"

273
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,430
the right question?

274
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,867
No.

275
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:27,652
The right question
is "Where's Nora?"

276
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,523
We've been trying to
find the Speed Force

277
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,613
when we should be
looking for... the person.

278
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:36,443
So where would the
real Nora Allen go?

279
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,402
Home.

280
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,906
Come on.

281
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,540
Harness modifications complete.

282
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:49,002
Let's get some time particles.

283
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,590
Actually, you know what? Um...

284
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:55,027
Let me run just
one more diagnostic

285
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,899
on the collection disc.

286
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:00,752
I just need one
more, just one more...

287
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:11,043
Frak.

288
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,350
Yo, yo, Deon.

289
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:14,786
What’s what’s...

290
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,857
- What's good, man?
- You tell me.

291
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,730
Something drew me here.

292
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,187
Was it you?

293
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,666
I’m don't think it was...

294
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,192
Who's this? I'm
sorry, who are you?

295
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,846
Who am I? Who are you?

296
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,325
Who is he?

297
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,588
Look, guys, all's
good in the hood.

298
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,155
All right, look.

299
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,549
Barry, this is Deon.

300
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,465
Still Force.

301
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,206
Andand Deon, this is Barry,

302
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,382
who's actually...

303
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:50,411
Owner of this,
fine establishment.

304
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,564
So you're the landlord.

305
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,306
What's that got to
do with anything?

306
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,395
Deon

307
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,223
it's good to meet you.

308
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,789
Actually, you remember me?

309
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,617
I was with him, you
called us one of the Urkels.

310
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,576
Yeah... the cornballs.

311
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,516
Cornball. He's so funny.

312
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:10,910
Who's the egghead?

313
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,411
Harrison Wells.

314
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,132
I'm a fellow...

315
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,920
Visitor to Barry's place.

316
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:25,901
You know, y'all are being
real friendly right now.

317
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,599
But I think

318
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,253
I think y'all are
acting like that

319
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,627
because you're afraid of me.

320
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,998
- Now why is that?
- No, we're just

321
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:38,478
we're just making awe're
just doing an experiment...

322
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,156
Shut up!

323
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,281
Now

324
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:02,981
why do I get the feeling

325
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,573
you're reason I'm this way?

326
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,294
Because that's true.

327
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,383
And I'm sorry.

328
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,994
I never meant
for this to happen.

329
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:19,258
- So please let me fix it.
- Fix it?

330
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,695
Fix it? So I'm a mistake?

331
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:25,027
- I didn't say that...
- You didn't have to.

332
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:29,510
I can feel it.

333
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:37,494
- You want to destroy me.
- No, I want to save you.

334
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,868
Deon... Deon.

335
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:44,457
There are three other
forces... people like you.

336
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:49,158
One of them? She
wants to kill you.

337
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:52,030
Now, she's already killed
one of the other forces...

338
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,598
The Strength Force,
and she didn't care

339
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:59,385
when the person
containing that force died too.

340
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:04,695
So I need to make it so the
Still Force never found you.

341
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:07,287
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

342
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:14,009
Nah.

343
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
I like being me.

344
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,305
I get it.

345
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,328
- I get it.
- Yeah?

346
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:30,851
No, I get it. I get it.

347
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,679
This is what you're
gonna use to do it?

348
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:33,898
This is what you're gonna use

349
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,073
to make it like I never existed?

350
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,380
Not you, just
the force inside...

351
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,928
Man, I am that force!

352
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,081
Do you have any
idea what it's like

353
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,629
to be told that you
shouldn't be here?

354
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:52,917
I never asked to be born.

355
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,527
Deon, listen to me.

356
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,877
Look at what you're doing.

357
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,358
Okay, you you don't
understand what you are.

358
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:03,125
Yeah, I do.

359
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,888
I'm a god.

360
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:10,413
Maybe it's time
you understood that.

361
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:11,699
Deon, wait...

362
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:19,272
Time to bounce.

363
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,970
Right?

364
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,194
What the hell just happened?

365
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,742
I think your friend
Deon just stopped time.

366
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,614
Yeah, he does that.

367
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:40,051
Why'd he leave?

368
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,382
Because I couldn't stop him.

369
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,670
Deon just aged the
harness a thousand years.

370
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:54,370
- How bad is it?
- Pretty bad.

371
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:56,807
But not hopeless.

372
00:18:56,831 --> 00:19:00,071
See I figured if we
can find some way to...

373
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:02,750
Somehow create some sort of.

374
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,210
I was working on the collection
disc when Deon showed up.

375
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,342
I figured I better
hide it just in case.

376
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,388
Chester.

377
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,476
You're a lifesaver.

378
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,043
As for the vest,

379
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,002
I'm used to working with junk.

380
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,091
I'll just need a bunch
of replacement parts

381
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,311
from my garage and she'll
be up and running in no time.

382
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:26,077
- With a little help, that is.
- I'm with you.

383
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,347
What's up?

384
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,196
I think Deon's right.

385
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,893
We can't just

386
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:43,225
uncreate these forces like that.

387
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,943
So what, we we

388
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,728
we should just give up?

389
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,513
On this? Yeah, we give up.

390
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:53,366
Doesn't that feel like
the right thing to do?

391
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,999
Cisco, Nora will kill him

392
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:01,437
if I don't do
something to prevent it.

393
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,352
Just like she killed Alexa.

394
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,832
'Cause she's not gonna
stop until all the forces...

395
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:09,184
And the people
connected to the mare dead.

396
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,229
Why can't you see?
I'm trying to save him.

397
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,884
He doesn't want
to be saved by you!

398
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:17,216
He just wants to be given
the chance to be himself.

399
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,370
And Iris understood that.

400
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:25,069
Look, every second
that we leave these forces

401
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,637
inside Deon and Psych,
people are in danger.

402
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,900
It's only a matter of
time before someone dies

403
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,467
in one of Psych's nightmares

404
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:34,296
or gets killed by some
kind of Deon time anomaly.

405
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,081
Not to mention
Nora declared war.

406
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,083
She doesn't care how
many people she kills

407
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,824
as long as the forces die.

408
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,392
You're right. Yes,
you're absolutely right.

409
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,568
And something needs
to be done about that.

410
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,961
And I don't have
all the answers.

411
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:50,921
All I know is

412
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:53,904
this can't be it.

413
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,931
You guys understand, right?

414
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:04,263
II have to uncreate
these forces.

415
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,790
Like I said, I aml'm
Team Flash all the way.

416
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,160
But

417
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:16,013
Cisco has a point, man.

418
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:20,907
Harrison?

419
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,127
If uncreating these forces is

420
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,781
what you feel in
your heart is right,

421
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,957
I'll take that voyage with you.

422
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:31,875
But all I ask is that
you think truly think

423
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,554
about the choice you're making.

424
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,478
Please fix the harness.

425
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,528
Good luck.

426
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,341
Iris, you were right.

427
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,431
These isotopic
readings are off the chart.

428
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,564
Where are we?

429
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,087
The old Allen house.

430
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,917
This is where Barry's
mom was killed.

431
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:17,336
He also said this is where the
Speed Force went when she died.

432
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:23,013
Whoa. That old
car is hella vintage.

433
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:25,169
Almost looks brand new.

434
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,366
Must be a collector
or something.

435
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,412
We can ask him when we're done.

436
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,394
Assuming we survive.

437
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:41,534
Caitlin called me about Alexa.

438
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:44,469
So it turns out,

439
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:47,994
when Iris and I brought
back the Speed Force,

440
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:52,283
we also created
three new forces.

441
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:57,439
It's our fault that they're out
in the world hurting people.

442
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,441
Killing them.

443
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,399
So I feel like

444
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,620
I have to be the
one to take them out.

445
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:07,013
These forces.

446
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:10,713
You think they're
above saving, too?

447
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:16,046
I think it would be safer for
everybody if they didn't exist.

448
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,678
You remember when
Wally first showed up?

449
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:22,812
Man, it wasn't just that
I'd found out I have a son.

450
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,422
I found out

451
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:29,122
I have a son who kept
getting his butt in trouble.

452
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:32,474
Boy, he was mad at the world.

453
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,432
There was one point

454
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,329
he said to me that he wished
he had never been born.

455
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:44,094
So I tried to get close.

456
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,139
And he pushed me away.

457
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:48,751
I tried to give him space,

458
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:50,927
then he felt abandoned.

459
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,929
No parent is perfect.

460
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:56,715
But one thing I
never stopped doing

461
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,587
was trying.

462
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:01,024
And look at the man
he grew up to be.

463
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:05,550
Strong. Kind. Good.

464
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:09,119
Yeah I get it, II do, but

465
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,121
I mean, these forces?

466
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,776
- They're not my children.
- You sure?

467
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,474
You said it yourself.

468
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,259
You brought them
into this world.

469
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:23,960
Look, I know they've
all done terrible things.

470
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,571
But what if they could change?

471
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:33,143
You never judge your
kids for who they are now.

472
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,624
You help them become

473
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:41,325
who they know they can
be when they grow up.

474
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,613
So lead with love.

475
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:50,010
After that, it is up to them.

476
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,160
This is Barry's old room.

477
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,053
Nora?

478
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,369
Psych.

479
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,743
Hi, Mom.

480
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,713
Esperanza, don't kill me!

481
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,715
- They're everywhere.
- We need to keep them out.

482
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,108
Psych, stop. You're
hurting them please.

483
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,023
They're hurting themselves.

484
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,590
Sure, I pull back the curtain.

485
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,287
But what they see is up to them.

486
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:16,725
Now, before I show
you your worst fear,

487
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,248
why were you looking for me?

488
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,510
I wasn't.

489
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:20,772
No...

490
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:24,080
You're looking for
the Speed Force?

491
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:25,908
Nora. Why?

492
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,387
Why are you so
desperate to find her?

493
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,780
Is it to hurt her?

494
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,608
I want to talk to her
so I can help her.

495
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,741
Are you sure? Because I am

496
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:36,396
feeling the pain that she
has inflicted upon you.

497
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,182
How deeply she's torn
apart your relationships.

498
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:40,444
Your whole life.

499
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:42,664
Actually, the suffering
she's caused is

500
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,666
- quite beautiful.
- That wasn't Nora.

501
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,668
She's lost control.
Just like you have.

502
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,800
But if you let me, I
can help you both.

503
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,454
I don't need your help.

504
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:53,892
Besides, I can feel
what you fear the most.

505
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:56,982
It's the person you seek.

506
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:59,661
Well, your wish is my command.

507
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:18,027
Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

508
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,903
You'll never measure up.

509
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:30,059
Okay. It's working.

510
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,714
Now, when you're close
enough to cycle particles,

511
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,716
the disc will light up.

512
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,935
Guys, I appreciate
you helping me.

513
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,155
Make sure the proton
collection housing's

514
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,244
double-fused.

515
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:43,550
We did.

516
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,857
And it's good to see you.

517
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,642
What changed your mind?

518
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,600
Look, this is dangerous.

519
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:51,800
And it doesn't feel right.

520
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:57,347
But I'm always
gonna have your back.

521
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:58,677
No matter what.

522
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,528
Chester. Let's get it going.

523
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,225
Okay, so. Barry.

524
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,358
All you need to do is
get close enough to the.

525
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,796
Speed Force lightning to
collect a sample of each force.

526
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,932
The PHC and Timeless Wells'
time bubble should do the rest.

527
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:19,088
Theoretically.

528
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,439
Ready?

529
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,644
Nothing's happening.

530
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:36,429
- You gonna...
- Wait for it.

531
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:37,541
Wait for it.

532
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,745
Incredible.

533
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,747
We're at 100% organic speed.

534
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,531
We need you

535
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:52,881
I need you.

536
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,509
I remember this moment.

537
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,275
This is where it all started.

538
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,674
We should get to the roof.

539
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,813
You think you can
be a good wife?

540
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,815
Good mother?

541
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,078
But you never will.

542
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:03,908
Everything you do pales
in comparison to me.

543
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:07,303
Besides... how could
you be a good mother

544
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,654
- if you never even had one?
- I'm not listening to you.

545
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,090
You don't have to.

546
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,091
You already know it's the truth.

547
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:15,006
No. You're not real.

548
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,226
There's no escaping
your own fear.

549
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,035
I know you're still here, Psych.

550
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,493
Very good.

551
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,060
It is not every day that

552
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,976
somebody can sense my
presence in their nightmare.

553
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,935
- I'm not just someone.
- We have a connection.

554
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,676
I know you can feel that too.

555
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,505
Perhaps. It's not going
to help you, though.

556
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:38,247
Escape one nightmare
and I'll just serve up another.

557
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:41,883
Because there's always
more terror to unlock.

558
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,737
But before you had those powers,

559
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:54,002
before you became a
force. You were a person.

560
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,700
I'm talking to that
person right now.

561
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:58,354
I have friends. I have a team.

562
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,922
They can help you fight this
monster that's inside of you.

563
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:03,141
We can help you regain
control of your body.

564
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:06,318
What makes you
think I'm not in control?

565
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:09,452
- I know you didn't...
- choose to have these powers.

566
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:12,107
And you shouldn't have
to go through this alone.

567
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,326
I know that we're
not flesh and blood.

568
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,633
But in a way

569
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:20,008
I'ml'm like a parent.

570
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:25,405
So please let me help you.

571
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:53,583
Well, then there's something
I should tell you, Mother.

572
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,739
I hated my parents.

573
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,264
The isotopic energy
readings are going down.

574
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,420
The forces are dying.

575
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,274
These fools gonna learn.

576
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:34,300
You mess with Deon.
You get dealt with.

577
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:46,225
Another 20 seconds,
and they'll be gone forever.

578
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,987
Barry did it.

579
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,989
Okay.

580
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,035
Wait... wait.

581
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,191
What is that?

582
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:05,679
I think that is an
act of creation.

583
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,356
I have the particles.

584
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,402
Shouldn't the forces be dying?

585
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:17,014
Perhaps they are. Somewhere.

586
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,149
In time, but right
here? Right now?

587
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:23,784
They're being born.

588
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,515
What are you doing to me?

589
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,299
I wasn't able to
get through to him.

590
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:44,239
- And now it's too late.
- Boss, we can't stay here.

591
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:59,404
Allen.

592
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:01,537
You okay?

593
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:07,325
Never judge your kids
for who they are now.

594
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:14,158
You help them become
who they know they can be.

595
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,073
They're almost gone.

596
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,553
5%.

597
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:18,665
4

598
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:22,799
3%

599
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,066
2%...

600
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,424
What's happening?

601
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:04,382
Everything just stopped.

602
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:06,428
The numbers are going back up.

603
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:09,194
It's as if the forces
are still here.

604
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,914
Iris was right.

605
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:17,178
You all were.

606
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:20,442
I

607
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:21,989
I couldn't do it.

608
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:40,810
Iris

609
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:41,811
I'm sorry.

610
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:42,879
Yeah, me too.

611
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,474
Barry, Ium

612
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,215
I went looking for Nora.

613
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,565
I thought that if I
could just talk to her,

614
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:59,002
that I could fix everything.

615
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,656
But, um.

616
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,181
I ended up finding Psychinstead.

617
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,356
You were right.

618
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,184
I couldn't get through to him.

619
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,057
And it probably would have
been the same with Nora.

620
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,494
I should have listened to you.

621
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:15,477
No, I'm the one who
should have listened.

622
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:20,328
Harrison told me about
the birth of the forces.

623
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,939
Sounds incredible.

624
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:24,834
It was.

625
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,206
Can't believe how close
I came to erasing them.

626
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,210
- What changed your mind?
- You.

627
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:36,039
Joe. Everyone.

628
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:39,216
Even the forces themselves.

629
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,696
I could

630
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,091
I could feel how they
would affect the future.

631
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:48,269
All the speedsters' and
heroes' lives they'd shape.

632
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,750
Some of them were family, Iris.

633
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:54,927
Our family.

634
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:57,365
Barry, we both know how
dangerous these forces can be.

635
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,801
I mean, if you
couldn't uncreate them,

636
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,717
and I couldn't get
through toPsych...

637
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:04,154
- What are we supposed to do?
- Try again.

638
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:06,200
Together this time.

639
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,072
Joe helped me realize
that we can't judge.

640
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:12,554
Psych and Deon
for who they are now.

641
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:15,687
We have to help them become
who they can grow up to be.

642
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,844
'Cause that's what parents do.

643
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:25,895
Alexa.

644
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:33,314
- What happened?
- There was a tremor.

645
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:36,055
And Alexa sat up
and looked at me.

646
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,622
Alexa's alive?

647
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:40,930
She was for a second,
but she's not anymore.

648
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:44,760
Which doesn't make any
sense, medically speaking.

649
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,588
What if us being back in sync

650
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:48,459
is what woke her
up for the moment?

651
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,462
And then she reconnected
with the Strength Force.

652
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:57,033
Is it crazy to think
that we did this?

653
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,687
No.

654
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,602
'Cause we're all connected.

655
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,778
And if we woke her up once.

656
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:06,588
Then we could bring
her back permanently?

657
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,893
Why is everyone looking at me?

658
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,750
Listen. I'd ask you to say, but

659
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,447
I already know the answer.

660
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:05,995
A man's gotta be
where his heart lies.

661
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:12,350
He's just gotta
learn to listen to it.

662
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:22,336
One more thing before I go.

663
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,816
Whether it's me,

664
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:30,866
or any of the many
Wells predecessors,

665
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,609
I want you to know
that you taught us

666
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:38,482
every inch as much
as we taught you.

667
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:40,203
Maybe more.

668
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,394
Yeah, I'm never
gonna get used to that.

669
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:04,116
You okay?

670
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,510
Yeah.

671
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:09,078
For the first time
in a long while.

672
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,409
Yeah, I feel okay.

673
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:13,996
Good.

674
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,911
Um...'cause I've been
thinking about something.

675
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:20,481
And after tonight, I
know I have to do it.

676
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,831
Okay, that's just weird.

677
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:28,706
I was literally about to say
the exact same thing to you.

678
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,429
I have to leave Central City.

679
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,670
Thank God.

680
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:38,629
Are you kidding me?

681
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,196
My God.

682
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,591
Babe, what are you
gonna tell Team Citizen?

683
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:46,444
What are you gonna
tell Team Flash?

684
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:16,580
You're the one who's after me?

685
00:41:16,604 --> 00:41:18,780
You don't look so tough.

686
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:29,114
What are you?

687
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,358
A reckoning.

688
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:08,047
Greg, move your head.
