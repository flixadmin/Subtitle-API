1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,740
- One for each of you.
- Thanks.

2
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,822
Have fun.

3
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,328
- There you go.
- Yeah!

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,863
Now, doesn't that just lift your spirits?

5
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,989
Let's give another big hand
for the Hawkins High Marching Band!

6
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,082
I hope you're all having
a good time tonight.

7
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,251
Are you having a good time?

8
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,498
I can't hear you!

9
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,133
Are you having a good time?

10
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,256
I want you to know
that we spared no expense

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,344
to provide you with the very best
entertainment that money can buy!

12
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,887
Keep your arms inside.

13
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,220
Uh-oh! Dad can't get out now.

14
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,976
Why do you two enjoy torturing me?

15
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,399
- Because it's fun.
- Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's fun!

16
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,186
Oh, here we go.

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,606
Oh, boy.

18
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,148
Hoo!

19
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,946
But enough of me blabbering.

20
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,490
Who here wants to see some fireworks?

21
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,292
Come on, now, you can do better than that.

22
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,539
Who here wants to see some fireworks?

23
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,223
Uh, why are we stopping?

24
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,723
Because I slipped Jimmy a five.

25
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,801
You what?

26
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,005
Come on,
these are the best seats in the house.

27
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,556
The best seats in the house.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,680
Oh!

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,320
Happy Fourth of July!

30
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,787
Whoa!

31
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,619
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,708
Yeah.

33
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,894
Mom, the trees.

34
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,392
- What, baby?
- The trees are moving.

35
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,389
Why are you looking at the trees, baby?

36
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,807
The fireworks. Look at the fireworks!

37
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,116
That was a big one, wasn't it?

38
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,132
He said he was
building something.

39
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,919
That it was all for me.

40
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,844
Building something...

41
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,135
- Is he talking about the flayed?
- He must be.

42
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,429
So, he's building an army,
just like we thought.

43
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,683
Yeah, but he's not building this army
to spread.

44
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,095
He's building it to stop Eleven.

45
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,480
Last year, El closed the gate on him.

46
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,281
I have a feeling
that really pissed him off.

47
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,354
Like, royally.

48
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,567
And the Mind Flayer now knows that
she's the only thing that can stop him.

49
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,490
- But if she's out of the way...
- Game over.

50
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,069
He also said

51
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,912
he was gonna kill all of you.

52
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,737
Yeah, well, that's nice.

53
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,088
Do you guys hear that?

54
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,546
It's just the fireworks.

55
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,306
Billy...

56
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,103
When he told you this,
it was here, in this room?

57
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,827
He knows we're here.

58
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,140
Jesus, slow down!

59
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,597
Yeah, what is this,
like, the Indy 500?

60
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,937
It's the Indy 300.

61
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,862
- No, dingus, it's 500!
- It's 300!

62
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,282
Let's say a million.

63
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,994
- What is wrong with them?
- I don't know.

64
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,238
- Dustin, watch out!
- Shit!

65
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,290
Oh!

66
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,570
You guys all right back there?

67
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,832
They're fine.

68
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,627
Come on. We gotta go, now.

69
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,462
- Come on! Get out!
- Let's go!

70
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,838
Ow!

71
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,644
- We're coming!
- Here goes nothin'.

72
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,216
This sucks.

73
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,442
- Hey! You look like you're surfing!
- Surfing! Yeah!

74
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,518
Whoa!

75
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,232
- They seem drunk.
- Why would they be drunk?

76
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,023
I'm a natural! Check it out!

77
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,107
Whoop!

78
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,284
Wipeout!

79
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,868
- He's burning up.
- You're burning up.

80
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,240
- One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve.
- God, no.

81
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,947
Ow!

82
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,956
His pupils are super dilated.

83
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,288
Maybe he's drugged.

84
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,544
Ugh. Boop!

85
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,381
Steve, are you drugged?

86
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,751
How many times, Dad?

87
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,167
I don't do drugs. It's only marijuana.

88
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,617
This isn't funny, okay?
I need to know what they did to you.

89
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,466
- Are you gonna die on us?
- Boop.

90
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,063
We all die,
my strange little child friend.

91
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,179
It's just a matter of how...

92
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,766
and when.

93
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,872
They're gonna be looking for us up there,

94
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,707
so I need you to tell me
where you parked your car.

95
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,191
Oh, can we make a pit stop
at the food court?

96
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,025
- I would kill for a hot dog on a stick.
- Ooh!

97
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,111
All right. Yeah, food.

98
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,356
Yes, you can have
as much food as you want,

99
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,448
but only if you tell me
where your car is parked.

100
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,873
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

101
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,081
The car's off the board.

102
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,661
- What?
- They took the keys.

103
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,406
The Russians, they took the keys.

104
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,708
Like, forever ago.

105
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,167
That's a bummer, right?

106
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,131
Oh!

107
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,969
Oh, my God, that tastes so good. Ah!

108
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,552
Steve, can you taste the air?

109
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,387
I taste it! I taste it!

110
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,642
- Stop!
- Shit! Come on! Come on!

111
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,495
Stop right there!

112
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,189
- Okay, okay, okay! Woo!
- Why are we running?

113
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,201
Yeah. That's good like that.

114
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,586
Hey, get away from the windows.

115
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,368
It's close.

116
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,473
Where'd it go?

117
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,610
Holy shit.

118
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,010
El!

119
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,144
El!

120
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,687
Pull!

121
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,441
Nancy, shoot it!

122
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,615
Come on! Lucas!

123
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,801
Pull!

124
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,354
El! El, you okay?

125
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,512
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on, go!

126
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,323
- Go!
- Hurry up! Come on!

127
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,347
Everybody out!

128
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,312
- Go!
- Go, come on!

129
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,602
Go, go, go, go!

130
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,903
- Come on!
- Come on!

131
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,438
Come on! Come on!

132
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,270
Get in. Right here.

133
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,202
Drive! Drive!

134
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,520
- Whoa!
- Where are we going?

135
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,054
Just trust me.

136
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,339
All clear.

137
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,308
Doc!

138
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,892
What did I tell you?!

139
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,653
Eighty-eight miles per hour!

140
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,941
Come on.

141
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,744
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20...

142
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,241
- You two, sit.
- No, no, no! These seats are too close!

143
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,873
- Dude, these seats blow.
- Then don't watch the movie.

144
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,491
- We wanna watch it.
- Then watch it!

145
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,827
- Shh!
- Shh!

146
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,752
Sorry.

147
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,120
Whatever you do,

148
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,416
don't... go... anywhere.

149
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,670
Fine, Dad.

150
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,712
The appropriate question is
"When the hell are they?"

151
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,917
You see, Einstein has just become

152
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,927
- the world's first time traveler!
- Sorry. Sorry.

153
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,680
I sent him... into the future!

154
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,767
Okay, it's official.

155
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,137
I'm never having kids.

156
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,225
- What are we doing here?
- We're laying low.

157
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,310
Cooling off.

158
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,225
Like Oswald.

159
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,482
Oswald was found in a theater
and shot to death.

160
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,565
A week later.

161
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,437
The point is, his plan didn't work.

162
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,856
Only because it was a setup.

163
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,364
- What?
- He was just a patsy.

164
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,195
- Tell me you're joking.
- Shh!

165
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,161
Shh!

166
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,661
We need to get outta here.

167
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,409
All right, you watch
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

168
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,075
- Make sure they don't go anywhere.
- Where are you going?

169
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,618
To find us a ride.

170
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,788
Look out!

171
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,301
Doc...

172
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,550
- What's happening?
- I have no idea.

173
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,952
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine...

174
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,353
- What's he saying?
- He's showing me the location of the key

175
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,858
to turn off the machine.

176
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,669
Sorry, "keys." Two keys.

177
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,613
Two-man rule.

178
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,414
- Two-man rule?
- Yeah, two men, two keys, like a...

179
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,989
nuclear launch.

180
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,283
But, uh, to retrieve the keys,
there is a vault.

181
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,127
And to open the vault,

182
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,462
you need to enter Planck's constant.

183
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,418
- Planck's what?
- Planck's constant.

184
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,168
- It's a very famous number.
- All right, so we get the keys,

185
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,091
and then we turn the machine off.

186
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,380
That's what he says.

187
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,223
All right, well, that shouldn't be
too hard. We can do this.

188
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,485
Joyce, did you hear the part
where he said the place was like

189
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,589
an impenetrable fortress?

190
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,507
Yeah, but there has to be a way in.

191
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,926
Yeah, there is. Our military.

192
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,054
- Who are coming.
- Well, we don't know that anymore

193
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,739
because you yelled at them
like it was a parent-teacher conference,

194
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,650
and then you hung up on them,
so we don't know what the hell's going on,

195
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,570
because now we're...
Wait, wait, what are we do... Oh!

196
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,030
Wait, that's right!

197
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,609
We're on our way to rescue our children

198
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,696
from the big, bad
Fourth of July celebration!

199
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,293
You know what, if you can't handle this,
then just turn around

200
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,540
and drop me off first.

201
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,041
What are you gonna do?

202
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,252
You gonna walk back to Hawkins?

203
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,843
I will do anything
if it gets me away from you!

204
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,089
Children! Children! Children!

205
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,756
This interminable bickering
was amusing at first,

206
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,312
but it's getting very stale and we've
still got a long drive ahead of us.

207
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,139
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit

208
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,975
and get to the part where you admit
your sexual feelings for one another?

209
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,522
- Whoa!
- You are way off base, buddy!

210
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,066
Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me!

211
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,531
Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know.

212
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,572
Probably reminds you
of a bad relationship,

213
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,156
and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man
to settle down with,

214
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,373
but, admit it, you're real curious to know
what he's like in the sack.

215
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,541
And you. Ha!

216
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,794
Well, you're just a big manbaby

217
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,296
who'd rather act tough
than show his true feelings,

218
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,468
because the last time
you opened your heart, you got hurt.

219
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,380
Owie.

220
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,717
And now, rather than admit these feelings,
you're dancing around one another

221
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,885
with this mind-numbing
and frankly boorish mating ritual.

222
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,805
So, please, for my sake,

223
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,194
either quit your bickering, or pull over,

224
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,982
tear off those clothes,

225
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,105
and get it over with already!

226
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,869
What was that?

227
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,621
I told them they should have sex.

228
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,581
They have not had sex?

229
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,998
No.

230
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,101
Oh! Oh!

231
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,381
Okay, get her down.

232
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,956
Okay.

233
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,296
Lemme see.

234
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,512
Oh, shit.

235
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,528
What... What... Hey, what are you doing?

236
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,805
I'm cleaning the wound.

237
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,719
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding,

238
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,228
then clean, then disinfect, then bandage.

239
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,690
I skateboard. Trust me.

240
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,771
Mike, hold this.

241
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,245
Keep the pressure on it,
nice and firm, okay?

242
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,730
We're gonna need water, soap.

243
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,405
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

244
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,616
Does any of this help?

245
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,786
No.

246
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,293
Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.

247
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,377
- A bowl?
- Lucas.

248
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,416
- Go.
- Okay.

249
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,100
What did that thing
look like to you?

250
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,184
Like that thing in the hospital,
only bigger.

251
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,431
Yeah, a lot bigger.

252
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,852
Like, Tom and Bruce,
they merged to become one, right?

253
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,493
And... And Driscoll kept saying
how she needed to go back to the source...

254
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,517
Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?

255
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,023
Maybe.

256
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,574
And... And... And maybe Heather and Janet,
too, and God knows who else.

257
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,170
I don't know how we're gonna
kill this thing, but if we do...

258
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,034
- We kill all the flayed.
- And... we end this.

259
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,532
Maybe.

260
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,954
All I know is...

261
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,911
we need El.

262
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,496
Bowl...

263
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,248
Bowl...

264
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,666
Bowl...

265
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,998
- Why wouldn't it be with the cereal?
- I don't know.

266
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,761
What else do you use a bowl for?

267
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,050
I... I don't know.

268
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,468
Oh, shit.

269
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,887
Satan's Baby.

270
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,521
You ever shot one of these suckers?

271
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,225
No. Is it sweet?

272
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,290
- That's an understatement.
- That doesn't look like a bowl.

273
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,316
Nah, it's way better.

274
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,323
There is a reason this warning label
says "18 or older."

275
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:04,201
This sucker is filled with 150 grains
of black powder.

276
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,120
AKA gunpowder.

277
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,132
Strap two of these together,
and it's bigger than an M-80.

278
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,584
Five of them,

279
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,674
we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.

280
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,165
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?

281
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,627
Do you have a better idea?

282
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,217
Uh, yeah. Eleven.

283
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,353
Against that thing?
She's gonna need some backup.

284
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,102
Oh, my God.

285
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,194
Hold this.

286
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,821
Does that hurt?

287
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,781
Uh, not bad.

288
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,986
You're gonna have an awesome scar.

289
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,158
You'll look even more badass.

290
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,120
Bitchin'.

291
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,449
Yeah, bitchin'.

292
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,246
El...

293
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,039
Yeah?

294
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,932
I've been meaning to tell you something.

295
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,004
It's just, being broken up,

296
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,257
it's been hard.

297
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,675
And...

298
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,009
I like that you and Max are friends now.

299
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,310
It's just, I was jealous at first,
and... and angry.

300
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,481
And that's why I said
all that stupid stuff.

301
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,649
And it's like I wanted you all to myself.

302
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,653
And now I realize how unfair that is.

303
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,441
And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry.

304
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,450
I just, like, I've never felt like this,
you know, with anyone before...

305
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,196
and...

306
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,544
You know, they do say
it makes you crazy.

307
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,038
What makes you crazy?

308
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,422
You never... You never heard that term...

309
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,501
You know, like the phrase, like...

310
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,666
"blank makes you crazy," like the word...

311
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,068
- "Girlfriends"?
- No, no, no, no, not... not girlfriends.

312
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,392
- "Boyfriends."
- No! No, no, not boyfriends either.

313
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,864
- It's like... It's like a feeling or...
- A feeling...

314
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,098
Yeah, like something... Like, old people
say it to each other sometimes.

315
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,183
- Old people?
- Yeah.

316
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,018
What I wanna say is...

317
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,614
that I just...

318
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,229
I know that I...

319
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,614
I repeat... this is a code red!

320
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,507
Dustin?

321
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,621
Mike?

322
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,409
- Dustin!
- Mike!

323
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,002
Oh, my God, you have to listen.
I know I've been MIA,

324
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,168
and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad.
I mean, I actually was mad,

325
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,668
but it's also because
I was trapped underground

326
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,921
in a secret Russian base.

327
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,510
Dustin, you're going way too fast.
I can't understand you.

328
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,760
I know that sounds insane,
but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins!

329
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,053
The goddamn Russians!

330
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,306
And now... they're using...
to open the gate.

331
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,907
Dustin, you're... you're breaking up.

332
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,327
And now they're after us
and we don't have a way out of here,

333
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,311
so I need you to come and get us.
Can Nancy drive?

334
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,608
Dustin, you're cutting out.

335
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,943
- Mike?
- Dustin, you there?

336
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,435
Mike? Mike, do you copy?

337
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,693
Dustin...

338
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,817
Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike!

339
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,487
- Dustin!
- Mike!

340
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,493
What is it?

341
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,501
Do you have any batteries? Double-A?

342
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,883
Why would I have batteries?

343
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,129
I always carry batteries.

344
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,461
Then what's the problem?

345
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,625
I need eight.

346
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,633
Eight?

347
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,634
Shit. Guess we'll have to go to plan B.

348
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,547
Plan B? What's plan B?

349
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,102
Where... are they?

350
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,478
That's amazing.

351
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:28,411
So, like, I wasn't totally focused
in there or anything, but...

352
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,489
I'm pretty sure...

353
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,251
that mom was trying to bang her son.

354
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,869
Wait, wait, the hot chick
was Alex P. Keaton's mom?

355
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,037
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

356
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,665
But they're the same age.

357
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,751
No, but he went back in time.

358
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,970
Then why is it called Back to the Future?

359
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,678
He has to go back to the future

360
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,679
because he's in the past.

361
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,971
So, the future is actually the present,

362
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,345
which is his time.

363
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,103
Wh... What?

364
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,976
No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough.

365
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,449
Wow.

366
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,757
Hey, Robin.

367
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,553
You gotta check this out.

368
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,429
Check this...

369
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,932
This... The ceiling, it's beautiful.

370
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,846
Oh, wow.

371
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,811
Oh.

372
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,360
Stay here,
go over the plans with Smirnoff.

373
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,938
- I can help look.
- No, you'll scare the children.

374
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,614
- Jim, if this is about earlier...
- Stay put, Freud!

375
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,703
You hear me? Stay put!

376
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,136
You know,
say what you will about Kline,

377
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,411
he certainly knows how to throw a party.

378
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,330
I'm sorry about him, by the way.

379
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,915
- Who, Larry?
- No, Murray.

380
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,800
He's a sick individual
who likes to get under people's skin.

381
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,088
So, let's not let him, you know,
get under our skin.

382
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,263
I'm not, I haven't.

383
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,221
I just, you seem
a little more quiet than usual.

384
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,488
- I just... I just wanna find the kids.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,872
I'll give it my best shot.

386
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,183
You won yourself a bear!

387
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,887
Thank you. Here you go.

388
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,058
Mayor Kline!

389
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,480
One more, one more.

390
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,110
Big smile. There we go.

391
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,947
- Watch it!
- Happy Fourth, dick.

392
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,171
Come on, come on, come on!

393
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,672
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
you commie bastards!

394
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,488
- Quiet.
- Oh, sorry.

395
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,950
- How do you even drink that?
- Because it's delicious.

396
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,035
What?

397
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,119
It's like Carpenter's The Thing.

398
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,914
The original is a classic,

399
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,498
no question about it.

400
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,287
But the remake...

401
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,680
Sweeter, bolder...

402
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,771
better.

403
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,139
You're insane.

404
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,805
So, you prefer the original Thing?

405
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,145
What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing,
I'm talking about New Coke.

406
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,651
It's the same concept, dude.

407
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,403
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.

408
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,605
It is the same concept.

409
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,088
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

410
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,202
Hey.

411
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,989
Sorry.

412
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Sorry.

413
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,584
Did you... find him?

414
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,126
The movies?

415
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,749
Dustin's so freaked out about the gate,
he decides to go watch a movie?

416
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,047
Yeah, makes total sense.

417
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,130
You're positive he said "gate"
and not "great"?

418
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,056
Yeah, like,
"This movie I'm watching is great."

419
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:58,974
Sounded like "gate."

420
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,172
Which would explain how
the Mind Flayer's still alive.

421
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,701
- Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
- Then the monster dies.

422
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,095
But if not,
we always have Lucas' fireworks.

423
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,774
Keep mocking my plan, Max.
Keep mocking it.

424
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,363
I wanna hear you say it again,
because you keep doubting me.

425
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,439
You keep doubting me!

426
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,114
- Ridiculous.
- Will?

427
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,032
We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right?

428
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,882
The ceiling stopped spinning for me.

429
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,974
Is it still spinning for you?

430
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,638
Holy shit.

431
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,637
No.

432
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,853
You think we puked it all up?

433
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,272
Maybe. Ask me something.

434
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,085
Interrogate me.

435
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,805
Okay. Interrogate you. Sure.

436
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,976
Um...

437
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,438
When was the last time
you, uh, peed your pants?

438
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,686
Today.

439
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,777
What?

440
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,782
When the Russian doctor
took out the bone saw.

441
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,494
Oh, my God.

442
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,494
It was just a little bit, though.

443
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,746
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.

444
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Oh...

445
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,961
- All right, my turn.
- Okay.

446
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,375
Hit me.

447
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,295
Have you...

448
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,764
ever been in love?

449
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,140
Yep. Nancy Wheeler.

450
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,600
First semester, senior year.

451
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,810
Oh, my God.

452
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,271
She's such a priss.

453
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,811
Hm.

454
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,145
Turns out, not really.

455
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,439
Are you still in love with Nancy?

456
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,033
- No.
- Why not?

457
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,585
I think it's because I found someone
who's a little bit better for me.

458
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,576
It's crazy.

459
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,327
Ever since Dustin got home,
he's been saying,

460
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,205
"You know, you gotta find your Suzie.
You gotta find your Suzie."

461
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,633
Wait, who's Suzie?

462
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,461
It's some girl from camp,
I guess his girlfriend.

463
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,877
To be honest with you,
I'm not 100% sure she's even real.

464
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,724
But that's not...
that's not really the point.

465
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,805
That doesn't matter. The point is,
this girl, you know, the one that I like,

466
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,062
it's somebody that I...
didn't even talk to in school.

467
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,146
And I don't even know why.

468
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,113
Maybe 'cause Tommy H.
would've made fun of me or...

469
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,492
I wouldn't be...

470
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,697
prom king.

471
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,044
It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right,
it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.

472
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,410
Because, when I think about it,

473
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,817
I should've been hanging out
with this girl the whole time.

474
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,214
First of all, she's hilarious.
She's so funny.

475
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,173
I feel like, this summer,
I have laughed harder

476
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,505
than I have laughed...

477
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,675
in a really long time.

478
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,088
And she's smart.

479
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,891
Way smarter than me.

480
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,425
You know, she can crack, like,
top secret Russian codes and...

481
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,148
You know? She's honestly unlike anyone
I've ever even met before.

482
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,569
Robin?

483
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,288
Robin, did you just OD in there?

484
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,540
No.

485
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,329
I...

486
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,464
am still alive.

487
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,143
The floor's disgusting.

488
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,310
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood
and puke on my shirt, so...

489
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,847
What do you think?

490
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,895
About?

491
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,563
This girl.

492
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,981
She sounds awesome.

493
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,744
She is awesome. And what about the guy?

494
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,988
I think he's on drugs,
and he's not thinking straight.

495
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,781
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking
a lot more clearly than usual.

496
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,241
He's not.

497
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,328
Look...

498
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,116
he doesn't even know this girl.

499
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,285
And if he did know her,

500
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,131
like... like really know her,

501
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,671
I don't think he'd even want to be
her friend.

502
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,177
No, that's not true. No way is that true.

503
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,839
Listen to me, Steve.

504
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,393
It's shocked me to my core,

505
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,391
but I like you.

506
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,683
I really like you.

507
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,227
But I'm not like your other friends.

508
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,689
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.

509
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,864
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.

510
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,452
Do you remember what I said
about Click's class?

511
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,989
About me being jealous and, like,
obsessed?

512
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,655
Yeah.

513
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,003
It isn't because I had a crush on you.

514
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,213
It's because...

515
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,879
she wouldn't stop staring at you.

516
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,713
Mrs. Click?

517
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,426
Tammy Thompson.

518
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,717
I wanted her to look at me.

519
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,023
But... she couldn't
pull her eyes away from you

520
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,192
and your stupid hair.

521
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,781
And I didn't understand,
because you would get

522
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,491
bagel crumbs all over the floor.

523
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,908
And you asked dumb questions.

524
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,201
And you were a douchebag.

525
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,662
And... And you didn't even like her and...

526
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,115
I would go home...

527
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,254
and just scream into my pillow.

528
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,344
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.

529
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,046
Steve.

530
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,673
Yeah?

531
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,803
Oh.

532
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,471
Oh.

533
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,347
Holy shit.

534
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,226
Yeah.

535
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,145
Holy shit.

536
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,029
Steve...

537
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,203
did you OD over there?

538
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,327
No, I just, uh...

539
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,789
just thinking.

540
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,884
Okay.

541
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,207
I mean, yeah.

542
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,593
Tammy Thompson, you know,
she's cute and all, but...

543
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,092
I mean,

544
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,465
she's a total dud.

545
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,763
She is not.

546
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,560
Yes, she is.
She wants to be, like, a singer.

547
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
She wants to move to, like,
Nashville and shit.

548
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,146
- She has dreams.
- She can't even hold a tune.

549
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,558
She's practically tone-deaf.
Have you heard her?

550
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,916
All the time.

551
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,819
Shut up.

552
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,063
- She does not sound like that.
- She sounds exactly...

553
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,050
- That's a great impersonation of her.
- She does not.

554
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,164
You sound like a Muppet.

555
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,741
She sounds like a Muppet.

556
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,866
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.

557
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,125
- Exactly.
- I know!

558
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,837
Okay.

559
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,927
What the hell?

560
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,555
And why all this?

561
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,146
If I just turn the keys,
it's like turning off a car.

562
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,269
But then the car still works, does it not?

563
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,819
Yes.

564
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,360
And do you want the car to still work
or do you want it to explode?

565
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,155
I want the car to explode.

566
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,369
Good. Then do this.

567
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,575
Just make sure you are nowhere near it
when it does. It is not pretty.

568
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,372
Turns people into dust.

569
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,331
And then...

570
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,330
It's over.

571
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,380
And I become an American citizen
and join in the fun, yes?

572
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,720
Who said you had to be an American
to join the fun?

573
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,654
It doesn't get
more American than this, my friend.

574
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,031
Fatty foods, ugly decadence,

575
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,939
rigged games...

576
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,989
Fifteen tickets, please.

577
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,373
- They are rigged, these games?
- Yes.

578
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,794
They do not look rigged.

579
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,509
That's just it, my dear Alexei.

580
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,219
They have been designed
to present the illusion of fairness!

581
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,430
But it's all a scam, a trick,

582
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,141
to put your money
in the rich man's pocket.

583
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,773
That, my dear friend, is...

584
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,733
America.

585
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,691
But, hey...

586
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,441
knock yourself out.

587
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,608
Where are you going?

588
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,150
To get us the closest thing to food
I can find.

589
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,501
Hey. Hey.

590
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,004
Karen.

591
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,263
Step right up!

592
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,486
...feel the wind push you back
and it's gonna...

593
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,930
- Hold on. Do we have seat belts?
- Hey, Karen.

594
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,852
Joyce!

595
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,600
Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here!

596
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,603
Where are the kids?

597
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,354
I... I haven't seen them.
I don't think they're here yet.

598
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,266
- You three, up against the wall!
- No, where are they?

599
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,526
Oh, my gosh,
I can hardly keep track these days.

600
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,488
Uh, they were at, uh...

601
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,528
Dustin's, then Lucas's,

602
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,072
- then Max's.
- Max...

603
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,369
You know how it is. Summer!

604
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,579
Probably getting into some kinda trouble.

605
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,246
Last warning, you two.
Up against the wall!

606
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,996
Hold the ride!

607
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,634
On your life, Magnum.

608
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,625
Woo! Here we go!

609
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,585
Holy smokes!

610
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,638
Holy smokes!

611
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,483
Roads?

612
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,648
Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

613
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,056
And...

614
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,138
blend.

615
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,308
It is so good!

616
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,727
- Well, shit, that worked.
- Course it worked.

617
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,045
We just have to get on the bus
with the rest of these plebes,

618
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,449
and home sweet home, here we come.

619
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,702
- Uh, Dustin?
- What?

620
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,421
Yeah, we might not wanna
go to your house.

621
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,369
Why?

622
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,410
Well, I might've told them your full name.

623
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,581
- What is wrong with you?
- Dude, I was drugged.

624
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,043
- So?
- So?

625
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,673
So, you resist. You tough it out.
You tough it out like a man.

626
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,302
Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say.

627
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,379
Guys?

628
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,302
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Have a pleasant evening.

629
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:47,967
Abort.

630
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,764
Abort. Abort.

631
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,141
Shit.

632
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,309
Okay.

633
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,562
Come on, let's go, let's go.

634
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,111
That's three green!

635
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,366
And here's dart number four!

636
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,292
One more for the big prize!

637
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,088
You can do it, mister!

638
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,314
We have a winner!

639
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,148
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen!

640
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,194
Get your tickets right here!

641
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,695
Murray!

642
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,573
Look!

643
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,077
It's not rigged!

644
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,159
Ah!

645
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,405
It's not rigged.

646
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,137
Traitor.

647
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,321
Alexei!

648
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,546
Alexei!

649
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,433
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Let's go.

650
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,894
Easy.

651
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,008
Keep pressure on it.

652
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,685
I'll get you help.

653
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,145
I'll get help.

654
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,214
Jim... Jim.

655
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,746
Jim!

656
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,669
They got Alexei, Jim!

657
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,718
Jim! Alexei! They got Alexei, Jim!

658
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,012
We gotta go.

659
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,888
- We gotta go.
- What?

660
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,143
Let's go.

661
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,740
They make an odd couple, don't they?

662
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,277
Well, it's like they say,

663
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,236
there's someone for everyone.

664
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,340
Who wants a hot dog?

665
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,085
Find Murray, get the car,

666
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,592
- bring it around back.
- Okay.

667
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,495
Heading to "Big Top."

668
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,099
Northeast side of the fair.

669
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,398
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen!

670
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,152
Get your tickets to the Big Top here!

671
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,362
...this side of the Mississippi.

672
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,485
Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police!

673
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,446
Get 'em out of here! Go!

674
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,536
You, sir!

675
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,248
Step on up!

676
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,501
I see you eyeing the maze!

677
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,293
Don't be surprised! Don't be scared!

678
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,670
Step on up, sir!

679
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,470
Do you dare enter the cave of horrors?

680
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,885
You never know what you might find
around the corner.

681
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:10,862
Don't show your fear
in the presence of the tiger.

682
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,032
Or you may never escape this cave alive.

683
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,134
Alexei!

684
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,509
Oh, my God.

685
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,391
I... I just left for a minute...

686
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,837
for a corn dog.

687
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,218
A stupid corn dog.

688
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,272
Oh, God.

689
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,854
Oh, no.

690
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,284
Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer!

691
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,749
What are you doing?

692
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,713
Hey!

693
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,011
- Larry.
- Joyce.

694
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,893
Ooh!

695
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,348
Yeah, lady!

696
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,573
Hey.

697
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,164
Comrade!

698
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,668
Get off me!

699
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,925
Goddamn!

700
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,013
Son of a bitch!

701
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,396
Hey!

702
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,940
Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go!

703
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,784
Alexei?

704
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,963
On the lower level...

705
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,748
Hey, translate.

706
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,169
We've found the children.

707
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,498
They are still in the mall. Lower level.

708
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,419
Keep all entrances locked down.

709
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,337
I repeat...

710
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,385
Keep all entrances locked down.

711
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,126
Everyone, get over here.

712
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,512
I found them.

713
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,214
What the hell?

714
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,843
You flung that thing
like a Hot Wheel!

715
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,764
- Lucas?
- What are you doing here?

716
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,175
Ask them. It's their fault.

717
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,473
True, yeah. Totally true.
It's absolutely our fault.

718
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,118
I don't understand what happened
to that car.

719
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,182
El has superpowers.

720
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,246
- I'm sorry?
- Superpowers. She threw it with her mind.

721
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,940
- C'mon, catch up.
- That's El?

722
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,152
- Who's El?
- I'm sorry, who are you?

723
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,902
- I'm Robin. I work with Steve.
- She cracked the top secret code.

724
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,879
Yeah, which is how we found out
about the Russians in the first place.

725
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,203
Russians? Wait, what Russians?

726
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,160
- The Russians!
- Those were Russians?

727
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,330
- Some of them.
- What are you talking about?

728
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,886
- Didn't you hear our code red?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,510
- Couldn't understand half of what you were saying.
- Goddamn low battery.

730
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,599
How many times do I have to tell you
with the low battery?

731
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,183
Well, everything worked out, didn't it?

732
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,420
- Worked out? We almost died.
- Yeah, but we didn't, did we?

733
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,303
- It was pretty damn close.
- Okay, Russians?

734
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,631
As in, they're working for
the Russian government?

735
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,112
What are you not comprehending?

736
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,386
Am I not speaking English?

737
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,141
We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation.

738
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,143
So this has nothing to do
with the gate?

739
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,475
It has everything to do
with the gate...

740
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,728
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

741
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,975
El! El!

742
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,670
- What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong?

743
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,114
My leg. My leg.

744
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,196
Her leg, her leg. Okay.

745
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,448
- Get that off.
- Okay.

746
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,830
El! El!

747
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,919
El! El, are you okay?

748
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,844
El! El!

749
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,923
El!
