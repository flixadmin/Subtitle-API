1
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:50,243
O Stree come tomorrow

2
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:14,576
O Stree come tomorrow

3
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,576
Prakash.

4
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:07,118
Prakash...

5
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,784
Prakash!

6
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,993
O Stree come tomorrow

7
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:46,534
"The heart's completely open,
with no hook or button..."

8
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:48,284
"No button."

9
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:53,994
"Dreams are larger than life..."

10
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:56,078
"...and a mind that cares for no one."

11
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:57,828
"...cares for no one."

12
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:05,362
"My dreams are too
big to fit in this city."

13
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:06,869
"Bigger than the city..."

14
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:11,831
"I can fix your pain
with just a smile."

15
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:14,703
"I am the tailor of Heart."

16
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,578
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

17
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:20,703
Hey...

18
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,328
"I am the tailor of love."

19
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:30,661
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

20
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,244
"I am the tailor of Heart."

21
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:52,536
"Stitch me a beautiful dress,
sweetheart..."

22
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,411
"...which makes me
look more charming."

23
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,161
"I am the tailor of Heart."

24
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:04,661
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

25
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,494
"I am the tailor of Heart."

26
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:12,328
Uncle...you start this charade
in every festival, don't you?

27
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,953
Vicky, there's still time.

28
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,078
But, this is no ordinary ink.

29
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:22,828
These are crushed bones of a bat
mixed with the pee of a white crow.

30
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,536
That's how this ink is prepared.

31
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:29,036
Uncle, sell these stories to
those who like reading Aesop's fables.

32
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:30,911
We're the modern generation.

33
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:33,661
The entire city believes
in this ignorance.

34
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:37,744
Vicky, any house that has
this ink outside their house...

35
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,244
...will always be safe from 'Stree'.

36
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:41,203
I see...

37
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,369
Have you ever heard that the
Ambani's daughter was possessed?

38
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,661
Or the Tatas or Birla's were haunted.

39
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,411
I know she will come.

40
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,203
Loosen your pockets
and let me finish writing.

41
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:53,203
Uncle, don't forget
to write on our wall too.

42
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:56,619
And listen, write it in bold.

43
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,869
Otherwise, she might not
read it and come right in.

44
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:02,953
Yes, I will.

45
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,578
Your mouth will end
up like that aunty.

46
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,369
Close the gate, mister.

47
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:13,661
Or the cow will barge in.

48
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,411
I am the watchman as well.

49
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,081
So you finally found
time to come home.

50
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:17,994
What's the matter?

51
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:20,411
- You should also come with me from tomorrow.
- I don't need to.

52
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,994
The sewing machine gives
me all the exercise I need.

53
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,744
And, you don't need this either.

54
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,453
Or soon you'll be
hanging from a hanger.

55
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:26,828
Was that a joke?

56
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:28,286
And you're trying to be wise.

57
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:30,494
I'm already observing a fast
for the next four days.

58
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,869
And, you're making me waste my energy.

59
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:34,703
- Another fast?
- Focus on your job.

60
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:37,409
Soon the ladies will queue up.

61
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,411
I've told you before
stop taking alteration work.

62
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,786
"Loosen the petticoat,
tighten my blouse."

63
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:46,286
We'll only accept orders
for stitching new clothes.

64
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,536
Brand new clothes only.

65
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:49,453
Only?

66
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,161
And what will you do for
the rest of the year, son?

67
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:53,786
Ring the bell.

68
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,161
Daddy, explaining you is impossible.

69
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:56,911
Listen...

70
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:59,203
Listen... Listen... Listen...

71
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:05,619
You should spend some time
learning how to run the shop.

72
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,328
Otherwise,
if someday your dad passes away...

73
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:11,203
...you won't be able
to run the show alone.

74
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:15,203
Even if Death comes himself
to collect your soul, you won't die.

75
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:19,161
Even when your fingers will become frail,
you'll still be altering lady's dresses.

76
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,244
Son, soon you'll be following
in my footsteps.

77
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:27,994
Daddy, I wasn't born
to alter lady's dresses.

78
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:29,869
Then what are you destined for, son?

79
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:32,869
I don't know yet, dad.
But I will know pretty soon.

80
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:36,494
(Rap Song)

81
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:49,536
Let them in.

82
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:51,328
How are you, brother Vicky?

83
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:53,328
Stitch a dress for me.

84
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,786
Take down sister-in-law's
measurements.

85
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:55,619
Step back a little.

86
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,081
Length;48, Shoulder; 14.5.

87
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,203
- Take off the shawl, sister-in-law.
- Yes.

88
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:04,661
Arm-hole;16, Wrist;
7, Chest; 38, waist; 42.

89
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:05,786
Turn around, sister-in-law.

90
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,328
Hip;44, Neck:10

91
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:09,411
Deep or Medium?

92
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,619
No, not deep.

93
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:11,453
Keep it medium.

94
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:13,161
Deep's better, sister-in-law.
It's in fashion these days.

95
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:14,453
You'll look nice.

96
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:18,244
I am telling you, my son
is the tailor-incarnation of God.

97
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:19,161
Do you want it tighter?

98
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:20,661
The shoulder on this dress...

99
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:23,994
But this idiot doesn't
respect his own talent.

100
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:27,244
(Rap Song)

101
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:41,161
What is this boy, Khan sir?
What is he?

102
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:43,369
I've stitched thousands of clothes.

103
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,828
But the way his fingers
moves on the machine...

104
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:48,536
...feels like God's fingers
moving on the machine.

105
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:53,911
The way he handles the scissors sounds
like Goddess Saraswati's playing her Veena.

106
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:59,369
When he puts a thread in the needle,
I can hear conches resonating in my ears.

107
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:03,956
I am sure it's some
connection from his past life.

108
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:06,286
"I am the tailor of Heart."

109
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,828
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

110
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:16,078
"I am the tailor of Heart."

111
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,869
I'll be back in 10 minutes, dad.

112
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:21,578
Break time.

113
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,286
"I am the tailor of Heart."

114
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:52,619
Hi.

115
00:12:57,703 --> 00:12:58,286
Hi...

116
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,619
- Is your name Vicky?
- Yes.

117
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,618
I saw you last year at the festival.

118
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:06,659
Okay...

119
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:09,118
I've heard a lot about you.

120
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:14,534
I don't live here, but I come
every year during the festival.

121
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:16,576
I see... okay.

122
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:20,284
- Can you stitch a dress for me?
- Okay.

123
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,743
- How long?
- 2 weeks.

124
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,243
Can't you do it earlier?

125
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,368
How about 10 days?

126
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,951
I want it on the last
day of the festival.

127
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,826
To wear it during the
auspicious veneration.

128
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:42,993
Vicky, please.

129
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,576
Give it earlier.

130
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,868
It's okay.

131
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:53,534
I'll get it done by someone else.

132
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:54,368
Thank you.

133
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,451
Two days... Two...

134
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:03,868
- Two days.
- Thank you so much.

135
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:07,201
My measurements.

136
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,284
Take off the jacket.

137
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:18,701
Turn around.

138
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:20,951
Turn.

139
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:22,784
Again.

140
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:26,784
Done.

141
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,159
Ohh...

142
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,034
Thank you.

143
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,243
I'll be visiting the
temple in the evening.

144
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:41,576
Good.

145
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:48,909
For the evening veneration.

146
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:49,743
Very good.

147
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:00,201
Visiting the temple...

148
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:01,284
Okay.

149
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:11,743
(Religious venerations)

150
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:22,743
One.

151
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:35,951
Saw?

152
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:41,784
She doesn't even look at you, and
you can already hear wedding bells.

153
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:44,868
And you're Mister know-it-all,
aren't you?

154
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:48,826
Whenever I pass through her lane,
she always looks at me.

155
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,034
No, she doesn't, she stares at you.

156
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,534
Are you all right?

157
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:01,076
Will you say something? What happened?

158
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:05,076
- Love at first eye-sight.
- First eye-sight.

159
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:06,868
Love at first sight.

160
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,121
We both attended the English
Speaking course together.

161
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,951
Don't try to be Shakespeare.

162
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:12,618
Who is the girl?

163
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,618
The same girl who attended
the festival last year.

164
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:16,201
The one with brown eyes.

165
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:19,201
- One with the long hair.
- Yeah...

166
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:21,159
The one you bragged about last year?

167
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:23,368
I wasn't bragging.

168
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:25,909
She came out of nowhere
like a cool breeze.

169
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,868
Took my hand and said...

170
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:30,618
"Vicky, please!"

171
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:31,826
She held your hand.

172
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:32,826
Ba***

173
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,534
- And she even said please?
- Yes.

174
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,534
He is lying and you believe him.

175
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:37,826
Swear on my sewing machine.

176
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,868
She held your hand and said,
Vicky, please.

177
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:43,993
"Vicky, please!"

178
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:45,784
Vicky, please!

179
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:48,451
"Vicky, please!"

180
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,201
That's what I am saying,
Vicky, please.

181
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:51,576
You have no emotions at all.

182
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:52,243
Give me your hand.

183
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:55,701
"Vicky, please!"

184
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:57,618
Now that's emotion.

185
00:16:58,409 --> 00:16:59,659
But why you?

186
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:00,743
She wants me to stitch a dress.

187
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:02,451
Stitch a dress.

188
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:04,243
I have a readymade dress shop.

189
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,993
Who gets dresses stitched nowadays.

190
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:08,826
You idiot, stitched dresses
have a different charisma.

191
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,534
And love is never readymade.

192
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:14,326
It's always tailor-made.

193
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,743
Right.

194
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:17,701
"Vicky, please!"

195
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,951
Bro put it on my tab.

196
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,534
Jealous.

197
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,368
She held this hand.

198
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:26,326
Smell it.

199
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,118
Sunflower.

200
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:31,118
I think you should start
planning your wedding.

201
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,368
Even I can hear wedding bells, Jana.

202
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:35,993
Hey, ...snap out of your dream world.

203
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:38,034
Today is the first
day of the festival.

204
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:41,534
Lokesh is throwing a
party at his uncle's home.

205
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:44,326
So we're going to have
a ball for the next four nights.

206
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:45,576
Nobody be late.

207
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:47,618
Meaning party all night and,
in the morning...

208
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:48,326
Full tight.

209
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:49,368
Right.

210
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:50,451
But that's in the morning.

211
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:56,659
"Just tell me why
do you throw tantrums."

212
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,951
"I can follow you around
like your crazy lover."

213
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,868
"I feel a little shy to convey."

214
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:09,576
"But, I want to sleep in your arms."

215
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:13,451
"I've been telling
you since February came."

216
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:17,201
"Darling,
step out of Chanderi for me."

217
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:20,451
"Come over to my mansion."

218
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:31,534
"Come over to my mansion."

219
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:39,451
"Come over to my mansion."

220
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:50,368
"Come over to my mansion."

221
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:58,326
"Come over to my mansion."

222
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,326
You guys go ahead,
I'll join you later.

223
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:01,784
What are you planning to do out here?

224
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,118
My heart's a little restless.

225
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,243
I guess I'll just sit here and pray.

226
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,243
What's wrong with you, Vicky? Why
are you feeling so religious today?

227
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:08,451
That dancer from Bhopal
must have arrived too.

228
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:09,368
I've been waiting
for a year to see her.

229
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,493
- Let's go...
- Jana, you just go.

230
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,201
- I'll come later...
- Hold on.

231
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:15,618
He's going to see that girl.

232
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:16,701
One who said "Vicky Please".

233
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:18,243
And he's making excuses to us.

234
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:19,993
Is sister-in-law coming?

235
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:20,993
Then we'll wait too.

236
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,826
- What?
- No one's coming.

237
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:24,659
- I'll get the offerings for you.
- What offerings.

238
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,284
Stop making excuses, Vicky.

239
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,173
Remember, females have been
the reason for the downfall of men.

240
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:28,868
What?

241
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:31,118
It was a female who disrupted
Vishwamitra's penance.

242
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,618
And I am not Vishwamitra.

243
00:19:32,698 --> 00:19:33,784
And I am not looking for a boon.

244
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:37,159
I am not standing on one leg and waiting
for some Meneka to disrupt my penance.

245
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:37,909
What do you think?

246
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:38,826
You explain to him.

247
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:39,701
He's talking nonsense.

248
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:40,826
Take him with you, Jana.

249
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,034
This is not about any girl.

250
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:43,201
Let's go, Bittu.

251
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:44,826
Go on.

252
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:45,534
Come soon.

253
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,576
You too.
- Come on.

254
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:47,034
I'm coming.

255
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:47,659
Not you too.

256
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:48,659
Jana.

257
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:49,743
Go on.

258
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:50,784
Why did you say yes?

259
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:33,201
Hi.

260
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:34,659
Hi.

261
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:36,368
Hello.

262
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,659
I thought you didn't understand.

263
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:42,534
No, I understood,
but it takes me a little time to...

264
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,201
I mean I've very
little experience in...

265
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:46,784
I...I...

266
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:50,909
- Do you have a problem in speaking?
- No. Why?

267
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:52,659
Because if you do, it can be treated.

268
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:55,368
No, no, I can speak pretty well.

269
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:00,784
Peacock.

270
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:02,076
Peacock is our National bird.

271
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,326
Peacock has a long and sharp beak.

272
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:04,534
The Peacock is around 1.5 feet tall.

273
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:05,409
The Peacock is a beautiful bird.

274
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,034
The Peacock's feather has many colors.

275
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:08,993
Some people believe when the female
peacock drinks the male peacock's tear...

276
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:10,121
...then a baby peacock is born.

277
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:11,368
When the Peacock dances
during the monsoons...

278
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:12,659
...people are enchanted
to see the sight.

279
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:13,993
Just like I was
enchanted when I saw you...

280
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:18,659
Sorry.

281
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,576
By the way,
you're looking really nice tonight.

282
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,201
Even you're looking...alright.

283
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:28,368
Thank you.

284
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:33,163
- You're late. The veneration is over.
- Is it?

285
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:34,159
Yes.

286
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,534
I didn't realize I was late.

287
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,243
It's the ambiance.

288
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,409
But I will inform you before
the veneration starts tomorrow.

289
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,326
I will call you.

290
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,118
Store your number on this.

291
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:46,659
I don't carry a mobile.

292
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:47,743
You don't.

293
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,326
Okay.

294
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:55,743
So if I...or anyone else wants
to talk to you, or call you...

295
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:56,701
...then how to do that?

296
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:58,576
I don't know about others, but...

297
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,159
...if you want to talk, then...

298
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:04,243
Then?

299
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,868
Just think about me.
And I'll come over.

300
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:11,951
Fine, I will do that.

301
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:16,284
Letter.

302
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:18,326
"To Vicky."

303
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:19,326
For me?

304
00:22:20,284 --> 00:22:20,826
No.

305
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:22,784
Read it tomorrow morning,
after you've freshened up.

306
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:24,951
After...

307
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:27,868
Okay.

308
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:29,118
Thank you.

309
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:35,743
By the way, it's quite late, isn't it?

310
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:37,993
It's dark everywhere.

311
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,534
I wait for this darkness.

312
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:45,993
Okay...

313
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:52,243
FIRST NIGHT

314
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:57,201
What's the point of owning
a bike if you can't afford fuel?

315
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,201
Do you have a problem with petrol?

316
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,243
It's always getting over.

317
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:02,201
Forget the petrol.

318
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:03,368
Think about Vicky.

319
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,201
Stop fighting, Bittu.

320
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,909
It was his good luck,
that he found a girl.

321
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,243
But he could've introduced us as well.

322
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:10,076
Why isn't he introducing us to her?

323
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:11,534
I think there is no
girl in the first place.

324
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:12,993
And if there is one,
then there's something wrong with her.

325
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,284
What was that sound?

326
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:16,451
What sound?
I've been speaking all this time?

327
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:17,784
What sound did you hear?

328
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:19,701
There, I heard it again.

329
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:20,909
What?

330
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,076
- Brother Rudra.
- Hello.

331
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:24,993
Hello, brother Rudra.

332
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,243
- Are you two in your right mind?
- Yes, we are.

333
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:29,576
- Where are you two going at this hour?
- Why?

334
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:30,493
What happened?

335
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,993
The festival has begun.

336
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:34,784
She will be out
hunting for the next four days.

337
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:35,784
Who?

338
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:38,451
She.

339
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:42,368
Stree.

340
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,784
Stop scaring him, brother Rudra.

341
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:47,784
I am not scaring him,
just warning you.

342
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:53,118
Look, our city is the
only place in this world...

343
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:58,118
...where no male steps out alone
during these days of the festival.

344
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:02,868
She abducts male,
leaving only his clothes behind.

345
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:04,034
Only his clothes.

346
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,368
It's just that I like you two,
you two are like family...

347
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:09,659
...that's why I was telling you,
otherwise...

348
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:12,076
Brother Rudra, please tell us.

349
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,284
Form a triangle. Form a triangle.

350
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:14,909
Come here.

351
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:18,326
What is that?

352
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:19,243
Beer.

353
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,701
All right. I have mine.

354
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:26,034
Yes.

355
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:32,493
There are certain rules
to escape the wrath of Stree.

356
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:35,201
Rule no. 1.

357
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:41,576
Under no circumstances, and I mean
none... don't step out of the house alone.

358
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:48,243
And only those men are safe, who have
written outside their home, O Stree...

359
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:49,409
...Come tomorrow.

360
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:51,326
Rule no. 2.

361
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:57,743
If in case you've to step out, then don't
try to be a lion, be a wolf instead.

362
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,034
- Wolf?
- Why?

363
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:02,409
- Travel in packs, not alone.
- I see.

364
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:03,993
Rule no. 3.

365
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:08,284
If you ever come across the Stree...

366
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:11,326
...then she will first
call out your name.

367
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,076
Hello, Tom-Dick-Harry.

368
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:16,201
What do you do?

369
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:19,159
Take off your slippers,
hold it in your hand, and...

370
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,368
- Run!
- No!

371
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:23,743
No running.

372
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:26,201
Keep walking.

373
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,451
Do what?

374
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,201
Keep walking.

375
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:31,368
Then she will call out to you again.

376
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:33,201
This time with more passion.

377
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:34,868
And what do you do?

378
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,076
Keep walking.

379
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,576
Then she will call out to you again,
for the third time.

380
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:39,284
With an enchanting, alluring voice.

381
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:40,659
Like an angel.

382
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:48,201
"Embrace me now... because this
night may not come again."

383
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:50,409
That's the kind of
emotions you'll feel.

384
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:53,243
Your breathing will get faster,
your heart will start pounding.

385
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:55,659
Bedroom. Bedroom. Bedroom
will be the only thing on your mind.

386
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:57,243
And what do you do?

387
00:25:57,326 --> 00:25:59,118
- Keep walking.
- No.

388
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:06,534
No man could ever resist the Stree
when she calls out for the third time.

389
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:10,451
You will start losing
control over yourself.

390
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:12,451
And as soon as you turn around...

391
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:15,534
Gone!

392
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,284
But brother Rudra,
there must be some way.

393
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:22,243
Yes.

394
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,534
Rule no. 4.

395
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,118
And the most important thing to
remember if you want to escape the Stree.

396
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:31,118
At any point...

397
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:34,493
Yes, Shama.

398
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:35,951
What?

399
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,909
You're coming into my life.

400
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:39,618
I am coming right over.

401
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,101
Brother Rudra.

402
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,185
You didn't finish the 4th rule.

403
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:54,871
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

404
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,330
Don't make a noise.

405
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,038
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

406
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:08,080
- Wait a minute.
- No!

407
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:10,913
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

408
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:32,871
Bittu.

409
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:36,246
Jana, look.

410
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:37,538
What?

411
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:38,288
Someone's out there.

412
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:56,288
Bittu. Wait.

413
00:27:56,538 --> 00:27:57,496
Stop.

414
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,746
Bittu.

415
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:02,705
Stop Bittu, for your mother's sake.

416
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:06,955
- Why are you running?
- Because you're running.

417
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:09,496
Come on.
- Come.

418
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,705
What was that?
- I haven't the slightest clue.

419
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,163
Don't tell Vicky anything.
or he'll make fun of us.

420
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,163
Do you understand or not?

421
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:17,496
Do you understand?

422
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,038
Where were you two?

423
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:21,871
What happened?

424
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:23,080
- Huh!
- Nothing.

425
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:24,246
What...

426
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:38,496
"Oh, my silly beloved..."

427
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,455
"...snap out of your illusion."

428
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:41,996
"Stop being afraid."

429
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,496
"Stop making gestures
from a distance."

430
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,080
"Open the door to
your heart wide apart..."

431
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:50,246
"...and say it out loud."

432
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,830
"Don't be scared."

433
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,163
"Tell me what's your
plan for tonight."

434
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:58,871
"I want to be struck by lightning."

435
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:00,958
"Start a fire in my heart."

436
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:07,413
"If you come with us, baby and..."

437
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,913
"Shake your hips..."

438
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,246
"Shake it... Shake it... "

439
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,455
"Shake it... Shake it... "

440
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:14,663
"Cross your eyes...with us."

441
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:16,163
"Cross your eyes..."

442
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:17,455
"Cross your eyes...with us."

443
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:19,580
"Shake your hips..."

444
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:21,121
"Shake it... Shake it... "

445
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:22,413
"Shake it... Shake it... "

446
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,830
"Cross your eyes..."

447
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:26,080
"Cross your eyes...with us."

448
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:27,371
"Cross your eyes..."

449
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,413
"Take my heart, sweetheart..."

450
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
"Take my life..."

451
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,705
"But just..."

452
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:38,830
"Just...shake your hips for me."

453
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:41,205
"Take my heart, sweetheart..."

454
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:43,580
"Take my life..."

455
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:45,455
"But just..."

456
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:49,621
"Just...shake your hips for me."

457
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,871
"Shake it... Shake it... "

458
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,080
"Shake it... Shake it... "

459
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:54,538
"Cross your eyes..."

460
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:57,041
"Cross your eyes...with us."

461
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:58,371
"Cross your eyes..."

462
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:09,413
"These beautiful sights..."

463
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:10,621
"The stars in the sky..."

464
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:11,871
"...the season of spring
that's arrived..."

465
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:13,496
"...its all for you my love."

466
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:14,663
"My love..."

467
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,580
"...and my joys..."

468
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:18,496
"Take anything you want, sweetheart."

469
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,705
"These beautiful sights..."

470
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:20,955
"The stars in the sky..."

471
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:22,038
"...the season of spring
that's arrived..."

472
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,455
"...is all for you my love."

473
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:24,538
"My love..."

474
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:25,788
"...and my joys..."

475
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,958
"Take anything you want, sweetheart."

476
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:30,330
"I want to be struck by lightning."

477
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,580
"Start a fire in my heart."

478
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:38,371
"If you come with us, baby and..."

479
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:41,538
"Shake your hips..."

480
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:42,830
"Shake it... Shake it... "

481
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:44,038
"Shake it... Shake it... "

482
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,455
"Cross your eyes..."

483
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:47,746
"Cross your eyes...with us."

484
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,996
"Cross your eyes..."

485
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,455
"Shake your hips..."

486
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,871
"Shake it... Shake it... "

487
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:56,330
"Cross your eyes...with us."

488
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,871
"Cross your eyes...with us."

489
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:01,371
"Shake your hips..."

490
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:02,580
"Shake it... Shake it... "

491
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:03,830
"Shake it... Shake it... "

492
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:06,246
"Cross your eyes...with us."

493
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:07,496
"Cross your eyes...with us."

494
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:08,830
"Cross your eyes...with us."

495
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:09,788
Bye.

496
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,746
"Cross your eyes...with us."

497
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,746
"Shake your hips..."

498
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,038
"Shake it... Shake it... "

499
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:29,538
"Cross your eyes...with us."

500
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:37,038
"Shake it... Shake it... "

501
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,288
"Shake it... Shake it... "

502
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,538
Go on.

503
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,330
Go.

504
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:47,996
Come on. Come in.

505
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:49,955
She's my girlfriend.

506
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:52,455
I called her over for 'friendship'!

507
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:56,871
Come in.

508
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:58,663
This kind of 'Friendship'
isn't allowed in here.

509
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:00,538
Wasn't it enough
that we called a dancer?

510
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,455
Uncle will never approve of this.

511
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:04,746
Just go out and start
the generator, okay.

512
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:06,621
Why didn't you inform me before that
there are going to be more people?

513
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:07,955
Don't worry, darling.

514
00:33:08,132 --> 00:33:10,288
I've already reserved
a room for us upstairs.

515
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:11,121
No one's going to disturb us.

516
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,205
Just you and me. Me and you.

517
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:15,064
All alone in a room.

518
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,496
Well, if I had known, I would've
brought my friends along too.

519
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,663
And even your friends could've
snuggled up with them in a room.

520
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:21,110
Naughty.

521
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,163
Go upstairs.

522
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,080
Narender. Narender. Narender

523
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:28,955
"Shake it... Shake it... "

524
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:48,038
Come on.

525
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:51,705
- Are you carrying protection?
- Protection?

526
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,705
No protection, no friendship.

527
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:55,996
Oh... protection.

528
00:33:56,413 --> 00:34:00,163
"Shake it... Shake it... "

529
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,957
Hello. Who is it?

530
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:34,038
Jana. Are you carrying protection?

531
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:36,038
Protection.

532
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,788
No, I don't carry one.

533
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:39,705
Let's ask one of the guys.

534
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:43,413
Guys... is anyone carrying protection?

535
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:45,830
Come on, quickly.

536
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:47,330
Hurry up.

537
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:08,080
Lights back. Lights back. Lights back.

538
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:09,788
I got the stuff.

539
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:12,038
Why have you turned off the lights?

540
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:15,038
I like the lights on.
Because now I've protection.

541
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,204
This thing is older
than my grandfather.

542
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,163
Such a cheap quality.

543
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,246
Yes.

544
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,371
Narender.

545
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,455
- What happened?
- There...

546
00:35:33,538 --> 00:35:34,288
What?

547
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:35,330
Outside the window.

548
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:36,080
What?

549
00:35:36,163 --> 00:35:38,205
Someone dragged him out of the window.

550
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:38,958
Narender.

551
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:43,121
I came into the room and
someone dragged him outside.

552
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:43,871
Stay here.

553
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:44,663
You go check.

554
00:35:44,996 --> 00:35:45,996
Narender.

555
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:47,746
Narender.

556
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:52,038
Clothes.

557
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:53,496
Clothes?

558
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:55,580
Narender's clothes.

559
00:35:57,163 --> 00:35:58,705
Narender's clothes.

560
00:35:58,788 --> 00:35:59,746
Only his clothes.

561
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:01,121
Stree took him.

562
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,038
This is Stree's doing.

563
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,871
Whenever she takes any man with her,
she leaves his clothes behind.

564
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:17,621
But I don't understand one thing?
How did Stree come inside?

565
00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:18,455
I don't know.

566
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:20,955
I wrote "O Stree come
tomorrow" on the wall...

567
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,288
...so that we can party peacefully.

568
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:25,621
Someone erased it.

569
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:30,121
I think that someone
intentionally erased it.

570
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:31,830
Who peed on the wall?

571
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:33,121
Who was it?

572
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,371
Who was it?

573
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,080
Speak up now.

574
00:36:38,288 --> 00:36:40,913
- Vicky?
- You did it.

575
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,246
No, it wasn't me.

576
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:44,871
Oh really? Then who did this?

577
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,496
Right... you went out
in the middle of the dance.

578
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,080
You peed on the wall.

579
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:51,496
Yes, I did.

580
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,788
It didn't say no peeing here.

581
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:53,371
Get lost.

582
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:55,996
Why did you have to pee
there of all the places?

583
00:36:56,538 --> 00:36:59,371
My pee, my will,
I can pee anywhere I want.

584
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:01,788
We lost a friend because of you.

585
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:02,663
He's a junkie.

586
00:37:02,746 --> 00:37:04,038
He must be high and wandering around.

587
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,913
We won't hear anything
against our friend.

588
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:08,580
- You made him disappear.
- I didn't do anything.

589
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:11,496
You made him disappear.
You peed on the wall.

590
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,163
Just a second.

591
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,413
Stop! Stop! Stop, guys! Stop!

592
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,163
What's the point of beating up Jana?

593
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:24,746
Your friend's missing,
go look for him.

594
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,371
Stop ranting Stree.

595
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,288
It's pretty late.

596
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:42,788
Daddy must be waiting for me.

597
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:45,038
Even I didn't tell my
mom that I'm coming here.

598
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:49,288
Fine, let's come back tomorrow.

599
00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:07,080
Letter.

600
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,891
Here's the letter.

601
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:21,371
Brother, some madam's here to see you.

602
00:38:21,496 --> 00:38:21,871
Who is it?

603
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:22,621
Tell her to come back later.

604
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:23,663
It's her.

605
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:25,913
Take a look for yourself.

606
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:30,940
What the...

607
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:34,065
- Did you tell her that I am at home?
- I did, brother?

608
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,482
Come here.

609
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,982
What are you doing here?

610
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:44,024
- I want my money.
- What money?

611
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:46,107
Money for the 'friendship'.

612
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:48,649
Your friend didn't pay
me for the 'friendship'.

613
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:49,482
So?

614
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:50,482
So you're going to pay me.

615
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:51,607
Why will I pay?

616
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:55,899
I see... you pee on the
wall and I won't get my money.

617
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:57,940
Has the government
put a ban on my pee?

618
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:00,149
I can pee anywhere I want.

619
00:39:00,315 --> 00:39:01,149
Pay up quietly.

620
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:04,482
I heard that the
friendship never happen.

621
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:06,982
We were halfway through...

622
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:10,065
Please sister,
I don't have that kind of money.

623
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:11,024
I don't have money...

624
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:13,024
Look here, stop making excuses...

625
00:39:13,107 --> 00:39:15,732
...otherwise, I will come down
here with my friends and make a scene.

626
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:16,940
Calm down.

627
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,524
And, your father won't like it.

628
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,690
I have heard a lot about him.

629
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:22,524
How much do I pay, sister?

630
00:39:23,357 --> 00:39:25,482
She's collecting donation.

631
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:29,357
I think 3000 will be fine.

632
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:31,940
Take some lessons from him.

633
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:32,732
Jai Mata Di.

634
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:43,232
So mister, are you going to stand
around like this or put something on.

635
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,107
Take care of your son.

636
00:39:50,815 --> 00:39:51,982
He's bustling with energy.

637
00:39:57,024 --> 00:40:02,065
Son, I'm going to share a
really important experience of life.

638
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:07,357
Youth... is a weird phase.

639
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:12,190
The body bustles with vitality.

640
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:14,149
A tank full of energy.

641
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:20,399
And this energy... craves to come out.

642
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:24,607
But this body... is puzzled
about what to do or not to do.

643
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,232
And this restlessness...

644
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:32,774
...provokes it to have
friendship with the opposite sex.

645
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,232
Dad, I hope you know
what friendship means here.

646
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:36,982
Friendship.

647
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,690
Son, I was born in
this town before you.

648
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,190
I've had a lot of friendship
back in my days.

649
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,899
- You had friendships.
- I did.

650
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:52,232
Yes, but once I met your mother...

651
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:55,440
...she completely changed
my point of view.

652
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:57,857
The union of a male and a female...

653
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,690
- Listen to me.
- Go on.

654
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:03,524
The union of a male
and a female is pure.

655
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:04,899
It's auspicious.

656
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:07,815
Like the union of Heaven and Earth.

657
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:10,899
The confluence of Shiv and Shakti.

658
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:13,649
But why are you telling me all this?

659
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:17,357
I telling you so that
you don't pay for friendship.

660
00:41:17,524 --> 00:41:19,190
When did I pay for friendship?

661
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:24,482
- And what about her...
- Dad, she wasn't here for me.

662
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,524
I didn't pay for friendship.

663
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:27,899
Listen to me first.

664
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:33,524
My advice to you is that you must
wait for a companion...

665
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:38,565
...with whom you can enjoy this
process for the rest of your life.

666
00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:43,274
And learn to control this energy
bustling in your body till then.

667
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:48,232
And if you can't, then...

668
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:50,149
Then what?

669
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:52,190
Then be self-reliant.

670
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:54,482
Cater to your needs.

671
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:55,774
Meaning...

672
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:58,815
Meaning... yourself.

673
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,107
How, daddy?

674
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:01,190
I mean...

675
00:42:02,774 --> 00:42:03,274
I mean...

676
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,107
Loss of words?

677
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,232
Come on. Go out.

678
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,982
Listen...

679
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:08,607
Come on. Go out.

680
00:42:13,107 --> 00:42:14,190
Energy.

681
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:19,815
Where is my energy?

682
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:27,232
My dear Vicky.

683
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:32,440
If she's started with 'my dear'
then she will end it with 'with love'.

684
00:42:32,524 --> 00:42:33,107
Okay.

685
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:34,649
My dear Vicky, how are you?

686
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:36,357
What a stupid question?

687
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,524
She just met yesterday and
today she wants to know how you are.

688
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,274
Keep reading.

689
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:44,815
Honestly speaking I was
really happy to meet you.

690
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,982
After talking to you I felt like that
we've known each other for a long time.

691
00:42:54,565 --> 00:42:57,024
Since I retreated...

692
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,024
Returned.

693
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,190
Sorry, since I returned
after meeting you...

694
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:02,315
...I want to meet you again.

695
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,732
And this time when we meet,
my dear Vicky...

696
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:09,315
...can you bring these things for me?

697
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:10,357
PTO.

698
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:13,565
A quarter brandy.

699
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:15,149
Half a kilo of mutton.

700
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:17,482
A kilo of charred glass.

701
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:18,982
Thornapple flower.

702
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:20,899
Hair of a cat.

703
00:43:21,107 --> 00:43:22,399
- And...
- And?

704
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:25,107
The tail of a lizard!

705
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,232
Thanking you, with love.

706
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,649
With love. See...

707
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:30,899
What is this stupid stuff?

708
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:33,690
Who asks to get stuff like these?

709
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,027
Plus she drinks.

710
00:43:35,107 --> 00:43:36,107
So what if she drinks?

711
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:37,274
Sister-in-law is cool.

712
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,607
That's not the point.

713
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:41,357
She wants you to get
the tail of a lizard.

714
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,482
And you're a tailor,
not the ancestor of lizards.

715
00:43:44,742 --> 00:43:47,607
You're prepared to go on this impossible
mission because she told you.

716
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:49,690
Jana has been telling
to you to stitch a shirt for him.

717
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:50,357
But did you?

718
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,857
I have been telling
you to let's go to Goa.

719
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,649
But did you?

720
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,690
Trying to be a hero for the girl.

721
00:43:56,857 --> 00:43:58,024
You say something.

722
00:43:58,857 --> 00:43:59,774
What now?

723
00:44:00,149 --> 00:44:02,190
- She's asked so politely...
- So?

724
00:44:02,649 --> 00:44:03,565
Then I must get it.

725
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,232
What?

726
00:44:05,357 --> 00:44:06,357
It's very simple.

727
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:09,149
Guys always do what
girls tell them to.

728
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:09,774
That's it.

729
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,690
Shahjahan built the
Taj Mahal for his love.

730
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:47,065
And our brother
chasing cats and lizards.

731
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:50,732
Whoever imagined love would
fall to such levels in 500 years.

732
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,065
Tell me something, don't
you think something is wrong?

733
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,482
Right and wrong is just
a point of view, Bittu.

734
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:00,190
Don't try to be wise.

735
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,940
I am telling you,
I have a bad feeling about this.

736
00:45:06,107 --> 00:45:07,190
Something is wrong about this girl?

737
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,857
Got it. Got it. Got it.

738
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,399
Got it.

739
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:27,923
Come on, now hurry up.

740
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:29,632
That Stree already
took one male last night.

741
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:32,423
We must return home before
she comes out to hunt.

742
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:34,090
I am going as fast as I can.

743
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:35,382
Don't be scared.
I am with you.

744
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:37,882
You can't handle one woman, and
now you're scared of another.

745
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,257
Hello.

746
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,923
Jana, meet me right now.

747
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:22,673
Vicky!

748
00:46:24,923 --> 00:46:25,548
Vicky!

749
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:26,632
Hi.

750
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:28,173
Hello.

751
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:32,298
Sorry, I was too engrossed
in listening to music.

752
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:33,865
What do you listen to?

753
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
English.

754
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:36,657
Wow!

755
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:38,907
- Akon.
- Who?

756
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,157
Akon.

757
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:44,407
"Wanna be my Chammak Challo."

758
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:47,490
The guy's like Kumar
Sanu of his country.

759
00:46:47,782 --> 00:46:48,365
I see.

760
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:49,865
- You don't know?
- No.

761
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:51,199
I see.

762
00:46:52,657 --> 00:46:54,615
You missed the veneration again.

763
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:56,782
I guess I don't get
along with God too well.

764
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:58,657
Right. Right.

765
00:47:00,532 --> 00:47:01,532
I...

766
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:03,699
I brought this offering for you.

767
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:05,740
I'm fasting today.

768
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,199
Even offerings are not allowed.

769
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,657
I see.

770
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:11,990
Doesn't matter.

771
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:13,324
Whether you eat it or me,
it's the same.

772
00:47:15,157 --> 00:47:16,574
By the way, we can go inside.

773
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:18,282
I know the priest.

774
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:20,824
I can arrange for a
special veneration for you.

775
00:47:21,512 --> 00:47:23,532
And even make a donation
of 11 rupees in your name.

776
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:26,365
- Your name...
- Did you get the items on the list?

777
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,324
Yes.

778
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,824
I got everything you asked for.

779
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,324
You didn't tell me which brand
of brandy, so I got every brand.

780
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:38,157
But it's better this way.
You can try every brand, for variety.

781
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:40,699
And, I couldn't find a
cat with completely white hair.

782
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:42,282
She had mixed colors.

783
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:44,240
But what will you
do with all these things?

784
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:48,240
Are you going to ask
everything right now?

785
00:47:52,074 --> 00:47:53,199
Let's go someplace else.

786
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:57,324
- At this hour?
- Yes.

787
00:47:58,824 --> 00:47:59,657
Okay.

788
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:01,824
But where?

789
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,115
Let's go. I know a spot.

790
00:48:18,324 --> 00:48:20,449
"Fair...you're so fair."

791
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:23,365
"Like the moonlight that's
falling on earth."

792
00:48:23,865 --> 00:48:25,949
"Bad... very bad."

793
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:28,532
"The world's intentions are very bad."

794
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:31,240
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

795
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:33,907
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

796
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:36,699
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

797
00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:40,449
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

798
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:56,574
"This silky dress...that
you've worn tonight."

799
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:01,619
"When you smile...all
my sorrows get alleviated."

800
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:04,407
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

801
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,115
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

802
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,865
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

803
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:12,699
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

804
00:49:20,032 --> 00:49:21,740
- Vicky's gone tonight.
- Where?

805
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,449
Focus on my meaning.

806
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:26,865
I pondered over this a lot.

807
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:30,282
And the verdict I've
reached is pretty dangerous.

808
00:49:30,782 --> 00:49:31,907
What is your verdict?

809
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:36,782
You were a genius at school,
then how are you so slow in real life?

810
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:40,074
I go to the depth of every
matter and weigh it properly.

811
00:49:40,657 --> 00:49:42,115
My dear Pacific Ocean.

812
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,199
Why aren't your depths
showing you what I can see?

813
00:49:47,782 --> 00:49:48,699
This girl...

814
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,240
...comes once in
a year like an endangered species.

815
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,407
And always during the festival.

816
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,782
And do you know who else
shows up during the festival?

817
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,615
Who?

818
00:49:59,074 --> 00:49:59,740
Stree!

819
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,574
Mister, open your mind

820
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,115
Has anyone else seen
her except for Vicky?

821
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:11,490
No.

822
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,115
And what does she ask him
to get in her first love letter?

823
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:19,824
- Cat hair, lizard leg...
- Tail.

824
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,365
It's one and the same.

825
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:22,657
Who asks to get stuff like this?

826
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:25,740
He's not picking up.

827
00:50:25,824 --> 00:50:28,282
- Mister, turn off your phone.
- You shut your mouth.

828
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:29,782
And fill fuel worth 50 rupees.

829
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:30,699
50 again.

830
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:32,490
Why don't you ever put more?

831
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,282
Why don't you try
telling my father that?

832
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,157
You try calling him.

833
00:50:39,532 --> 00:50:41,407
He's gone to meet her,
I am telling you.

834
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:44,032
Our friend is in trouble, understand.

835
00:50:44,803 --> 00:50:46,115
Stree has laid a trap.

836
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:49,657
And our love hungry friend,
is heading straight for it.

837
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:51,615
He is actually cutting the calls.

838
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:54,490
Why do people become blind in love?

839
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:55,699
How would I know?

840
00:50:58,248 --> 00:50:59,907
You can be anyone you want,
but not a devotee.

841
00:51:00,115 --> 00:51:02,990
Where do you think the new couple would
have gone to spend some time alone?

842
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:03,740
The lake.

843
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:12,657
SECOND NIGHT

844
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,657
How do you know about this place?

845
00:51:22,365 --> 00:51:24,365
And why did we come here?

846
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,407
Because it's dark out here.
And no one comes here.

847
00:51:33,032 --> 00:51:33,865
Dark.

848
00:51:37,907 --> 00:51:39,157
He isn't here either.

849
00:51:39,824 --> 00:51:40,699
Where could he be?

850
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:43,324
I am telling you,
we'll only find his clothes today.

851
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,824
Your clothes are very nice.

852
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:51,157
Where did you buy them?

853
00:51:51,657 --> 00:51:53,115
I designed them myself.

854
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:55,657
People call me the Manish
Malhotra of Chanderi.

855
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,657
Isn't it too tight?

856
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:01,199
It's just my body...

857
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:02,490
How do you open it?

858
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,365
- Listen.
- Yeah...

859
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:09,365
- Shall we leave?
- Why?

860
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:11,990
- Are you scared too?
- No.

861
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:13,824
I am not scared of
any ghosts or spirits.

862
00:52:14,115 --> 00:52:16,907
But how long are we going
to waste our time on a selfish guy?

863
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,699
But he's our friend.

864
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:23,615
Bittu.

865
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,824
Wait.

866
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:27,657
So what else do you
stitch at your shop?

867
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:30,574
Just skirts and long dresses,
or anything else?

868
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:32,449
Actually, we make everything.

869
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:33,699
Completely ladies fashion.

870
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:37,282
Skirts, tops, traditional dresses,
tunics. Midis, minis.

871
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:42,199
Short dresses, long dresses,
kaftans, fringe, party dresses.

872
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:49,282
Mirror work,
stonework, designer panty, nightfall.

873
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,490
Nighty fall.

874
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,699
That's it.

875
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:56,740
When will you give me my dress?

876
00:52:57,365 --> 00:53:00,407
It completely slipped off my mind.

877
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:06,907
- I troubled you a lot, didn't I?
- Of course not.

878
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:08,574
It was no trouble at all.

879
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:11,699
And anything for you.

880
00:53:16,365 --> 00:53:18,740
I should have taken
your measurements that day.

881
00:53:20,115 --> 00:53:21,824
I thought you did.

882
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:27,490
Normally I am good at this,
but in your case, I goofed up.

883
00:53:34,865 --> 00:53:35,782
So take it now.

884
00:53:36,782 --> 00:53:39,115
But I don't have my measuring tape.

885
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,157
Can't you take my
measurement without it?

886
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,074
I can, but...

887
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:45,824
Should I?

888
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,032
Take it.

889
00:53:47,782 --> 00:53:48,490
Should I?

890
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:50,074
Take it.

891
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,615
Okay, I will.

892
00:55:33,449 --> 00:55:34,282
Hello.

893
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:36,282
Where are you?

894
00:55:36,365 --> 00:55:37,240
Hello.

895
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,199
- Bittu.
- Yes.

896
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:49,240
I am missing my mom.

897
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,449
Shall we go back?

898
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:54,949
You're right.

899
00:55:55,907 --> 00:56:00,574
- Parents are more important than friends.
- You're right.

900
00:56:01,115 --> 00:56:02,407
Let's go back.

901
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,115
What happened?

902
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:12,782
Let me check.

903
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:21,577
What?

904
00:56:21,657 --> 00:56:23,157
I think we're out of petrol.

905
00:56:23,574 --> 00:56:25,699
I told you, didn't I?

906
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,532
Tell me one thing...is
your father a menial labor?

907
00:56:29,574 --> 00:56:30,615
You own a big shop in the city.

908
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:33,157
From Manish Malhotra to Manish Behl.

909
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:33,907
What is this?

910
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,365
Whether you fill 50 rupees
petrol at a time or fill your tank.

911
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:38,740
It's still the same.

912
00:56:38,824 --> 00:56:40,532
The petrol pump is close-by. Push.

913
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,490
It's your bike, isn't it?

914
00:56:42,615 --> 00:56:43,199
You push.

915
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:44,324
Why should I?

916
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,907
I've been pushing
it since we were kids.

917
00:56:46,157 --> 00:56:47,074
What's wrong with you?

918
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:48,574
That Stree is wandering
around the city.

919
00:56:48,824 --> 00:56:51,240
And we're stuck in
the middle of nowhere.

920
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,699
And you want to know what's wrong?

921
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:54,240
Mom clearly said that
I should come back soon.

922
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:58,407
If I don't hurry up,
she will lock the doors and sleep.

923
00:56:58,782 --> 00:56:59,282
What now?

924
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:01,032
Push!

925
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,324
Mummy!

926
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,074
Hello.

927
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:19,740
Where are you?

928
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:22,740
Madam.

929
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,157
Where are you going?

930
00:57:49,324 --> 00:57:50,949
I knew it, selfish rascal.

931
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:52,199
What's wrong with you today?

932
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:53,990
I am your friend, not your slave.

933
00:57:54,157 --> 00:57:56,699
First I go over to your house so that you
can tuck yourself neatly under the blanket.

934
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:59,407
- And then I go home all alone.
- But we do that all the time.

935
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,074
Not today.

936
00:58:00,157 --> 00:58:00,657
Fine, let it be.

937
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,740
I've been listening to
your nonsense for a long time.

938
00:58:01,824 --> 00:58:02,199
Go on.

939
00:58:02,282 --> 00:58:03,074
Fine, you don't have to.

940
00:58:03,282 --> 00:58:04,032
Get going.

941
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:05,199
Weird guy.

942
00:58:06,074 --> 00:58:08,615
- I hope Stree abducts you.
- Same to you.

943
00:59:45,532 --> 00:59:46,282
Son!

944
00:59:46,657 --> 00:59:48,240
No...no...

945
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:12,157
If you ever come across the Stree,
this is what you do.

946
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,282
Jana

947
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:24,490
No.

948
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,824
Don't turn around.

949
01:00:27,532 --> 01:00:28,907
Keep walking.

950
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,949
Jana

951
01:00:48,324 --> 01:00:50,990
Jana

952
01:01:48,865 --> 01:01:51,990
No... No... No!

953
01:02:02,115 --> 01:02:04,365
Jana

954
01:02:05,414 --> 01:02:08,365
Jana. My Jana.

955
01:02:09,657 --> 01:02:11,365
Curse that Stree.

956
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:15,115
My Jana never even touched any female.

957
01:02:15,657 --> 01:02:17,949
And now she must be
sitting on top on him.

958
01:02:18,686 --> 01:02:23,282
I told him a thousand times not to hang
around with these worthless friends.

959
01:02:23,951 --> 01:02:26,490
Jana could've had a good job.

960
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:30,449
But these rascal friends spoiled him.

961
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:33,574
Lord, give him strength.

962
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:36,324
Give my son strength.

963
01:02:36,574 --> 01:02:38,199
I know you went to meet her.

964
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:43,115
Stop getting jealous of my love life.
Think about Jana.

965
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,699
Did anything weird happen?

966
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,365
Weird how?

967
01:02:47,782 --> 01:02:50,615
Anything at all,
when you were with her?

968
01:02:51,074 --> 01:02:52,907
What did you two do?

969
01:02:53,949 --> 01:02:54,782
Why?

970
01:02:55,074 --> 01:02:56,115
Just tell me.

971
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:00,199
We went to the temple.

972
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,282
Then to the river banks.

973
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:05,574
We were just sitting and chatting,
and then she disappeared.

974
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,199
And didn't return.

975
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:08,240
I knew it.

976
01:03:10,074 --> 01:03:11,324
I knew it, Vicky.

977
01:03:11,532 --> 01:03:12,074
What?

978
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,199
- That your girlfriend is a ghost.
- What do you mean ghost?

979
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,199
Jana and I were coming to save you.

980
01:03:17,282 --> 01:03:19,949
- And she took Jana instead.
- What nonsense.

981
01:03:20,365 --> 01:03:23,240
Snap out of your dream world, Romeo.

982
01:03:23,657 --> 01:03:27,949
Why does your girlfriend show up only
during the festival, and then disappear?

983
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:32,032
She asks you to get ingredients
for black magic in her love letter.

984
01:03:32,824 --> 01:03:34,074
Have you ever seen her feet?

985
01:03:34,324 --> 01:03:35,365
Are they straight or crooked?

986
01:03:35,657 --> 01:03:36,532
Did you ask her name?

987
01:03:36,615 --> 01:03:37,782
Do you know her phone number?

988
01:03:39,657 --> 01:03:42,574
Has anyone seen her except for you?
Because I haven't.

989
01:03:45,324 --> 01:03:46,282
But...

990
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:52,449
OH F***

991
01:03:57,699 --> 01:04:00,115
I just don't understand one thing.

992
01:04:00,907 --> 01:04:02,532
How does she enter the temple?

993
01:04:03,074 --> 01:04:05,074
Are these ghosts atheists?

994
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,032
Aren't they scared?

995
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:11,282
She never enters the temple,
always stays out.

996
01:04:11,907 --> 01:04:14,032
She doesn't take the offerings either.

997
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:25,157
Vicky, for the first time
I am feeling sad for you.

998
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:29,532
Because of all the things in the
world... you fell in love with a witch.

999
01:04:33,574 --> 01:04:37,574
Go and ask her,
your Stree, where she took Jana.

1000
01:04:38,907 --> 01:04:40,240
I miss him.

1001
01:04:43,157 --> 01:04:44,449
One more thing.

1002
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,824
Don't tell her that
Bittu told you all this.

1003
01:04:49,782 --> 01:04:51,490
Otherwise, she might abduct me too.

1004
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:28,292
Warning! Warning! Warning!

1005
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,667
An important piece of warning
for all the males in the city.

1006
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,834
Stree is out hunting
and the males are in threat.

1007
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:41,584
The method to save yourself
from Stree is written in this paper.

1008
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,292
Remember it.

1009
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:45,709
- Show me.
- No, it's not for you.

1010
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:46,459
You're safe.

1011
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:50,625
If you ever run into Stree...

1012
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:53,292
...then there's just
one way to escape

1013
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:55,875
Under no circumstance will you...

1014
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,500
Hello!

1015
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:57,292
Hello!

1016
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:00,754
How do you know so
much about the Stree?

1017
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:02,250
I know everything.

1018
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,542
Tripple BA, Double MA,
literarian, musician, teacher.

1019
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,084
I have all these degrees.

1020
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:10,712
I spent my childhood
amongst crocodiles.

1021
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:11,959
Rudra Book Depot.

1022
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:14,542
But why do we write
"O Stree Come tomorrow"?

1023
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:15,917
We can write something else.

1024
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:16,917
Like, "Stree, never come back again".

1025
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,834
As long as it's working,
let it continue.

1026
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,959
And by the way,
if we ever have an unwanted guest...

1027
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,750
...we don't directly say "Get
lost and don't come back" to him.

1028
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:27,459
We politely say "Come back tomorrow".

1029
01:06:27,542 --> 01:06:31,334
I've heard that the Stree first
s**** her prey before killing him.

1030
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:34,000
That's the system with
female scorpions too.

1031
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:36,875
She swallows the male
scorpion which she mates with.

1032
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:40,375
Listen wise guy, please don't
share your knowledge with us.

1033
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:41,834
Leave all that aside.

1034
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:44,209
Tell us what's the solution to it.

1035
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,500
My wife says that I should
wear a saree when I step out.

1036
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:48,959
Please don't spread such rumors.

1037
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,584
Or soon we'll see everyone
in our city draped in a saree.

1038
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:53,709
"My beloved's arrived" type.

1039
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:54,375
No, no.

1040
01:06:54,459 --> 01:06:56,417
How does she know everyone's name?

1041
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:58,584
Because all our databases
are linked to her.

1042
01:06:58,667 --> 01:06:59,375
I see.

1043
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:00,792
Shut up, idiot.

1044
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,834
You see, two youngsters
have already been abducted.

1045
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,209
Be alert.

1046
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:08,334
Poor guy was abducted from the town
square. He was such a healthy boy

1047
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:10,459
Wasn't he your friend too, Vicky?

1048
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,250
But not anymore. Not anymore.

1049
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:19,042
- Keep the glass down.
- What?

1050
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,209
Trying to be over smart. Huh!

1051
01:07:23,417 --> 01:07:23,917
Get lost.

1052
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,167
He's still alive.
My friend isn't dead.

1053
01:07:59,334 --> 01:08:00,125
Brother.

1054
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,750
Sir. Sir.

1055
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,055
See for yourself.

1056
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,000
Brother Vicky, you are amazing.

1057
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:37,042
You stitched this dress in 31 minutes.

1058
01:08:37,334 --> 01:08:38,125
Sir.

1059
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:06,000
- What happened?
- No... it's nothing.

1060
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:31,334
No, I haven't done anything.
I didn't do anything.

1061
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,959
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1062
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:35,667
What happened?

1063
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,084
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1064
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:38,750
Vicky, what's wrong?

1065
01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:42,167
What happened?

1066
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:49,042
It's nothing.

1067
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,667
You look like you saw a ghost.

1068
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:52,375
Ghost.

1069
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:53,834
No... no ghost.

1070
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:54,667
It's nothing.

1071
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,417
- You okay right, Vicky?
- Yes, I am okay.

1072
01:09:57,709 --> 01:09:58,375
I am all right.

1073
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,625
- Is it ready?
- Yes, it is.

1074
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:06,542
Thank you.

1075
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:07,500
It's all right.

1076
01:10:11,209 --> 01:10:12,417
Shall we go out somewhere?

1077
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:13,959
Out?

1078
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:16,417
I'll take you to another
one of my favorite spots.

1079
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:17,792
No!

1080
01:10:17,959 --> 01:10:19,334
This is my favorite place.

1081
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,959
- Let's sit here.
- Okay.

1082
01:10:24,042 --> 01:10:33,375
(Hanuman Chalisa)

1083
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,125
There's magic in your fingers.

1084
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,709
And even in my feet.

1085
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:43,667
I can turn it around like this.

1086
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,959
Can you turn your feet around too?

1087
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:50,542
- Is there a problem?
- No. What problem?

1088
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:51,750
There is no problem.

1089
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:58,750
Can I ask you a question
for my personal knowledge?

1090
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,792
Do you believe in ghosts and spirits?

1091
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,417
I've heard that a woman
wanders in this city at night.

1092
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:08,792
Called Stree.

1093
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:10,667
She is a witch.

1094
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,875
She abducts males.

1095
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:14,959
Strips them.

1096
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:19,209
I know she must have a good reason.

1097
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,917
No one is born as a witch. Right.

1098
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:24,042
I understand.

1099
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:28,959
My friend Jana,
he's disappeared as well.

1100
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,417
He's a very nice guy.

1101
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:33,250
People say that Stree took him.

1102
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,750
Have you seen Jana?

1103
01:11:44,084 --> 01:11:45,334
Can I ask you a question?

1104
01:11:47,042 --> 01:11:50,209
Its personal,
but don't take it personally.

1105
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,834
Are you...

1106
01:11:54,584 --> 01:11:55,334
Are you...

1107
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:57,167
I mean not intentionally.

1108
01:11:57,334 --> 01:11:59,917
Are you... Stree.

1109
01:12:01,209 --> 01:12:02,500
I just asked.

1110
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:03,750
I don't have a problem.

1111
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,084
I was just confirming.

1112
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:07,042
If you're a ghost...

1113
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:09,167
I mean you are what you are.

1114
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,542
If it's anything like that,
please tell me now.

1115
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,667
I'll just be prepared mentally.
That's all.

1116
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:22,500
Uncle.

1117
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,875
Do you see that girl standing there?

1118
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:28,625
What girl?

1119
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:30,125
That one...

1120
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:31,375
That...

1121
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:44,542
(Song Other languages)

1122
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:46,584
You should listen
to your friends as well.

1123
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:52,834
But how can a beautiful
woman like her be Stree?

1124
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,625
Was she beautiful?

1125
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:57,500
Sorry.

1126
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,167
Think about Jana.

1127
01:13:01,459 --> 01:13:02,625
What condition will he be in?

1128
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,417
Lying somewhere naked in this cold.

1129
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:09,167
What now?

1130
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:15,875
We'll have to find someone who's
an expert in such absurd folklores.

1131
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,375
You came to the right place.

1132
01:13:27,459 --> 01:13:28,584
I know everything.

1133
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:32,042
- Doesn't get me high.
- Then why do you drink?

1134
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:34,459
In Shama's memory, that's why.

1135
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:36,084
Leave Shama aside.

1136
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,042
And tell us what you know about Stree.

1137
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:40,292
I am doing research on Madam Stree.

1138
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,000
And like they say, the fruits
of hard work is always sweet.

1139
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:43,584
Yeah...

1140
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:45,334
- And I got one too.
- Sweet fruit.

1141
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:46,875
No. Book.

1142
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:47,917
Book.

1143
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,792
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1144
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:53,667
Here you go.

1145
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:00,042
Ohh...

1146

Ka Su...

1148
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:05,042
- Are you researching on this?
- Not that.

1149
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,250
This one. This is it.

01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:08,000
This is Chanderi Puran.

1151
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,959
Chanderi has its own manuscript.

1152
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:13,542
Our city is older than you think.

1153
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,542
The spot where you're sitting.

1154
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:17,792
If we dig beneath it,
you'll find the Harappa Civilization.

1155
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:18,712
Right here.

1156
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:19,500
Harappa.

1157
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:21,417
You don't say.
Exactly under this spot.

1158
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:26,125
So look, Chanderi Puran
written by Shankar Shashtri.

1159
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,375
Here we go.

1160
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:31,959
Many years ago.

1161
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:38,042
Many years ago there used to be
a beautiful and attractive courtesan.

1162
01:14:38,459 --> 01:14:41,000
Every male in the city
would dream about her.

1163
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:46,417
Finally, she found a man
who loved soul and not her body.

1164
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:47,709
True love.

1165
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:49,542
And talk about your generation.

1166
01:14:49,709 --> 01:14:51,167
Love at first sight.

1167
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,625
Then your place or mine.

1168
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,334
What direction is this
generation heading in?

1169
01:14:54,417 --> 01:14:55,334
Brother Rudra.

1170
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:56,500
Don't try to be a dad.

1171
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:58,334
- Please read ahead.
- Yes.

1172
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:00,959
They both decided to get married.

1173
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,750
But the other males
couldn't tolerate their joy.

1174
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:09,625
And before their wedding night, some
jealous people murdered both of them.

1175
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:12,959
Since then she has been
wandering in this city.

1176
01:15:13,417 --> 01:15:17,667
Looking for her love,
and complete her wedding night.

1177
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:21,917
And this can only happen when
she will find her lost love again.

1178
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:24,042
Such insolent people.

1179
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,542
They can't tolerate
someone's happiness.

1180
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:28,584
Every female has the
right to find her true love.

1181
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,084
Brother Rudra. Brother Rudra.

1182
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,417
We can have this debate later.

1183
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:35,250
First, tell us if there's
a method to stop Stree?

1184
01:15:36,209 --> 01:15:38,250
There I just one way
to get rid of Stree...

1185
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:39,709
- Yeah
- Turn the page.

1186
01:15:40,584 --> 01:15:41,917
- Turn the page.
- Okay.

1187
01:15:45,084 --> 01:15:47,875
The city's main business was silk.

1188
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:49,754
People had such high
Scarcity for education,

1189
01:15:49,834 --> 01:15:51,959
...that they actually believed
that the moon was their uncle.

1190
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:53,167
The main...

1191
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:56,334
How come Shastri turn
up in west from east.

1192
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,417
After page 66 there is page 80.

1193
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:00,334
Where are the rest of the pages?

1194
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:03,084
This is why I don't let anyone in.

1195
01:16:03,334 --> 01:16:06,000
Children tear pages from
the book and make paper boats.

1196
01:16:06,084 --> 01:16:07,709
How will we save Jana now?

1197
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:08,584
Just a minute.

1198
01:16:10,084 --> 01:16:11,334
I've seen this place.

1199
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:12,875
- You have?
- Yes.

1200
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,667
Where?

1201
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:16,042
Above the hill.

1202
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:18,625
- We should go there.
- Then let's go.

1203
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:20,125
- We might find something here.
- Yes.

1204
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:22,750
- Go. Go on you two.
- What "go"?

1205
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,125
- You must come along too.
- Me?

1206
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:28,209
- Brother Rudra, you have done research.
- Of course.

1207
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:28,625
I see...

1208
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,417
Wait a minute then.

1209
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,959
Let me take a sip. Take this along.

1210
01:16:32,917 --> 01:16:34,375
Shama, I am going.

1211
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:41,709
THIRD NIGHT
- We'll run out of petrol.

1212
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:43,459
How much further, Vicky?

1213
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:44,709
Just a little further.

1214
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:49,500
Stop!

1215
01:16:49,584 --> 01:16:50,250
Stop.

1216
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:01,250
What?

1217
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,584
I am allergic... to dust.

1218
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:04,209
Come on.

1219
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,292
It's so dark around here.

1220
01:17:11,917 --> 01:17:15,667
- What if she abducts me?
- She is a female, not a male.

1221
01:17:16,209 --> 01:17:18,709
She doesn't use force
against your will, like men.

1222
01:17:19,209 --> 01:17:21,000
She will first ask
for your permission.

1223
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:23,584
Hello Mr. Tom-Dick-or-Harry.

1224
01:17:23,959 --> 01:17:25,000
And if you turn around.

1225
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:26,792
Then she will think it's a yes.

1226
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:28,542
Yes, means yes.

1227
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,917
Then she will take you away.

1228
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:32,834
So under no circumstance
will you turn around.

1229
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,459
- No turning around.
- No.

1230
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:35,167
Let's go.

1231
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:45,834
Jana.

1232
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:47,750
Jana.

1233
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:54,250
Jana.

1234
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:02,292
Jana.

1235
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,542
Jana.

1236
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:15,250
What are you doing?

1237
01:18:22,834 --> 01:18:24,542
Brother Rudra. Give me the alcohol.

1238
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:26,125
Alcohol.

1239
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:28,209
Why?

1240
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,667
This is no time or a drink.

1241
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,209
No.

1242
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,000
Power.

1243
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:35,750
No power.

1244
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:38,417
Okay, give me.

1245
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:44,709
Save some for me.

1246
01:18:45,792 --> 01:18:47,417
You're worried about the alcohol.

1247
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:48,709
You go that way.

1248
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,709
Brother Rudra, you search upstairs.

1249
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,667
- Why?
- And I will look here.

1250
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,584
Let's stay together.

1251
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:53,625
We don't have time for that.

1252
01:19:48,334 --> 01:19:51,834
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1253
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:02,167
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1254
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,500
Mom always said to learn
the Hanuman Chalisa.

1255
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,042
Now see.

1256
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:12,625
Sorry, mom.

1257
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:25,542
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

1258
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:27,334
Run.

1259
01:20:27,584 --> 01:20:28,209
Snake!

1260
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:47,834
Mummy!

1261
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:55,334
Brother Rudra! Brother Rudra!

1262
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,125
Where are you going?

1263
01:20:56,334 --> 01:20:57,375
I was just warming up.

1264
01:20:58,042 --> 01:20:59,959
- I saw her.
- You did.

1265
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,167
Brother Rudra!

1266
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:17,542
Jana.

1267
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:56,334
Vicky...

1268
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,292
Stree... it's me. Vicky.

1269
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,959
Remember I stitched your dress.

1270
01:22:09,334 --> 01:22:14,917
I am here for Jana,
he's a... very nice guy.

1271
01:22:15,186 --> 01:22:17,209
In fact, he calls you sister-in-law.

1272
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,959
Vicky...

1273
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:26,042
I stitched your dress in 35 minutes,
Stree, and you want to abduct me.

1274
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,584
You hurt me.

1275
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:30,792
I won't turn around.

1276
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,209
- Vicky...
- I can't hear you at all.

1277
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:35,425
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1278
01:22:58,542 --> 01:22:59,750
Daddy.

1279
01:23:01,167 --> 01:23:02,042
Daddy.

1280
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:03,917
Vicky!

1281
01:24:13,584 --> 01:24:14,292
Are you okay?

1282
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:17,459
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am fine.

1283
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:19,500
Is she gone?

1284
01:24:20,834 --> 01:24:21,709
Don't know.

1285
01:24:22,542 --> 01:24:23,542
Don't know?

1286
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,959
But at least one good thing happened.

1287
01:24:29,709 --> 01:24:31,042
You're not Stree.

1288
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:33,500
You know, like in the morning...

1289
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:36,375
Sorry.

1290
01:24:37,003 --> 01:24:38,211
Shall we go back?

1291
01:24:38,461 --> 01:24:39,961
- But Vicky is still inside.
- Bittu.

1292
01:24:40,378 --> 01:24:43,294
Where were you?

1293
01:24:43,628 --> 01:24:44,419
Did you see Jana?

1294
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:46,753
No!

1295
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:48,919
Run brother Rudra.
He's fallen prey as well.

1296
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:50,544
That's not her.

1297
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:52,128
- She is not Stree.
- You are lying.

1298
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:53,419
That's the girl.

1299
01:24:53,544 --> 01:24:54,628
The letter... Remember.

1300
01:24:54,794 --> 01:24:55,711
The dress.

1301
01:24:56,961 --> 01:24:58,003
"Vicky Please!"

1302
01:24:58,628 --> 01:24:59,544
That's her.

1303
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:02,631
I swear she risked
her own life to save mine.

1304
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:03,836
You two would've...

1305
01:25:04,669 --> 01:25:05,628
Been amazed.

1306
01:25:05,961 --> 01:25:07,586
She flung her dagger at the witch.

1307
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:10,086
If we had posted her video on Youtube,
it would've been an instant hit.

1308
01:25:10,711 --> 01:25:11,961
#daggergirl.

1309
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:14,878
But what is she doing here?
How does she know we're here?

1310
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:17,253
Your friend is not
the only one missing.

1311
01:25:17,961 --> 01:25:19,669
Many people go missing every year.

1312
01:25:20,086 --> 01:25:22,378
I've been coming here for the
past three years during the festival.

1313
01:25:23,044 --> 01:25:25,503
So that I can get rid of her for good.

1314
01:25:29,753 --> 01:25:32,003
I know he will never come back.

1315
01:25:33,544 --> 01:25:34,378
But still...

1316
01:25:36,169 --> 01:25:38,544
You can share your sorrow with me.

1317
01:25:39,211 --> 01:25:40,544
It will lighten your burden.

1318
01:25:42,628 --> 01:25:43,211
No!

1319
01:25:43,794 --> 01:25:44,919
Okay.

1320
01:25:45,628 --> 01:25:47,628
By the way,
where did you learn this art?

1321
01:25:48,169 --> 01:25:49,336
I had to wander around for it.

1322
01:25:49,919 --> 01:25:53,503
I went to ascetics, and tantric.

1323
01:25:54,044 --> 01:25:57,378
Tantra, magic, hypnosis,
and spells from the red book.

1324
01:25:57,461 --> 01:25:58,503
I learned everything.

1325
01:25:59,086 --> 01:26:01,503
I've had only one mission
for the past three years.

1326
01:26:01,919 --> 01:26:03,128
Defeating Stree.

1327
01:26:05,169 --> 01:26:08,461
I tried everything I knew.

1328
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:10,419
But it wasn't enough.

1329
01:26:10,836 --> 01:26:12,586
I thought I was ready.

1330
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,294
I thought that I would
defeat her this time.

1331
01:26:16,378 --> 01:26:21,169
You see, ma'am. I've done
extensive research on this subject.

1332
01:26:21,253 --> 01:26:22,294
Research.

1333
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:27,378
I have books on magic spells, hypnosis,
and other art forms in my library.

1334
01:26:27,586 --> 01:26:29,253
You can come over
if you need any help.

1335
01:26:29,503 --> 01:26:31,378
Even we have a shop
for lady's fashion.

1336
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:32,253
Best in town.

1337
01:26:32,503 --> 01:26:34,753
If you need anything at any time,
just let me know.

1338
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:38,253
And anyway... it's always
better than stitched clothes.

1339
01:26:38,669 --> 01:26:40,003
I don't like readymade.

1340
01:26:43,586 --> 01:26:44,169
Shall we?

1341
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:46,586
Vicky.

1342
01:26:47,753 --> 01:26:48,544
What happened?

1343
01:27:01,836 --> 01:27:04,753
Jana. My Jana is back.

1344
01:27:04,836 --> 01:27:06,586
My son is back.

1345
01:27:07,419 --> 01:27:10,336
My son, where were you?

1346
01:27:10,711 --> 01:27:13,836
- Where were you...
- You'll tear his (the) clothes.

1347
01:27:13,919 --> 01:27:15,336
He's lost so much weight.

1348
01:27:15,878 --> 01:27:18,044
Forgive me, son. Forgive me.

1349
01:27:18,294 --> 01:27:20,294
You really are his friend.

1350
01:27:20,378 --> 01:27:22,169
- I said such bad things.
- It's all right.

1351
01:27:22,253 --> 01:27:22,919
It's okay, aunty.

1352
01:27:23,003 --> 01:27:26,128
Jana, it's your mom, your mom.

1353
01:27:26,211 --> 01:27:27,461
I want to go sleep.

1354
01:27:28,586 --> 01:27:29,669
He wants to sleep.

1355
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:31,628
- Yes son, let's go.
- Come on.

1356
01:27:31,753 --> 01:27:33,711
Please send my coat back.

1357
01:27:33,794 --> 01:27:34,461
Okay, aunty.

1358
01:27:35,711 --> 01:27:36,419
Bye, Jana.

1359
01:28:12,711 --> 01:28:15,336
Aunty. Aunty.

1360
01:28:15,419 --> 01:28:17,711
She took my husband.

1361
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:22,003
She took my son too.

1362
01:28:22,086 --> 01:28:25,044
She took him too.

1363
01:28:26,419 --> 01:28:28,836
She took my husband.

1364
01:28:28,919 --> 01:28:31,586
My husband too.

1365
01:28:51,586 --> 01:28:54,003
But... how did so
many people disappear?

1366
01:28:55,753 --> 01:28:57,503
Someone erased the ink.

1367
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:06,378
Jana, look what Stree did.

1368
01:29:06,711 --> 01:29:08,919
She abducted a dozen men.

1369
01:29:09,128 --> 01:29:11,044
And she's also erased the ink.

1370
01:29:11,128 --> 01:29:11,836
Jana.

1371
01:29:13,419 --> 01:29:13,919
You...

1372
01:29:19,336 --> 01:29:20,086
Jana.

1373
01:29:24,794 --> 01:29:25,794
Jana...

1374
01:29:27,919 --> 01:29:29,753
Why are you sitting like that, Jana?

1375
01:29:32,836 --> 01:29:33,919
And your palms...

1376
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:36,961
Jana.

1377
01:29:44,503 --> 01:29:47,253
I am your mother.
Listen to your mom, son.

1378
01:29:47,878 --> 01:29:48,586
Jana.

1379
01:29:49,544 --> 01:29:51,253
Jana, spare your friends at least.

1380
01:29:51,711 --> 01:29:54,836
Listen to me,
I am already 70% damaged.

1381
01:29:59,294 --> 01:29:59,919
Jana.

1382
01:30:00,003 --> 01:30:02,961
We're humans, not kites.

1383
01:30:04,461 --> 01:30:05,169
Jana.

1384
01:30:05,253 --> 01:30:08,503
Vicky, look at Jana's hand.
He erased the ink.

1385
01:30:08,711 --> 01:30:10,631
- Divert his attention?
- Me?

1386
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:11,586
Go.

1387
01:30:12,128 --> 01:30:12,878
Jana.

1388
01:30:12,961 --> 01:30:14,253
Someone get a blanket.

1389
01:30:15,419 --> 01:30:16,461
Jana.

1390
01:30:17,169 --> 01:30:17,878
Jana.

1391
01:30:18,336 --> 01:30:19,044
Jana.

1392
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:20,169
Jana, stop.

1393
01:30:20,253 --> 01:30:25,378
Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana.

1394
01:30:26,628 --> 01:30:28,253
It's Vicky.

1395
01:30:30,878 --> 01:30:32,836
Jana.

1396
01:30:32,919 --> 01:30:33,919
Quiet!

1397
01:30:34,336 --> 01:30:36,419
Or else I will slap you.

1398
01:30:36,628 --> 01:30:37,169
Quiet!

1399
01:30:41,128 --> 01:30:42,253
Jana.

1400
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:43,669
What are you doing?

1401
01:30:44,544 --> 01:30:45,878
It's Vicky.

1402
01:30:48,336 --> 01:30:50,919
Bittu! Bittu!

1403
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:56,586
Come on.

1404
01:31:02,003 --> 01:31:03,711
This is the only solution left.

1405
01:31:03,919 --> 01:31:06,628
Wear saree and bangles like women do.

1406
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:08,169
Your solutions were
not effective at all.

1407
01:31:08,336 --> 01:31:10,794
That Stree took 20 men.

1408
01:31:12,003 --> 01:31:12,794
Yes, Vicky.

1409
01:31:13,128 --> 01:31:14,753
Yes, I know. I am coming.

1410
01:31:15,044 --> 01:31:15,961
I am coming.

1411
01:31:16,044 --> 01:31:18,378
We want our youngsters back.

1412
01:31:18,878 --> 01:31:21,878
Whoever brings the
missing men back,

1413
01:31:22,294 --> 01:31:28,586
...will be rewarded
10,000 for every male.

1414
01:31:29,711 --> 01:31:30,794
Understand?

1415
01:31:33,628 --> 01:31:35,211
This city wants freedom.

1416
01:31:35,294 --> 01:31:36,878
Freedom.

1417
01:31:37,003 --> 01:31:38,711
Everyone knows...

1418
01:31:38,794 --> 01:31:40,419
Stree is a thief.

1419
01:31:40,503 --> 01:31:42,586
Let's all unite.

1420
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:44,294
And drive Stree away.

1421
01:31:44,378 --> 01:31:47,419
You give us men...

1422
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,378
We'll give you freedom.

1423
01:31:50,711 --> 01:31:53,711
It's the smoke coming on my face.

1424
01:31:55,044 --> 01:31:58,044
- Bittu, untie me.
- Wait.

1425
01:31:58,128 --> 01:31:59,503
No one listens to him.

1426
01:31:59,919 --> 01:32:02,794
David has turned into Goliath today.

1427
01:32:03,169 --> 01:32:04,753
How can someone beat
up your own friend?

1428
01:32:05,211 --> 01:32:06,711
We cannot waste any more time.

1429
01:32:06,878 --> 01:32:08,711
Jana is completely under her control.

1430
01:32:08,961 --> 01:32:11,336
We must do something solid
before the festival ends.

1431
01:32:11,586 --> 01:32:15,253
You're experienced in this field,
suggest something.

1432
01:32:15,711 --> 01:32:19,753
If we can find out more about Stree,
then I can come up with something.

1433
01:32:20,919 --> 01:32:21,878
But from where?

1434
01:32:23,086 --> 01:32:25,836
- We found a book at his shop.
- Library.

1435
01:32:27,294 --> 01:32:29,378
We found a book in his library.

1436
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:30,794
But the pages were missing.

1437
01:32:32,503 --> 01:32:35,753
What if we find the
guy who wrote that book...

1438
01:32:36,044 --> 01:32:38,253
...then he would know what
was written on those pages.

1439
01:32:38,961 --> 01:32:41,419
- Do you know that guy?
- I know everything.

1440
01:32:41,586 --> 01:32:43,128
Is he alive?

1441
01:32:44,128 --> 01:32:45,503
He lives in Emergency.

1442
01:32:46,128 --> 01:32:47,169
- What?
- ICU!

1443
01:32:48,336 --> 01:32:49,378
Emergency.

1444
01:33:13,794 --> 01:33:15,586
Which book are you talking about?

1445
01:33:17,878 --> 01:33:19,503
Respected Mr. Shastri.

1446
01:33:19,753 --> 01:33:24,044
You wrote the history
of our city in a book.

1447
01:33:24,128 --> 01:33:27,294
Chanderi Puran, remember?

1448
01:33:27,794 --> 01:33:30,628
The book was launched
in my Rudra Book Depot.

1449
01:33:32,211 --> 01:33:35,003
You used to sell
adult books back then.

1450
01:33:36,003 --> 01:33:39,253
Mr. Shashtri,
that Stree abducted our friend.

1451
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:41,294
She abducted many more males too.

1452
01:33:41,378 --> 01:33:43,336
Can we get them back?

1453
01:33:43,878 --> 01:33:44,961
Stree.

1454
01:33:45,128 --> 01:33:46,878
Please, Mr. Shashtri.

1455
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:48,669
We request.

1456
01:33:51,461 --> 01:33:53,336
Did the emergency end?

1457
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,044
We've been banging
our heads against a wall.

1458
01:33:55,128 --> 01:33:56,586
This man doesn't remember anything.

1459
01:33:57,294 --> 01:34:00,878
Yes, Emergency is over.

1460
01:34:01,878 --> 01:34:03,461
No-no-no.

1461
01:34:03,919 --> 01:34:06,669
Mr. Shashtri,
we're talking about Stree.

1462
01:34:06,836 --> 01:34:07,544
Stree.
- Stree.

1463
01:34:07,628 --> 01:34:08,711
Like "Stree Come back tomorrow".

1464
01:34:08,794 --> 01:34:09,503
Stree.

1465
01:34:10,128 --> 01:34:11,753
What is a Stree (Female)?

1466
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:17,336
She has no s tature compared to males.

1467
01:34:17,628 --> 01:34:18,544
What?

1468
01:34:18,794 --> 01:34:21,128
She should always
stay within her limits.

1469
01:34:21,753 --> 01:34:23,919
Never step out of the home.

1470
01:34:25,253 --> 01:34:29,378
Her job is to keep her husband happy,
and bear children.

1471
01:34:29,669 --> 01:34:34,503
And if she crosses her limit,
then burn her alive at the cross.

1472
01:34:36,503 --> 01:34:37,586
He has no solution.

1473
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:38,544
Such vile thoughts.

1474
01:34:38,628 --> 01:34:39,711
We just wasted our time with him.

1475
01:34:39,836 --> 01:34:41,211
What kind of a writer is he?

1476
01:34:41,669 --> 01:34:42,544
Is this what he writes?

1477
01:34:43,086 --> 01:34:44,044
What about Jana now?

1478
01:34:44,128 --> 01:34:45,211
He's too strong to control.

1479
01:34:45,294 --> 01:34:45,794
Let's think.

1480
01:34:45,878 --> 01:34:47,169
He's got such a filthy mind.

1481
01:34:48,253 --> 01:34:55,419
It's not me,
its this city that has a filthy mind.

1482
01:34:56,836 --> 01:34:59,961
They used that Stree
as long as they wanted.

1483
01:35:00,336 --> 01:35:01,544
And then got rid of her.

1484
01:35:02,794 --> 01:35:08,503
And that man who gave her respect,
they took him away as well.

1485
01:35:10,044 --> 01:35:11,086
They will all die.

1486
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:13,128
Everyone.

1487
01:35:15,836 --> 01:35:20,919
As long as there's even one male
in this city, she won't stay quiet.

1488
01:35:22,919 --> 01:35:27,878
Just one...
one man can douse this fire.

1489
01:35:28,086 --> 01:35:30,503
- Who is he?
- How does he look?

1490
01:35:31,961 --> 01:35:35,753
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1491
01:35:36,794 --> 01:35:39,044
Born in the arms of the oak tree.

1492
01:35:39,128 --> 01:35:40,919
The prince of his family.

1493
01:35:41,253 --> 01:35:43,128
Love reflects in his eyes.

1494
01:35:43,378 --> 01:35:44,878
A true artist.

1495
01:35:45,503 --> 01:35:48,086
He's the true protector of this city.

1496
01:35:49,794 --> 01:35:52,878
A prostitute's son who's a bachelor.

1497
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:54,961
Courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1498
01:35:55,044 --> 01:35:58,711
A courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1499
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:03,628
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1500
01:36:04,044 --> 01:36:09,003
Born in the arms of the oak tree.
The prince of his family.

1501
01:36:10,419 --> 01:36:14,044
Vicky. Weren't you born
at your grandma's house?

1502
01:36:15,753 --> 01:36:18,294
And there was an oak
tree behind her house.

1503
01:36:19,086 --> 01:36:19,878
Yes.

1504
01:36:20,169 --> 01:36:20,711
So?

1505
01:36:21,378 --> 01:36:22,753
And you're the only son.

1506
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:24,919
Prince.

1507
01:36:25,294 --> 01:36:26,086
Very good.

1508
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:30,711
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1509
01:36:30,919 --> 01:36:34,336
- He has wheatish color.
- And a long nose.

1510
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:40,003
And, you always think
of yourself as a king.

1511
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,419
Love reflects in his eyes.

1512
01:36:42,919 --> 01:36:44,211
And a true artist.

1513
01:36:44,669 --> 01:36:46,086
There's love in your eyes.

1514
01:36:46,586 --> 01:36:48,878
And Stree saw that,
which is why she didn't abduct him.

1515
01:36:49,086 --> 01:36:50,336
There's love in my eyes?

1516
01:36:50,503 --> 01:36:52,253
Stree can see it, not her.

1517
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:54,086
And you're an artist as well.

1518
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:56,419
Aren't you getting carried away now?

1519
01:36:56,669 --> 01:36:57,836
What artist?

1520
01:36:58,336 --> 01:37:03,628
Vicky is the best ladies tailor
in the neighboring three districts.

1521
01:37:03,794 --> 01:37:04,586
Exactly.

1522
01:37:04,711 --> 01:37:06,169
This is a good coincidence.

1523
01:37:06,544 --> 01:37:08,753
But we must find someone
who has all five qualities?

1524
01:37:08,836 --> 01:37:10,878
And what about the fifth quality?
courtesan's son?

1525
01:37:10,961 --> 01:37:12,169
How will find him?

1526
01:37:13,128 --> 01:37:15,086
Courtesan means that right?

1527
01:37:15,253 --> 01:37:15,711
That...

1528
01:37:27,253 --> 01:37:28,794
No one told him.

1529
01:37:29,211 --> 01:37:30,003
Nobody.

1530
01:37:30,419 --> 01:37:33,836
Everyone knows, but you don't know.

1531
01:37:34,503 --> 01:37:35,086
What?

1532
01:37:37,919 --> 01:37:38,836
- What?
- Look...

1533
01:37:41,628 --> 01:37:43,919
There's no need to feel bad.

1534
01:37:44,711 --> 01:37:49,753
Some mothers are school teachers,
some are government officers.

1535
01:37:50,128 --> 01:37:52,003
Some make pickles.

1536
01:37:53,128 --> 01:37:55,961
- Your mother was that...
- What?

1537
01:37:56,628 --> 01:37:57,253
That.

1538
01:37:59,086 --> 01:37:59,753
What?

1539
01:38:01,128 --> 01:38:01,878
Courtesan!

1540
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:06,711
I will kill you right now.

1541
01:38:10,378 --> 01:38:12,753
I thought you never meant
it when you called me a bas***

1542
01:38:13,253 --> 01:38:14,044
You...

1543
01:38:14,544 --> 01:38:15,669
This is absurd.

1544
01:38:17,919 --> 01:38:19,336
And in front of her.

1545
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,044
Vicky. it's true.

1546
01:38:25,919 --> 01:38:28,378
Jana, I will break your head.

1547
01:38:31,961 --> 01:38:32,503
Vicky.

1548
01:38:32,586 --> 01:38:33,419
Don't look at me.

1549
01:38:34,044 --> 01:38:35,836
I won't believe you.

1550
01:38:38,336 --> 01:38:39,753
My mother was not a courtesan.

1551
01:38:40,753 --> 01:38:41,836
- Listen!
- No.

1552
01:38:42,461 --> 01:38:43,794
Vicky!

1553
01:38:51,003 --> 01:38:52,628
We've found the protector of the city.

1554
01:38:55,169 --> 01:38:56,503
He will deal with Stree.

1555
01:38:57,253 --> 01:38:59,919
- You mean Stree.
- Yes. Stree.

1556
01:39:17,669 --> 01:39:18,378
One more.

1557
01:39:25,919 --> 01:39:29,211
Brother Vicky, mom's asking
when you will return her blouse.

1558
01:39:33,753 --> 01:39:34,503
Dad.

1559
01:39:38,544 --> 01:39:40,253
What were you lecturing
me about energy?

1560
01:39:43,794 --> 01:39:45,836
You've done a lot of
friendship when you were young.

1561
01:39:48,253 --> 01:39:49,711
Tell me something.

1562
01:39:50,919 --> 01:39:54,461
Did you do friendship with mom,
or marry her?

1563
01:40:01,794 --> 01:40:03,044
Blouse petticoat.

1564
01:40:09,711 --> 01:40:10,794
Who was she?

1565
01:40:12,253 --> 01:40:13,336
Why didn't you tell me?

1566
01:40:15,378 --> 01:40:17,586
You kept lying to me.

1567
01:40:29,294 --> 01:40:32,253
Daddy, I won't drink again.
Swear on mom.

1568
01:40:33,211 --> 01:40:34,253
Swear on my dad, okay.

1569
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:35,086
Sorry.

1570
01:40:36,044 --> 01:40:37,086
Eat.

1571
01:40:41,794 --> 01:40:43,211
You could've told me this once.

1572
01:40:43,378 --> 01:40:44,086
That's all.

1573
01:40:47,544 --> 01:40:48,336
Eat.

1574
01:40:53,601 --> 01:40:54,778
I talked to daddy.

1575
01:40:55,034 --> 01:40:56,211
And I thought how does it matter.

1576
01:40:56,836 --> 01:40:57,961
She was my mother after all.

1577
01:40:59,294 --> 01:41:00,669
Maybe my father's someone else too.

1578
01:41:01,461 --> 01:41:02,878
But I know only one father.

1579
01:41:04,461 --> 01:41:07,378
The guy who stands at the
shop with the measuring tape.

1580
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:13,628
And who thinks that my talent
is the greatest talent in the world.

1581
01:41:16,128 --> 01:41:17,294
But this city...

1582
01:41:18,128 --> 01:41:21,753
Everyone knew about me,
but they never made fun of me.

1583
01:41:23,336 --> 01:41:25,628
Otherwise, people like to gossip.

1584
01:41:27,336 --> 01:41:32,794
I always knew that I wasn't
meant for altering dresses.

1585
01:41:33,461 --> 01:41:37,086
But I didn't know that
I was born to save these people.

1586
01:41:38,059 --> 01:41:41,268
Lord chose a really
unique mission for me.

1587
01:41:43,570 --> 01:41:45,184
"Born in the arms of the oak tree."

1588
01:41:45,828 --> 01:41:47,101
"The sole prince..."

1589
01:41:50,878 --> 01:41:52,018
"The son of a courtesan
who's a bachelor."

1590
01:41:53,184 --> 01:41:55,268
If I really am the
son of a coutesan...

1591
01:41:55,476 --> 01:41:57,351
...then I will save this city.

1592
01:41:57,851 --> 01:41:59,893
Along with Jana,
I will save everyone!

1593
01:42:01,591 --> 01:42:03,518
Bittu gather everyone.

1594
01:42:08,559 --> 01:42:09,976
What do we know about the Stree?

1595
01:42:10,518 --> 01:42:12,726
- She is scary.
- Ferocious.

1596
01:42:12,976 --> 01:42:15,518
No! She can read.

1597
01:42:15,768 --> 01:42:18,809
Have you ever heard about
a ghost or spirit who can read?

1598
01:42:18,976 --> 01:42:20,393
Right.

1599
01:42:20,476 --> 01:42:23,059
Meaning we're up against
an educated witch.

1600
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:24,684
She is the new generation witch.

1601
01:42:24,918 --> 01:42:25,809
Point no. 2.

1602
01:42:26,309 --> 01:42:28,268
She comes every year during
the festival, to abduct men.

1603
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:31,809
But if you write outside your
house "O Stree, come back tomorrow".

1604
01:42:32,143 --> 01:42:34,559
Then she reads it and thinks...

1605
01:42:34,976 --> 01:42:40,143
"Oh... okay. Rest today,
and I'll come back tomorrow."

1606
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:43,101
Meaning she listens.

1607
01:42:43,184 --> 01:42:44,601
Meaning she is obedient.

1608
01:42:44,809 --> 01:42:45,726
No. 3.

1609
01:42:46,309 --> 01:42:47,518
She is very stupid.

1610
01:42:47,726 --> 01:42:48,809
Next night she comes back again.

1611
01:42:49,101 --> 01:42:51,934
Reads the same line
again and thinks...

1612
01:42:52,434 --> 01:42:55,476
"Oh shit, now I'll have
to come back tomorrow again."

1613
01:42:55,559 --> 01:42:56,393
"This is cheating."

1614
01:42:56,726 --> 01:42:58,643
And she goes back to her home.

1615
01:42:58,809 --> 01:43:01,143
Poor thing doesn't understand
that these people are s...

1616
01:43:03,018 --> 01:43:03,976
I mean making a fool of her.

1617
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:06,559
- She has a low IQ level.
- Exactly.

1618
01:43:06,684 --> 01:43:09,351
And we're much smarter than her.

1619
01:43:09,643 --> 01:43:10,309
Thank you.

1620
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:11,893
And, if we get serious...

1621
01:43:12,726 --> 01:43:15,393
...then we can easily
get rid of this witch forever.

1622
01:43:15,768 --> 01:43:18,684
- Then let's get serious.
- Correct. Let's get serious.

1623
01:43:21,101 --> 01:43:22,184
But what are we going to do?

1624
01:43:26,143 --> 01:43:27,018
Wedding night.

1625
01:43:27,768 --> 01:43:28,768
Wedding night.

1626
01:43:29,184 --> 01:43:30,934
But brother Rudra,
aren't you too old for that?

1627
01:43:31,018 --> 01:43:31,976
No me.

1628
01:43:32,518 --> 01:43:33,018
No!

1629
01:43:33,143 --> 01:43:35,059
According to Mr. Shashtri's book,

1630
01:43:35,268 --> 01:43:38,601
Stree wants her wedding
night which was left incomplete.

1631
01:43:38,726 --> 01:43:39,601
Yes so.

1632
01:43:39,726 --> 01:43:41,309
And if you're the
protector of this city...

1633
01:43:41,393 --> 01:43:44,768
...then you must fulfill her wish.

1634
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:45,768
What are you saying?

1635
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:46,726
Have you lost your mind?

1636
01:43:46,809 --> 01:43:48,101
- No.
- What are you saying?

1637
01:43:48,726 --> 01:43:50,893
My father never even let
me watch a wedding night on TV,

1638
01:43:50,976 --> 01:43:52,184
...how can I do it with a witch?

1639
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:53,018
Yes.

1640
01:43:53,726 --> 01:43:55,851
I am the protector, shouldn't
I prepare for a battle or something.

1641
01:43:55,934 --> 01:43:58,434
The battle begins
after the wedding night.

1642
01:43:59,393 --> 01:44:00,309
Brother Rudra...

1643
01:44:00,851 --> 01:44:04,559
You mean, me and that witch...

1644
01:44:04,768 --> 01:44:07,309
We just have to use it as bait.

1645
01:44:08,184 --> 01:44:10,934
We must lead her to you, that's all.

1646
01:44:11,351 --> 01:44:13,393
Remember she saw love in your eyes.

1647
01:44:13,726 --> 01:44:14,268
Yes.

1648
01:44:14,351 --> 01:44:16,268
- And then?
- Then leave it to me.

1649
01:44:16,649 --> 01:44:18,351
She is very strong in her own home.

1650
01:44:18,768 --> 01:44:22,101
But I know how to overpower
her when she is out of her house.

1651
01:44:23,559 --> 01:44:24,768
But where will we call her?

1652
01:44:26,765 --> 01:44:28,559
Right here, in Vicky's Palace.

1653
01:44:28,809 --> 01:44:29,476
Best place.

1654
01:45:00,809 --> 01:45:01,934
Show the bait.

1655
01:45:23,768 --> 01:45:25,976
Hurry up.

1656
01:45:47,601 --> 01:45:49,143
Stree is out hunting today.

1657
01:45:49,268 --> 01:45:51,893
Don't step out of the
house and lock the door.

1658
01:45:51,976 --> 01:45:52,393
Okay.

1659
01:45:52,476 --> 01:45:53,559
Come back soon.

1660
01:45:53,643 --> 01:45:55,309
I feel scared alone.
- I'll be back soon.

1661
01:45:55,393 --> 01:45:56,768
Keep the doors closed.

1662
01:46:11,143 --> 01:46:12,601
Vicky, you're looking really handsome.

1663
01:46:12,684 --> 01:46:14,101
- Now wear this cap.
- No, no.

1664
01:46:14,268 --> 01:46:15,476
- I said wear it.
- No, no, caps. You'll ruin my hair.

1665
01:46:15,559 --> 01:46:17,309
- But the groom has to wear...
- I don't want to...

1666
01:46:17,393 --> 01:46:18,018
Wear it.

1667
01:46:32,309 --> 01:46:34,059
Dad had such vivid
dreams about my wedding.

1668
01:46:34,726 --> 01:46:37,309
Who knew that I'll be
marrying a witch some day.

1669
01:46:37,476 --> 01:46:38,518
Don't worry.

1670
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:40,726
You're getting a chance
to save the entire city.

1671
01:46:40,934 --> 01:46:42,101
Not everyone gets this opportunity.

1672
01:46:42,184 --> 01:46:42,646
Don't be scared.

1673
01:46:42,726 --> 01:46:44,476
Don't you want to save Jana?

1674
01:46:44,559 --> 01:46:46,143
Don't you want to make
him a human being again?

1675
01:46:46,684 --> 01:46:47,559
What is the plan?

1676
01:46:47,643 --> 01:46:48,434
What do we do?

1677
01:46:49,184 --> 01:46:52,684
Stree will definitely come here
after reading the message on the wall.

1678
01:46:54,934 --> 01:46:58,559
When she looks into your eyes,
don't look away.

1679
01:46:58,643 --> 01:47:00,351
Instead look into her eyes.

1680
01:47:00,934 --> 01:47:02,184
I know a spell.

1681
01:47:02,601 --> 01:47:04,726
That spell will render her powerless.

1682
01:47:04,893 --> 01:47:08,476
And then we must drive
this dagger through her heart.

1683
01:47:08,643 --> 01:47:10,518
Dagger? How can I...

1684
01:47:11,976 --> 01:47:13,018
We're waiting inside.

1685
01:47:13,309 --> 01:47:14,059
Don't be scared.

1686
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:16,184
Let's go.

1687
01:47:16,434 --> 01:47:17,393
Listen...

1688
01:47:17,809 --> 01:47:19,851
Will your spell work?

1689
01:47:20,018 --> 01:47:20,768
90%

1690
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:22,643
What is 90%?

1691
01:47:23,643 --> 01:47:24,976
Maybe 99%.

1692
01:47:25,518 --> 01:47:28,143
Meaning there is a
1% chance I'll be dead.

1693
01:47:29,768 --> 01:47:30,726
Daddy...

1694
01:47:31,059 --> 01:47:31,976
Let's go.

1695
01:47:32,351 --> 01:47:33,726
Listen.

1696
01:47:35,268 --> 01:47:36,851
I am going...

1697
01:47:39,726 --> 01:47:41,726
Don't worry, okay.

1698
01:47:41,976 --> 01:47:43,059
Don't forget you are Vicky.

1699
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:45,976
The guy who can spend
a night with a witch.

1700
01:47:46,184 --> 01:47:49,393
In case I don't come back,
don't come looking for me.

1701
01:47:50,143 --> 01:47:52,684
And... look after my dad.

1702
01:47:57,268 --> 01:47:59,601
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1703
01:48:00,726 --> 01:48:03,726
O Stree there are no men here.

1704
01:48:05,518 --> 01:48:07,643
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1705
01:48:08,559 --> 01:48:11,559
O Stree there are no men here.

1706
01:48:46,309 --> 01:48:50,726
O STREE COME HERE.

1707
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:10,768
O STREE COME HERE.

1708
01:49:21,726 --> 01:49:22,768
I think it's her.

1709
01:49:34,768 --> 01:49:39,351
O STREE COME HERE.

1710
01:49:48,351 --> 01:49:49,726
She isn't coming inside.

1711
01:49:49,893 --> 01:49:51,309
Is she suspicious?

1712
01:49:51,559 --> 01:49:54,684
Stree is smarter than
you all thought she is.

1713
01:49:57,684 --> 01:49:58,976
- Jana.
- Jana.

1714
01:49:59,309 --> 01:50:00,018
Jana.

1715
01:50:00,101 --> 01:50:01,018
Listen to me.

1716
01:50:01,101 --> 01:50:01,893
Jana.

1717
01:50:06,184 --> 01:50:06,851
Jana.

1718
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:08,726
Leave him.

1719
01:50:13,601 --> 01:50:14,601
Jana.

1720
01:50:16,393 --> 01:50:18,893
Vicky.

1721
01:50:31,101 --> 01:50:32,268
Jana.

1722
01:50:37,768 --> 01:50:40,018
- Jana!
- Jana.

1723
01:50:51,851 --> 01:50:53,059
Vicky is missing.

1724
01:50:54,434 --> 01:50:55,143
Vicky.

1725
01:51:02,393 --> 01:51:03,393
Vicky.

1726
01:51:06,143 --> 01:51:06,851
Vicky.

1727
01:51:08,684 --> 01:51:09,434
Vicky isn't here.

1728
01:51:09,601 --> 01:51:10,351
He's not.

1729
01:51:11,476 --> 01:51:12,768
Where could he be?

1730
01:51:13,851 --> 01:51:16,559
Meaning Stree was here
and she took her lover.

1731
01:51:16,643 --> 01:51:17,601
Don't say that.

1732
01:51:17,684 --> 01:51:20,851
All our arrangements, the wedding
night preparations, didn't work.

1733
01:51:22,393 --> 01:51:25,684
Where did your sister take him?

1734
01:51:26,059 --> 01:51:28,976
- Vicky just sent a message, on WhatsApp.
- What?

1735
01:51:29,344 --> 01:51:30,768
He just shared his location.

1736
01:51:35,768 --> 01:51:36,851
Stree.

1737
01:51:40,309 --> 01:51:42,684
Where are you, Stree?

1738
01:51:58,643 --> 01:51:59,601
Stree, I...

1739
01:52:23,184 --> 01:52:26,351
Okay. Fine. I am sitting here.

1740
01:52:26,434 --> 01:52:27,726
I'm not going anywhere.

1741
01:52:28,684 --> 01:52:29,768
I am sitting right here.

1742
01:52:42,434 --> 01:52:43,476
This is the same place.

1743
01:52:43,559 --> 01:52:45,393
I guess she took him to the bedroom.

1744
01:52:45,768 --> 01:52:47,726
And she won't let him go until
she spends her wedding night with him.

1745
01:52:56,976 --> 01:52:57,934
Oh, God.

1746
01:53:04,893 --> 01:53:07,726
Stree... I am ready.

1747
01:53:09,351 --> 01:53:12,809
Come on this bed.
We'll spend our wedding night.

1748
01:53:17,143 --> 01:53:19,518
I am getting ready.
I am getting ready.

1749
01:53:24,893 --> 01:53:26,101
I'm taking it off.

1750
01:53:32,809 --> 01:53:34,396
Do I have to take my pants off too?

1751
01:53:35,143 --> 01:53:36,976
Fine, I'll take it off.

1752
01:53:41,643 --> 01:53:45,143
I am ready now. Come on.

1753
01:53:50,726 --> 01:53:51,893
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1754
01:53:51,976 --> 01:53:55,684
Sorry, Stree. I understand
that you've no interest in all this.

1755
01:53:55,809 --> 01:53:57,601
I respect you.

1756
01:53:58,851 --> 01:54:00,726
I'll even wear my clothes back.

1757
01:54:00,893 --> 01:54:02,726
See, I am wearing them back.

1758
01:54:02,976 --> 01:54:03,976
Don't kill me, Stree.

1759
01:54:04,059 --> 01:54:06,684
I am the only son.

1760
01:54:53,569 --> 01:54:54,476
Vicky!

1761
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:00,768
Jana.

1762
01:55:03,184 --> 01:55:04,559
What happened?

1763
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:05,601
Is she dead?

1764
01:55:05,934 --> 01:55:07,851
She is just powerless at the moment.

1765
01:55:07,934 --> 01:55:10,851
But we must finish her
before she gets her powers back.

1766
01:55:11,976 --> 01:55:12,851
Where are your clothes?

1767
01:55:13,934 --> 01:55:14,851
Sorry, I...

1768
01:55:15,101 --> 01:55:18,268
I thought in order to save the city,
I will have to sleep with her.

1769
01:55:19,309 --> 01:55:21,809
But you know what,
I don't think she wants any of it.

1770
01:55:23,518 --> 01:55:24,393
Here you go.

1771
01:55:24,893 --> 01:55:26,851
You must pierce her
heart with this dagger.

1772
01:55:26,934 --> 01:55:28,101
And cut off her braid.

1773
01:55:28,286 --> 01:55:29,059
Braid?

1774
01:55:29,143 --> 01:55:31,018
How did her braid get in all this?

1775
01:55:31,184 --> 01:55:32,726
And, how will I do this?

1776
01:55:32,809 --> 01:55:33,726
You do it, please.

1777
01:55:33,809 --> 01:55:36,434
I would've done it if I could.

1778
01:55:36,518 --> 01:55:37,351
You will have to do it.

1779
01:55:37,434 --> 01:55:38,726
You're the protector of the city.
Come on.

1780
01:55:38,809 --> 01:55:42,393
Yes, I know I am the protector,
but I am a tailor, not a killer.

1781
01:55:42,476 --> 01:55:43,351
Kill her before she wakes up again.

1782
01:55:43,434 --> 01:55:44,018
Take it.

1783
01:55:44,101 --> 01:55:45,434
- Come on.
- Yes.

1784
01:55:47,268 --> 01:55:47,976
Go.

1785
01:56:22,454 --> 01:56:23,726
Do we have to kill her?

1786
01:56:24,253 --> 01:56:25,893
Poor thing is lying
down so comfortably.

1787
01:56:26,101 --> 01:56:27,851
This is exactly how the
people of this city treated her.

1788
01:56:27,976 --> 01:56:28,976
And we're doing the same.

1789
01:56:29,435 --> 01:56:30,809
So what's the difference
between us and them?

1790
01:56:31,018 --> 01:56:32,268
She must have a reason.

1791
01:56:32,643 --> 01:56:34,726
She is trying to find her true love.

1792
01:56:35,726 --> 01:56:36,726
Let her go, please.

1793
01:56:37,976 --> 01:56:38,976
There must be another way.

1794
01:56:39,143 --> 01:56:41,059
Like lizard's tail, cockroach soup.

1795
01:56:46,018 --> 01:56:47,434
Then cut off her braid.

1796
01:56:47,893 --> 01:56:49,434
This will make her powerless.

1797
01:56:49,518 --> 01:56:50,393
And, she won't die either.

1798
01:56:51,271 --> 01:56:52,018
Okay.

1799
01:56:59,184 --> 01:57:00,768
- No, no, no.
- Look into her eyes.

1800
01:57:01,684 --> 01:57:02,726
Find the dagger.

1801
01:57:03,053 --> 01:57:04,351
Look. Look.

1802
01:57:05,522 --> 01:57:06,722
Vicky, open your eyes.

1803
01:57:06,802 --> 01:57:09,411
She won't do anything
if you look in her eyes.

1804
01:57:09,768 --> 01:57:10,851
It's not working.

1805
01:57:10,934 --> 01:57:11,688
She is hungry for love.

1806
01:57:11,768 --> 01:57:12,351
For love...

1807
01:57:12,434 --> 01:57:13,476
Look into her eyes with love.

1808
01:57:14,476 --> 01:57:15,309
Love.

1809
01:57:16,848 --> 01:57:17,768
Love.

1810
01:57:24,184 --> 01:57:25,143
Love...

1811
01:57:25,601 --> 01:57:27,143
More love, Vicky.

1812
01:57:27,268 --> 01:57:29,809
I am shitting in my pants,
and you want more feelings.

1813
01:57:31,726 --> 01:57:32,559
Quiet!

1814
01:57:34,393 --> 01:57:35,143
Quiet!

1815
01:57:36,143 --> 01:57:37,768
What is all this yelling for?

1816
01:57:38,059 --> 01:57:39,726
This is no way to take revenge.

1817
01:57:41,351 --> 01:57:43,309
I am the protector of the city,
so show some respect.

1818
01:57:44,559 --> 01:57:45,476
Always screaming.

1819
01:57:46,143 --> 01:57:46,893
Vicky.

1820
01:57:48,351 --> 01:57:48,976
Here.

1821
01:58:32,018 --> 01:58:33,059
Vicky.

1822
01:58:33,627 --> 01:58:35,059
Throw the braid away.

1823
01:58:38,059 --> 01:58:39,518
Are you okay?

1824
01:58:41,312 --> 01:58:42,601
Yes.

1825
01:58:42,684 --> 01:58:44,184
Dagger.

1826
01:58:48,018 --> 01:58:48,976
Sit up.

1827
01:58:49,059 --> 01:58:50,309
Get up.

1828
01:58:51,351 --> 01:58:53,018
Sit up straight.

1829
01:58:56,726 --> 01:58:58,643
- I think she's gone.
- Yes.

1830
01:58:58,726 --> 01:58:59,351
Isn't it?

1831
01:59:00,275 --> 01:59:02,817
She kept attacking her.

1832
01:59:03,275 --> 01:59:05,442
But I snuck up behind
her and cut off her braid.

1833
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:06,859
Then she disappeared.

1834
01:59:06,984 --> 01:59:07,567
And didn't come back.

1835
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:09,067
But is the Stree dead or not?

1836
01:59:10,567 --> 01:59:11,317
Tell me.

1837
01:59:12,984 --> 01:59:14,984
Meaning she will come
back again next year.

1838
01:59:15,574 --> 01:59:19,567
- She's only hungry for one thing.
- No. it's two.

1839
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:20,442
What?

1840
01:59:21,484 --> 01:59:24,817
Love and respect,
which this city never gave her.

1841
01:59:25,525 --> 01:59:27,109
And that was this
city's biggest mistake.

1842
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,400
And we were going to
repeat the same mistake.

1843
01:59:31,317 --> 01:59:35,359
And if this city gives her
the respect, which she never received.

1844
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,817
Then she might leave us alone.

1845
02:00:14,067 --> 02:00:20,067
These brave men together
have protected the city...

1846
02:00:20,484 --> 02:00:23,817
...and we will never
forget their contribution.

1847
02:00:24,067 --> 02:00:29,734
All the youngsters who went missing
in the last two days have returned.

1848
02:00:29,817 --> 02:00:31,567
Are you listening?

1849
02:00:44,484 --> 02:00:45,859
- There she is.
- Stop. Stop.

1850
02:00:46,359 --> 02:00:47,859
Sister-in-law.

1851
02:00:48,484 --> 02:00:50,400
The flower. The flower.

1852
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:51,650
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1853
02:00:52,724 --> 02:00:55,859
Everyone was looking for you.

1854
02:00:58,859 --> 02:01:00,859
You wore the dress.

1855
02:01:01,727 --> 02:01:02,525
Does it fit well?

1856
02:01:03,443 --> 02:01:05,192
You took my measurements so well.

1857
02:01:07,317 --> 02:01:09,275
This is for you.

1858
02:01:09,554 --> 02:01:12,442
I could've never fought
against the Stree without you.

1859
02:01:13,822 --> 02:01:14,692
Thank you.

1860
02:01:17,234 --> 02:01:18,859
You are very nice, Vicky.

1861
02:01:19,474 --> 02:01:22,234
I wish we had met before, then
we could've become friends before.

1862
02:01:23,317 --> 02:01:24,567
Will you be my friend?

1863
02:01:27,734 --> 02:01:31,275
You mean friends, or...

1864
02:01:32,192 --> 02:01:34,567
Yes. Isn't that what friendship means?

1865
02:01:35,795 --> 02:01:36,525
No.

1866
02:01:36,734 --> 02:01:38,998
There's another meaning
for friendship in our town.

1867
02:01:50,622 --> 02:01:53,609
What if I want to talk to you,
or meet you?

1868
02:01:53,692 --> 02:01:55,025
I don't even have your number.

1869
02:01:56,525 --> 02:01:57,692
Just think of me.

1870
02:02:00,109 --> 02:02:02,025
Do you have to go?

1871
02:02:02,359 --> 02:02:03,900
Please wait for a few more days.

1872
02:02:04,882 --> 02:02:05,900
Please.

1873
02:02:07,317 --> 02:02:08,442
Vicky, please!

1874
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:24,234
Name?

1875
02:02:24,317 --> 02:02:25,900
You didn't tell me your name...

1876
02:02:26,442 --> 02:02:30,067
This is my first time where he's smitten
by love but doesn't know her name.

1877
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,479
Maybe this is true love.

1878
02:02:37,630 --> 02:02:40,067
'For the past three years,
I had only one motive.'

1879
02:02:40,692 --> 02:02:41,942
'Defeating Stree.'

1880
02:02:42,609 --> 02:02:46,817
'I tried everything I knew,
but it wasn't enough.'

1881
02:02:47,609 --> 02:02:50,817
'There's always a method
to control any power.'

1882
02:02:51,525 --> 02:02:52,859
'Just cut off her braid.'

1883
02:02:53,109 --> 02:02:55,984
'She will become powerless,
and won't die.'

1884
02:03:13,484 --> 02:03:16,317
'I would've done
it long ago if I could.'

1885
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,859
'You're the protector of the city,
you have to do it.'

1886
02:03:40,984 --> 02:03:44,609
ONE YEAR LATER.

1887
02:04:18,484 --> 02:04:21,067
O STREE PROTECT US.

1888
02:05:05,734 --> 02:05:06,567
"Music."

1889
02:05:22,025 --> 02:05:23,817
"Everyone's talking about you."

1890
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:25,692
"They all know that you're an angel."

1891
02:05:25,775 --> 02:05:26,734
"You're hard to get..."

1892
02:05:26,817 --> 02:05:29,525
"...your poor beloved's been waiting."

1893
02:05:29,609 --> 02:05:31,445
"All I know is there's a cave..."

1894
02:05:31,525 --> 02:05:33,359
"...but the cave's hard to open."

1895
02:05:33,442 --> 02:05:35,234
"No matter what I do,
but you're never impressed..."

1896
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:37,359
"...your beloved's
been wandering around."

1897
02:05:37,525 --> 02:05:39,359
"I've played all the shots right."

1898
02:05:39,442 --> 02:05:41,150
"And seen have all slots."

1899
02:05:41,234 --> 02:05:44,775
"But I haven't hit
the jackpot yet, but..."

1900
02:05:45,192 --> 02:05:47,025
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1901
02:05:47,109 --> 02:05:48,942
"You'll get it..."

1902
02:05:49,025 --> 02:05:50,484
"I'll get it too."

1903
02:05:50,567 --> 02:05:52,404
"The miracle's going to happen."

1904
02:05:52,484 --> 02:05:54,650
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1905
02:05:54,734 --> 02:05:56,484
"You'll get it..."

1906
02:05:56,567 --> 02:05:58,109
"Someday we'll all get it."

1907
02:05:58,192 --> 02:06:00,067
"Be patient my friend."

1908
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:23,817
"I warned you before..."

1909
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:24,775
"I warned you before..."

1910
02:06:24,859 --> 02:06:25,734
"She will come draped in a saree..."

1911
02:06:25,817 --> 02:06:26,692
"Draped in a saree..."

1912
02:06:26,775 --> 02:06:28,109
"And come for your..."

1913
02:06:28,645 --> 02:06:30,484
"Heart... Your heart... Your heart..."

1914
02:06:30,567 --> 02:06:32,400
"She comes alone."

1915
02:06:32,484 --> 02:06:34,317
"When she comes along."

1916
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:38,109
"Just meet me."

1917
02:06:38,512 --> 02:06:40,445
"Meet me in my dreams."

1918
02:06:40,525 --> 02:06:42,359
"Meet me completely decked up."

1919
02:06:45,317 --> 02:06:46,109
"Because..."

1920
02:06:46,192 --> 02:06:47,942
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1921
02:06:48,025 --> 02:06:49,484
"You'll get it..."

1922
02:06:49,942 --> 02:06:51,404
"I'll get it too."

1923
02:06:51,484 --> 02:06:53,317
"The miracle's going to happen."

1924
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,234
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1925
02:06:55,359 --> 02:06:57,445
"You'll get it..."

1926
02:06:57,525 --> 02:06:59,067
"Someday we'll all get it."

1927
02:06:59,150 --> 02:07:00,984
"Be patient my friend."
