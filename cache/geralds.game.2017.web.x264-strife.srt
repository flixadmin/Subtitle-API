00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,498
What if I won't?

164
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,043
Wait. You have to.

165
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,882
What if I'm sweet?

166
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,138
Go to the bathroom,
get the keys off the sink.

167
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,848
I'll just be sweet.

168
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,517
- Gerald...
- Shh.

169
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,686
- I need you to stop this.
- You'll like it.

170
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,896
[yells] Fuck!

171
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,193
What the fuck is the matter with you?

172
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,612
With me?

173
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,116
[panting]

174
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,915
How did we go so wrong?

175
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,209
Mnh-mnh.

176
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,840
Jess, we were happy once.

177
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,717
Of course.

178
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,220
- Weren't we?
- Yes.

179
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,723
- I mean, weren't we?
- Yes.

180
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,478
What?

181
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,688
[gasps]

182
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,772
Gerald?

183
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,942
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- Honey.

184
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,361
Hey, that's not funny.

185
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,530
[moans]

00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,490
Gerald?

- [gasps]
- Gerald?

188
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,328
What's... Gerald?

189
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,290
- [moans and gasps]
- Hey, hey! What's happ...

190
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,379
Oh, my God.

191
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,216
[whimpering and panting]

192
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,469
Honey?

193
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,015
[crying]

194
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,809
Come on.

195
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,310
[blubbers]

196
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,441
I can't...

197
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,777
Gerald! Gerald!

198
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,278
Hey, baby, look at me.

199
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,863
Wake up, Gerald.

200
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,531
Gerald?

201
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,369
[thuds]

202
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,041
Ger?

203
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,378
Where... Gerald.

204
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,173
Gerald, say something!

205
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,968
Please!

Oh, God!

Wake up!

210

Wake up!

Help!

212
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,402
Sound more real now, huh?

213
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,321
You wanna try again?

214
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,618
Just get back up here.
You can do anything you want.

215
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,704
I mean it.

216
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,165
Anything.

217
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,182
Help!

218
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,269
Help! Somebody!

219
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,522
Help! Somebody!

220
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,788
Help.

221
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,506
Help. [sniffles]

222
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,306
Wake up.

223
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,308
Just wake up.

224
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,770
It's time to wake up, honey.

225
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,397
It's time to wake up.

226
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,068
[branch snaps]

227
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,741
Hello?

228
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,835
[leaves rustling]

229
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,348
Help.

230
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,276
It'll be dark.

231
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,949
In an hour or so, it'll be so dark.

232
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,954
[gate clangs]

233
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,417
Hey!

234
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,254
We're back here! He's hurt!

235
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,592
Nate, Kelly, is that you?

236
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,681
[soft footsteps approaching]

237
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,701
Shit.

238
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,871
Hi.

239
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,461
How was the steak?

240
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,672
It's $200 a portion, you know.

241
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,097
I don't suppose you're a rescue dog.

242
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,559
I didn't think so.

243
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,866
Hey.

244
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,493
Hey.

245
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,120
Back off from him.

246
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,707
[snaps fingers] Hey!

247
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,545
- [stammers]
- [whines]

248
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,259
Hey!

249
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,969
Hey!

250
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,096
Get away from him.

251
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,181
Back off!

252
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,602
Bad dog!

253
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,397
Bad dog!

254
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,150
Hmm...

255
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,360
Hey!

256
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,070
Bad dog! Go away!

257
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,866
- [shouts] Oh, God!
- [growls]

258
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,955
Oh. Uhh... [grunting]

259
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,006
Get the fuck away!

260
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,008
Get the fuck away from him!

261
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,635
[gasping and panting]

262
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,765
No.

263
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,184
[wails and moans]

264
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,855
No.

265
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,523
[gasps]

266
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,982
[groans]

267
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,152
- [gasps] Gerald?
- What the hell?

268
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,821
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I thought... I thought you...

269
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,573
My goddamn arm!

270
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,535
- [stammers] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- The dog, right?

271
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,496
- You were so right. I was so wrong.
- The one you fed.

272
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,958
Uncuff me and hold me. I'm so sorry, baby!

273
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,585
The goddamn dog.

274
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,714
That goddamn dog.

275
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,552
The goddamn dog you had to feed.

276
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,306
Smelled the blood, did what dogs do.

277
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,308
Fuck you, roadkill! I hope you choke!

278
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,275
Should've let you cut up all the steak.
Maybe it would've filled him up.

279
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,733
But I guess they always smell
fresher meat.

280
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,235
Do you remember the joke I told
at Christmas last year?

281
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,779
You came up behind me.

282
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,281
I was, like, four or five
into the night already.

283
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,200
I was loose but not slurring yet.

284
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,869
It was Tom Reynolds I was talking to...

285
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:57,417
in this low and conspiratorial, in that
very specific "guys only" fucking tone

286
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,587
that says, "You'll appreciate this,
brother, but only you."

287
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,591
You didn't hear the beginning
of the joke, just the end...

288
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,930
"And what is a woman anyway?"

289
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,265
And I waited.

290
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,061
That cocky little pause I take
before a punch line

291
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,854
that really makes me proud of myself,

292
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,440
and Tom said, "What?"
like he already knew the answer,

293
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,525
and I said...

294
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,907
"A life support..."

295
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,494
Come on.
"And what is a woman, anyway?"

296
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,626
- "A life support system for a cunt."
- Yeah, that was it.

297
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:44,089
You never told me you heard it.
You never raised an objection.

298
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,050
You smiled through the night,
hated me a little bit,

299
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,262
- but never once brought it up.
- Because you're not like that.

300
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,516
- You don't talk that way.
- Yeah, was I just putting on a show?

301
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,977
For a client?

302
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,690
Stooping to his level
to get something I needed,

303
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:06,194
or was that who I really was,
underneath it all?

304
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,368
Don't ask a question you don't wanna know
the answer to, I guess.

305
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,828
I guess.

306
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,792
A life support system
for a stupid fucking cunt is more like it.

307
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,596
How many hours you been chained
to that bed?

308
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,881
You never heard me breathe, not once.
And you know the sound.

309
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,925
You've heard it every night
for the last 11 years.

310
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,511
That tiny rumbling snore I make
in the back of my throat

311
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,848
that sometimes. I make when I'm lost
in thought. I forget myself. I zone out.

312
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,809
That tiny little "Gerald only"
fucking purr.

313
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:43,231
Hours of not hearing that sound,
total fucking silence, and you knew it.

314
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,484
Five minutes after my head hit the floor,
you saw blood. You heard the silence,

315
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,071
and you knew it, but you just laid there,
wasting precious minutes and hours

316
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,658
and breath and life, calling my fucking
name, talking to a corpse on the floor.

317
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,743
What's happening?

318
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,746
Well, I'm pretty sure
you just lost your mind.

319
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,999
Seeing a dog eating your husband
will do that.

320
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,436
If you're gonna have a mental breakdown,
that's a great excuse.

321
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
Right.

322
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,923
The blood stopped spreading.

323
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,258
A while ago.

324
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,638
And you did what you always do
when it gets too much, you ran.

325
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,223
In here.

326
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:21,061
You just laid here,
calling my name again and again,

327
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,980
and let critical time tick by

328
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,233
- like a stupid fucking...
- Stop it.

329
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,085
You should have been thinking
about life support.

330
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,111
Maybe that's why
you're remembering that joke now.

331
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,635
Gotta be for some reason, after all.

332
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,658
And why is that?

333
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,369
- Time.
- That's right!

334
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,665
You're a life support system.
You've been unplugged.

335
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,148
There's still juice in there,
but the charge is running down.

336
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,420
And if you don't get out of the cuffs,
it will go all the way to zero.

337
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,175
When did we get here?

338
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,766
One-ish, I think.

339
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,434
And how long till we got into bed?

340
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,563
- An hour, maybe more.
- Call that two o'clock, then.

341
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,065
And I dropped dead...

342
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,150
Ten minutes, maybe, after.

343
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,111
When's the sun been setting?

344
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,739
- 7:15 or so.
- Oh, that's pretty close.

345
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:20,912
That's another 15, 20, tops.
So, let's say... five hours, so far.

346
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,206
Five hours you've wasted,

347
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,750
screaming for neighbors
that are half a mile away.

348
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,585
[both] If they're even here yet.

349
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,879
And, you know,
if you really think about it...

350
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,025
- Nate and Kelly said they wouldn't...
- They wouldn't be heading up until June.

351
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,843
The maids came to prep for us yesterday.

352
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,970
Because the bed is made
and the house is dusted.

353
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,055
Which means they're done and gone,
and the grass...

354
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,267
- was cut, fresh.
- Which means no gardeners.

355
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,439
Because I arranged it all
to get the place ready for us today.

356
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,444
And I wouldn't want them
interrupting my little game,

357
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,488
so I probably gave them
at least the weekend off.

358
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,325
- So, who could possibly...
- possibly hear you scream?

359
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,951
Except Cujo over there?

360
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,925
[grunts]

361
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,219
- You tried that.
- I know.

362
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,433
You can pull till your wrists break.
You're not getting out of those cuffs.

363
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,393
[Jessie yells]

364
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,190
[bones cracking]

365
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,779
[laughs] I told you.

366
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,322
I told you.

367
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,076
[grunting]

368
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,007
It's that easy.

369
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,553
Oh, babe, you're really losing it now.

370
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,224
Except your hand won't fit
through the cuff

371
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,642
and the bedpost is reinforced.

372
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,394
- Nice thought, though.
- Shut up.

373
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,023
Don't listen to him. He's the reason
we're here and look how he ended up.

374
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,858
I'm just telling her
how things really are.

375
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,612
No, you're doing what you always did,
minimizing, condescending.

376
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,240
Men aren't so much blessed
with penises as cursed by them.

377
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,157
[laughs]

378
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,077
And we might die here today
because of Gerald's five inches.

379
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,164
Our life has to add up to more than that.

380
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,376
- I can't get out.
- What about the stories on the news,

381
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,628
where mothers lift their cars
to save their children?

382
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,879
She's no mother.

383
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,841
What's that supposed to mean?

384
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,593
No maternal instinct.

385
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,305
- Your career always came first.
- That's what you said.

386
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,641
Maybe you even started to believe it.

387
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,228
I'm not so sure you can hide things
from me now.

388
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,730
You're wasting precious time here.

389
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,106
I can't get out.

390
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,276
- You have to.
- I am chained to the goddamn bed!

391
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,028
Don't recite facts to me. Wake up.

392
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,947
Says the voice in your head.

393
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,117
This is you... all over.

394
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,828
Problem, panic, denial.

395
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,998
Hoping if you look away,
it'll magically vanish.

396
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,878
If you don't wake up,
you're gonna die in those handcuffs.

397
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,673
And we both know you've been sleepwalking
since you were 12 years old.

398
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,300
- Not now.
- If not now, when?

399
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,801
Not now, what?

400
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,973
He put you in those handcuffs
way before Gerald did.

401
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,645
Who's "he"?

402
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,428
If I can get to the phone...

403
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,731
Phone's gonna die anyway.
I never charged it.

404
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,025
Or did a load of laundry, for that matter.

405
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,204
Tough luck.

406
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,874
Okay, scrap that.
Phone might as well be on Mars.

407
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,293
If you can't get off the bed...

408
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,426
live long enough
for someone to find you on it.

409
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,634
Yeah.

410
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,564
[moans]

411
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,279
What's wrong?

412
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,282
My head hurts.

413
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,578
You know why?

414
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,205
Life support.

415
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,295
How long do you think
someone lives without water?

416
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,006
Three days?

417
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,800
At best.

418
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,639
Yeah, seems like
I've heard three days somewhere.

419
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,517
That feels about right.

420
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,355
And it's been, what? Five...

421
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,442
six, seven hours.

422
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,740
I wanted to please you so badly.

423
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,662
This was such a stupid fucking idea.

424
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,374
Remember when I first
started taking those?

425
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,668
I hid it.

426
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,838
For what, six months?

427
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,924
I found the prescription.

428
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,636
You found it and never said anything.

429
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,433
But I knew you'd seen it,
and I just stopped covering it up.

430
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,438
- We never talked about it, though.
- There was that one time.

431
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,068
That one time.

432
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:30,406
Late one night, you tried without a pill,
and it just wasn't working.

433
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,492
- I was as soft as a kitten.
- Until...

434
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,662
- Until...
- Until you held my wrists above my head.

435
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,791
- I hadn't done that before.
- No, you had.

436
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,462
- This time, though...
- I grabbed your throat.

437
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,759
- Softly, then I squeezed, didn't I?
- Mm-hmm.

438
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,929
And, God, was I hard.

439
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,724
I was harder than you'd felt in years.

440
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,477
And you just laid there...

441
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,522
and I went to town...

442
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,442
and you moaned...

443
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,071
like a dutiful wife, never objected.

444
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,661
But, for the first time, first time
in all those years, you wondered...

445
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,540
"Who exactly did I marry?"

446
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,711
We never really know, do we?

447
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,465
'Cause everybody's got a little corner
in there somewhere.

448
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,221
A button...
they won't admit they want pressed.

449
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,517
Year after year...

450
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,938
I barely gave you a glimpse of mine.

451
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,234
[Jessie 2] One thing for sure...

452
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,613
you're glad he took
those little blue pills.

453
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,365
Huh?

454
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:56,993
You're glad.

455
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,662
I couldn't figure out...

456
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,582
what was wrong with me
that you needed.

457
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,418
No, you're not listening. Take one, babe.

458
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:15,887
Now give it to her.

459
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,931
Wait, I...

460
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,516
Give it to her.

461
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,187
- Are you...
- Give her what she needs.

462
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,150
Nice.

463
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,111
[Jessie 2] Thank God for those pills.

464
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,992
For those little blue pills
that made Gerald so thirsty.

465
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,535
Oh...

466
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,676
Okay. Okay.

467
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,313
[gasps, panting]

468
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,549
[panting]

469
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,938
You're smirking.

470
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,898
What?

471
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,651
[cuffs clank]

472
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,820
That's what.

473
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,742
- Stupid.
- No.

474
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,871
[whimpers]

475
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,706
Don't you dare let it go.

476
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,458
- But I can't.
- Put it down.

477
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,836
- Where?
- Right where you caught it.

478
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,089
- Where you know you can reach it again.
- Okay.

479
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,052
Careful.

480
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,471
[gasps]

481
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,479
Go away.

482
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,361
- Get the fuck away!
- Look at me.

483
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:43,993
That dog is just doing what it has to,
to get along, and you have to do the same.

484
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,371
- Focus.
- But I can't!

485
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,416
You're right. Give up.

486
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,628
Come tomorrow,
you and Gerald will be together again,

487
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,254
inside the fucking dog.

488
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,132
- Can we please get back to work now?
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,256
[Gerald] I love this slip.

490
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,056
I love this slip.

491
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,851
Oh, good, I bought it special.

492
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,603
You bought it brand-new.

493
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,765
[slurping]

494
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,395
Mmm.

495
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,985
[gulps]

496
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,070

498
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,578
Why can't I keep my eyes open?

499
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,040
Stress makes your adrenaline
and cortisol levels skyrocket,

500
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,625
and now you're crashing.

501
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,919
That's it, just fade away.

502
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,713
Assume this'll all be fine.

503
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,636
- I know... I know I shouldn't.
- Well, maybe you should.

504
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,224
If anyone's gonna find you,
it'll likely be tomorrow, not tonight.

505
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,104
- I will need my energy.
- [Jessie 2] You will.

506
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,939
You will, at that.

507
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,194
Hmm. Tomorrow.

508
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,303

Where'd you go, you little shit? [gasps]

512
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,183
Hello?

513
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,713
Who are you?

514
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,929
I... I need help.

515
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,443
You're...

516
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,071
not...

517
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,949
real.

518
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,285
Not real.

519
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,919
[footsteps approaching]

520
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,052
Not real.

521
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,387
Maybe.

522
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,893
Or maybe you're just not safe anymore.

523
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,942
People are safe from ghouls and ghosts...

524
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,404
and the living dead in the daylight.

525
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,533
And they're usually safe
from them at night...

526
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,619
if they're with others.

527
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,206
But a person alone... in the dark...

528
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:54,882
Women alone in the dark
are like open doors, Jessie.

529
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,843
And if they scream for help,
who knows what might answer?

530
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:05,768
Who knows what people see
in the moment of their solitary death?

531
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,066
Is it so hard to believe
that some of them may have died of fear...

532
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,446
no matter what the words
on the death certificates say?

533
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
Died of fear...

534
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,456
because they saw, at their bedside...

535
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,835
the Moonlight Man.

536
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,633
Maybe that's just what Death looks like.

537
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,845
Not... real.

538
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,685
Then why did the dog leave?

539
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,652
Maybe he just moved...

540
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,821
under the bed.

541
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,119
He could reach up at any time,
put his hand on your hip.

542
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,794
[gasps]

543
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,967
And if he wants that cold, dirty hand...

544
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,845
on your soft, warm flesh,

545
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,181
there's not much
you can do about it, Mouse.

546
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,936
- What did you call me?
- Close your eyes.

547
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,565
If there's a monster under your bed,
it won't bother you if you're asleep.

548
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,986
Everybody knows that, Mouse.

549
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,364
Don't call me that.

550
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,742
Dream your dreams.

551
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:48,996
Dream deep.

552
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,778
[mother] No, help your father, please.

553
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,220
You okay, Jessie?

554
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,140
- It's so much smaller than I remember.
- 'Cause you're bigger.

555
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,392
- Come on, Mouse.
- [mother] Wait up.

556
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,768
[sister] I'm going in the water!

557
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,229
- [father] No, no, no.
- [mother] No, no running, please.

558
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,314
Thank you.

559
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,612
Can you please bring
your lacrosse stuff inside?

560
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,157
- Can you help, please?
- [father] No playing that inside.

561
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,409
[man on radio]
For the first time in 26 years,

562
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,871
a total solar eclipse will occur
in the United States.

563
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,074
The few and lucky cities
along the path of the eclipse

564
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,667
who have decided
to create official viewing areas,

565
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,753
have set their focus to logistics,

566
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,380
ensuring the comfort and safety
of their guests.

567
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,592
For those of us who have never seen
a total solar eclipse,

568
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,844
this is an opportunity
to view one of the most rare...

569
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,931
- and beautiful phenomena on the planet.
- [siblings] Dad!

570
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,224
The eclipse is tracked...

571
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,684
- Oh, you did it!
- We finally finished them.

572
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,019
[brother] I made this, too.

573
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,439
All right.
Here, go on out to the boat now.

574
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,024
- Yes, sir.
- Be careful.

575
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,235
- [sister] Okay.
- [brother] Okay, Dad.

576
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,154
[man on radio] It's rare to see
more than one from any single location.

577
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:09,201
You'd have to wait an average of 375 years
to see two eclipses from the same place.

578
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,246
Since our area lies
within the path of totality,

579
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,208
we can expect to experience
two minutes and 20 seconds of totality,

580
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,752
starting today at around 4:17 p.m.

581
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,555
You want me to make sandwiches
for the boat?

582
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,925
I don't think I wanna go out
on the boat today. The lake scares me.

583
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,802
People have drowned out there, you know.

584
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,515
[father] If she's afraid of the water,
I'm not gonna force her out onto a boat.

585
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,518
[mother] We came here as a family
to do this on the lake.

586
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,854
It is not going to kill her
to spend some time with the rest of us.

587
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,898
She's a complete daddy's girl.

588
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,733
- That's normal, isn't it?
- Please don't.

589
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,818
What?

590
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,698
You didn't even wanna go skiing with us
over Christmas.

591
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,033
And we didn't force you out
onto the mountain, did we?

592
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,244
No, we left you at the lodge
and let you relax.

593
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,647
[mother] You wanna stay with her?

594
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,957
Stay with her. Fine.
She's a nuisance anyway.

595
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,435
She picks fights with her brother.
She rolls her eyes at me incessantly.

596
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,379
- [father] She's 12.
- Yeah. Smiles and sweetness for Daddy.

597
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,383
That's totally
age-appropriate behavior, isn't it?

598
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,595
Sure.

599
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:11,930
It's just...

600
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,644
It's fine. It's fine! It's fine.

601
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,146
Okay, I'm not...

than at any other point along its path.

603
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,781
This is another reminder to our listeners

604
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,243
not to look directly into the eclipse,
which should begin to...

- Yeah. Mom said it was too short.

- Here, so you don't hurt your eyes.
- Thanks. Where's yours?

Oh, you know what? I don't know.

617

I think your mom might have taken it.

I'm just remembering something.

You and me, sitting here together...

625
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,207
When you were a little girl,
you used to sit on my lap.

626

You'd point up at the stars,

627
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,378
and you'd ask me
how far away each one was.

00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,089

Well, how about it?

Nah, that's silly. That's just

[Jessie 2] Really?

You married an older man.

686
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,943
Your father was a lawyer.
Gerald was a lawyer.

687
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,863
Your father minimized you,
objectified you.

Let's not forget
my burgeoning drinking problem.

Babe, if you had a drinking problem,
that's certainly cured now.

The point is, Jessie...

691
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,708
you married into the only dynamic
you've ever known.

692
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,460
You were a girl, he was a man, and...

693
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,005
you never walked away from that.

694
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,589
That afternoon never ended.

695
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,010
It's not enough... that I'm here.

I also have to be there? Again?

697
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,347
You tell me.

698
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,976
You'd gotten your period
for the first time a month before, right?

699
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,940
Maybe that's what got him going.
He smelled the blood and did what dogs do.

700
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,530
Our friend in the hall
is every man you've ever known.

701
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,741
He had Kobe rib eye...

702
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,160
- It's actually from Kobe.
- Till he smelled Gerald.

703
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,912
Your father had your mother
till you were nice and ripe.

704
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,956
- It wasn't like that.
- And Gerald...

705
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,625
The late hours, the mystery callers...

706
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,670
The weekend trips...
What was he really doing?

707
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,672
You ignored it, but...

708
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,634
you knew his hunger for you had faded,
and a dog's gotta eat.

709
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,012
I handled it.

710
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,222
Sure.

711
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,769
Just like you handled
those last few minutes on Daddy's lap.

712
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,483
He didn't rape me.

713
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,027
He didn't even touch me.

714
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,530
He only touched himself. [sobs]

715
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,742
And if you wanna blame someone...

716
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,036
I might as well blame...

717
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,372
my mother or the boat.

718
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,292
The sundress that was too short.

719
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,298
What he did to me on that swing...

720
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,968
wasn't the worst thing anyone's ever done.

721
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:34,641
No, that would be what he did
to you after, in the bedroom.

722
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,603
What did he do?

723
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,275
Nothing.

724
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,029
He just talked to me.

725
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,155
Nothing?

726
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,909
Nothing on the swing.

727
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,873
And nothing in the room.
It might as well have been a bad dream.

728
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,917
I had a dream...

729
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,711
that night at the lake house.

730
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,507
There was a woman...

731
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:12,971
standing over a deep well,
looking down into the blackness.

732
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,015
And I'm in the well, looking up at her.

733
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,770
The sky was so dark behind her...

734
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,982
the eclipse burning overhead.

735
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,444
The smell... The smell in that well...

736
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,158
It was like pennies, and then oysters.

737
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,370
She was standing there in her red dress...

738
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,956
looking right at me.

739
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,460
What was in the well?

740
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,006
Secrets.

741
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,386
So many secrets.

742
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,181
You thought yours
could go down there, too.

743
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,643
Just... throw 'em in the well,
down in the dark.

744
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,230
Who was the woman?

745
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,525
I remember thinking
maybe she was supposed to be me.

746
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,405
Because she would never tell.
I knew that, looking at her.

747
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,241
She'd die before she told.

748
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,869
"I could do that," I figured.

749
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,584
I don't know why I thought of that.

750
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,587
It was just a dream.

751
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,590
Like the man in the corner.

752
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,971
He was definitely... a bad dream.

753
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,057
[laughs]

754
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,892
I don't know, princess.

755
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,774
You can tell yourself that
if you need to.

756
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,567
He was a trick of the mind.

757
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,403
Just like you, Gerald.
Just like both of you.

758
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,757
Then why won't you look over there
for more than a second?

759
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,261
What are you afraid you're gonna see?

760
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,410
- Why are you still listening to him?
- Shh!

761
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,800
- It's probably from the dog.
- It's bigger than that.

762
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,262
Look at it again.

763
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,687
[Gerald] I think it's a footprint.

764
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,855
- And if it is...
- Shut up!

765
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,857
It was Death you saw.

766
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,611
He'll be back tonight, Jessie.

767
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,658
And when you're dead, he'll have
your wedding ring in his case...

768
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,911
with the rest of his pretty things.

769
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,292
His souvenirs.

770
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,087
- I am gonna close my eyes.
- No.

771
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,339
- And count to ten.
- Stay awake.

772
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,841
And when I open them...

773
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,094
you will both be gone.

774
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,268
- Ten, nine, eight...
- [Jessie 2] Do you hear me?

775
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,353
- Stay awake.
- I'm awake.

776
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:12,817
Seven, six, five...

777
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,363
four, three...

778
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,616
two...

779
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,659
one.

780
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,344
[father] You all right, Mouse?

781
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,227
I'm so sorry.

782
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,889
I'm sorry you were there when I...

783
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,477
It's not like I touched you, Jessie.

784
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,230
But still...

785
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,195
Maybe we should tell Mom.

786
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,408
I think we have to, don't you?

787
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,204
I hate to...

788
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,167
just because things have been pretty
tense between the two of you lately.

789
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,963
Hell, they've been tense
between us, too...

790
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,006
with the baby and all.

791
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,509
But this...

792
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,180
well, this could make things a lot worse.

793
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,353
She won't think it's your fault.

794
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,731
I'm sure.

795
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,067
Fairly sure. I mean, she might.

796
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,155
We all know... it wasn't your fault.

797
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,119
Maybe we shouldn't tell her.

798
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,458
I have to.

799
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,210
We have to.

800
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,254
Why?

801
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,631
Because...

802
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:45,595
- Because you can't keep it a secret.
- Because you can't keep it a secret.

803
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,269
I mean, if it's ever going to come out,

804
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,482
then it's better for both of us
that it happen now.

805
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:02,904
Not in a week or a year or...
even ten years from now.

806
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,119
Please...

807
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,872
I won't tell.

808
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,959
I mean...

809
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,422
if we don't tell your mom today...

810
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,801
then we could never tell anyone.

811
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,928
I wouldn't. Never.

812
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,012
Not ever.

813
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,431
- Ever.
- And not just your mother.

814
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:32,975
Not anyone.

815
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:38,564
That's a big responsibility
for a little girl.

816
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:40,857
I'm sorry.

817
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,527
A young woman.

818
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,155
But you might be tempted.

819
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,366
With friends...

820
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:54,080
One of them tells you a secret,
maybe you might wanna tell them.

821
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:58,000
- Never.
- Or your brother.

822
01:03:58,584 --> 01:03:59,585
Or your sister.

823
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,673
There might come a time
when you wanna tell...

824
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:04,757
No.

825
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,970
No. I promise. I swear.

826
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,139
I don't know, Jess.

827
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:19,063
I think it might be better for both of us
if this were all out in the open now.

828
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,357
Take our medicine.

829
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,944
I mean, she can't kill us.

830
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,281
Please...

831
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:33,286
Please, please, please.
Please just don't tell her.

832
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,791
I won't tell anybody... ever.

833
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,587
Ever. Please.

834
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:50,970
I've never been able to refuse you
anything that you really wanted, have I?

835
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,182
Okay, Jess.

836
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,060
We'll try things your way.

837
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,146
Thank you, Daddy.

838
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,901
So I guess we have a deal.

839
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,112
I say nothing.

840
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:13,701
You say nothing, not to anyone else,
not even to each other.

841
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,662
We walk out of this room...

842
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,916
and it never happened.

843
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,126
Okay.

844
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,342
I did a shameful thing.

845
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,013
You looked away... when you said that.

846
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:40,478
You were able to face me with the lies.

847
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,900
But it was the truth
that finally made you turn away.

848
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,569
[father] I don't know what came over me.

849
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,322
Maybe it was the eclipse.

850
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,704
Well, thank God
we'll never see another one.

851
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,210
Nothing happened.

852
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,381
Nothing ever happened.

853
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:18,140
Come on, let's get grilling.
They should be back in a bit.

854
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,703
[licking sounds]

855
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,957
[yells and gasps]

856
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,122
- [growls]
- [bone crunches]

857
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,675
[flesh tearing]

858
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,705
He'll try that again.

859
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,542
It's fresher meat.

860
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,901
You're still strong enough to kick,
but you won't be for long,

861
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,173
and he can smell that.

862
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,429
Afternoon already.

863
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,808
Sun's starting down.

864
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,520
And no one came this morning.

865
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,566
Or if they did, you were asleep.

866
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:58,491
Eventually, someone will find you, Jess,
but it might take a long time.

867
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:04,163
The first assumption will be we're off
on some wild romantic fling.

868
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,247
I mean, why not?

869
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,542
Only you and I know, at the end,

870
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,378
I could only get it up
if you were handcuffed to the bed.

871
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,425
To the rest of the world,
we're the picture of marital function.

872
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,721
Sooner or later,
people will start looking, my people.

873
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,851
There are a couple of women
in New Orleans you call friends, but...

874
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,106
You've never really let them
inside your life, have you?

875
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,529
None of them are gonna worry much
if you drop out of sight for a week or...

876
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,531
ten days.

877
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:43,619
But I have appointments.

878
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,415
And when I don't show up by Friday,
there'll be questions.

879
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,546
That's how it'll start.

880
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:02,429
I think the caretaker
will actually discover the bodies.

881
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,892
He'll call the cops when he spots you
through the window or...

882
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,728
when he smells us.

883
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:16,402
He'll turn his face away while he throws
the blanket from the closet over you

884
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,488
because he won't wanna see your fingers
sticking through the handcuffs.

885
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,326
Stiff as pencils, white as candles.

886
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,454
But, most of all...

887
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,500
he won't wanna look at the expression
of horror on your face.

888
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,460
Why are you doing this?

889
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,882
The forensics unit will show up
with the county coroner.

890
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,719
When they pull off the blanket,
they will...

891
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:48,517
wince and nod and tell each other
the woman on the bed died hard.

892
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,061
But they won't know the half of it.

893
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,523
They won't know...

894
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,486
the real reason your eyes are staring...

895
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,073
and your mouth is screaming...

896
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,537
is because of what you saw at the end...

897
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,040
coming out of the dark.

898
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:18,005
They'll take you to the medical examiner.
He'll cut you open, inventory your guts.

899
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:21,592
He'll have a peek
at what's left of your last meal,

900
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:24,595
take a little section of brain
to look at under his microscope.

901
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:25,888
But in the end...

902
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,521
in the end, he'll just call it
"death by misadventure."

903
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,361
- They were playing a harmless game.
- Harmless.

904
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:44,573
Only the gentleman had a heart attack
at a critical moment...

905
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,661
and the woman was left to...

906
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,873
Well, it's best not to get into it.

907
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,461
Just to say the lady died hard.

908
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,674
You only need to look at her to see that.

909
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,640
And maybe someone
will notice your wedding ring is gone...

910
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:16,188
but they won't hunt for it
for long, if at all.

911
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,861
They won't notice that one
of your bones...

912
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:28,284
not an important one, the third phalange
in your right foot, let's say...

913
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:32,288
is also gone.

914
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,459
But we'll know, won't we, Jess?

915
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:42,381
We'll know he took them.

916
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,136
Because it was Death.

917
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,806
And you did see him...

918
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,644
as people who die in the lonely places do.

919
01:11:58,522 --> 01:11:59,606
It was Death.

920
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:05,654
And tonight, when the sun goes down,
he'll be back for you.

I don't want you to be sorry.

935
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,319
Then what do you want?

936
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,156
I want you to remember.

937
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,201
You think I don't remember?

938
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,287
I remember every moment.

939
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:23,333
I remember every shame-filled glance
he threw my way, and I remember Mom...

940
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,087
- looking but not seeing...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

941
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,172
Because seeing?

942
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,425
It would have meant my little sister
was also doomed

943
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:34,178
to let that son of a bitch
steal her childhood,

944
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,638
and Mom would have died
before facing that.

945
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,558
So it was up to me to protect Maddie.

946
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,812
Even though it meant that I never felt
like part of the family again.

947
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:51,528
And that wasn't my job description.
Was it? My job was to be a kid.

948
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,405
Suddenly, that wasn't an option.

949
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,909
You've had everything you need
to survive from the beginning.

950
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,995
You just have to remember.

951
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,749
Not the sun, not the eclipse.

952
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,543
After.

953
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,506
[mother] We had fun on the boat.
Should we get one?

954
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,649
- [Maddie] Yeah.
- [mother] Yeah?

955
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,926
I hope it was as pretty here
as it was on the boat.

956
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,345
- It was awesome.
- It was fun.

957
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:19,431
- [laughing]
- "It was fun."

958
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,851
It was beautiful here, too.
Right, Mouse? We had fun.

959
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,978
Did you have a nice time
with your dad, Jess?

960
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:32,569
Jesus! Jess, are you okay?

961
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,489
I'm... I'm...

962
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:38,158
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

963
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,327
Just come on,
let's get this cleaned up.

964
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,387
Oh, it's not so bad.

965
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:00,847
I think you'll live.

966
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,935
- Does it hurt?
- It's okay.

967
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,479
Just...

968
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:09,773
Just be careful.

969
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:12,901
The last thing I want...

970
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,321
is to have to take you
to the emergency room

971
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,282
and have your fingers sewn back on.

972
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,590
It's gonna fucking hurt.

973
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,736
- But the thing about blood...
- But the thing about blood...

974
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,555
is that, until it clots,
it's as slick as oil.

975
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,849
That will not work.

976
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:46,226
Maybe not.

977
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,106
But the wrists have fewer nerves
than the body's other checkpoints.

978
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:54,776
That's why slitting wrists
is always the best way to...

979
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,361
How do you know so much about that?

980
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,532
Go too deep, you'll bleed to death.

981
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,536
Do nothing, I'll die of seizures,
dehydration or dog.

982
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:07,873
Or when my visitor with the bag of bones
shows up tonight.

983
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,917
The sun is starting down.
He'll be here soon.

984
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,419
Then I'll have to hurry.

985
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,553
Barely working, aren't they?

986
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:25,140
- I won't need much.
- Your legs won't be reliable.

987
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:27,351
It's been a day and a half
since you walked on them.

988
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:32,981
If my hands pull this off,
my legs better do their fucking part.

989
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,196
Okay.

990
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,408
Visualize it, then. All of it.

991
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,785
Yeah, okay.

992
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,210
Okay, okay.

993
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,909
[Jessie 2] Once you start,
you're not gonna be able to stop.

994
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:11,436
Everything has to go very fast
because your system is already dehydrated.

995
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,689
- And, Jessie...
- Huh?

996
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,691
You know, if anything goes wrong...

997
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:16,900
It won't matter.

998
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,404
Goodbye.

999
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:31,957
Okay.

1000
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,477
You stay right there, dog.

1001
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:06,992
One, two...

1002
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:09,870
Okay, okay.

1003
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:14,541
- Three!
- [glass breaking]

1004
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,560
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1005
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:38,607
[grunting, panting]

1006
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,124
Oh, God!

1007
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,085
[flesh tearing]

1008
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:00,712

01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,716

[screaming]

1012
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,199
Come on. Come on.

1013
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:30,801
Shit!

1014
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:48,945
[key jangles on desk]

1015
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:50,196
[yells]

1016
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,575
Okay.

1017
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:55,410
Okay.

1018
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,427
[panting]

1019
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:19,684
[coughs]

1020
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,002
[dog growling]

1021
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,258
Get off me!

1022
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:06,416
[car horn beeps]

1023
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,003
[dog growling]

1024
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:16,885
[whimpering]

1025
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:21,931
[barks]

1026
01:24:57,842 --> 01:25:00,053
[whispers] You're only made of moonlight.

1027
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,518
You're only made of...

1028
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:08,728
Moonlight.

1029
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,215
[car engine starts]

1030
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:08,705
[groans]

1031
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:28,975
- Oh!
- [tires screech]

1032
01:26:29,058 --> 01:26:30,351
Oh, God.

1033
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:32,896
Please, just a little bit longer.

1034
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:37,233
[mumbles] Please just... a little...

1035
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,516
Oh, no.

1036
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:16,355
Mouse.

1037
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:48,930
[coughing]

1038
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:10,994
[horn honking]

1039
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:22,255
Hi.

1040
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,218
[footsteps approaching]

1041
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,212
I'm writing this letter
with my right hand,

1042
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,923
nestled snug
in its frictionless burn glove.

1043
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,886
Three skin grafts later,
it still doesn't work quite right,

1044
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:11,471
and it still hurts to write.

1045
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:13,890
But that's good.

1046
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,726
This letter should hurt to write.

1047
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:23,608
The doctors, the cops
and even the reporters

1048
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,860
accepted my amnesia at face value.

1049
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:27,612
And why not?

1050
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:30,698
People who undergo serious trauma
often block out memories.

1051
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,493
The cops knew that
even better than the lawyers.

1052
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:36,079
And I knew it better than any of them.

1053
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,542
Gerald's firm kept the details out
of the papers.

1054
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,752
That was kind.

1055
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:46,672
The coroners confirmed it was
a heart attack and a long time coming.

1056
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:52,303
The insurance paid,
the headlines faded, and life went on.

1057
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:54,180
The new normal.

1058
01:29:57,517 --> 01:29:59,102
Well, not normal.

1059
01:30:00,394 --> 01:30:01,646
Never normal.

1060
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:05,441
Every night,
just before I closed my eyes...

1061
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:07,527
[moaning]

1062
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:17,203
[panting]

1063
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:32,427
[gasps]

1064
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:39,433
If it wasn't him, if it wasn't his face
keeping me from sleep...

1065
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:41,602
it was the question.

1066
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,147
That in all the reports,

1067
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,190
all the cops that combed
through that house,

1068
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:48,693
they never found my wedding ring.

1069
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:54,115
What got me through those nights was you.

1070
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:56,450
Thinking of you.

1071
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,996
And why you came to me that day.

1072
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:04,709
You, in your sunless world,
always on that swing.

1073
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:07,795
What you needed me to understand...

1074
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,760
that his shackles were silence,

1075
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:19,056
and his were comfort.

1076
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:25,688
My days were better.

1077
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:27,481
I took the insurance money,

1078
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:31,819
and I started a foundation
for girls and boys like us.

1079
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:37,783
I spent so long never telling that story,
so... I made sure that I did.

1080
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:42,830
I tell that story every day
to every kid it could possibly help.

1081
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:48,586
When I was 12,
I went to the lake house with my family.

1082
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,423
And while that helped my days,
I still sat up at night...

1083
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,220
waiting for that pale face
in the moonlight...

1084
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:00,973
to claim his runaway bride.

1085
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:10,191
Six months after the handcuffs,
six months of being a widow...

1086
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:13,194
six months of living death.

1087
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:18,699
And then Raymond Andrew Joubert's picture

1088
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,534
first appeared in the paper.

1089
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:26,707
Two years ago,
reports of graveyard vandalism

1090
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,918
in the backwoods of Alabama
hit the papers,

1091
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,463
but I never read about them,
not in New Orleans.

1092
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,549
And they were tiny stories, buried.

1093
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,636
Someone was breaking
into crypts and mausoleums

1094
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:43,391
of small town cemeteries
with drills, bolt cutters and hacksaws...

1095
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,893
and stripping corpses of jewelry.

1096
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:48,604
As the months went by, it escalated.

1097
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,315
Incidents started being reported
in Louisiana.

1098
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:55,278
He gouged out eyes, cut corpses' throats.

1099
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:58,948
Last February,
two were found without noses.

1100
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,868
Later hands. Then... ears.

1101
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,539
Something I'd always assumed was the dog.

1102
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:11,711
And when it came to removing genitalia
after having sex with the dead...

1103
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,505
he stuck strictly to the gentlemen.

1104
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,300
This was, clearly, extremely lucky for me.

1105
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:21,929
I only noticed
when he finally made the front page.

1106
01:33:22,596 --> 01:33:24,974
He'd graduated, it seemed, from the dead.

1107
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:29,186
And, one night, a man woke up
to find Raymond Joubert in his room,

1108
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,647
naked, trying to cut off his ear.

1109
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,109
Joubert suffers from acromegaly,

1110
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:38,446
a progressive enlargement
of the hands, feet and face

1111
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:41,324
that happens when the pituitary gland
goes into warp drive.

1112
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,826
It causes the forehead to bulge

1113
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:47,538
and abnormally long arms
that dangle almost to his knees.

1114
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:52,418
They went to his only known address,
a farmhouse on Kingston Road.

1115
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,337
They didn't find him there,

1116
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,714
but they did find his sister
and her husband,

1117
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,633
who he called his "mommy and daddy."

1118
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,096
He'd scalped them both
and eaten most of "Daddy."

1119
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,935
They found 50 bell jars
containing ears, lips, fingers.

1120
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:14,523
They think he may have killed as many
as a dozen people in the last five years.

1121
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,651
But, for some reason, he spared me.

1122
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:21,447
This monster was real, real as they come.

1123
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:25,117
As real as the cuffs, as the dog.

1124
01:34:26,535 --> 01:34:28,037
As real as the eclipse.

1125
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:32,333
And so I had to write this
to you, Mouse...

1126
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,753
because you're the only person
who'd understand...

1127
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,714
and you're the only one who truly matters.

1128
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:45,388
[Young Jessie] "He's being arraigned
tomorrow, and I'm going to see him.

1129
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,392
Because the people who were supposed
to protect you from the monsters...

1130
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:52,311
[both] turned out to be
monsters themselves...

1131
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:55,064
[both] and it almost killed you."

1132
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:58,109
We need the sun to come back out.

1133
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:00,194
After so long...

1134
01:35:01,695 --> 01:35:03,280
I think we deserve the sun.

1135
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:10,746
[reporter] This morning, it was announced
that cameras would not be allowed

1136
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,665
inside the courtroom for the arraignment,

1137
01:35:12,748 --> 01:35:17,461
an unusual decision in a case
that's already full of surprises.

1138
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,630
But nothing more unusual than the way...

1139
01:35:19,713 --> 01:35:22,883
Sources within the Alabama State
Police Department tell us

1140
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:26,720
Raymond Andrew Joubert hasn't spoken
a single word since his arrest,

1141
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,722
not even to his public defender.

1142
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:32,184

trespassing and vandalism.

1143

1144
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:38,357

01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,235
Twenty-one counts mutilation.

1146
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,113
Twenty-eight counts
desecrating human remains.

1147
01:35:45,197 --> 01:35:47,783
Sixteen counts breaking and entering.

1148
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:48,701
Hey.

1149
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:51,370
- Four counts, assault and battery.
- [clears throat] Hey!

1150
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:54,122
Ma'am?

1151
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,004
You're not real!

1152
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:04,800
[crowd gasps]

1153
01:36:05,384 --> 01:36:06,927
You're not real!

1154
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:08,345
[woman] Officer!

1155
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:11,891
You're only made of moonlight!

1156
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:39,667
[chuckles]

1157
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:42,379
You're so much smaller than I remember.
