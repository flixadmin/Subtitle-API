1
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:05,125
My name is Captain Swing,
calling from the occupied Six Counties.

2
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:08,005
<i>This Michael, your kin,</i>

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,445
making deals with the very men
who want you dead.

4
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:12,645
What happened on that ship?

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:15,885
Said the men from Glasgow
were called Billy Boys.

6
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:20,805
Protestant razor gang.
They run every man east of Glasgow.

7
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:23,725
We have a mutual acquaintance.

8
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:26,645
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

9
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,405
I'm Jimmy.

10
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:33,965
<i>I need Mr Shelby to understand that
his best is not good enough.</i>

11
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,285
<i>Your body will be the lesson.</i>

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,885
Tommy, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:43,125
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

14
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:45,685
My chair. My throne.

15
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,645
People think that I'm gonna fall,
they start to circle.

16
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,205
Who's gonna take the throne, eh?

17
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,765
<i>Black cat dreams are never wrong.</i>

18
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:03,525
They crucified my son...

19
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:06,685
...for you.

20
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,845
Good morning, sisters.

21
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:27,205
Let us pray.

22
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:42,925
Our Father, who art in heaven...

23
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,565
...but deliver us from evil...

24
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:06,845
...for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever...

25
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,525
...Amen.

26
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:20,685
You wanted to speak to us, Mr Shelby?

27
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,285
Yeah.

28
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,285
- All of us?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:27,125
At 6.30 in the morning?

30
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,045
Yes.

31
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:34,365
- We don't smoke in here.
- Well, I fucking do.

32
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:37,125
Nor do we use language.

33
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:40,285
Nor do we find fault in the innocent.

34
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:41,645
Yet you do.

35
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:45,125
You fucking do.

36
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,205
May I ask what this meeting is about?

37
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:55,605
The Grace Shelby Foundation
is the biggest single source of funding

38
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,005
for this charitable institution,

39
00:02:57,045 --> 00:03:00,205
devoted to the care of the orphaned girls
of south Birmingham, yeah?

40
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,565
For which we give thanks.

41
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:04,645
Uh-huh.

42
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:09,445
I have a temper similar to the one
described in that report.

43
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,405
Yet, unlike you,
I wait until I'm matched in size.

44
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,565
Whose report?

45
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:18,165
The testimony of children.

46
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,365
Who have they spoken to?

47
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:28,365
- You'd have them only speak to God.
- God be their witness.

48
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:31,685
There is God,
and there are the Peaky Blinders.

49
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:34,125
This is Sparkhill, we're in Small Heath.

50
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:37,045
We are much, much closer at hand than God.

51
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:39,965
And we have heard terrible things.

52
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:44,125
We have in this place
children of the worst sort.

53
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:45,965
They lie as easily as breathe.

54
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:50,285
You had a child half black,
you made her wash with a different soap.

55
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,765
Mr Shelby, your own sins are legend.

56
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:57,445
Our sins...

57
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:07,365
Our sins against the beating of children
with bricks and hoses.

58
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:08,885
Our sins.

59
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,885
Our sins...

60
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,165
...against a black child
who hanged herself

61
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,805
for fear of your temper.

62
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,845
- I do not see how...
- You do not see!

63
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,565
Now put 'em on.

64
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,125
Put 'em on your face,

65
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,285
or it'll be your eyes that are broken.

66
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,925
Please don't imagine
that I won't use this minute to do it,

67
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:52,645
or that I am afraid of your prayers
or your crosses.

68
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,645
You see the world broken.

69
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,405
Like those beaten children will.

70
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,245
Now look at me.

71
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:26,645
Look at me.

72
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:33,765
Look at me!

73
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,405
Funding withdrawn.

74
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:44,085
All children to be taken
into our own institutions.

75
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:46,645
You have no say in where the children...

76
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:48,165
If I come for you,

77
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:51,085
and I still might yet decide
to come for you,

78
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:54,605
I will wear high heels
so you can hear my approach

79
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:58,285
on the cobblestones,
and have time to repent.

80
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,245
You listen for my footsteps.

81
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:24,485
Happy birthday, Pol.

82
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:28,725
They grow grand in the horse shit, Pol.

83
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,525
Curly, pour some beer, eh?

84
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:38,205
The train to London leaves in an hour.

85
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:41,165
Arthur, Michael, you're coming with me.

86
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:44,365
Tommy, I have to take Gina
to the hospital today.

87
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:45,965
A week ago,

88
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:50,005
one of our most trusted men
was killed by Jimmy McCavern.

89
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,525
The man we're gonna speak to in London

90
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,685
is establishing a relationship
with Jimmy McCavern.

91
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:58,645
So cancel your appointments,
and Ada can take Gina to the hospital.

92
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,245
That's what women do.

93
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:05,005
And clean that shit off your shoes
before you get in my car, eh?

94
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:10,085
Michael, they will give it and give it
until your case is proven,

95
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,605
and then they'll take it.

96
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,085
From you, but mainly from me.

97
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:18,405
Polly, you go to the hospital
and speak to Aberama Gold.

98
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:23,045
You tell him there is a strategy in place
to avenge the death of his son,

99
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,525
so not to do anything rash.

100
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,605
And take with you
the heartfelt condolences

101
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:28,005
of the whole family.

102
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,445
Why me?

103
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:34,405
Because Aberama Gold is in love with you.
He even got a haircut.

104
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,645
And the smell of your perfume
might help ease his pain.

105
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:40,205
Tommy, I'm 45 years old today.

106
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,245
45 years old
and still breaking hearts, eh?

107
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:44,525
- Yeah!
- To Polly!

108
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,525
Polly Gray, hmm?

109
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:47,645
Polly.

110
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:49,405
Happy Birthday, Pol, yeah?

111
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:53,125
Curly, organise a wagon to take
Bonnie Gold's soul to heaven.

112
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:58,085
Isiah, fetch his boxing gloves
from the gym to burn with his body.

113
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:02,365
Michael, turn the Bentley around,
you've a train to catch.

114
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,485
And don't forget
to wipe that shit off your shoes, eh?

115
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,685
Just start up the car and drive.

116
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:35,125
So, what's the strategy?

117
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,485
You can smile.

118
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,125
You... don't smile.

119
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:45,725
Nice.

120
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,325
Very nice, Tom.

121
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,325
Hmm.

122
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:53,765
Although, I must say, I thought
your office would be bigger than this.

123
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:55,085
It will be.

124
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:56,845
Michael, you sit.

125
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,525
Arthur, you stand by the window.

126
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,965
So, who are we meeting?

127
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,245
The man we're about to meet

128
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:15,245
is the Minister
for the Duchy of Lancaster.

129
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:18,925
He's also deputy
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer

130
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:23,405
and Cabinet adviser
to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.

131
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,805
You've both met bad men before.

132
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:31,805
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

133
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,285
Yep.

134
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,885
Send him in.

135
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,165
I never seem to get to meet you
without your family.

136
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:22,125
I understand you know a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

137
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:28,885
May I take a cigarette?

138
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,445
Please.

139
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,965
Who on earth is Jimmy McCavern?

140
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:56,885
Over the last 12 months,

141
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:00,005
you've been making approaches
to various men across the country

142
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:05,245
who you think might be able
to help you in your cause.

143
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,365
McCavern is one of these men.

144
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:11,405
He runs the east Glasgow shipyards.
He killed an associate of mine.

145
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,285
I want to know what your strategy is.

146
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,445
That one's your brother, yes?

147
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:31,485
Yes, and I'm his business adviser.

148
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,885
We would like to talk business.

149
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:38,165
Michael.

150
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:40,485
Michael Gray.

151
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:45,365
You lost all your cousin's money
in America playing the fool.

152
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:52,165
A nightclub in Detroit
called the Gladiator was your regular.

153
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,485
You lost the money...

154
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,085
...and found a wife there.

155
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:04,125
And poor old Arthur Shelby standing
there at the window

156
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,685
is afraid his wife will never return.

157
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:12,085
My spies tell me
she's been seen with another man.

158
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:13,605
Arthur...

159
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,045
Arthur.

160
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,525
And bingo.

161
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:24,205
20 seconds in, and I have them
speaking their wog lingo.

162
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,245
Mr Shelby, I do have plans.

163
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:32,605
I <i>will</i> have need of men like you.

164
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:36,885
Except, of course,
there is no other man like you.

165
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,765
You, in particular, I need.

166
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,125
But, please,

167
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:47,525
don't imagine I would trouble myself
with turf wars.

168
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,005
You have many enemies.

169
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,965
Shuffle the pack and pick another card.

170
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:03,005
That investigation of the dead journalist,

171
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,405
the queer...

172
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:06,605
I've made that go away.

173
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:11,765
Read it and, uh, come back to me.

174
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:16,445
Next time, bring only an open mind
and a cigar to celebrate our union.

175
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:01,085
What the fuck was that all about, Tom?

176
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:03,165
Fuck.

177
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,605
Fuck.

178
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,445
Arthur!

179
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:15,565
Do <i>not</i> let them get inside your head.

180
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:19,085
That's exactly how these people work.

181
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:22,525
Who the fuck are these people, hmm?

182
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,205
Who the fuck are they?!

183
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,885
I've just been invited...

184
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:34,365
...to become the deputy leader
of a brand-new political party.

185
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,205
These people say they are the future.

186
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,725
Do you want a drink?

187
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:54,165
I've stopped.

188
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,325
So, what have you decided?

189
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,725
I've been talking to the Friends.

190
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:09,845
- What friends?
- Quakers.

191
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:12,845
Friends who meet at the meeting house
in Bournville.

192
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:14,685
I'm staying in Bournville.

193
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,805
And what do they say?

194
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:22,565
They say I've been led astray.

195
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:30,645
If you've come to talk about redemption,
you're talking to the wrong person.

196
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,485
I also went to a solicitor.

197
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,685
They heard my name was Shelby,
and suddenly they were too busy.

198
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:40,805
To divorce a Shelby man,
you have to go to a solicitor in London.

199
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:43,965
I found one.

200
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,525
He said he'd represent me.

201
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,965
But I put the phone down.

202
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,285
Not through fear.

203
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:54,485
I chose this life, it didn't choose me.

204
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:57,005
Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is a man.

205
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,045
He listens to me when I talk.

206
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,365
His wife died of the Spanish flu.

207
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:07,085
He has a daughter.

208
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:10,325
And you're considering making
this daughter an orphan?

209
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,005
Nothing has happened.

210
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,205
Nor will it.

211
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,725
He would die without his eyes.

212
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,405
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter

213
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:22,165
a place in one of his institutions
for orphaned girls.

214
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:24,245
Or even take her into the family.

215
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,885
And it would begin again.

216
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,765
What is the thing, Linda?

217
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:36,405
The thing you can't put aside?

218
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,245
It's not Arthur.

219
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,045
It's who I am when he's there.

220
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:48,885
God hears every filthy word in my head,

221
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:51,125
knows every dirty thing.

222
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:53,285
And your Friends don't use filthy words?

223
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:56,485
If I fall this time,
I'll fall all the way.

224
00:16:56,605 --> 00:17:00,405
Perhaps it's what you deserve,
with your filthy words.

225
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,445
I used to fuck seven men a day,

226
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,965
and now I'm learning
how to ride a horse side-saddle.

227
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:14,445
There's good and there's evil.

228
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:16,445
There's both mixed.

229
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,965
And that's Arthur and you... and me?

230
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:24,365
You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you take.

231
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,245
What about him?

232
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:34,965
He's making up his mind.

233
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,165
Someone called Polly Gray to see you.

234
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:55,005
Yes or no?

235
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,445
Yes.

236
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,965
I've come to take you to the clinic.

237
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:22,565
I already told Michael -
my husband or no-one.

238
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,405
I've got a car.

239
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:27,285
They have taxis,
even in this fucking city.

240
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:30,685
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat,
they're gonna give you options.

241
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,405
None of them are nice.

242
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,485
I had my check-up three days ago.

243
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:37,325
They heard a beating heart.

244
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:40,325
But if they had told me
that baby had died inside of me,

245
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:42,525
I would have wanted someone with me.

246
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,005
My husband may do as he's told,

247
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,205
but, er, I don't.

248
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:51,405
Look, if they hear a heartbeat,
you won't need anybody with you,

249
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:53,205
cos you'll have the baby with you.

250
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,045
So I will leave you alone.

251
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,605
But if you get in a taxi in this city
and they hear your accent,

252
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:00,725
they'll take you on a grand tour.

253
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,805
Come on.

254
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:14,005
- So, when will Mum be home?
- She said she had to go to Birmingham.

255
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,725
- Do you want me to cook you something?
- Cook?

256
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:18,445
You're a man.

257
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,965
This is really not fair.

258
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:28,365
Your mother never told me
you were this good.

259
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,685
I'm in a club. I'm the champion.

260
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,725
I beat people even older than you.

261
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:35,285
Even older than me?

262
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:42,365
At school, some of the children
say that black people and Jews are worse.

263
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,325
Worse than what?

264
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:46,485
Than anything.

265
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,325
And one teacher,

266
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:49,925
Mr Hudson,

267
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:52,565
he calls my friend a little Jew boy.

268
00:19:56,045 --> 00:20:00,605
Karl, these days,
there are some very stupid people

269
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,405
saying some very stupid things.

270
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:05,285
OK?

271
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:07,645
What do you think?

272
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,125
Checkmate.

273
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,765
I think I don't want you to be my dad.

274
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,845
Cos my dad's white... and he's in heaven.

275
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:48,445
I came to see you in hospital
to tell you there's a strategy in place,

276
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,085
not to break you out.

277
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:54,285
Don't worry,
my sister will look after me.

278
00:20:57,285 --> 00:20:59,205
You must stay here,

279
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,765
and you'll let Tommy deal
with the men who killed your son.

280
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:13,285
You're 45 today.

281
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,445
I'm probably a bit older than that.

282
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:21,085
Probably.

283
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,605
I've dealt death.

284
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:28,845
Now death has dealt with me.

285
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:34,485
I have one more killing to do
then I'll be done.

286
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:41,125
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.

287
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,085
Get a car and a driver.

288
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:43,245
Find out where the Fury family are camped.

289
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,645
I need their men to help me.

290
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:49,365
I'll need my hunting rifle, 50 bullets.

291
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:51,525
I'm going to Scotland.

292
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:52,725
Tonight.

293
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:11,565
I was expecting Ada.

294
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,765
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?

295
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:16,341
I was meant to meet her today,
but she said had to go to Birmingham.

296
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:17,805
Yes. Tommy sent her on a mission.

297
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,285
She's doing my job for me.

298
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,621
Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?

299
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:22,445
He went to buy an ice cream.

300
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:24,365
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.

301
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:27,405
- You knew I'd be here?
- Yeah, we knew you'd be here.

302
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:29,285
We have some business for you.

303
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:45,325
Any business I have with you, Mr Shelby,
is meant to be strictly confidential.

304
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:47,061
Ah, Michael.
You still have shit on your shoes.

305
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,045
My associate here can evidently smell it.

306
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:50,285
I don't mean any of fence.

307
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:52,885
Here, Michael, go and find Karl

308
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,445
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

309
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:56,885
The man doesn't trust you.

310
00:23:58,085 --> 00:23:59,925
Fuck you, Tom.

311
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,085
You know Gina phoned.

312
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:15,005
The baby's heart's beating strong.

313
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,965
And I swear to God, Tom,

314
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:20,965
by the time
that baby draws its first breath,

315
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,125
you and I will be done.

316
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,765
And you will be king.

317
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,125
Is that it, Michael?

318
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:34,805
You know, Tom,

319
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,765
there are doctors in London now

320
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:40,085
who can talk their way into your head,
dig out all the shit.

321
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:42,445
Perhaps, you should see one.

322
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:54,005
You're still not alone.

323
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:59,565
Me brother and I are the same person.

324
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:00,685
Here.

325
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:02,445
Here's a letter from Mosley.

326
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:04,605
You should read it.

327
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:19,725
What investigation is he talking about?

328
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:25,925
Two weeks ago,
a journalist was killed in Maida Vale.

329
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:29,085
The night before,
he'd come to me about some story

330
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:31,205
he was going to write about me.

331
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:32,925
We had nothing to do with that killing.

332
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,005
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

333
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,405
His constituency is Smethwick.

334
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:39,525
It borders my own.

335
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:41,165
He wants Birmingham as his stronghold.

336
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:44,645
He knows I've... strong support
among working people.

337
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:49,605
We help him out at rallies,
show up at some town hall meetings.

338
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:52,845
Right, and why are you showing
this letter to me?

339
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,365
A Minister of State

340
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:57,085
who may have seditious intentions.

341
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,205
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

342
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,885
You work in intelligence, Younger.

343
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,205
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

344
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:06,485
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.

345
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:10,725
My brief is specifically
to gather information

346
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,765
on the activities of communists.

347
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,565
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

348
00:26:18,685 --> 00:26:21,405
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

349
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:26,365
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

350
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:30,685
They share membership of various clubs
in London and Birmingham.

351
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,045
I have specific orders.

352
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:33,485
I am a soldier.

353
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:36,405
You think you can join this family?

354
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:40,565
I have no intention of joining a family.

355
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:44,285
Well, thank fuck for that,
cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.

356
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:47,085
Thought you said this was about business.

357
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,005
Yes - family business
and government business,

358
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,485
all in one envelope.

359
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:57,485
Younger, listen to me.

360
00:26:57,605 --> 00:26:59,245
Forget about Ada.

361
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,965
Forget about weddings.

362
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,805
You know what Mosley represents.

363
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:06,965
You know his philosophy.

364
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:12,405
I am planning to reply to him
and tell him that I'm making up my mind.

365
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,885
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

366
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:18,845
I could fight him on my own, if I have to,

367
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:22,165
or I could join his organisation

368
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:26,165
and undermine him on behalf of the King.

369
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:28,725
But you need to make a decision.

370
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,925
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

371
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:16,605
On your fucking feet.

372
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,205
Hello, Tom.

373
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,005
I thought you were staying over in London.

374
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:28,325
Hello, Johnny.

375
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:31,245
How are you, eh?

376
00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:33,765
How are your ribs?

377
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:35,765
You managing?

378
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:37,645
- Just about Tom, yeah.
- Yeah? Good.

379
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:39,805
And who's that?

380
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:44,805
Is it Maisie, or is it Clara?

381
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:49,125
Ah! Sandra.

382
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,045
Well, may I say,

383
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:55,805
your breakfasts are a great improvement.

384
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:58,965
Mr Shelby, I'm sorry.

385
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,485
Don't worry, Sandra.

386
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:03,365
The only way to get fired
from this household

387
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:05,805
is through burnt toast...

388
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:07,685
...or talking to the police.

389
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:09,005
Go on, go to bed.

390
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:12,005
And Sandra...

391
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:16,925
...everything Johnny said is lies.

392
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,125
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...

393
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:26,445
While you was gone, I got a message, Tom.

394
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:30,245
A cousin of Aberama Gold
galloped from Meriden.

395
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:33,325
He said Aberama wants you to know
that he's gone to Scotland

396
00:29:33,445 --> 00:29:35,485
to deal with his business himself,

397
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,245
and that you'd know what that meant.

398
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:41,005
Fuck!

399
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:46,005
The boy said Aberama arrived
from the hospital in Polly's Bentley.

400
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:50,045
She fucking helped him.

401
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:53,365
She fucking helped him.

402
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:57,725
But it can't be love, cos it's Polly.

403
00:29:57,845 --> 00:29:59,445
Cos it's fucking Polly.

404
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,565
All right, Johnny,
I have a job for you.

405
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:04,925
Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.

406
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,605
I need you to go and find Aberama Gold.

407
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:10,565
He has kin on the Lothian border,
the Fury family.

408
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:11,965
Ah, for fuck's sake, Tom!

409
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:15,365
The Furys, they don't even use words
to fucking talk.

410
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:17,325
Just hand gestures and fucking howls.

411
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:19,445
You will go to them
and you will find him.

412
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:21,285
Tom, I am in fucking pain here.

413
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,365
- Yeah, you appear to be managing.
- I said I was <i>just</i> managing.

414
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:26,925
Well, you can just manage
to sit in a car with Arthur

415
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:29,485
and follow the patrin
to find the Fury family.

416
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:32,645
Arthur will take care of everything
that requires bones and muscles.

417
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:35,565
I warned you, Tom.
The Golds'll be the death of one of us.

418
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,125
And it looks like it's gonna be
fucking me!

419
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:44,245
Well, go on, open it.

420
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:49,965
So...

421
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,725
...you heard the baby's heartbeat today.

422
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:57,085
Beats so fast.

423
00:30:57,205 --> 00:31:00,565
Would have been a birthday gift enough.

424
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:02,405
A new life.

425
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,445
Liberty.

426
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:11,965
Freedom.

427
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:19,285
Feels like a weapon.

428
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:21,965
I only came because Michael's
driving back from London

429
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:24,205
and he said he didn't want you
to be on your own.

430
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:29,445
So...

431
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:34,005
Whose idea was the gift of freedom?

432
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,285
Mine.

433
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:40,605
You want to take Michael
and the baby to New York?

434
00:31:40,725 --> 00:31:41,965
Yes.

435
00:31:43,005 --> 00:31:44,725
The baby will have two grandmothers.

436
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:45,885
The other one lives...

437
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,445
The other one lives amongst human beings.

438
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:51,365
The other one <i>is</i> a human being.

439
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:56,405
It's all right, I'm not drunk.

440
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,485
I'm just free.

441
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:00,085
So, what do you want?

442
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,725
My approval?

443
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,045
Your help.

444
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:12,365
Michael wants you to come with us.

445
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:15,245
We can all live in Long Island,
right on the beach.

446
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,245
Isn't Long Island in Australia?

447
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:23,245
Or is it in California,
amongst the Indians?

448
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:25,845
It's in New York, Polly.

449
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:30,165
You see, we all try and get away.

450
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,885
But we never do.

451
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:49,205
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

452
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,965
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

453
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:01,165
I'm an American.

454
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:04,725
We don't just go round
and round and round.

455
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:05,965
We go in a straight line.

456
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:11,565
And my baby... will be born in New York.

457
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:26,365
I'm not happy about moving this meeting
to licensed premises.

458
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:33,365
You've saved your union the train fare,
and you hate London anyway.

459
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:36,725
We're looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

460
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:39,925
You're making quite a name for yourself
in the Commons.

461
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:41,645
Betty!

462
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:43,245
What are you drinking?

463
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:44,525
Water.

464
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:46,565
Bottle of Champagne, Betty.

465
00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:48,725
You'll drink it on your own.

466
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:49,965
That's the idea.

467
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:51,885
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

468
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,685
Revolution.

469
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:24,525
So, how is life as a socialist?

470
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:27,565
This glass.

471
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:30,125
The bubbles.

472
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:33,845
They rise to the top.

473
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:38,325
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.

474
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:41,325
That is a very peculiar form of socialism.

475
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:42,485
And this bottle.

476
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:46,405
Once the cork comes out...

477
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,645
...you can't get it back in.

478
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:52,645
You need to finish what you started.

479
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,565
It's cleverness, that's all.

480
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:01,245
So you're playing at this.

481
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,525
People can be turned around.

482
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,325
Even your people.

483
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,805
- <i>My</i> people?
- Yeah.

484
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:10,965
For them, it's just the same.

485
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:13,925
Communism. Fascism.

486
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,045
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

487
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:19,205
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

488
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,045
I want you to speak against it.

489
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:23,925
In answer to your question...

490
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,045
...I cannot address your rally...

491
00:35:28,485 --> 00:35:30,805
...because it's not part
of the current strategy.

492
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:35,965
Are you OK, Thomas?

493
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:38,965
Do you want a man to carry you home?

494
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:43,925
I knew we should not have had this meeting
on licensed premises.

495
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:00,925
Happy or sad, Thomas?

496
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:15,885
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

497
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,085
I didn't expect you home.

498
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:39,325
Frances said Linda was here today.

499
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:42,925
Frances has a very specific loyalty,
doesn't she?

500
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:48,005
Well, people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

501
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:54,045
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

502
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:56,205
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.

503
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:59,405
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?

504
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,885
He said he'd represent me.

505
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:09,885
But I put the phone down.

506
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:13,645
There and then, I made a decision.

507
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:19,765
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.

508
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,085
You said, in your head,
you still pay for it.

509
00:37:28,805 --> 00:37:31,045
So I've decided to continue
to take the payment

510
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,885
and balance my heart against my head,

511
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:35,245
as though it were a book of accounts.

512
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:39,125
- I value my head a shilling more.
- Huh!

513
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:47,725
When was the last time
you had to worry about shillings, eh?

514
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:52,565
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

515
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:54,525
That's why I'll be loyal to you.

516
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,405
But this is the deal.

517
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:02,725
You don't fuck anybody else in my house,

518
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,885
nor within a day
of holding our child by the hand.

519
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:06,565
A day on either side.

520
00:38:08,645 --> 00:38:11,685
And you let me in sometimes.

521
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:12,925
Into your head.

522
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,045
To clear it out.

523
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,405
That what needs clearing out.

524
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,005
Agreed.

525
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,445
And this...

526
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:31,605
Always.

527
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,765
The deal is...

528
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:37,125
...you belong to me.

529
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:39,685
My property.

530
00:38:41,325 --> 00:38:43,245
No-one touches my property.

531
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,165
I touch myself, but it's still you anyway.

532
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,805
So that's why I put the phone down.

533
00:38:58,245 --> 00:38:59,685
No, Tom.

534
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,885
We do it in the bed at least.

535
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:19,565
Everything is mine, Lizzie.

536
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:23,085
Everything.

537
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:55,965
Arthur.

538
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:58,645
<i>- Hmm?</i>
- Frances was right.

539
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,325
Linda was here today.

540
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,125
Fuck.

541
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:04,085
What did she say, huh?

542
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:07,725
- I just want to talk to her, that's all.
<i>- Arthur, listen.</i>

543
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,165
<i>First, I need you to go to Scotland</i>

544
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,965
<i>and bring back Aberama Gold.</i>

545
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:13,525
<i>Then we'll go and we'll find Linda.</i>

546
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,925
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

547
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:17,525
<i>I'll keep calling you, Tom.</i>

548
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:21,085
You know I will.

549
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:24,285
I'll call this number back...

550
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:28,525
...again, again and again.

551
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:30,805
If you don't answer,

552
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:32,245
I'll jump in my fucking car

553
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:35,605
and I'll drive to your house,
you know I will.

554
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:39,005
I'll stay there all night if I have to.

555
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:40,725
<i>I won't go nowhere -</i>

556
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:42,485
<i>not Scotland -</i>

557
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:45,205
<i>till you tell me what it is you know.</i>

558
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:57,405
Right, listen to me.

559
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,205
I don't have an address.

560
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:02,845
But she's with the Quakers in Bournville.

561
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:07,245
<i>Apparently,
there is someone who is a Friend.</i>

562
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:13,005
He had a wife who died
from Spanish flu in 1918.

563
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,645
And he has a daughter.

564
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,605
<i>That should be enough to find him.</i>

565
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,285
<i>Arthur...</i>

566
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:21,645
Just talk to him
and get a message to Linda.

567
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:25,365
Nothing happened, Arthur.

568
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,365
He's a Quaker, a Friend.

569
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,045
They're not like us, they talk.

570
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:31,565
Oh, I'll speak to him.

571
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:35,365
Man to man.

572
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:36,645
<i>And then, after that...</i>

573
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,605
<i>...I'll go up north, hmm.</i>

574
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:41,325
Deal with our business.

575
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,405
I promise you.

576
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:45,605
<i>Arthur. Arthur, listen to me...</i>

577
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:03,965
Who were you talking to?

578
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:07,285
I have to ask you,
cos Maggie at the exchange won't tell me.

579
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:09,485
Who was it?

580
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:10,805
Was it Arthur?

581
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:14,645
I need my brother in one piece.

582
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,005
Arthur makes his own decisions.

583
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,245
You marry a Shelby,

584
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:23,245
you stay fucking married.

585
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:26,285
Fuck.

586
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:34,085
Well, look at this, hmm.

587
00:42:34,205 --> 00:42:35,565
Can I help you?

588
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,965
Yeah, I think you can.

589
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:40,885
I'm looking for Linda Shelby.

590
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,165
Do you know her?

591
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:46,045
Eh? I'm Arthur.

592
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:48,445
Her husband.

593
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:52,685
If you're her husband,
she doesn't want to talk to you.

594
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:55,045
Well, look at you.

595
00:42:57,405 --> 00:42:59,365
Ain't you smart?

596
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:00,485
Eh?

597
00:43:00,525 --> 00:43:03,485
What, you got all the fucking answers,
have you?

598
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:06,165
Well, let's try you with another one. Eh?

599
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:07,501
Let's try you with another one.

600
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:08,685
How about...

601
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:13,725
How about we search
for the fucking truth within, hmm?

602
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,885
Let's have a look, eh? Let's have a look.

603
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:17,605
See what we've got inside here, eh?

604
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,765
You fucking bastard!

605
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:29,165
Eh? You wanna keep looking, eh?

606
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:15,045
Hey,

607
00:44:15,165 --> 00:44:18,005
I wanna ask you again.

608
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,405
Eh? Eh?

609
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,645
I'll ask you again.

610
00:44:24,925 --> 00:44:27,765
Where is she? Eh?

611
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:29,525
Where is she?

612
00:44:34,045 --> 00:44:36,485
- Eh? Eh?
- No. No, no, no...

613
00:45:06,485 --> 00:45:08,005
I'm a good man.

614
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:12,525
I'm a fucking good man, like you.

615
00:45:17,605 --> 00:45:19,045
A God-fearing man.

616
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,525
There is good in my heart.

617
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:26,085
There is good in my heart!

618
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:34,685
But my hands...

619
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:37,205
These hands belong to the devil.

620
00:45:39,045 --> 00:45:40,965
The fucking devil!

621
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:53,005
Wait... Who are you?

622
00:46:13,885 --> 00:46:14,965
Did she come back?

623
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:17,645
No.

624
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:22,485
Is she in Scotland?
Is that why you're going?

625
00:46:22,605 --> 00:46:24,885
No, she's not in fucking Scotland,
Charlie.

626
00:46:27,845 --> 00:46:28,965
Whiskey.

627
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:30,285
We want whiskey.

628
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:31,405
Maps.

629
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:32,805
Cigars.

630
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:34,405
Load the van, we want it all.

631
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:35,765
Who's we?

632
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:37,285
Me and Johnny Dogs.

633
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:39,245
Ah.

634
00:46:39,365 --> 00:46:41,925
So it's you and Johnny Dogs
against Scotland?

635
00:46:45,245 --> 00:46:47,125
You know, at the BSA,
our friends could get you

636
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:50,805
some of them new artillery cannons
that fire ten shells a second.

637
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:53,925
You can mount one
on the roof of your fucking car.

638
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:55,685
Petrol.

639
00:46:55,805 --> 00:46:56,805
We need petrol.

640
00:46:56,885 --> 00:47:00,125
It's so far up north,
they run out of the bloody stuff.

641
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:02,485
Yeah.

642
00:47:02,605 --> 00:47:05,845
Still riding round on fucking chariots,
they are.

643
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:12,645
Curly, Arthur is going to Scotland,
so he needs hand grenades.

644
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:13,845
How many?

645
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:15,885
Fuck's sake, it's like it's normal.

646
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:18,805
Our friends at the BSA
still have lots left from the war,

647
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:20,845
but we can't give them...

648
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:23,605
Get me some hand grenades, Curly, eh?
Hmm?

649
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:26,645
You find 'em back there, eh?
Good boy, yeah?

650
00:47:26,765 --> 00:47:29,085
You get me some.
Put them on my account.

651
00:47:29,205 --> 00:47:30,485
Yeah.

652
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:34,325
How many?

653
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:36,565
- Three, Curly.
- Three. Three.

654
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:45,085
Find a way of getting her back, Arthur.

655
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,245
Without her,
you're as good as dead already.

656
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:18,005
That's them, the Billy Boys!

657
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:40,245
Gentlemen.

658
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:45,165
You have just crossed the border
into the County of East Tollcross.

659
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:49,925
Now, according
to the unwritten constitution

660
00:48:50,045 --> 00:48:51,685
of Tollcross County,

661
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:57,125
Gypsies, Catholics
and other criminally minded individuals

662
00:48:57,245 --> 00:49:00,645
are not allowed to work the roads
of our Protestant district

663
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:03,205
on account of the poor quality
of their labour.

664
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:07,165
So, my own boys
will be taking over from here.

665
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:10,565
We will be needing your tools,

666
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:13,565
your tar, your burner...

667
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:16,605
...and your transportation.

668
00:49:16,725 --> 00:49:18,085
You're Gypsies,

669
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,725
you can easily steal another.

670
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:24,045
I have the keys to the truck.

671
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:52,245
Ah!

672
00:50:16,285 --> 00:50:17,765
Now...

673
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:23,365
...I want you boys to take a message back
to Jimmy McCavern.

674
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:25,125
You killed my son.

675
00:50:25,245 --> 00:50:26,885
You hoisted him on a cross!

676
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:32,045
Now, in this gun...

677
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:35,525
...there's a bullet

678
00:50:35,645 --> 00:50:39,205
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

679
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:46,245
And when the time comes
for his crucifixion,

680
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:50,885
it will be me who drives in the nails.

681
00:51:34,285 --> 00:51:36,165
Mr Shelby!

682
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:38,245
At last you are alone.

683
00:51:40,645 --> 00:51:42,405
I think we'll make quite the team.

684
00:51:44,525 --> 00:51:46,605
The pheasants won't know what hit them.

685
00:51:51,685 --> 00:51:53,485
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.

686
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,525
You were in the yeomanry, yes?

687
00:51:57,805 --> 00:51:59,525
Were you cavalry?

688
00:51:59,645 --> 00:52:02,445
You won the Distinguished Service Medal.

689
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:03,605
That'll help.

690
00:52:04,885 --> 00:52:05,885
With what?

691
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:09,765
Two months ago, I was in Rome.

692
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:11,205
I met Mr Mussolini.

693
00:52:12,325 --> 00:52:14,005
You and I and men like him...

694
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:18,045
...we will shape the future.

695
00:52:20,485 --> 00:52:22,405
When will you resign
from the Labour Party?

696
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:28,045
The day before I announce
the formation of my new party.

697
00:52:30,965 --> 00:52:35,885
The British Union of Fascists will be born
on January 1st of next year.

698
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:38,485
The first day of a new decade.

699
00:52:41,085 --> 00:52:44,285
The 1930s, Mr Shelby, will belong to us.

700
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,565
Did you bring that cigar?

701
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,165
Before we smoke...

702
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,765
...I have some conditions.

703
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,525
It really isn't going to be
that kind of relationship.

704
00:53:04,645 --> 00:53:07,125
Just smoke like the fine man
you will become.

705
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:24,885
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.

706
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:27,925
I have an allocated confidential line -
code 78.

707
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:32,285
It's me.

708
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:34,285
I've agreed to work with our friend.

709
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:38,045
He's gonna announce on January 1st.

710
00:53:38,165 --> 00:53:41,165
I need to know that my position
as informant against him

711
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:42,525
is officially sanctioned.

712
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:52,605
Today, gentlemen,

713
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:56,285
we are avenging an unprovoked attack

714
00:53:56,405 --> 00:53:58,725
on members of our organisation

715
00:53:58,845 --> 00:54:02,805
who were simply carrying out
a routine border patrol.

716
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:05,245
Our enemies are Gypsies,

717
00:54:05,365 --> 00:54:10,085
members of a race destined
for natural eradication anyway,

718
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,405
due to what the scientists call selection.

719
00:54:14,845 --> 00:54:18,965
And since these beggars
are unchristened and unregistered,

720
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:21,445
the local constabulary
will as soon drop them

721
00:54:21,565 --> 00:54:25,445
in a communal grave
as find a name for a gravestone.

722
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:32,165
So proceed in any manner you choose
to find the fugitive we seek.

723
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:42,365
Morning, Mr Gold.

724
00:54:42,485 --> 00:54:44,285
Yeah.

725
00:54:44,405 --> 00:54:46,325
The Billy Boys are coming for you.

726
00:54:46,445 --> 00:54:48,085
How the fuck did you find me?

727
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:52,085
- How the fuck did they find me?
- I kind of let it slip.

728
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,205
Give you no choice, eh?

729
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,485
What, hmm? What?

730
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:07,325
And a Bentley outside, the engine running.

731
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:09,805
Fastest engine in the world,
apparently, which is good.

732
00:55:09,925 --> 00:55:12,765
We've got two minutes to get out of here.

733
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:35,325
We are officers of
the East Lanarkshire Special Constabulary.

734
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:38,925
We are seeking a man
by the name of Aberama Gold.

735
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:44,765
Hand the gentleman over,
and no-one else will be harmed.

736
00:56:18,205 --> 00:56:20,805
Fuck! Take cover!

737
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:53,005
So, Tommy Shelby...

738
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:56,365
...it's war you want...

739
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:01,125
...it's war you shall have.
