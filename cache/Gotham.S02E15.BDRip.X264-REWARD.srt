1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,091
- Is it loaded?
- Ain't no point in an unloaded gun.

3
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:07,759
It's Kristen Kringle's final paychecks.

4
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,427
She never picked them up. I don't like it.

5
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:11,137
<i>Oswald,
you are making progress.</i>

6
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:16,518
By the laws of Gotham City,
he is hereby declared sane.

7
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:17,936
<i>You are a free man.</i>

8
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:20,939
I was wondering if you'd heard
from Kristen Kringle lately.

9
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,401
Do you think
that something bad has happened?

10
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,321
<i>- We have no idea when she might wake up.</i>
- Bitch.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,240
<i>So, that's the game is it, Jimbo?</i>

12
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:31,825
<i>Gonna try to outsmart me?</i>

13
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,034
<i>I don't think so.</i>

14
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,285
We've met before?

15
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,996
Yes. You killed my parents.
Who hired you?

16
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,415
You'll never know their name.

17
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,417
I'm a monster. You need to kill me.

18
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,211
- You're just a man.
- Bruce.

19
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:44,671
He's in there.

20
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,135
<i>Alfred,
I have left home for a while</i>

21
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,803
<i>to live on the streets with Selina.</i>

22
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,847
<i>Trust me, and honor my wishes.</i>

23
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,515
<i>Don't try to bring me back.</i>

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,647
<i>Welcome to the Gotham Museum of Art.</i>

25
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,691
<i>The museum offers hundreds of new events</i>

26
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:07,819
<i>and programs each month,
including lectures,</i>

27
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,906
<i>performances, tours,
family activities and more.</i>

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,994
<i>The Gotham Museum cafe and gift shop
is located on the fourth floor...</i>

29
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,626
Keep moving!

30
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,014
Stop!

31
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,411
Solo robber hit the museum
about an hour ago.

32
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,997
Scared people away
with a bomb that never went off.

33
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,582
- Anybody hurt?
<i>- Nope.</i>

34
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,043
Why us, then?
Isn't it a Robbery Squad case?

35
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:50,588
Bomb threats are you guys,
whether the bomb goes off or not.

36
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:51,756
<i>So, get on it.</i>

37
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,259
Gordon, you stay.

38
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:04,978
Internal Affairs is reopening the file
on Galavan's murder.

39
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,189
Why?

40
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:11,276
Anonymous tip.

41
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,987
Someone called in, claims they saw you,

42
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,991
not Penguin, kill Galavan
that night at the docks.

43
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,410
IA gets a dozen crank calls a week.

44
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,203
They're probably just bored.

45
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,789
This tip came with a detail
we didn't put out to the public.

46
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,584
The umbrella.

47
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,796
So someone in the GCPD
is trying to make trouble for me.

48
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,298
By spreading lies.

49
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:34,674
Been known to happen.

50
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,884
Lies, huh?

51
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,677
Tell me the truth again.

52
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,555
I didn't kill Galavan.

53
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:41,806
I wasn't there.

54
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,768
What was that all about?

55
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,061
Later.

56
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,647
- Detective Gordon.
- Hey, Ed.

57
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:50,857
I'm ready for our sit-down.

58
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,108
Our what?

59
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,318
You wanted to interview me

60
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,153
about Ms. Kringle leaving town
with Officer Dougherty?

61
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,822
Oh, right. Yeah, sorry. Rain check.

62
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,490
We got to get to Gotham Museum.

63
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,034
Oh, the art heist.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,368
Yes, I heard about this.

65
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,745
Very bold.

66
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,914
Uh, yes, rain check.

67
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,292
Tally-ho, chaps. Go get that bad guy.

68
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,420
We'll talk later this afternoon.
And Ed?

69
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,506
Don't worry. I'll find out
what happened to Ms. Kringle.

70
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,676
I have the utmost faith in your abilities,
Detective Gordon.

71
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,137
Believe me.

72
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,108
Boss?

73
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,110
You'll never guess
who just knocked on the door.

74
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,571
If I'll never guess,
then why not just tell me, jackass?

75
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,824
If you say I have three guesses,
well, then that's a game.

76
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,535
It's an annoying and stupid game,
but at least it makes sense.

77
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,828
Son of a...

78
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:48,623
Hi.

79
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,044
Well, well, well.

80
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,671
I heard they let you out of Arkham.

81
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,880
Yes.

82
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,216
Happy day.

83
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,009
I'm sane.

84
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,970
I have a certificate.

85
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,638
Whoa.

86
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,724
Uh...

87
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,227
<i>But... But I... I hope I'm not intruding.</i>

88
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,354
I just got back in town,

89
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,066
and thought it'd be rude
not to say hello to an old friend.

90
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,194
An old friend?

91
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,404
<i>Well, yes.</i>

92
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,239
I mean, we had our ups and downs,

93
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:24,158
but on the whole,
I thought we were friends.

94
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,077
<i>Weren't we?</i>

95
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,371
That's what I recall, anyhow.

96
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,790
Cupcake?

97
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,670
You killed my brother.

98
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,632
You messed with his mind
and made him your slave.

99
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,800
Hello?

100
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:42,885
I guess I was pretty terrible, huh?

101
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:45,138
I want to apologize sincerely.

102
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,724
I wasn't thinking straight.

103
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,350
Apology accepted.

104
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:51,102
Let's kill him.

105
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,271
Wait. What?

106
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,606
Uh, Butch, listen, I've changed.

107
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,567
You have no reason to fear me. I'm...

108
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,194
I'm a good person now.

109
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,118
I was thinking about
visiting your mother's grave.

110
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,578
- Oh?
- Mmm.

111
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,246
Miss the old bird.

112
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:14,250
Her sobs would often lull me
to sleep at night.

113
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,918
"Oswald!

114
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,628
"Oswald!

115
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,630
"Save me."

116
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,845
That does sound like her.

117
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,514
<i>You know, I think he's for real.</i>

118
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,225
Those loony bin doctors
must have done a real number on him.

119
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,477
It's actually kind of sad.

120
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:34,479
Let him go.

121
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,315
What?

122
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,859
You heard me.

123
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,070
Look at him, he's a pathetic loser.

124
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,529
<i>He doesn't pose a threat to anyone.</i>

125
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,406
Are you serious?

126
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,075
No way! He has to die.

127
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:49,660
Who's the boss here?

128
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,373
I believe in an eye for an eye.
We've all lost something, including him.

129
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,132
We're square, you and me.

130
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,551
- Understand?
- Completely.

131
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,056
Mmm.

132
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,146
Fine. You know,
I didn't realize you were so sentimental.

133
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:20,608
He's not leaving
without some kind of punishment.

134
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,612
- He's not.
<i>- Okay.</i>

135
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,447
What'd you have in mind?

136
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,592
Your little private,
inside voice is screaming.

137
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,428
Want to tell me what that pow-wow
with Barnes was all about?

138
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:55,810
IA is re-opening the investigation
into the murder of Theo Galavan.

139
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,688
Anonymous person called in,

140
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,731
saying they saw me kill him.

141
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,570
That old chestnut, huh?

142
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,197
Is there something I can do?

143
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,408
You still friendly
with your gal over in IA?

144
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:11,909
Ginny?

145
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,453
Our paths have been known to cross.

146
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,497
Can they cross again soon?

147
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,749
I need to know what they have.

148
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,295
Sure.

149
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:30,720
Mr. Thatch?

150
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,388
Detective Gordon.

151
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:33,681
This is Detective Bullock.

152
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,766
What can you tell us
about the painting that was stolen?

153
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,019
Uh, the painting
is entitled <i>Mad Grey Dawn,</i>

154
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:41,355
and it depicted a railway explosion
at the turn of the century.

155
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,275
A minor work
compared to much of the collection.

156
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,862
Strangely, he simply defaced
two much more valuable paintings

157
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,031
in another section of the gallery.

158
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:52,033
A Marché and a Larue.

159
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,743
Follow me.

160
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,622
<i>Priceless.</i>

161
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:02,418
What kind of art thief would take time
to defile such masterpieces?

162
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,545
- An ignorant one?
- No.

163
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,963
<i>This took a lot of time and effort.</i>

164
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,381
He knows what he's doing.

165
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,967
He's not interested in profit.
He's trying to send a message.

166
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,135
Which is what?

167
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,012
No idea.

168
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,972
What about the painters themselves?

169
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,224
What about them?

170
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,893
<i>Question marks are directly over
their signatures on the canvas.</i>

171
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,564
There's entire books written
on each of them.

172
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,149
- I'm sorry, I--
<i>- He would want to keep it simple.</i>

173
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,984
What about their names?

174
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,696
"Marché" means "market"
and "Larue" is "the road," yes?

175
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,948
Yes.

176
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,115
Or "the street."

177
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:34,951
Market Street.

178
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:40,498
The painting he stole
depicted a railway explosion? Yes?

179
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,833
Yes. A bombing actually.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,710
It was known as Bloody Monday.

181
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,003
Today is Monday.

182
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,048
And Union Railway Station
is on Market Street.

183
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:16,158
<i>Attention, please evacuate
the train station in an orderly fashion.</i>

184
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,121
<i>Please find your nearest exit
and evacuate the train station.</i>

185
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:21,706
<i>Thank you.</i>

186
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,582
- What are we looking for?
- I have no idea.

187
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,626
<i>Get these people out of here. Go, go!</i>

188
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,129
<i>- Get outta here! Go!</i>
- Move! Move!

189
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,722
Come on.

190
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,475
Bullock.

191
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:57,575
Listen up!
The device is inside the lockers.

192
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,286
Pinkney, get these people out of here.
Get them out of here.

193
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:01,662
<i>Outside, now!</i>

194
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,248
Get them out of here! Go!

195
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,471
How much time
till the bomb squad gets here?

196
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,931
Too long. Get back.

197
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,142
Okay, get back. Back, back, back.
Go, go, go!

198
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,518
Go, go, go, go.

199
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,196
- Hey, Ivy.
- Hey, Cat.

200
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,573
Hey, Billionaire Boy.

201
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,325
What is he doing here?

202
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,412
Shh. They're right upstairs.

203
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,039
He's staying with me for a while.

204
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,207
Don't touch anything.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,544
What is this place?

206
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,672
Ivy works for a gang
that runs the magic mushroom trade.

207
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,008
What's a magic mushroom?

208
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,594
Some give you visions.
Some give you energy.

209
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,096
Some help you to sleep.

210
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,056
I've cultivated over a dozen kinds.

211
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,183
What are we doing here?

212
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,396
The gang is run
by Gilzean's nephew, Sonny,

213
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,107
and his merry band of losers.

214
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,069
So, these mushrooms are illegal?

215
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,406
Yes, very illegal.

216
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,032
Which means there's always
a ton of cash around.

217
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,367
You're going to rob them?

218
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,536
Uh...

219
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,954
Yeah.

220
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,710
Okay.

221
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:14,753
How do we do it?

222
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,591
We don't.

223
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,676
You have money, remember?

224
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,886
A lot of it.

225
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,095
<i>Selina, I told you.</i>

226
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,430
I want to survive on my own,

227
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,265
find out who I am without my money.

228
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:27,892
Without being Bruce Wayne.

229
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:32,229
Besides, I don't mind stealing
if it's from criminals.

230
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,566
What's the plan?

231
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,574
Meet Psilocybe Arkrescens.

232
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,826
<i>Also known as the blue devil.</i>

233
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,329
She slipped a few of them
in the gang's lunch today,

234
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,289
so all we have to do now is wait.

235
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,124
- What will they do?
- Instant death.

236
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,127
Kidding.

237
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,087
They'll be in a state of relaxed bliss.

238
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,464
Like a dream.

239
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,090
Trust me, it's great.

240
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,761
How long until they're out?

241
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,435
From art thief to mad bomber
in the same day?

242
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:12,770
What the hell is next?

243
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,564
I don't know. But he wanted us to find it.

244
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,274
I think that's what the heist was about.

245
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,692
He's playing a game.

246
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,278
Great.

247
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,656
That's exactly what this city needs.

248
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,245
Did you find any other brainteasers

249
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,164
that might indicate his next piece
of performance art?

250
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:36,460
No. Either he's decided to keep it
a surprise or he's taking a break.

251
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,462
I doubt we're that lucky.

252
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,632
I want every available resource
on this thing.

253
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,050
You got it.

254
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,137
Excuse me.

255
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,890
Officer Pinkney, can I get your signature
on this chain of custody form?

256
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,141
Sure.

257
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:54,186
- Thank you.
- Pinkney.

258
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,481
Detective Gordon.

259
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,900
We've been working together
for over a year, Ed.

260
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,652
You can call me Jim.

261
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,988
Jim. Heard you were able to save the day.

262
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,573
I got lucky.

263
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,991
I don't believe in luck.

264
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,159
You saw a problem
and you solved it. Bravo.

265
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,621
Hey, I want you
to oversee forensics on this one.

266
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:13,831
Maybe our luck will hold

267
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,917
and we'll get something
on the bomb signature or trace elements.

268
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,127
No other leads yet?

269
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,171
No. I have no idea
what this guy wants

270
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,716
or what he's after,
which makes him dangerous.

271
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,427
Oh, don't you worry. I'm on the case.

272
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:27,761
Right.

273
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:39,815
Shh.

274
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,026
Be quiet.

275
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,527
Someone might still be awake.

276
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,314
Who... Who are you?

277
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,316
Hey! Hey, hey.

278
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:24,860
We're no one.

279
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,573
You're dreaming. Pretty cool, right?

280
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,824
Totally.

281
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,369
Yeah.

282
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,706
Listen, if you give us the coffee can
and close your eyes,

283
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,083
you'll be able to fly.

284
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,920
Sweet.

285
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,224
Run.

286
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,813
Whoa! Where you going?

287
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,943
Hey, Cat.

288
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:08,987
Hey, Sonny.

289
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,741
You lose weight?

290
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,327
Keep cracking wise, Selina.

291
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,955
You ain't gonna be smiling
when my uncle gets to you.

292
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,625
Let's see how many lives
you really have left.

293
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,519
- Hi.
<i>- Penguin?</i>

294
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,521
<i>- Hi. Hi.</i>
- Hi.

295
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,231
Sorry to intrude.

296
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,359
Bit of a mess.

297
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,362
I was just passing by and...

298
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,323
May I...

299
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,075
Could I come in for a moment?

300
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,994
These feathers aren't as warm
as they look.

301
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,539
Of course. Where are my manners?
Uh, it's... It's so good to see you.

302
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,169
So, how have you been, old friend?
Well, I hope.

303
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,545
Yeah, well.

304
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,714
I have been. Been busy.
I've been really busy.

305
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,049
And what about you?
I hear that you've been released.

306
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,843
What... What just... What happened?

307
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,137
Oh, oh.

308
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,515
Well, just good old Butch
and Tabitha having fun.

309
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,225
They talked about killing me,

310
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,645
so this was actually pretty nice
of them, considering.

311
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,439
Pretty nice of them?

312
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,858
They did a pretty good job
on you in Arkham, huh?

313
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,112
I'm here to tell you, Ed, as a friend,

314
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,656
violence and anger are not the answer.

315
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,325
I am a changed man.

316
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,869
Better, and you can change, too.

317
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,121
Cool.

318
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,373
Tempting offer.

319
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,709
The thing is,

320
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,837
the me I am right now
is kind of hitting my stride.

321
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,297
Oh.

322
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,257
And I'm really grateful
for all that you've taught me,

323
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:56,220
and that bad stuff you told me
about Jim Gordon is really paying off.

324
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,722
- Is it?
<i>- It is.</i>

325
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,307
It's helped me to create
the perfect puzzle

326
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,892
to get rid of my Jim Gordon dilemma.

327
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,685
<i>Normally, I would love to share,</i>

328
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,063
but to be honest,
the new you is kind of freaking me out.

329
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,194
I'm just really busy right now.

330
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,072
Well, I'll be on my way.

331
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:17,908
Thanks for coming by.

332
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,293
So, I spoke with my gal in IA.

333
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,671
The snitch said
Penguin was beating Galavan to death

334
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:34,049
when you stepped in
and put a bullet in his chest.

335
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,348
Someone else was there that night.

336
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,060
Either that, or Penguin talked.

337
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,270
He did just get out of Arkham.

338
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,355
How the hell he did, I'll never know.

339
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,607
But lest we forget he was in there

340
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,317
for a murder you committed.

341
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,404
A grudge is not beyond
the realm of possibility.

342
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,947
He could have talked when he was arrested.

343
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,157
Used it to cut a deal, but he didn't.

344
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,328
Did your IA contact
give you anything else?

345
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,664
The witness has agreed
to swear out a statement.

346
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,333
IA has officially
reopened the investigation.

347
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,377
You are now the primary suspect

348
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,589
in the murder of Theo Galavan.

349
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,264
Well, tell my uncle to call me!

350
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,269
Look, I know you think
he's got a soft spot for you,

351
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,689
but I'm pretty sure that's gonna change
when he finds out you tried to rob him.

352
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,525
My guess is he's not gonna be
too happy with you, either,

353
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:38,155
when I tell him that I just waltzed
in here and grabbed the cash.

354
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,576
So, maybe you let us go,
and we call it even?

355
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,913
What kind of message would that send?

356
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,666
No. The Gilzeans
are all about consequences.

357
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,335
More like all about pizza.

358
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,341
You ever try our product, Selina?

359
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,634
Stop!

360
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,719
Aren't you being rather cowardly?

361
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,638
Assaulting a girl?

362
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,185
No, he's right. You know,
when you're right, you're right!

363
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,229
Knock it off, Sonny. You made your point.

364
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,856
Stay out of this, Selina.

365
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,068
Call me a coward again.

366
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,611
You're a coward.

367
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,699
An ignorant, brutish--

368
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,577
Stop!

369
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:29,206
While you're down there, kid,
lick my boot.

370
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,379
<i>Strength costs wind.</i>

371
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:40,425
<i>Now, if you're gonna beat a big man,
all you have to do is outlast him.</i>

372
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,188
Stop!

373
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,784
I actually think he wants a beating.

374
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,744
Is that your thing, kid?

375
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,204
You like pain?

376
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:16,211
An ignorant, brutish, cowardly clown.

377
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,046
Yep.

378
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,256
He likes it, all right.

379
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,592
Your mom and dad
must have been real freaks,

380
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,886
bringing up a weird kid like you.

381
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,430
Enough!

382
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,938
Let's go! Let's go!

383
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,537
Hello, Mother.

384
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,251
What a lovely spot.

385
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:01,465
I'm so sorry I couldn't be here
for the funeral,

386
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,385
but I think you'd be proud of me.

387
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,638
I'm a changed man.

388
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,724
Or,

389
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,101
at least I'm trying to be.

390
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,021
To be honest,

391
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,608
I don't know

392
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,193
if I'm gonna make it without you.

393
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:25,989
Hello?

394
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,493
<i>I'm terribly sorry,</i>

395
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,620
- I don't mean to interrupt.
- Not at all.

396
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,374
- Lilies.
- Her favorite, if memory serves.

397
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,667
Yes. They were.

398
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,669
Did you know her?

399
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,923
A long time ago.

400
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:46,051
I found her again only in death,
I'm afraid.

401
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,637
- I'm Elijah Van Dahl.
- Oh.

402
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,013
Oswald Cobblepot.

403
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:52,974
Cobblepot?

404
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,726
You're related to Gertrude?

405
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,061
My mother.

406
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,272
Mother?

407
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,776
You're Gertrude's son?

408
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,027
Yes.

409
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,030
I'm sorry. How did you know
my mother, exactly?

410
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,907
- How old are you?
- Excuse me?

411
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,784
How old are you?

412
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,619
- Gertrude left--
- Thirty-one.

413
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,663
Thirty-one years ago, yes.

414
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,872
That's right.

415
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,542
Oh, my God. She...

416
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,337
She never told me.

417
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,881
Told you what?

418
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,717
That I had a son.

419
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,151
Any word on the bomber?

420
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,029
Bullock's waiting on forensics.

421
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,159
I just wish I knew what his endgame was.

422
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,910
Feels like I'm missing something.

423
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,414
Is that why you're not eating?

424
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,334
Uh, yeah, I guess.

425
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,965
No.

426
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,971
IA is re-opening the investigation
into Galavan's murder.

427
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,224
- Why?
- An eye-witness came forward.

428
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,979
You... You told me it was over, Jim.

429
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,230
You swore to me.

430
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,648
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,903
I knew in my heart that it wasn't.

432
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,070
<i>But I let you lie to me.</i>

433
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,281
I didn't. I wasn't.

434
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,532
We should have left
when we had the chance.

435
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,160
Gone somewhere new, somewhere better,
somewhere fit to raise our child.

436
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,454
You knew I couldn't do that.

437
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:38,872
I can fix this.

438
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,081
How?

439
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,960
You did it. You killed Galavan.

440
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,464
I'll find a way. I have to.

441
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,924
What if you can't?

442
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,729
Hello, Officer Pinkney.

443
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,774
I'm so sorry to bother you at home.
Can I come in?

444
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,735
Uh, sure.

445
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,320
Make it quick. The ballgame's on.

446
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:14,532
What's this about?

447
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,160
Oh, Detective Gordon'll explain.
He's just behind me.

448
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,328
Oh, okay.

449
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,164
Hey, Pinkney,

450
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,083
what do you call a tavern of blackbirds?

451
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,795
A crowbar.

452
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,256
You get it? A crow bar.

453
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:30,507
I know it's kind of lame.

454
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,050
I just came up with it on the spot.

455
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,802
Ow.

456
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,261
Gertrude came to work
as a cook for my parents.

457
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,263
She was so young and beautiful.

458
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,265
So full of life.

459
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:22,892
So beautiful.

460
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,856
I was young then, too.

461
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,399
A boy, really.

462
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,570
A foolish, romantic boy.

463
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,579
When my parents found out,

464
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,082
they forbade us from being together.

465
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,501
I was the heir to a great fortune,
they said.

466
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,211
And she was just a cook.

467
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,672
I threatened to run away with her.

468
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:57,927
Turn my back on my family name
and my inheritance.

469
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:01,056
It was the first and only time
I ever stood up to them.

470
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,392
<i>They must have known
my words were just that.</i>

471
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,021
A spoiled child, making idle threats.

472
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:09,898
<i>The next day, Gertrude was gone.</i>

473
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,820
My parents told me only that
they had come to an arrangement.

474
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,447
She would be taken care of,

475
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:21,284
and I must never make
an attempt to find her.

476
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,288
And to my shame, I didn't.

477
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,793
I let them separate us.

478
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,795
I had no idea...

479
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,672
She never told me she was pregnant.

480
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,468
She didn't tell me about you...

481
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,721
If she did...

482
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,974
She told me that my father had died
when I was still a baby.

483
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,895
Easier than the truth, I suppose.

484
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:53,316
That your father was a coward
who wouldn't stand up to his parents.

485
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,904
She must have figured that the two of you
would be better off making your own way.

486
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,409
Which, in fact, is probably the truth.

487
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,453
Look at you.

488
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,374
A strong young man.

489
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,460
She did a good job, didn't she?

490
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,296
She tried.

491
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,799
We both miss her terribly.

492
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,802
My poor boy,

493
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,139
you've been all alone in the world.

494
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,353
Yes, I have.

495
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:32,397
No longer.

496
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,607
You have a home,

497
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,402
and a father,

498
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,863
and a family.

499
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,451
- A family?
- A big, happy family.

500
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,496
They're going to be
so thrilled to meet you.

501
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,041
Sir, please,

502
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,335
tell me truthfully,

503
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,379
is this a dream?

504
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,009
It's not a dream, my boy.

505
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,802
You're home.

506
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,873
- Yeah.
<i>- Forensics just landed.</i>

507
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,418
The timer on the bomb was activated
remotely by phone, which was smart.

508
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,505
Gave him time to plant it in advance
and set it off when he wanted.

509
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,340
<i>We get a number?</i>

510
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:45,553
Yeah. Call came from a payphone
inside 17, West Dewy Avenue.

511
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,805
<i>Just a few blocks from Union Station.</i>

512
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,057
Payphone, huh?

513
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,434
All right, I'll go over there
and check it out.

514
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,895
<i>- See you tomorrow.</i>
- He's probably long gone by now.

515
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,105
I can't sleep anyhow.

516
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,315
<i>Yeah.</i>

517
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:19,587
Hello?

518
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,466
Hello?

519
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,314
Pinkney.

520
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,116
Gordon?

521
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:49,659
What the hell are you doing here?

522
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,539
Put your gun down. Now!

523
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,838
Place your gun on the floor.

524
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,631
I won't say it again.

525
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,133
Okay.

526
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,097
Listen to me.

527
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,017
I was just following up a lead
on the bomber investigation.

528
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,936
You were following up a lead
in Pinkney's apartment?

529
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,022
No.

530
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,399
I didn't know that
this was Pinkney's apartment building.

531
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,277
Why are you here?

532
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,779
Pinkney sent me a message.

533
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,282
Wanted to talk outside of work.

534
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:30,950
About what?

535
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,744
You.

536
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,249
I have to have to take you down
to the precinct.

537
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:43,630
There's been a mistake.

538
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,424
I hope so, son.

539
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:48,760
I hope so.

540
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,147
Almost done.

541
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,068
Okay.

542
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:15,536
Never seen someone
take a beating like that before.

543
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,082
I think Sonny's right.

544
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,833
You do like pain.

545
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,091
When it was happening,

546
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,222
it was like nothing else existed.

547
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,896
Everything I've been struggling with,

548
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,648
the emptiness

549
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,610
and confusion,

550
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,865
it just vanished,

551
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,160
and for the first time

552
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,163
in a long time,

553
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,291
I knew I was going to be okay.

554
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:07,797
I knew that whatever Sonny did to me,

555
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,135
I could take it.

556
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,183
That he couldn't break me.

557
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,229
That no one can.

558
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,568
Nobody's unbreakable, Bruce.

559
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:46,919
You want your rep here?

560
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,713
I didn't do this. Somebody set me up.

561
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,424
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma to the head.

562
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:52,633
Captain, listen to me. I--

563
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,051
Murder weapon was a crowbar.

564
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,553
We found it under the couch.

565
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,140
Your fingerprints were on it.

566
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:07,106
<i>At Union Station,
I used a crowbar to open up the locker.</i>

567
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:08,858
Somebody must have picked it up.

568
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,069
And that someone just happened to know

569
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,197
that you'd be paying
Officer Pinkney a visit tonight?

570
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,699
I told you.
I didn't know that he lived there.

571
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,994
Forensics traced the bomber's call
to a pay phone in the building.

572
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,245
Bullock will back me up.

573
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:22,663
He did.

574
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,082
<i>But when I asked for the report,</i>

575
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,795
it had nothing to do with a remote timer
or any traced call.

576
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,263
I know how this looks.

577
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,391
But Pinkney was one of us.
Why would I kill him?

578
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,520
Because he was the anonymous witness
that fingered you.

579
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:51,192
We found this Internal Affairs form
at Pinkney's place.

580
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:55,780
It's the exact same statement
that the anonymous witness made,

581
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,574
only Pinkney signed this
with his own name.

582
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,994
<i>I guess he got cold feet
about putting himself on the line.</i>

583
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,497
<i>So he sent in the anonymous tip instead.</i>

584
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,208
Must have figured you'd get nasty.

585
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,335
I don't know how you figured it out,

586
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,629
but you found out he was the witness.

587
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:12,839
No.

588
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,549
Maybe you went over to his place
to talk him out of it?

589
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,050
I told you,
I didn't know it was his place!

590
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:19,178
Or maybe you had no intention of talking,
and you just killed him.

591
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,138
You know me.

592
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,475
I know that something went down
between you and Galavan that night.

593
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,061
I saw it in your eyes
when IA was grilling you.

594
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:30,481
And now, the one person who was about
to shine light on this whole thing

595
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,484
is found beaten to death
with you standing over the body.

596
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,653
- What am I missing?
- I was set up!

597
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,783
Jim, how many lying,
son-of-a-bitch, low-life weasels

598
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,493
have you heard use that same line?

599
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,744
Somebody set you up?

600
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,621
That's what you're going with?

601
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,334
The least you can do
is admit what you did.

602
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,711
Be a man.

603
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,422
Pinkney was one of us.

604
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,383
He deserves that. I deserve that!

605
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,051
The least you could do
is look me in the eye

606
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:02,263
and remind me that
you were a good cop once.

607
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,725
That you still know right from wrong. Jim!

608
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,855
I want to talk to my rep.

609
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,944
You're a disgrace to the badge.

610
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,321
I trusted you!

611
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,325
But you broke my heart.

612
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,083
You, take him to county.

613
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:33,669
I don't want him here.

614
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:41,510
- Jim!
- Harvey.

615
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,262
The bomber, Harvey.

616
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:46,057
Everything that happened today
was set up to trap me!

617
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,352
<i>The bomber, Harvey!</i>

618
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:59,028
<i>The four-week
murder trial of Detective Gordon</i>

619
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:01,322
<i>concluded just minutes ago,</i>

620
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:04,408
<i>with the jury returning
a unanimous verdict of "guilty."</i>

621

622
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,205
<i>to be served at Blackgate Penitentiary.</i>

623
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,716
<i>...jury was unanimous in its decision
after deliberating less than 24 hours.</i>

624
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,678
<i>District Attorney Harvey Dent
was not available for comment--</i>

625
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:24,845
Wow.

626
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,225
You okay?

627
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:31,394
This isn't right.

628
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:34,772
This can't be right.

629
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,066
Tell me something that is.

630
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:47,576
<i>Just hours ago, the murder
trial of Detective James Gordon concluded</i>

631
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:52,039
<i>with the jury returning
a unanimous verdict of "guilty."</i>

632
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:55,251

<i>The jury was unanimous in its decision--</i>

635
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,592
Oh, my. Awake at last.

636
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:13,144
Well, hello, dear.

637
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,730
Someone call Professor Strange!

638
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,906
We're gonna fight this.

639
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,161
- Lee.
- Did you hear me?

640
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,704
No matter what it takes,
we're gonna fight this.

641
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:33,205
The evidence isn't gonna change.

642
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:34,415
You're innocent.

643
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,625
I'm far from innocent. We both know that.

644
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,836
So, what? We just give up?

645
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,423
We move on.

646
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:44,925
Move on?

647
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,511
Move on to what?

648
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,141
You mean me.

649
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:53,934
You mean I move on.

650
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,228
I've thought long and hard about this.

651
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,105
- No.
- You have to listen to me.

652
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,315
I'm tired of listening.

653
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:00,816
This isn't fair!

654
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,112
How can you not be with us?

655
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,034
Birthdays,

656
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,496
and first steps,

657
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,581
and skinned knees,

658
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,125
and everything?

659
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,547
What, what? Visits through bars and...

660
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,716
And not knowing
when the phone is gonna ring

661
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,760
in the middle of the night
and tell me when you're--

662
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,095
I don't want that.

663
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,638
For either of you.

664
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,307
- You still have a chance at happiness.
- No.

665
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,101
You need to go somewhere.

666
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,061
Far away from here.

667
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,146
Somewhere fit to raise our child.

668
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:40,731
Start a new life.

669
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:43,526
Forget I exist.

670
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,861
It's the only way
either one of us survives this.

671
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,446
No, Jim.

672
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:52,827
Don't try to contact me again.
I won't reply.

673
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,621
No. Don't do this.

674
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,039
I'm sorry, Lee.

675
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,541
Jim, don't do this. I love you.

676
00:40:58,707 --> 00:40:59,959
I'm so, so sorry.

677
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:01,544
Jim!

678
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,177
<i>A toast.</i>

679
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,805
I want to thank you all
for your generosity.

680
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:17,726
You have welcomed Oswald into our family
with open arms and open hearts,

681
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,896
and for that, I am truly blessed.

682
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,650
To family.

683
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:29,071
Uh, you guys have made me

684
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:31,490
the happiest man on the planet.

685
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,826
I am so grateful.

686
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,413
I love you all.

687
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,749
- Family.
- To family.

688
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,293
To family.

689
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:49,633
Oh...

690
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,637
- Brother.
- Yes, yes.

691
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:56,140
Yes.

692
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,614
<i>Inmate Gordon,
prison transfer. Open the gate.</i>

693
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,256
I'm gonna find who set you up.

694
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,009
This ain't over.

695
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:34,678
Yeah.

696
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:52,780
You were a good partner, Harvey.

697
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:54,240
Still am.

698
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:48,877
