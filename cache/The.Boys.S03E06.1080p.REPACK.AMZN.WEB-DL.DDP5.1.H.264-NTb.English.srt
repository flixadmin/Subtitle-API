the rest of Payback?

164
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,587
Countess wasn't strong enough
to fuck him over on her own.

165
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,005
She had help.

166
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,175
Soldier Boy's
just getting started.

167
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,801
[Starlight] Do you know
where any of them are?

168
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,136
[Mother's Milk] Those
shady-ass TNT Twins

169
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,096
got an address in Vermont.

170
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,098
- Okay. Does Butcher have it?
- No,

171
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,351
but he'll get it.

172
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,103
I think Soldier Boy
is bulletproof.

173
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,023
This ain't for Soldier Boy.

174
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,696
Look, I'm pissed
at those guys, too,

175
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,573
but we have to keep
our heads on.

176
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,035
Why? Why do I always
have to take the high road?

177
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,120
You know, when
white folks get mad,

178
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,622
y'all motherfuckers go berserk,

179
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,208
but I got to turn
the other cheek?

180
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,628
Fuck the high road,
fuck Butcher, and fuck Hughie.

181
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,296
Hughie is not himself right now.

182
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,590
Hughie is a grown-ass man
that's made his own choices.

183
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,549
M.M.!

00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,593
Please. Soldier Boy

185
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,096
is gonna kill more people.
I mean, fuck.

186
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,555
Kimiko is in the hospital.

187
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,224
She lost her powers.

188
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,435
Frenchie isn't answering,

189
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,145

190
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,611
We're all we've got.

191
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,658
It's up to us.

This is Starlight.

195

Yeah, of course, Ashley.
I'll be right there.

196
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,840
I got to go up
to the Tower for a little bit.

197
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,216
Now?

198
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,135
If I don't go, they're
gonna know something's up.

199
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,886
I'll be one hour.

200
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,932
Do I need to worry about you?

201
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,190
Okay.

What are you doing
about Blue Hawk?

213
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,094
Okay, first of all,
everyone at Vought

214
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,764
is just heartbroken over
your brother's tragic accident.

215

It wasn't an accident.

216

Blue Hawk went apeshit
for no reason.

217
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,976
Well, he said
he felt threatened.

218
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,269
- Threatened?
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,979
By what, a room
full of Black people

220

with no superpowers?

221

Fuck that.
I want charges brought.

224
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,404
Okay, A-Train,
persecuting Blue Hawk

225
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,073
will only make things worse.

226
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,240
This is a time for healing.

Now, uh, can we talk
about this later?

I have a lot going on today.
Thank you.

I don't need you.

I'll just ping his chip,
go get his ass myself.

235
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,551
No. Homelander wants
everyone to present

specifically figuring out
how to cover up your bullshit...

246
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,200
including all three
of your straight-up murders...

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,202
while you were out
in the club with your crew,

248
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,329
or getting your toe sucked
by Popclaw,

249
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,040
who, let's not forget,
you also murdered.

250
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,835
Yeah, that's right.
I know about that.

251
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,086
You did not give a shit

252
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,921
about all the collateral
you caused then.

253
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,090
Now, all of a sudden, you care

254
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,427
because it happened to you?

255
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,762
Go fuck yourself.

256
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,598
Yeah, that's right.

257
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,600

Noir, he's, uh, he's gone.

262

What do you mean, he's gone?

263
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,501
He cut out his tracking chip.

264
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,094
No, he-he-he...

265
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,683
He-he wouldn't. Not Noir.
He wouldn't run.

266
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,644
Well...

267
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,897
He wouldn't do that to me.

268
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,690
He w... he wouldn't run.

269
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,195
Tell him...
what we figured out.

270
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,613
Right.

271
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,448
We think Crimson Countess
was just the start.

272
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,074
We think... he's going after

273
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,701
his whole team, including Noir.

274
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,119
The good news is,
that means we know

275
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,205
where he's probably headed next.

276
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,290
The twins. TNT.

277
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,542

00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,634
Okay? Really?
Homelander, thank you so much.

00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,511
Shh, shh, shh.

281
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,099
You go there,

282
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,601
and you check it out.

283
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,271

Uh...

- what should I tell the twins?
- I don't give a fuck.

00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,702
Yeah, but, you know, I didn't
need you to jump in there

291
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,204
like that.
I had the whole thing.

292

Hey, hey. [scoffs]

293
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,916

00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,170
Okay. Right.

What if I can't handle him?

300
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,868
I mean, if Noir ran...

301
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,454
Oh, you can handle him.

302
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,040
You're the top
of the food chain.

303
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,626
Hey, hey.

304
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,962
When we were kids,

305
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,047
alone in the bad room,

306
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,217
I got us through it, right?

307
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,510
Don't I always?

308
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,638
- Always.
- No matter what.

309
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,639
No matter what.

310
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,434
And now,
I'll get us through this.

311
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,812
Just as long as you and me
stick together.

312
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,732
But... what if Edgar's right?

313
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,235
What if it was a mistake
to take over Vought?

314
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,529
And-and...

315
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,198
and I am just talent,
and they all know I'm a fraud.

316

a bunch of mud people think?

Come on.

00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,498
Tell me the real reason.
I want to hear you say it.

320
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,586

- I want them to love me.

Only it never seems
to work out, does it?

323
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,969
Madelyn, Maeve, Stormfront,

324
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,679

00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,655
[laughs] Okay. Okay, good.

487
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,198
Oh, great. I thought
he was avoiding me

488
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,491
- or something, you know...
- No, no.

489
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,451
...'cause he was scared
I was gonna pop his head.

490
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,328
[swallows]

491
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,538
Hmm?

492
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,248
Come on, Annie.

493
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,000
Put them away.

494
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,002
I'm not gonna hurt you

495
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,963
or Hughie or your families.

496
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,215
Besides, you'd lose.

497
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,135
Then why are you here?

498
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,803
Because I want to help you.

499
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,098
Huh. Help.

500
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,642
From the psycho
who blew up Congress.

501
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,019
Look, most of those guys
passed around deepfakes of me

502
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,063
on the House floor
blowing bin Laden,

503
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,149
so I'm not exactly overwhelmed
with sympathy.

504
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,735
Annie, you need me.

505
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,279
You're all alone.

506
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,406
I mean, come on,
that "hashtag Homelight" shit?

507
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,366
That looks like you're in
a hostage video.

508
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,659
Blink twice if I'm wrong.

509
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,327
And, what, you got to play nice
with the guy

510
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,829
that throat-fucked you
on your first day of work.

511
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,916
And Maeve, they say Maeve
is in rehab,

512
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,086
but you and I both know
she's probably dead.

513
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,588
I'm all you got.

514
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,591
Come on, Annie,
you and I were friends.

515
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,467
None of that
has changed for me.

516
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,136
Are you ever gonna get
to the point?

517
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,724
You have 193 million
Instagram followers.

518
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,059
Lend me your influence,
and I'll lend you mine.

519
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,061
I can protect you
from Homelander.

520
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,939
You'll finally
be team captain for real.

521
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,816
And in return, you help me
goose my numbers.

522
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,944
I can finally get
my education reform bill passed.

523
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,863
We can make things
better, Annie.

524
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,073
For my daughter,

525
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,909
for a lot of daughters.

526
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,872
Come on, what do you say?

527
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,669
You're right.

528
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,093
This whole place.

529
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,138
I'm so fucking tired...

530
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,185
...of listening
to people tell me

531
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,271
I need to be shitty
in order to win.

532
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,234
Fuck you.

533
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:29,403
And fuck Homelander,
and fuck Vought

534
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,573
and this
"whatever it takes" crap.

535
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:33,824
You're just gonna end up

536
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:37,078
sitting on top
of the steaming pile of shit

537
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,413
that you built.

538
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,332
I'm done.

539
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,543
I'm fucking done.
I'm not doing it anymore.

540
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,128
You're not gonna be
doing anything

541
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,296
if Homelander kills you.

542
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,839
Yeah, maybe.

543
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:52,093
But then I'll know I'm not
working with a fucking nutjob.

544
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,887
So, either pop my head

545
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,139
or get the hell out.

546
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,033
Hey, keep this between us?

547
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:19,662
It'd be really tough to take out
America's sweetheart,

548
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,081
but not impossible.

00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,510
no. Don't do this.

556
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,971
His body is a masterpiece, no?

[inhales]

Do you know the story
behind this one? [exhales]

559
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,941
Oh, years ago, my cousin Kolya
went State's witness, so

560
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,361
I send my Serge. Not even three

561
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:36,030
bullets could stop
my attack dog.

562
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:41,285
Bar fight on the Basque coast.

563
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,120
He started it.

564
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,332
Oh, my beast.
This is my favorite.

565
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,251
When Serge was

566
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,046
14 years old,
he dropped a glass.

567
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:55,049
His father told him
to kneel in the shards

568
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,301
and not move until he said so.

569
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:01,889
Little Serge
did not shift an inch,

570
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,100
not even after his father left
to get drunk

571
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,060
and pass out in the whorehouse.

572
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh, please, don't cry for Serge.

573
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,108
He likes to be told what to do.

574
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,443
And he loves to be punished

575
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,278
when he's bad.

576
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,905
Makes him hard.

Don't do this! Nina!

[Little Nina] You must
choose, Serge.

583
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,875
If not, I will kill

584
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,710
both of them,
and when you've finished

I will kill you, too.

Have you always had that?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

616
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,769
[sighs] I grew up in Harlem,

617
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,188
brownstone filled with family.

618
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,233
Grandparents, uncles,
aunts, cousins.

619
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,485
One night,

620
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,404
there was a ruckus outside.

621
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:06,782
I looked out the window,
and it was Soldier Boy.

622
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,826
He had pulled up on some kids
that were trying

623
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:12,705
to boost a Benz, and so I run
and wake up my granddad.

624
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:16,125
"Grandpa, Grandpa.
It's Soldier Boy. Come look."

625
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,752
Soldier Boy takes the Benz,

626
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,671
and he hurls it
through our house,

627
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,590
like a fucking freight train.

628
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,384
It missed me
by about six inches.

629
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,178
And my grandpa...

630
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,097
One minute he was there...

631
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,518
...and then he wasn't.

632
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,105
And I woke him up.

633
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,065
I put him in that spot.

634
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,569
That is not your fault.

635
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,446
[Mother's Milk] That's when
this whole OCD shit started.

636
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,947
I mean, I don't understand it.

637
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,074
All I know is that
if I didn't check the burners

638
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,534
three times a night,

639
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,745
Soldier Boy would come back
and kill the rest of us.

640
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,666
And I'm still that kid.

00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,087
Still getting up
in the middle of the night,

642
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,132

643
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,926
'Cause if I don't,

644
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,472
Soldier Boy's gonna come back,

645
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,807
and he's gonna kill my family.

646
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:22,358
I got to get this motherfucker
out of my head,

647
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,277
and end this.

648
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,571
Or it'll end me.

00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,961
- [gasps] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, hell nah.

650
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,089
- [Starlight] Oh, my God.
- Invitation?

651
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,548
I got your invitation
right here.

652
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,050
Hey.

653
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,220
Starlight. I did not
even recognize you.

654
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,931
Come in. You are
more than welcome to party.

655
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,265
- Party?
- [Love Sausage] Yeah.

656
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,726
The 70th anniversary
of Herogasm.

657
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,561
- Fuck me.
- Oh.

658
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,106
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

659
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,273
You seem familiar.

660
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,317
You about to get familiar
with these hands

661
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,486
if you don't get this
motherfucking love sausage

662
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,238
away from my goddamn face.

663
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,072
Okay, okay, okay.

664
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,700
You are not Supe.

665
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,368
I'm with her.

666
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,911
For the fuck party.

667
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,956
Yeah. Um, mm-hmm.
No, he's very good

668
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,624
at cunnilingus.
Yeah, his tongue

669
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,917
- is just... Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,211
He just gobbles
that vagina right up.

671
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,879
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom. [chuckles]

672
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,340
- Mm-hmm.
- Love Sausage, huh?

673
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,967
This is good name for me.

674
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,720
I like it. Come on in.

675
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,473
[moaning]

676
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,689
Oh, my God.

677
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,112
Oh...

678
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:53,282
All right, so once a year,
a bunch of C-listers

679
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,075
get together
at one of their places

680
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,952
- to get they wicks wet.
- [moaning]

681
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:57,828
- [grunts]
- Stop.

682
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,288
- Herogasm.
- Mm-hmm.

683
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,999
- I get it.
- Holy ass-ramming.

684
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,167
Ew.

685
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,251
Aw, stop!

686
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,628
Holy ass-ramming.
Holy ass-ramming.

687
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,133
- [screams]
- [moaning]

688
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:14,595
[female Supe] Come on.
Come on my hump.

689
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,054
That's it.

690
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,931
- [grunting]
- [electricity buzzing]

691
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,100
Poor Frenchie.

692
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:23,061
He's always wanted to see this.
He's gonna be heartbroken.

693
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,151
[Mother's Milk] You know
what's fucked up?

694
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,444
- Hmm?
- [Mother's Milk] It's that it's

695
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,862
real fucking sex workers here

696
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,490
getting banged up,
and not in the good way.

697
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,783
[screams]

698
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,409
[Mother's Milk] Not that
these Supes give a shit.

699
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,411
When Soldier Boy gets here,

700
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:40,871
it's gonna be a slaughter.

701
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,081
We have to get these people out.

702
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,002
What up, bro?

703
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,213
What the fuck
did this motherfucker

704
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,923
- put on my jacket?
- Oh, my God. Okay. Um...

705
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,341
It's my favorite fucking jacket.

706
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,842
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- Some nasty-ass shit.

707
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,469
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- This shit is sticky.

708
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,929
Let's go clean it up. Let's go.

709
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,847
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Yellowtail sashimi?

710
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,892
No. No, not in the mood
for that. Thanks.

711
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,435
- Goddamn it.
- [male Supe] Throwing ropes.

712
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:05,604
[gasps, screams]

713
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,897
[male Supe] Oh, shit.

714
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,817
Lick it up,
you yummy brown bear.

715
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:10,984
[door closes]

716
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,656
I can't.

717
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,367
I need a bathroom.

718
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,077
Right now.

719
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:23,372
[Hughie] Oh, okay.
So, this-this is an actual orgy.

720
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,748
That's what this is.

721
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,333
[Butcher] Fucking Herogasm.

722
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,336
Still a thing, eh?

723
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,338
It's my thing. I founded it

724
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,173
in '52.

725
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,967
Me and this other Supe, Liberty.

726
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,969
Man, was she a firecracker.

727
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,345
[Soldier Boy chuckles]

728
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:42,015
Frenchie's gonna be heartbroken
he missed this.

729
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,977
There are a lot
of people in there.

730
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,566
Well, as long as they stay out
of my way, they'll be fine.

731
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,903
Okay, all right. Just, uh,
give me three minutes.

732
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,029
I'll jump in,
I'll jump back out.

733
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,239
I'll tell you exactly where

734
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,408
to find the twins.
Nobody else in your way.

735
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,285
Three minutes.

736
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,999
[Blue Hawk] Soldier Boy?
Nah, he's dead as dog shit.

737
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,834
No, he's not.

738
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,545
I swear,
this is really happening.

739
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,715
Please, you need to help me
get people out of here, now.

740
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,384
Starlight, come on.

741
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,469
Do not let them do this to you.

742
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,221
- [sighs]
- This... this fear.

743
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,098
You heard what Homelander said.

744
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,766
Lamestream media's
making a fucking mountain

745
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,518
out of a molehill.

746
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,437
- Do the research.
- Oh, my God.

747
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:29,730
This is real.

748
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,024
These attacks are real.

749
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,318
Soldier Boy is real.

750
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:35,944
Well, I just think
you could stand to be

751
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,447
a little better informed.

752
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,991
Homelander's gonna
take care of it, okay?

753
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,828
I'm gonna go find
a salad to toss.

754
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,121
Excuse me.

755
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,123
[moaning in distance]

756
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,002
[panting]

757
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,379
[male Supe 2] You melted
my cock ring.

758
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,928
- [loud moaning]
- [woman] Oh, Jesus, your stretching powers!

759
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,517
[Deep] Oh, my God,
your mouth is amazing.

760
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,353
It's like a velvet vacuum
draining my balls.

761
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,605
[Deep] Oh, yeah.
You are so fucking hot.

762
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,523
Oh...

763
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,652
God, your legs go on for days.

764
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,404
- [grunts]
- [squishing]

765
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,658
Ooh. Ooh. Oh, my God.

766
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,993
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

767
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,161
It's not what it looks like.

768
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,996
What are you doing here?

769
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,373
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
Why would you even...

770
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,625
This octopus was sick.
Why would you ask that?

771
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,002
- Homelander is gonna love this.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Please, please, please. Stop.

772
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,671
Stop, stop, stop. No.

773
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,173
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Look.

774
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,842
That's why I'm here.
It's his idea.

775
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,013
What's his idea?

776
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:50,102
I said no cameras
in the toilets, Tommy.

777
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,437
- Give it back.
- You're pathetic.

778
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:53,772
[Tessa] You know what?

779
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,234
Let's see how everyone feels
about close-ups

780
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:00,112
of their assholes
without consent!

781
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,405
Fuck you. I'm done.

782
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:04,157
[distant] I never want
to see you again.

783
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,246
Oh. That's so sweet.

784
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,124
Uh, just, I got to give
my asshole a breather.

785
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,750
You know?

786
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,253
[Tessa] Then say goodbye
to that Westfield mall opening

787
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,672
next week in Poughkeepsie,
'cause nobody

788
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,383
is coming to see you without me.

789
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,468
[Tommy] I fucking hate you.

790
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,095
I hate your mouth.
I hate the way your jaw pops

791
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,096
when you chew.

792
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,348
And I hated every second I spent

793
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,891
holding that clammy hand.

794
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,727
I should've killed you
in the womb.

795
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:32,811
Ah, fuck you!

796
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,979
Fuck you!

797
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,564
Fuck you, Tommy!

798
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,774
- [both grunt]
- Sorry.

799
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,277
Ah.

800
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,820
Hey, I know you like
fucking Supes,

801
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,989
but I'm off the table.

802
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,158
That's not why I'm here, okay?

803
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,492
You're here, too, you know.

804
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:48,785
Whatever, Pornhub.

805
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,496
I don't have time
for you right now.

806
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,130
Hey.

807
