No, Gef.

985

I was a Kree battle
slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

989
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,320
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

990
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,960
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

991
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,880
But I was young...

992
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,280
and greedy, and stupid.

993
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,400
Like you stealing
those batteries.

994
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,120
That was mostly Drax.

995
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,040
Me and Stakar and
the other captains...

996
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,400
we weren't so different
from you and your friends.

997
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,240
The only family
I ever had.

998
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,320
When I broke the code...

999
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,240
they exiled me.

1000
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,040
This is what I deserve.

1001

Slow down, drama queen.

by those disgusting-ass teeth.

asshole or what?

deliver Quill to Ego

1287
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,360
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

1288
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,880
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

1289
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,000
I'm immortal?

1290
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,560
Mmm-hmm.

1291
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,200
Really?

1292
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,200
Yes!
As long as the light exists.

1293
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,520
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1294
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,000
like how you made
this whole planet?

1295
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,520
It might take you
a few million
years of practice...

1296
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,880
before you get
really good at it.
But, yes!

1297
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,080
What!

1298
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,880
Get ready for

of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

I'm gonna make
some weird shit.

1302
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,240
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous
responsibility.

1303
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,880
Only we can
remake the universe.

1304
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,600
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1305
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,520
and lead it to
where it needs to go.

1306

I found you disgusting.

I don't like you like that.

I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

Hey! There's no need
to get personal.

1324

Listen! Ego's gotten
exactly what he wanted.

1325
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,640
I should have
told you earlier.

1326
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,920
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

Everything around us,
including the girl...

1331

Everything is temporary.

We are forever.

get boring?

Not if you have a purpose,

1335

which is why you're here.

1336
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,240
I told you how
all those years ago...

1337
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,440
I had an unceasing
impulse to find life.

1338

But what I did not
tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1339
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,680
it was all so...

1340
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,000
disappointing.

<i>And that is when I came...</i>

1342

to a profound realization.

1343
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,160
My innate desire
to seek out other life...

1344
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,840
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1345

For honor? For love?

No. I don't care
about those things.

to put up with you...
