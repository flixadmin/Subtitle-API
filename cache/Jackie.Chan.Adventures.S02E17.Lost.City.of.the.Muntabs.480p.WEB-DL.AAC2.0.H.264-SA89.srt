1
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,673
I cannot believe
I am stuck in the jungle

2
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,174
with such a spoiled brat.

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,676
You invited me.

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,644
I was talking
about him.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,716
Mr. Smith! Please,

6
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,685
we must stay together.

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,820
There are many dangers
in the bush.

8
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,989
Eh, yes, yes,
so you keep saying.

9
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,724
Hop to it, Larsen.

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,163
Why don't we ditch
frick and frack
and have some real fun?

11
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,664
Go swinging
with the monkeys

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,233
or wrestle a crocodile?

13
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,667
What do you say, big j?

14
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,770
I'm sorry, Jade,
but you must learn

15
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,606
that growing up
sometimes means
having to do things

16
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,141
that are not fun.

17
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,243
Like guiding
obnoxious jerks
through the jungle

18
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,645
just 'cause they
give lots of money
to the museum?

19
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,747
Uh...Yes.

20
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,383
In that case,
- I never want to grow up.

21
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,684
What am I saying?

22
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,420
I can't wait to grow up.

23
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,121
Get my own car,
cell phone--

24
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,790
which, now that you
mention it...

25
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,124
I didn't mention it.

26
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,793
Smith: Oh, Mr. chan...

27
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,694
(Sighs) Yes?

28
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,796
Uh, why don't you
take a fiver

29
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,298
while Larsen snaps
a few photos?

30
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,700
Oh. Please, Mr. Smith,

31
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,803
this is no place
to dawdle.

32
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,307
Well, how do I look,
Larsen?

33
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,042
Very vibrant, sir.

34
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,111
(Twigs snapping)

35
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,913
(Gasps)
Do not move!

36
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,682
Black panther!

37
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,853
Shoo! Shoo-shoo-shoo!

38
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,421
(Growling)

39
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,391
Uh, Jackie?
I think that only
works on bears.

40
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,982
Haah!

41
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,991
Nobody move.

42
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,500
Aah! Throw me
your camera!

43
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,005
That is
a $4,000 zoltex

44
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,474
with a hand-ground
German lens and--

45
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,642
grrr!

46
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,691
Whew!

47
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,661
And if you want
photographs,

48
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,130
buy picture postcards
at the airport!

49
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,231
I am through
warning you

50
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,499
about the dangers
of the bush.

51
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,501
This happens again,
we turn back.

52
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,504
Oh, all right, Mr. chan.
You've made your point.

53
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,773
No dawdling.

54
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:30,075
Speaking of which,
it seems to me

55
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,643
that if we continue
on this path,

56
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,346
it will take 2 days
to reach the lost city
of the muntabs,

57
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:38,150
but only 2 hours
if we climb over
that mountain.

58
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,024
If I had a cell phone,
we could have called ahead
for a weather report.

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,294
According to my map,

60
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,364
the lost city
of the muntabs
should be right...

61
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,138
Well, now we know
how the lost city
got its name.

62
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,707
This map can't be wrong.

63
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,410
I--I--I paid a fortune
for it!

64
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,614
I warned you when we
began the expedition,
Mr. Smith.

65
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,349
The map might be
a forgery.

66
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,885
There has never been any proof
that muntab ruins exist.

67
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,327
What's so great about
these muntabs, anyway?

68
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,330
Ancient legends
speak of
the muntabs'

69
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,366
extraordinary health
and long life.

70
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,301
Ooh! Just imagine
what secrets

71
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,436
their artifacts
might reveal.

72
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,910
I suggest we turn back
before the storm
grows any worse.

73
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,946
I refuse to give up
so easily!

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,648
I can't. I won't!

75
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,185
Whoa.

76
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,456
(Squeaking)

77
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,164
Ohh, the muntab cloak
of invisibility!

78
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,799
The what?

79
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,802
Some legends speak
of the muntabs'
mastery of mirage--

80
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,604
a mixture of science
and sorcery

81
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:08,006
that allowed them
to shield their city.

82
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,708
It's definitely a wall,

83
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,109
and if there's a wall,

84
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,978
there must be a door.

85
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,715
(Gasps)

86
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,462
I found it, Larsen,

87
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,764
the lost city
of the muntabs.

88
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,399
Bully for you,
sir.

89
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,202
We must proceed
with extreme caution.

90
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,571
There is no telling
what lies...

91
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,239
Ahead?

92
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,585
It's like
something out of
a Tarzan movie.

93
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,187
It's fantastic.

94
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,260
Muntabs, Larsen.

95
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,062
They still exist.

96
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,031
So it would
appear, sir.

97
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,868
You know, if I had
a cell phone,

98
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,636
we could be
calling 911.

99
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,105
Not now.

100
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,474
Quickly, Larsen.
Take a picture.

101
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,010
No! Do not make
any sudden moves!

102
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,445
(Murmuring)

103
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,547
Eh, wait!

104
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,982
Uh, please!

105
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,052
We mean no harm.

106
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,188
Uh, I am
an archaeologist.

107
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,624
We are just visitors,

108
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,260
uh, accidental tourists.

109
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,065
(Murmuring)
(Murmuring)

110
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,437
Sorry. I did not
want to do that.

111
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,406
Uh, better come up
with some more stuff

112
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,574
you don't want to do,
quick.

113
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,817
Huh? What is he,
a coward?

114
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,886
It's called capturing
the high ground.

115
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,921
Hello? Martial arts 101?

116
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,592
This is a very bad way
to work out disagreements.

117
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,328
How about we sit down
and--ooof!

118
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,930
Ohh! (Grunting)

119
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,370
(Grunting)

120
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,309
Jackie!

121
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,577
(Gasps)

122
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:31,983
Ohhh!

123
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,799
Please, I don't want
to hurt you.

124
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,100
(Growls)

125
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,770
I warned you.

126
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,339
(Crunching)

127
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,640
(Grunts)

128
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,050
You don't know who
you're messing with!

129
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,685
Once my uncle Jackie
gets hold of you,

130
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,786
you're history!

131
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,355
Jade, please.
You will anger them.

132
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,191
A bit late for that,
I dare say.

133
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,167
(Gasps) Their chief!

134
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,072
Well, talk
to him, chan.

135
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,841
You're the expert
on aboriginal
cultures.

136
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,143
Huh? Uh...

137
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,180
How about that rain?

138
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,883
Outsiders
not welcome here.

139
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,118
Eh, we come
in peace.

140
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,154
In fact,
we will happily
<i>leave</i> in peace.

141
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,990
Hopefully one piece.

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,561
This...Weapon?

143
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,564
Heh heh. No, no.
A ca-me-ra.

144
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,633
Push the button.
Go ahead.

145
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,636
(Everyone gasps)

146
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,070
(Muttering)

147
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,373
Light in a box.

148
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,509
(Chief laughing)

149
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,878
(Muntabs laughing)

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,514
Oh. Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha hee hee!

151
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,783
(All laughter stops)

152
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,387
(Clears throat)
You see, we mean
no harm.

153
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,156
Chief: One way to be sure.

154
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,226
A test.
Behold cave of truth.

155
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,062
Only pure of spirit
may pass through unharmed.

156
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,531
Well, if you're
asking for
volunteers...

157
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,766
Him.

158
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:28,900
Huh?

159
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,273
Um, so what happens
if he doesn't
make it through?

160
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,741
Then you shall
all suffer

161
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,977
a fate far worse
than his.

162
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,046
Uh-huh.
Come on, chan!

163
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,415
Get your game face
on! Let's go!

164
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,587
You can do it, Jackie!

165
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,754
I know you can!

166
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,823
I'm almost positive
you can.

167
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,225
Uh, just between
you and me,

168
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,493
what are his chances?

169
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,995
Many have entered
the cave...

170
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,096
And?

171
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,464
None have emerged.

172
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,632
Ohhh.

173
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,174
(Gasps) A white rhino!

174
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,809
But you are extinct!

175
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,245
Ahh. Another
muntab mirage.

176
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,849
Aaaah! Not a mirage!

177
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,386
Bad day, bad day!

178
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,698
Sorry. Good rhino.

179
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,934
I don't hear anything.

180
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,769
Is that a good sign?

181
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,776
Aaaaaah!

182
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,511
D-ohhh!

183
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,413
Aaaaaaaah!

184
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,985
Very bad day!

185
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,455
(Rumbling)

186
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,623
Chan!

187
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,225
Please, Jackie.

188
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,732
His heart
was not pure.

189
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,335
You will all pay
for your lies.

190
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,738
(Coughing)

191
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,144
You should really
reinforce those walls.

192
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,179
Cave is very flimsy.

193
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,581
What'd I tell you?
My uncle is pure of heart

194
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,150
and tough as nails.

195
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,317
Ohhh.

196
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,825
(Playing in rhythm)

197
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,494
Eat, eat.

198
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,963
Thank you.
You are very generous.

199
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,033
Generosity
not given.
It is earned.

200
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,368
Oh, that's
very wise, yes.

201
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,704
Uh, one would expect
a chief of such wisdom

202
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,806
to be an old man,
but you, uh,

203
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,275
not a gray hair
or a wrinkle.

204
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,244
In fact, not one of you
looks a day over 35.

205
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,082
It is a blessing
to have wisdom of age

206
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,817
and body of youth.

207
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,652
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

208
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,621
So how do you do it?
Uh, diets? Exercise?

209
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,891
Our ways
are muntab ways.

210
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,626
Oh, come on, chief.

211
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,162
I'm prepared to offer
plenty for your secret.

212
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,831
Do you know
what this is?

213
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,567
Money. Major <i> dinero.</i>

214
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,471
Hmm. Prefer cloth.

215
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,008
Huh. Tell you
one thing, chan.

216
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,410
These people
may look good,

217
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,012
but they are backward
as all get out.

218
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,016
(Laughter)

219
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,818
Come, Jade.
We play.

220
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,864
Hello.

221
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,700
Cool, abila.
2 dolls for
the price of one.

222
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,268
Want to play
with her?

223
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,238
Uh, thanks,
but I'm a little old
to be playing with dolls.

224
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,573
Oh--not that there's
anything wrong with them.

225
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,741
I mean, when I was
your age--

226
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,676
what are you,
like, 7, 8?

227
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,346
Heh. 230.

228
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,847
(Laughs) Oh, right.

229
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,116
Jade, I want to
show you something,

230
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,552
but you must promise
to keep it a secret.

231
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,354
My nickname? Fort Knox.

232
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,857
Secrets go in,
they don't come out.

233
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,261
Honored guest,
tell me, what
brought you here?

234
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,863
How you
find muntabs?

235
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,799
Mr. Smith
purchased this map,

236
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,035
and we began
searching for your ruins.

237
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,671
Uh, I mean,
not ruins. I mean,

238
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,274
we had no idea
that your people still...

239
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,642
Uh, that you were--

240
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,912
ah! Entertainment!

241
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,087
Honored guest,
please join fire dance.

242
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,860
Oh, uh, well, thank you.
But I am not much
of a dancer.

243
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,363
Not wise to dishonor chief.

244
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,436
This ought to be good.

245
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,871
Oh! Oh! Oh!

246
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,441
Oh! Oh! Oh!

247
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,211
Honored guest spoke truth.

248
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,812
Not good dancer.

249
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,951
(Gasps)

250
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,619
Chalice of life!

251
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,222
It is gone!

252
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,890
Chalice of life?

253
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,659
Muntab: Chalice!

254
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,864
Second muntab:
Where's the chalice?

255
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,439
Return it, now!

256
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,008
Uh, but I did not
take your chalice.

257
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,676
See?

258
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,213
Lies!

259
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,216
Hold on!

260
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,385
Jackie went through
that truth tunnel thing,
didn't he?

261
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,787
So he's pure
or something, right?

262
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,891
The young one is wise.

263
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,325
You betcha.

264
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,231
Smith.

265
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,834
Ugh. We are doomed.

266
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,403
What do you mean?

267
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,439
Chief: Chalice filled
with water from altar

268
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,141
gives muntabs
eternal life.

269
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,577
Stay young forever.

270
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,713
So, you weren't
kidding. 230?

271
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,249
I will be 231
next week.

272
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,418
Uh, happy birthday?

273
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,588
Without chalice,
we will grow old.

274
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,089
And Smith
will be immortal?

275
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,126
2,000 plus years
of obnoxiousness.
Yuck!

276
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,628
Jade!
You must gather
your warriors!

277
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,829
Smith couldn't
have gone far.

278
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,897
We'll stop him!

279
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,766
We already grow weak.

280
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,768
With no chalice
to refresh us,

281
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,303
we will perish
in the jungle.

282
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,672
It is too late.

283
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,608
Too late? Come on!
Where's that good
old muntab--

284
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,643
uh, I mean <i> young</i>
muntab spirit?

285
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,178
It's never too late.

286
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,748
You are so young,
yet speak with the wisdom
of an elder.

287
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,083
See, Jackie?

288
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,718
He won't even
let me have
my own cell phone.

289
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,119
Ugh! Jade!

290
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,700
(Both panting)

291
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:09,968
Jackie!

292
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,453
Everything I've
ever hoped for,
Larsen,

293
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,221
right here, right now.

294
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,322
Eternal youth!

295
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,291
Eternal life!

296
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,793
Perhaps you would
like me to sample
it first, sir?

297
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,495
To make sure
it's safe.

298
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,364
Oh, no, that won't
be necessary.

299
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,899
You don't think
I'd leave you out
of this,

300
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,301
do you, old friend?

301
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,970
After all your years
of faithful service?

302
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,438
Well, I had hoped--

303
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,008
Larsen, I want you
by my side

304
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,843
to serve me forever.

305
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,978
Oh, goodie.

306
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,296
Shake him off!

307
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,102
Whoa!

308
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,204
Ugh! Gah! Ugh!

309
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,372
Gaah!

310
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,540
Whoa!

311
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,110
Larsen, cut the ladder!

312
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,613
Is that really
necessary, sir?

313
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,416
What harm could he
possibly do you now?

314
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,650
Do it!

315
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,978
Well, don't just
sit there, Larsen.

316
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,413
Take the controls!

317
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,950
You're not stopping me, chan!

318
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,487
What did you do?!

319
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,855
Parachutes!

320
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,256
Oh, none for us, thanks.

321
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,592
You see, Larsen and I
are immortal now.

322
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,893
Want it?

323
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,367
Good-bye, Mr. chan.

324
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,837
Yaaah!

325
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,685
Ow! Unh! Unh!

326
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,553
Ow! Unh! Unh!

327
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,088
Ow! Ooh! Unh!

328
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,790
Ohh!

329
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,362
Guess what I caught?

330
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,240
My camera!
Completely ruined!

331
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,309
Well, that's it, Larsen.
I'm docking your wages
for 75 years.

332
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,644
Yes, sir.

333
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,250
(Gasps)

334
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,320
Abila?

335
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,488
Jade.

336
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,769
Thank you
for saving
my people.

337
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,472
You are brave
and generous.

338
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,008
As a wise, young chief
once told me,

339
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,843
generosity is not given,

340
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,378
it is earned.

341
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,183
Uh, Jackie,
that was Smith's map.

342
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,386
Yes. No one will ever
find the muntabs again.

343
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,789
Hello? How are we
supposed to find our way
back through the jungle?

344
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,426
Well, Larsen...

345
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,627
How do I look?

346
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,362
Very youthful, sir.

347
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,565
I think I need
to be changed.

348
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,633
Oh, goodie.

349
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,005
I am sure
this is the right way.

350
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,974
You said that
6 hours ago.

351
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,210
Of course, if I had
my own cell phone,

352
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,712
we could call
captain black
or a taxi or something.

353
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,447
This is really
not the time, Jade.

354
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,055
Hey, Jackie.

355
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,225
If you could have any wish
in the world, what would
you wish for?

356
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,526
Peace.

357
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:33,497
We already have so many
natural problems.

358
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,701
Earthquakes. Tornados. Hunger.

359
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,970
We've been killing
so many people.

360
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,906
So many fighting going on.

361
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,475
We don't need
human problems.

362
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,078
Really. I really need peace.
