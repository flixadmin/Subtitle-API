3
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:55,034
'Parashuram is the sixth avatar
of the Lord of the Universe.'

4
00:01:55,597 --> 00:02:00,216
'In Treta Yuga Parashuram went
around the Earth twenty one times'

5
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:04,300
'and ended irreligiousness
and won over this land'

6
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:06,966
'which he donated to Kashyap Prajapati.'

7
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,841
'Gods, serpents prayed to Him
to give them shelter in this land.'

8
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:20,175
'Then he threw the divine axe
given by Lord Shiva into the ocean.'

9
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:25,800
'The ocean went back and
a wonderful new land was created.'

10
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:29,758
'The minerals of the ocean
made the land fertile.'

11
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,258
'Medicinal plants which are rare
grew in that forest.'

12
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:43,341
'One of the seven immortals Parashuram
made the land his meditation ground.'

13
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:47,216
'The land is Parshuramkshetra.'

14
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:50,925
'A miracle was noticed in that land.'

15
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,957
'The immensely powerful temple of
Lord Shiva that appeared on that land.'

16
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,425
Got scared?

17
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,425
Grandpa, do spirits exist?

18
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:43,966
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.

19
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:48,508
Then you must believe in spirits.

20
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:52,633
How did spirits come in the temple
where God exists?

21
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,675
This is miracle.

22
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:58,883
You won't understand these miracles
if you think rationally.

23
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,466
You'll understand them if you feel them.

24
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,591
Why did you shut this powerful temple?

25
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:09,508
There's an unheard and unsung story
of this temple.

26
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:15,508
'From the banks of the ocean
few miles into the forest'

27
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:21,300
'appeared the powerful Shivalinga
which would protect us.'

28
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:29,333
'The place where holy Mother Ganges
continuously anoints Lord Shiva.'

29
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,758
There was a time when
the walls reverberated

30
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,925
with the sound of drums,
music, holy chants.

31
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:44,175
When any person leaves for heavenly abode
of Lord Shiva before time

32
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:51,133
the spirit resides on this Earth for ten
days until the final rites are performed.

33
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:55,383
The wish of the spirit can be fulfilled
within ten days

34
00:04:55,466 --> 00:05:00,008
but it should be a righteous wish.

35
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,782
The fulfillment of the wish
depends on their actions.

36
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:15,175
If any family member of the deceased
worships the Lord from heart

37
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:19,591
the spirit of the dead person
enters the person

38
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,841
and the spirit fulfills his last wish.

39
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:29,557
Five decades back a son worshipped
Neelkanth Lord Shiva

40
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:33,765
'to fulfill the last wish
of his deceased father.'

41
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:40,258
'He was possessed by his father's spirit.'

42
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:47,508
'He killed his maternal uncle
who poisoned him.'

43
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:50,258
'People who witnessed
this incident were terrified.'

44
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:54,446
'The officers who investigated the case
were surprised and in dilemma.'

45
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:59,758
'It was not the son but the
father's spirit that killed the victim.'

46
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,216
'The main priest gave
this explanation and said'

47
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:08,091
'they couldn't ignore the belief
that was prevalent for ages.'

48
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:12,591
'So, the temple would remain closed
till the truth is revealed.'

49
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,800
'It was a legal decision.'

50
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:23,300
Since that day till now
the abhiseka of Lord Shiva

51
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,008
didn't stop despite the idol
not being worshipped.

52
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,925
The faith of the devotees didn't waver.

53
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:38,675
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

54
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:43,216
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

55
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:48,008
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

56
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,925
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

57
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,675
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

58
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,341
We've been here for a long time.

59
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,300
Why did he force us to come here?

60
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,008
He could've called us to the
police station for interrogation.

61
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,133
Why did he call us here?

62
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:09,591
What does he think?

63
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,591
Who does he think he is?

64
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:15,300
I could've called you at the
police station for interrogation.

65
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:20,008
But there's no guarantee that
you can go back home safely after that.

66
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,633
Sir, what's our mistake?

67
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,716
We are honest businessmen
who deal in petrol.

68
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,425
Two trucks are loaded
from the factory every time.

69
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:30,841
Those trucks are unloaded in your pumps.

70
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:37,925
How can a third truck pass the
check-post with the same permit?

71
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,050
The third truck doesn't belong to us.

72
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:52,800
But if I tell you whose truck it is
then I'll find my daughter dead, sir.

73
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:57,550
If you give me your complaint in writing,
I'll ensure you go back home safely.

74
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,425
Come out.

75
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:39,925
Bhavani!

76
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:45,883
Boss, please forgive us.

77
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:52,175
I would've spared him
if he interfered in my business.

78
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:55,627
But that tanker is my life.

79
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,550
Whoever messes with it won't be alive.

80
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:26,383
You must face the son
before you touch the father.

81
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,008
Rudra is always there
to protect Bhavani.

82
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,675
Don't you know that?

83
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,591
- Madam, please give me a cup of tea.
- Yes, please have a seat.

84
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,466
Let's go to a parlour for an hour.

85
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,675
- Massage parlour.
- Boss...

86
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,925
Excuse me. Please sit there.

87
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,216
Why is she staring at us?

88
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,462
- What if she doesn't offer free tea?
- We'll have coffee.

89
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:56,550
Boss, what is she doing?

90
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:57,550
Let's go from here.

91
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,091
She's cleaning the seat for us.

92
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,258
Be positive especially
when you are negative.

93
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,591
Shameless fellow!

94
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,800
Auntie, one tea.

95
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:14,466
Sorry, I've run out of milk.

96
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,258
Did the milkman forget to deliver
or did the buffalo run out of milk?

97
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,675
I don't have milk as you
didn't pay your dues.

98
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:22,216
You come to my stall daily
and gorge on biscuits.

99
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,258
You always have tea and coffee here.

100
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,300
Am I doing this for charity?

101
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,258
Worthless.

102
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,133
Did I ever condemn you
by saying such things?

103
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:29,966
You've said a lot.

104
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,133
- I've actually run out of milk today.
- Oh!

105
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:33,841
Sir, tea.

106
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,508
Milk tea.

107
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:36,800
How did she give him tea?

108
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:40,133
Hot samosas for you, have it.

109
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,425
Thank you.

110
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,050
Missing boy.

111
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,633
The newspaper is backdated.

112
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:47,508
Your name shouldn't have been Suvarna
but ominous lady.

113
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,716
Dial this number.

114
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,133
Hello.

115
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,508
Your son was missing. Right?

116
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:54,800
Yes, he was but we've found him.

117
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,633
Oh no! He has been found.

118
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,466
Boss, his son was found.

119
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,091
Pack your bags, we're going to the city.

120
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,883
Hi! I'm one and only Satish.

121
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,091
My name is also Satish.

122
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,758
But he doesn't have a son like you do.

123
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,758
If that's the problem
then visit a sexologist.

124
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:19,800
Why did you come to me?

125
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:22,175
We're sincere citizens
looking for your son.

126
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,591
Oh! Thank you.

127
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,091
I found my son one week after
this advertisement was given.

128
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,175
Why didn't you inform that?

129
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,566
What?

130
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:29,925
You published the missing report.

131
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:30,883
You should inform people
after he is found. Right?

132
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:31,966
You don't have any basic ethics?

133
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,425
- What?
- What's your problem?

134
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:37,550
We wake up early in the morning
and spend our money to search him.

135
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:38,800
Did you ask me before doing this?

136
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,925
Really?

137
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:42,258
There are other people doing the same.

138
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:43,550
Shall I call them?

139
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,550
What can I do about it?

140
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:48,050
Do you know the amount of time
and money my boss invested in this?

141
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,008
Well... time spent won't come back.

142
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,966
- But we can get back the money, right?
- Right.

143
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:57,133
- No... no...
- So, you don't want the money?

144
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,716
Cross the threshold
and then give the money.

145
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,951
Money makes money.

146
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:04,008
It's a small amount, please manage.

147
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,841
- Already taken.
- Here it is.

148
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,175
I'll publish the news that
my son has been found tomorrow.

149
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:13,925
He has understood it very fast.

150
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,008
Boss, how do you get such unique ideas?

151
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:20,550
When you run out of luck and money
you get such ideas naturally.

152
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:23,716
'The bus travelling from Bangalore
to Anantapur met with a serious accident'

153
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,008
'at Anantapur Ghat road.'

154
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:30,508
'The driver along with
all the passengers died on spot.'

155
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,550
'The relatives are mourning
at Anantapur Memorial Hospital'

156
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,383
'in front of the bodies of the victims.'

157
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:43,466
'The bus owner has promised
a compensation of 10 lakhs to each victim.'

158
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:44,883
We've to go there and mourn.

159
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:45,966
Where?

160
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:55,133
Come on, find.

161
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:56,466
What?

162
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:57,508
One unclaimed body.

163
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,716
Why do you want an unclaimed dead body?

164
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,216
- Because you can cry.
- I?

165
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,508
What happened to you?

166
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:09,175
Both numbers 14 and 15 seem
to be unclaimed dead bodies.

167
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:12,133
14.

168
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,216
Stop.

169
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:17,383
I guess the relative has gone
to smoke or have tea.

170
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:20,383
They can leave the body alone
but can't give up their vices.

171
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,550
- Let's wait for some time.
- Okay, boss.

172
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:23,300
- Is he your husband?
- No.

173
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:24,508
Okay, go.

174
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:26,466
This is your husband.
Go and mourn his death.

175
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:27,966
- What happened...
- Wait.

176
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,341
You should look messy and sad
before you start mourning.

177
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,300
- Come on, go.
- Look what has happened.

178
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:37,258
- Look what has happened.
- Why did you leave us and go?

179
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:41,425
Did you give him loan
that you're mourning so loudly?

180
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:42,567
You carry on.

181
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,341
We're very sad.

182
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,133
I'm also very sad.

183
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:49,383
I couldn't tolerate the stench,
so I went and had few drinks.

184
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,675
- Do you suspect me?
- No.

185
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:53,300
But I suspect you.

186
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,508
The word 'fraud' is written
on your t-shirt.

187
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,133
That's 'Ford', idiot.

188
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,633
I don't care what it is.

189
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,966
If the victim is your brother then
tell me where he has moles on his body.

190
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,966
My brother is not a lady
that he'll wear sari.

191
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,258
He used to wear lungi,
that too high-waist.

192
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:12,800
If you claim that he is your brother
but can't say where he had moles

193
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:15,300
then how can I believe you?

194
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,258
We are mourning our brother's death.

195
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,966
And all you're bothered about
is moles on his body.

196
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:22,629
Jackson, pay him for his drinks
and tell him to go.

197
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,383
Oh no, my sister-in-law.

198
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:27,508
My sister-in-law has fainted.

199
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:28,258
Come on, write down the details quickly.

200
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:30,175
Okay, I will. She'll get up.

201
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,591
She'll get up soon.

202
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:34,258
Look, she has come back
into her senses.

203
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,425
Come on, go now.

204
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:37,550
Here's the cheque of 10 lakhs.

205
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,758
You can't bring back
my brother's life with this money.

206
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:41,841
So, you don't want the money?

207
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,814
I don't want it but
my sister-in-law needs it.

208
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,591
She'll have to stitch clothes
and earn for us.

209
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,925
Please leave me.

210
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:48,383
She's my sister-in-law.

211
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:49,175
It's the fact.

212
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:50,091
Bye, sir.

213
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:51,425
- Hey!
- Who is it?

214
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:53,758
- What do you want?
- Who will take the dead body?

215
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:55,800
Come on, start crying.

216
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,550
Look, we've got 10 lakhs.

217
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,883
- Wow!
- Pour some more, boss.

218
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,133
You are too much.

219
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:09,112
Boss...

220
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:25,800
Brother, I'm sure we share some relation
or how would we get 10 lakhs.

221
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:30,008
I can do anything for you.

222
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,800
Whatever you wish.

223
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,425
But I don't know who you are.

224
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,841
I'm drinking as I can't do
anything for you.

225
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,716
I would've done if I could.

226
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,008
I swear I would've done anything.

227
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:47,258
I swear on my mother,
I would've done it.

228
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,295
- Jackson...
- Yes?

229
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:56,841
I hope there are no tigers here.

230
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:59,100
Save the tigers.

231
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,675
Who is it?

232
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,258
Boss, shut up!

233
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:24,175
Lord Shiva, when a daughter is angry
she goes to her mother

234
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,591
and when she's upset
she goes to her father.

235
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:30,716
My husband was an honest police officer.

236
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,466
He died in an accident.

237
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:40,843
Nobody found his dead body till now.

238
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:44,550
Whenever I visualize
my husband's cheerful face

239
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,050
I fail to bear this trauma.

240
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,591
He was my sole support.

241
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:51,758
But he was snatched away from me.

242
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:57,175
Now you'll take incarnation and come
or send your representative.

243
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:00,383
But you'll help your daughter
to get justice.

244
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:06,425
If you actually exist then come
in any form to save religion.

245
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:13,302
The savior will definitely come some day.

246
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:19,341
He'll deceive death.

247
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,508
"Hey Bhimaa!"

248
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,508
He'll vanquish evil and
rule over hearts of people.

249
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:27,216
"Hey Bhimaa!"

250
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,841
He'll come riding the Nandi bull
like an incarnation of Lord Shiva.

251
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,922
He will definitely come.

252
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:51,050
"Hey Bhimaa!"

253
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,216
"Hey Bhimaa!"

254
00:17:58,383 --> 00:17:59,466
"Hey Bhimaa!"

255
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,675
Who is he?

256
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,341
He has come riding a bull
like Lord Shiva.

257
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:08,175
I don't think so.

258
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,508
I guess he's an actor of some theatre group
who has come for some funds.

259
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,008
Hunter, give him some coins
and tell him to go.

260
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:16,050
Take this.

261
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,314
Hail Lord Shiva!

262
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:32,508
This is a special view.

263
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,175
Did you see Lord Shiva?

264
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,151
O Lord!

265
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:43,925
Do you think you're God
just because you thrashed one guy?

266
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:45,341
Come on, hit me. Let me see.

267
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:52,050
Don't cheat...
come before me and then fight.

268
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,675
He is over there and not here. Look.

269
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,800
He's not God, he's a policeman.

270
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,508
Correct answer.

271
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,716
Policeman.

272
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,175
You won't get what you want.

273
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:09,591
- I've an offer for you.
- Offer?

274
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:11,966
An offer to kill a policeman.

275
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,466
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

276
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,341
Hey... hey...

277
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,175
Why are you celebrating like wild animals?

278
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,258
Listen to the rules.

279
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,050
- Are there rules too?
- Yes.

280
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:24,300
The number of alphabets in your name
is the number of times you can hit me.

281
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:30,633
If you miss one,
I'll get the chance to punch you.

282
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,764
No case. No lock-up.

283
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,633
The wise will take up the opportunity

284
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,341
while the foolish will sit and wonder.

285
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:40,091
There are only two alphabets in his name.

286
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:41,800
Can he hit you only twice?

287
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,758
He's the goon of a particular region.

288
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,091
A goon doesn't have identity
without his territory.

289
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,883
There are six alphabets. Right?

290
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,591
You know everything, Lord.

291
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:50,841
Shut up!

292
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:51,508
You come.

293
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,758
I never miss my target.

294
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,008
I also don't miss my target.

295
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:13,550
Is this your hand or a hammer?

296
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:16,133
Check the damage and guess the power.

297
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,966
He has only one alphabet...
no other name.

298
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:21,175
One alphabet, one punch.

299
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:24,050
Shrinivas Ramanuj Parbrahma Yadav.

300
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:25,216
His ration card has a longer name.

301
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,758
Lucky guy. Fifteen punches. Come.

302
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,550
He is over there.

303
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,633
You should've hit harder and
water would've come out from underground.

304
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:49,300
My dear devotee,
water has already come out of underground.

305
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:50,310
That's enough.

306
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,008
Bonitas!

307
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,466
It's not an abusive word.

308
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,133
In Spanish it means beautiful lady.

309
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,383
Oh! Thank you.

310
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,428
Get tea for me. Please.

311
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:02,508
Sugar?

312
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,883
He doesn't need sugar.

313
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,383
He has a sweet smile. Let's go.

314
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:10,341
Boss, I guess you've
lot of women followers.

315
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,675
I won't tell you my name.
I'll come and directly kill you.

316
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,008
"Hey Bhimaa!"

317
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,091
"Hey Bhimaa!"

318
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,800
"Hey Bhimaa!"

319
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,258
"Hey Bhimaa!"

320
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:20,633
"Hey Bhimaa!"

321
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,883
"Hey Bhimaa!"

322
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,008
"Hey Bhimaa!"

323
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,216
"Hey Bhimaa!"

324
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:32,258
"Hey Bhimaa!"

325
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,133
"Hey Bhimaa!"

326
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:56,383
"Hey Bhimaa!"

327
00:22:58,008 --> 00:22:59,175
O Lord!

328
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,716
Where is Bhavani who thinks
he's the only man on Earth?

329
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,091
His father is here.
Won't he meet me?

330
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,050
Why are you looking at me like this?

331
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,966
Did I thrash him while fighting?

332
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:14,591
There's a problem.
Where did the culprit escape?

333
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,966
Is this old man Bhavani?

334
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,175
I swear.

335
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:24,341
I swear on my mother.

336
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:25,175
Oh no!

337
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:29,300
I thought Bhavani is a wild creature
who wreaks havoc in the jungle.

338
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,008
But he turned out to be timid one.

339
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:34,008
Grandpa, is this true? Are you Bhavani?

340
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:35,550
Oh no!

341
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:41,008
What kind of joke is this?

342
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:42,216
How can I hit you?

343
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,425
You'll die if I sneeze.

344
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,091
You don't know my problem, old man.

345
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,258
I'm Bhavani.

346
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:50,550
I'll listen to your details later,
you listen to me first.

347
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,341
Old man, listen to me.

348
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,175
Whenever I'm posted at a new place

349
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:58,466
I do my job in half-day's time
and get transferred.

350
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:00,800
So, I requested the commissioner.

351
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:02,091
He told me that you're a dangerous man.

352
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,341
He said I wouldn't be able
to solve this case.

353
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:04,883
He shared these details
and sent me here.

354
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,133
But what did I see after coming here?

355
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:07,633
The entire matter was solved
in an hour's time.

356
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,966
If the commissioner finds out

357
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,925
then he'll transfer me
to some other place immediately.

358
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,987
I didn't open the zip till now...

359
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:15,050
of my bag.

360
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,466
I know you thought something else.

361
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,069
Pervert Bhavani!

362
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:23,716
Bhavani, give me an idea
so that I can stay back here.

363
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:24,800
Idea?

364
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:27,800
Tea for you.

365
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,175
- Got it.
- What did you get?

366
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:30,633
Idea!

367
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,425
What if you suffer
a heart attack right now?

368
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:33,258
Oh no!

369
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:36,091
What if you suffer it after a month?

370
00:24:36,363 --> 00:24:37,657
Thank god!

371
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:41,675
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

372
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:45,300
If you delay the sorrow,
its impact decreases.

373
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:47,133
Listen, old man.

374
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:50,175
I've an offer for you.
I won't arrest you right now.

375
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,383
I'll spend a month long vacation here.

376
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:56,683
You can watch television,
go shopping with your family,

377
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:02,633
attend weddings, go to discos and pubs,
tell stories to your grandchildren...

378
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:04,216
then just carry on and do it, old man.

379
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,841
But there's a small change in the story.

380
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:09,800
Tell your granddaughter that the prince
won't come riding a horse this time.

381
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,747
He'll come on a bull.

382
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,550
If anybody disturbs me during my vacation,
I'll ensure to take out an entourage.

383
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:18,633
- Hey!
- Shut up!

384
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,883
Come and go behind the bars
after a month.

385
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:24,008
Or you won't be able to get up.

386
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:27,508
Bonita, thank you for your hospitality.

387
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:42,466
Sir, why did you come here
instead of going to the police station?

388
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,560
Why did you come here?

389
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,341
- To put this garland on you.
- Then go ahead and do it.

390
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:47,300
- Sir, what have you done?
- Why have you come here?

391
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:48,633
- To play the drum.
- Then play it.

392
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,216
Didn't you bring cheer girls with you?

393
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,216
- What? Cheer girls?
- Yes.

394
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:55,466
Sir, you've big demands.

395
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,841
But my budget is limited.

396
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:59,175
- Please adjust with Chintamani this time.
- Who is that?

397
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,011
Look behind.

398
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,883
So, you are Mani. Come, Mani.

399
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,591
Why did you stop?
Keep playing.

400
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,383
- Lord...
- Yes.

401
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,966
You asked our names
and then thrashed us

402
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,300
but you didn't tell your name.

403
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:17,123
A smart poet has written a song for me
for situations like this

404
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:18,591
on audience demand.

405
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:19,841
My title song.

406
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,966
All the rights are reserved by me.

407
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:55,758
"Play the drums and the
band on streets and lanes."

408
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:59,716
"Our carefree boss is here."

409
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:11,466
"He has great attitude.
Move aside."

410
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,300
"Bhimaa moves around
with temper and attitude."

411
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,008
"Remain silent"

412
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,925
"Or he'll get violent."

413
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:30,418
"If you do anything wrong.
He'll set things on fire."

414
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:32,758
"Don't question him."

415
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:34,716
"There's no doubt he's awesome."

416
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,367
"He has confused everybody.
Bhimaa is here."

417
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:04,258
I don't drink quarter, I drink water.

418
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:28,841
"He's strong. He's powerful."

419
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,658
"He's quiet, but he's a monster."

420
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:36,373
"He is powerful."

421
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,591
"He's trending."

422
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,469
"He's super."

423
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,466
"People are scared of him."

424
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,341
"He'll crush anyone."

425
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,341
"He's everybody's protector."

426
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,258
"He's awesome."

427
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:51,925
"Anybody who challenges him
will be vanquished."

428
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:55,966
"You can try but not overpower him."

429
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:59,800
"Play the drums and the
band on streets and lanes."

430
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:03,758
"Our carefree boss is here."

431
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:07,591
"He has great attitude.
Move aside."

432
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:11,341
"Bhimaa moves around
with temper and attitude."

433
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,466
"Remain silent"

434
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,633
"Or he'll get violent."

435
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:19,216
"If you do anything wrong.
He'll set things on fire."

436
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,425
"Don't question him."

437
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:23,383
"There's no doubt he's awesome."

438
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:26,966
"He has confused everybody.
Bhimaa is here."

439
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,300
Sir... sir... what are you doing?

440
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:40,466
This pump is illegal.
Shut it down.

441
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,008
Are you a rowdy or a police officer?

442
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:43,425
No doubt about it.

443
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:44,597
Rowdy police.

444
00:29:50,341 --> 00:29:54,175
Dad, I heard the new SI came home
and threatened you.

445
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,675
I'll give him a befitting reply

446
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:59,383
I'll ensure he becomes your slave
and salutes you day and night.

447
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,341
Forget him.

448
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,758
Do you know how important
the work you're doing is?

449
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:07,800
Finish the task first, my son.

450
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:13,216
In the meantime,
I'll infuriate the fire of revenge.

451
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:18,300
Come back and burn him
into ashes with the fire.

452
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Boss, you can use your connections

453
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:26,050
and get Bhimaa transferred
immediately, right?

454
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,716
Didn't you hear what he said?

455
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,050
He's used to getting transferred.

456
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:36,425
If I do the same,
how will he feel the pain.

457
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:38,675
After Rudra's arrival

458
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:43,300
the way he insulted me
before the entire village

459
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:48,008
I'll make sure he comes
to my feet and apologizes.

460
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:50,300
I'll make him rub his nose on the ground.

461
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:53,918
Till then let him do what he wants.

462
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:36,341
Mic testing. One. Two. Three.

463
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:38,841
What is he up to?
Is he planning to start a new drama?

464
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:40,175
Brothers and their sisters.

465
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:41,091
Sir, you're a handsome man.

466
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:42,803
The ladies won't pay attention
if you address them as sisters.

467
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:44,716
You are right. I forgot.
Hold on.

468
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,925
The old man in the corner.

469
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,841
Alcoholic Pandu who
puts up posters on walls.

470
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:54,258
Beautiful Kanta and Kanta Rao
who always stares at her.

471
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,925
Listen. Listen. Listen.

472
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:57,966
- My name is Bhimaa.
- So, your name is Bhimaa?

473
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,883
Where is your mace?

474
00:31:58,966 --> 00:32:01,300
Somebody wanted to see the demo
how I got the mace.

475
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:03,175
- Do you want to see it?
- Forget it.

476
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:06,175
- I've an offer for all of you
- Offer?

477
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:11,383
If you lose anything, come to the
police station and file your complaint.

478
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,508
The policemen will loot us if we go there.

479
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:16,216
- We don't trust the police.
- Right.

480
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:22,383
You don't have to trust me.
Sit and lick a lemon.

481
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:23,091
What?

482
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,591
Rest of you can come to
the police station and take cash

483
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:26,925
in the place of your stolen goods.

484
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:29,633
Will you pay us in cash
for our stolen goods?

485
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:30,286
Hmm.

486
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,591
What is this?

487
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:36,008
We rob people but he
wants to give them money.

488
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:37,550
So, you'll give us cash
for the stolen goods.

489
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:39,341
I won't bring back your missing wife.

490
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,633
- I won't complain about it.
- He is right.

491
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:43,425
If you do so,
I'll put you behind the bars.

492
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:48,883
If anybody lodges false complaints
I'll thrash them badly.

493
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,800
This offer starts from today
and will be valid

494
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:54,258
till I'm posted here
only for your well-being.

495
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:55,702
Take advantage of the offer.

496
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:58,341
Come on, applaud. Louder.

497
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:10,175
Sir, I've heard you give cash
in return of stolen goods.

498
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:12,591
Mr. Rao, we've got a customer.
Attend him.

499
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:14,716
What's wrong with him?
He's talking like us.

500
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:16,466
Yes, tell me.

501
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,300
My wallet was stolen from Geetanagar,
bus number 12.

502
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,591
- So, it's a case of pick-pocketing.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,591
The thief has no mercy.

504
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:28,091
- Did you get what I said?
- Yes, I have understood.

505
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,716
Mr. Old Boy, how much money
did you have in the wallet?

506
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,050
10,000 sir.

507
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,091
- 10,000?
- Yes, sir.

508
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:36,883
- Mr. Rao...
- Yes, sir.

509
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,550
Write down 10,500.

510
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,925
Why?

511
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:42,008
I'm sure this old boy
will buy a new wallet.

512
00:33:42,091 --> 00:33:43,425
Thank you, sir.

513
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,758
- Note down, sir.
- I'm writing down.

514
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:46,966
Write down about the new wallet.

515
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,841
- I'll note it down, sir.
- Okay, sir.

516
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:49,966
Sir...

517
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:52,175
Oh! I forgot.

518
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:53,466
Manju...

519
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:56,216
The audience is waiting for your entry.

520
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,883
I'll hit you if you come in slow motion.

521
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,550
Boss, how can I help?

522
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,216
Settle the dues of old boy
with your golden hands.

523
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,508
We've lot of money.

524
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:14,758
Take this. It's a small amount.

525
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:16,925
Take it. Profit.

526
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,258
Mr. Rao, call your juniors
and take my autograph.

527
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:24,841
- Why?
- Do I need to explain?

528
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:26,425
Boss... will you tell them or shall I...

529
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:28,966
- We need witness for this settlement.
- Okay.

530
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,466
We'll do it. Sign here.

531
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:34,966
Mr. Rao, you took 10,500 rupees from me.

532
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,341
You'll return it next week
along with interest. The due is 15500.

533
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:42,383
You've signed the paper and
agreed to it in front of witnesses.

534
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:43,841
Thank you for this.

535
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:45,591
- Sir...
- What is this, sir?

536
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:46,466
What is this, sir?

537
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,300
Will you pay a mechanic
if he doesn't repair your vehicle?

538
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:53,258
Will you pay a doctor
if he doesn't treat you?

539
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:57,925
Why shall I pay the police officers
who don't do their job?

540
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:00,591
Don't you feel ashamed?

541
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,091
You've stopped feeling ashamed long back.

542
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:06,591
You treat people who come
to file complaints as your customers.

543
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:10,341
We may not be able to help them
but we should do our work honestly.

544
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:12,383
After all,
it's a petty case of pickpocket.

545
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:16,175
Pickpocket? Pickpocket, huh?

546
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:23,149
If a middle-class man's
hard earned money is stolen...

547
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,861
If he fails to pay
all his utility bills on time...

548
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,800
If he runs out of money...

549
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,758
Do you know how it feels?

550
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:36,425
When he takes money from money-lenders
and is unable to pay back...

551
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:38,800
...the money-lender comes home
and humiliates the women of the house.

552
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,383
Do you know how it feels?

553
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:43,550
The person feels humiliated.

554
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:46,508
For you, it's a petty case of pickpocket.

555
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:49,883
When rich men are robbed or banks
are looted it's considered significant.

556
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,050
If a poor man gets robbed
it's considered a petty case.

557
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:55,633
We don't offer service according to
the financial status of complainants.

558
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:59,258
Public service is a serious duty.

559
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:03,302
Police service is a
damn serious responsibility.

560
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:08,800
An ordinary man feels half-dead
when he loses his hard-earned money.

561
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,008
People who take bribe from helpless people

562
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:14,216
instead of giving them justice are devils.

563
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,300
If you're interested in catching thieves
and recovering stolen goods,

564
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,300
only then you'll get salary.

565
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:26,300
If you fail, I'll take the stolen money
along with interest from you.

566
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:30,716
- Did you get it?
- Yes, understood.

567
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:33,425
Mr. Rao, I'm sure it's Ranga
as the theft took place in 12B.

568
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:34,675
I'll get the wallet from him.

569
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:35,925
Please make sir wait here
until I come back.

570
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:37,633
Sir, please stay here.
I'll be right back.

571
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:39,568
Sir, stay here. I'll be back soon.

572
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,966
Ranga. Ranga.

573
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,966
Sir...

574
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:48,508
- Why are you hiding here?
- I'll send your commission in the evening.

575
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:50,216
I don't want commission.

576
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:53,508
The new SI has planned a new mission.

577
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:56,008
Where is the wallet that
you stole from bus number 12 B?

578
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,216
- It's inside my loincloth.
- Oh!

579
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,633
No... no... it's not in this loincloth.
It's in the other one.

580
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,383
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

581
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,550
You confuse me a lot.
Go and get it quickly. - Yes.

582
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:05,550
From how many buses did
you steal all these wallets?

583
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:06,550
It's from only one bus.

584
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:07,883
- From only one bus?
- Yes.

585
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:10,091
You're not an ordinary thief.
What is this?

586
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:13,550
How did you steal a nose
ring from somebody's nose?

587
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:15,258
There was a young couple in the bus.

588
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:17,008
They were busy with their phones.

589
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:19,675
- I took advantage of it.
- You're a thief by birth.

590
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,133
Where is his wallet?

591
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,133
There's money in this one.
I'm sure this is his wallet.

592
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:24,550
- Okay, take it.
- I've found the wallet.

593
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:26,091
- Thank you. Bye.
- Okay.

594
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:28,008
What if anybody else
comes to file a complaint?

595
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:30,466
- Listen...
- I want this whole bundle. Got it?

596
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,300
Only this one. Right?

597
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:33,800
Only this one?

598
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,716
How many bundles do you have?

599
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:37,383
- Sir...
- Yes?

600
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:38,341
My loincloths?

601
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,216
I'll wash them and send them back.

602
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,716
Shut up, baldy.

603
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,425
Sir!

604
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:45,383
Sir, I'm here.
Sir, I've come.

605
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,008
- I've got the wallet.
- Oh god!

606
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:50,153
One complaint and we've
the robber's treasure here.

607
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:54,966
Here it is.

608
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,841
Here is his wallet. Take it, sir.

609
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,425
Sir, money.

610
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:01,758
Sir, take it.

611
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:03,050
- Brother, the paper.
- I've it.

612
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:04,050
Look.

613
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:10,258
Sir! somebody stole my slippers
worth thousands from the temple.

614
00:38:10,341 --> 00:38:13,133
Keep quiet.
We'll handle this case.

615
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:14,675
Put the table outside.

616
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:18,050
If he comes inside we'll be in trouble.
This man will loot us.

617
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,175
Listen... listen...

618
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,716
If you wish to file a complaint, you don't
have to come inside the police station.

619
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,383
You can file your complaint
outside the police station.

620
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:27,133
- Stand in queue.
- Boss, you are great.

621
00:38:27,216 --> 00:38:30,550
You've done a great job.

622
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:33,466
- You're so smart.
- I haven't used my brain yet.

623
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:37,383
- I'm in a vacation mood.
- Oh great! Fantastic, boss.

624
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,883
Sir, special tea for you.

625
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:44,258
- In which school do you study?
- Study?

626
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,925
They don't teach us anything
in government schools.

627
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:48,216
I can't afford to go to private school.

628
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:49,591
I'm an orphan, sir.

629
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,675
I survive by selling tea.

630
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:53,550
Boy, get two cups of tea for us.

631
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:54,383
Coming, sir.

632
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:57,633
- What is your name?
- Rama.

633
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:01,050
- Bye, brother.
- Stop!

634
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:03,675
- What did you say?
- Bye, brother.

635
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,258
'Hey! Call me brother.'

636
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,466
Call me brother once again.

637
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,925
- Brother.
- 'I know you'll never say it.'

638
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:18,008
Say it again.

639
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:19,342
Brother.

640
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:22,841
'One day you'll call me brother.'

641
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,133
- Mr. Rao...
- Yes?

642
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:14,550
- Please find out.
- What?

643
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:16,798
- Her details.
- Okay.

644
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,550
Understood, sir.

645
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:32,300
What are you looking at?

646
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:34,175
I want an information, Grandpa.

647
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:37,591
- Why did you address me as Grandpa?
- You don't look physically stable.

648
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:38,675
You're not young.

649
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:41,508
You are right.

650
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,675
What do you want?

651
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:45,133
I want to meet the best goon in town.

652
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:48,133
People come here to file
complaints against goons.

653
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:50,216
You want to meet a goon.
But why? Tell me.

654
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:52,341
I'll share my complaint with the goon.

655
00:40:53,008 --> 00:40:53,955
Why?

656
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:57,425
Whenever you approach a goon for work,
they take money.

657
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,591
They do the task sincerely.

658
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,966
If you go to the police for help, they
ask for bribe before filing complaint.

659
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:06,008
They want more money
during the follow-up.

660
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:08,383
There's no guarantee
that your work will be done.

661
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,050
They don't have any fixed rate.

662
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:13,883
You've exposed the policeman
with your straightforward words.

663
00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:15,716
- That's great.
- This is how I am.

664
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,008
- I don't shy from telling the truth.
- Understood.

665
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:20,133
Who is the best goon in town?
Come on, tell me.

666
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:22,883
There's only one goon in this area.

667
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:26,008
The others have taken
voluntary retirement and left.

668
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:26,800
Who is he?

669
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:30,175
The best goon in town is our sir Bhimaa.

670
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,091
My name is Vidya.

671
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,966
- You are very cute.
- What?

672
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:41,008
I mean... her name.

673
00:41:41,925 --> 00:41:43,508
I am also beautiful.

674
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:45,841
Hey... it's a compliment
and not complaint.

675
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:46,758
No, it's a complaint.

676
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:49,591
A guy named Romeo is after me
and wants to marry me.

677
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,175
Did you accept his proposal?

678
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,050
Oh no! No!
I didn't accept his proposal.

679
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,091
He threatened to throw acid at me
if I rejected him.

680
00:41:57,175 --> 00:41:58,925
Acid? I'll pour acid inside his pants.

681
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:02,091
Do it, but right now I need a bodyguard.

682
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:03,841
So, your body needs a guard. Right?

683
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:04,758
What did you say?

684
00:42:04,841 --> 00:42:08,383
Sir is saying that he's
our sole guard and protector.

685
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:10,591
I think you're his personal assistant.

686
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:12,425
You're continuously singing praises of him
since I came here.

687
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:15,050
- It's our duty, ma'am.
- Did you hear it?

688
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,008
I can see it clearly.

689
00:42:18,258 --> 00:42:19,716
Tell me how much you'll charge.

690
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,258
I won't let you increase the amount later.

691
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:23,925
- For what?
- To guard her body.

692
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,258
I won't charge anything for it.

693
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:28,383
Grandpa, I told you that
you can't rely in the police.

694
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:30,800
Sir, madam has already made her decision.

695
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,216
Don't hurt her feelings.

696
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,550
5000.

697
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:34,758
5000 rupees?

698
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:35,966
Won't you offer any discount?

699
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,841
We're not offering
any sale or discount here.

700
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:41,925
- Keep this money as advance.
- For what?

701
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:44,258
This advance is for me.
You attend to her problem.

702
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:11,508
Sir, the jeep is ready.

703
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,800
Sorry, sir. The tyres went flat just now.

704
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,466
Sir, take the bike.

705
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,800
You've made sure everybody in
the police station follows you blindly.

706
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,675
- The entire city.
- Okay, let's go.

707
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:43,175
Excuse me.

708
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,133
- Your phone number?
- I won't share it.

709
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:49,758
You'll be at my service
whenever I call you.

710
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:52,050
So, I'll call you.

711
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:55,008
These men start flirting
whenever they get a chance.

712
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,050
Give me one chance.

713
00:43:57,258 --> 00:43:58,800
Look at her gait.

714
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:21,341
- Babu Rao...
- No sir, I'm Kutumb Rao.

715
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,883
- It's okay, Babu Rao.
- Okay, sir.

716
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:29,383
Oh! You want to know about madam?

717
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:33,841
She's a temporary teacher
and is pursuing her PhD in botany.

718
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:37,300
- Strict teacher and a good student.
- Good.

719
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:42,050
Why are you doing research
on plants and trees

720
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:44,258
when you should be romancing in gardens.

721
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:45,341
Sir...

722
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:47,675
Okay, sir.

723
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:50,175
I need to impress her.

724
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:31,383
"Hail lord Shiva!"

725
00:45:33,008 --> 00:45:34,758
We were waiting for you.

726
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:39,826
"Hail lord Shiva!"

727
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,800
Sir, you're playing with the globe?

728
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:46,922
Stop overthinking, Mr. Rao.

729
00:46:49,175 --> 00:46:49,841
Hello.

730
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:51,216
- Is the security there?
- Yes.

731
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,716
- Security.
- Hey...

732
00:46:53,133 --> 00:46:55,300
Sir, madam has called.

733
00:46:55,475 --> 00:46:56,106
Oh!

734
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:58,008
Hello.

735
00:46:58,091 --> 00:46:59,508
- Security...
- Yes?

736
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,550
The Romeo is standing in my
school's corridor with an acid bottle.

737
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:05,466
Keep him busy, I'm coming.

738
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,789
Come on, boys.
Boys, come on.

739
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:11,758
Drive faster.

740
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:13,258
Oh no! The police have come.

741
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:14,675
I'll deal with you later.

742
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:16,841
Hey Romeo, stop.

743
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,644
Get him.

744
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:29,258
So many of you are
trying to catch one man.

745
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,883
What's this overacting for?

746
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,258
Sorry, Vidya. He has managed to escape.

747
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:39,383
I knew that he would escape.

748
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:40,633
How? How did you know?

749
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:44,133
I knew it when you left the jeep here
and ran after him.

750
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:45,508
It's obvious that he'll escape.

751
00:47:47,258 --> 00:47:48,216
Okay. Shall I drop you?

752
00:47:48,425 --> 00:47:49,258
No, thank you.

753
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,758
He ran in this direction.

754
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:52,091
I'll go in the opposite direction.

755
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:54,133
He starts flirting the moment
he gets a chance.

756
00:47:56,764 --> 00:47:59,300
Sir, when will you get chance?

757
00:47:59,383 --> 00:48:01,341
I haven't got it yet,
but I'll get it soon.

758
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:02,341
Oh!

759
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,633
Sir, you caught the Romeo.

760
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,883
Why did you tell her
that he managed to escape?

761
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,800
This was my plan.

762
00:48:12,675 --> 00:48:14,466
You can run after girls.

763
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,050
It's a thing every man does.

764
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,508
A male puts in lot of effort
to impress a female.

765
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:20,883
But he never threatens to kill her.

766
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:22,883
It becomes necessary to threaten
or the girls don't give in.

767
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,216
This is a part of the plan.

768
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:27,425
You're right. You must threaten them
or they don't listen.

769
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:29,175
Thank you, sir.
You've understood my point.

770
00:48:29,258 --> 00:48:30,091
I love you.

771
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,425
- Pour it.
- What, sir?

772
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:34,258
Acid.

773
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:35,508
What? Acid?

774
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:37,216
Pour it on me. Pour it.

775
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,466
Instead of getting scared
he wants us to pour acid on him.

776
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,591
- Show it to me.
- Here you go, sir.

777
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,175
Sir, you pour it on me.
You pour it on me.

778
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:46,758
Burn me.

779
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,258
What kind of man is he?

780
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:49,675
Sir, what are you doing?
Please don't do this.

781
00:48:49,758 --> 00:48:51,591
Sir, he'll die.
Please forgive him.

782
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:53,258
Sir, forgive him... Sir...

783
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:54,508
Forgive him.

784
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,591
He added some pills to baking soda.
That's it.

785
00:48:58,675 --> 00:49:01,466
Oh, God! He's a lunatic.

786
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,133
Give me his phone.

787
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:04,216
Take it.

788
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:06,234
Here.

789
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:08,883
- By what name have you saved Vidya's name?
- Vidya, my love.

790
00:49:08,966 --> 00:49:11,925
So Vidya, you've appointed
the police to protect you.

791
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:14,383
I'll come to your hostel tonight
and throw acid on you.

792
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:16,050
This is wrong.
This is crime.

793
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,258
What is wrong?

794
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:19,802
The story will get cooked
only if I light the fire.

795
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,300
- Hello.
- Hey security.

796
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:25,341
Sir, you've lit the fire.

797
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:26,425
It's very fast.

798
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:27,466
Vidya!

799
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,508
Hello.

800
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:31,883
The Romeo has message me.

801
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:34,008
He has threatened to come
to my hostel and throw acid on me.

802
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:35,091
Please come fast.

803
00:49:40,466 --> 00:49:42,966
When did the police officers
become so handsome?

804
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,091
Shut up!

805
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,258
I'm ready to get arrested by him.

806
00:49:48,758 --> 00:49:50,341
I guess he's a virgin.

807
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:53,008
Yes, you are right.

808
00:49:53,175 --> 00:49:54,175
Sir, what does virgin mean?

809
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:55,800
- Are you from Hindi medium?
- Yes, sir.

810
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:58,216
One who hasn't got lucky
with a woman yet.

811
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,383
Sir, it means I'm also a virgin.

812
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:02,091
Forget it.
Do you know if you're a virgin?

813
00:50:02,175 --> 00:50:03,091
Shut up!

814
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:04,925
- Soldiers...
- Yes, sir.

815
00:50:05,008 --> 00:50:06,175
Enter the dragon.

816
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:08,508
- The target is there and not here.
- Oh!

817
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,383
Hey... hey...
do you plan to enter our room?

818
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,091
- Yeah.
- This is a ladies' hostel.

819
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:16,050
- Can't you see that?
- Really? Is it?

820
00:50:16,425 --> 00:50:18,050
- Who are you?
- Security.

821
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:19,883
- Where should you be posted?
- At the gate.

822
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:25,258
Mosquitoes will bite them
if they remain posted outside.

823
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:27,675
Poor fellows! They'll be in pain.

824
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:30,716
Will you take care of them
if they come to our room?

825
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:31,883
No, friend.

826
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,508
Come on, let's go from here.

827
00:50:33,716 --> 00:50:34,466
Let's go.

828
00:50:34,758 --> 00:50:35,883
No... no...

829
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:37,466
No... no...

830
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:40,758
Hey! Don't sleep.

831
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:43,008
How can we sleep after seeing
so many beautiful ladies?

832
00:51:03,216 --> 00:51:05,633
He starts flirting
whenever he gets a chance.

833
00:51:05,883 --> 00:51:09,050
I think the food got spoilt
due to too much heat.

834
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,133
Sir, I understand we are virgin.

835
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:12,966
What's the problem with madam
that she is still a virgin?

836
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:15,175
Idiot, do you know what
the word actually means?

837
00:51:15,258 --> 00:51:16,425
What are you doing?

838
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,008
Go inside, madam.

839
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:21,841
Sir and we'll be here.

840
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:24,758
- Idiot...
- Yes, sir.

841
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:26,841
You're happy that you
sent her inside, right?

842
00:51:27,925 --> 00:51:30,008
What will you do if I go inside her room
in five minutes?

843
00:51:30,091 --> 00:51:31,008
Impossible.

844
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,675
Do you know what a great man said?

845
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:33,841
What did he say? Tell me.

846
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,008
There's no word celled
'impossible' in his dictionary.

847
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:48,008
Baking soda with some pills.

848
00:51:54,216 --> 00:51:55,841
Sara, acid. Run!

849
00:51:57,175 --> 00:51:59,008
Hey! What are you doing?

850
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:00,133
Killing mosquitoes.

851
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:03,008
He threw acid in my room
and you're busy killing mosquitoes?

852
00:52:03,466 --> 00:52:04,466
Who am I?

853
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,591
Security.

854
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:08,050
Where should I be posted?

855
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,425
At the gate.

856
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,925
I had told you that if I stay close to you
I can protect you.

857
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,883
Let him come inside.

858
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:21,550
Come in.

859
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:22,758
- Devotee.
- Yes, my lord.

860
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:23,841
What did she say?

861
00:52:24,012 --> 00:52:25,675
Madam is calling you inside.

862
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:29,508
Idiot, the food is not burnt.

863
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:33,008
When a tiger cooks the rice,
it'll always be nice.

864
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,133
He didn't understand what I said,
explain it to him.

865
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:50,591
"You've cast your magic spell."

866
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:53,300
"I'm lost in you."

867
00:52:53,383 --> 00:52:58,675
"The God has created you
with lot of efforts."

868
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:01,466
"Look at His divine plans."

869
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,258
"They've brought us together."

870
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:10,091
"I went crazy the moment I saw you."

871
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:34,508
"You've cast your magic spell."

872
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,841
"I'm lost in you."

873
00:53:37,216 --> 00:53:42,841
"The God has created you
with lot of efforts."

874
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:20,841
"I wonder how beautiful
these moments are."

875
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,550
Stop. Stop.

876
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:24,175
Hey... where are you going?

877
00:54:25,114 --> 00:54:26,675
To meet Mr. Ravindra Verma.

878
00:54:26,966 --> 00:54:28,175
He's an Ayurveda expert.

879
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,175
I'm doing my research under his guidance.

880
00:54:30,258 --> 00:54:31,508
Okay. So, he's your teacher.

881
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:32,883
He's more than just a teacher.

882
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:34,300
He's like my father.

883
00:54:37,258 --> 00:54:47,216
"Our stories will reverberate everywhere."

884
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:03,925
Hey Rama...

885
00:55:05,425 --> 00:55:06,091
Brother...

886
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:07,800
I've got some new clothes for you.
Wear them.

887
00:55:07,883 --> 00:55:09,925
- Why, brother?
- It's my birthday tomorrow.

888
00:55:10,175 --> 00:55:12,216
Why are you gifting me clothes
on your birthday?

889
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,550
Just like that.

890
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:16,133
- Thank you, brother.
- "I'm lost in you."

891
00:55:16,341 --> 00:55:21,633
"The God has created you
with lot of efforts."

892
00:55:50,716 --> 00:55:52,425
When did this school start?

893
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:56,591
A police officer has come
as a savior for the poor kids.

894
00:55:56,831 --> 00:55:57,573
Bhimaa.

895
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,091
Madam, please come.
My wife is waiting for me.

896
00:56:07,175 --> 00:56:08,841
Say something now.

897
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:10,091
You say it.

898
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,550
I love you.

899
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:23,716
Don't worry, he'll recover.

900
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:35,591
Will her fever subside
if she takes this medicine?

901
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,675
Why did you bring her so late?

902
00:56:37,758 --> 00:56:39,591
We came here at night
but somebody informed us that

903
00:56:39,675 --> 00:56:40,800
Guruji is not here.

904
00:56:41,258 --> 00:56:44,925
Don't you know that Guruji
doesn't meet anybody after sunset?

905
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:47,133
- He doesn't treat anybody after sunset.
- Why?

906
00:56:47,383 --> 00:56:50,508
It's a sin to cut plants after sunset.

907
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,383
Don't panic.

908
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:55,966
- Drink this and your fever will subside.
- Drink it.

909
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:30,591
Guruji...

910
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:44,883
It's a rare plant.

911
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:48,133
It has miraculous healing powers.

912
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:53,591
We can save many lives
by using this plant.

913
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:01,591
Greetings, Guruji.

914
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,133
God resides in every human being.

915
00:58:04,591 --> 00:58:06,966
Bless everybody with happiness.

916
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:10,300
Guruji, you're the reason
why we all are so happy.

917
00:58:10,466 --> 00:58:14,091
We had visited many hospitals
and spent millions on her treatment.

918
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:16,133
But nobody could cure our daughter.

919
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,341
Your treatment has healed my daughter.

920
00:58:20,341 --> 00:58:22,050
You are our god.

921
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:24,258
This is not my greatness.

922
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:26,175
This is the greatness of our land.

923
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:30,240
The Sanjeevani plant that can bring
a dead person back to life

924
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,716
grows on this land.

925
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,758
So, we can find medicines
for every disease.

926
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:39,091
Guruji, people say that there are
miraculous healing plants in the Himalayas.

927
00:58:39,175 --> 00:58:40,300
Do you get your plants from there?

928
00:58:40,655 --> 00:58:42,341
Not only in the Himalayas...

929
00:58:42,675 --> 00:58:45,675
The stone on which you
are standing is also magical.

930
00:58:46,925 --> 00:58:49,800
One of the seven immortals is Parashuram.

931
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,716
Parashuram lived in this land.

932
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:56,800
The plants you see here
have magical medicinal properties.

933
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,758
They can heal any disease.

934
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:07,508
If we try wholeheartedly,
we can find Sanjeevani also here.

935
00:59:07,716 --> 00:59:08,988
Is that true, Guruji?

936
00:59:10,466 --> 00:59:12,883
It's impossible for humans.

937
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:19,675
We need an avatar of the lord,
a super human to attain it.

938
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:28,341
Greetings.

939
00:59:31,925 --> 00:59:33,050
Greetings.

940
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:34,508
My name is...

941
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:37,925
Bhimaa. You are the new SI in town.

942
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:41,675
I've heard you're doing
a remarkable job since you came here.

943
00:59:41,883 --> 00:59:43,216
I wanted to meet you.

944
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:46,999
You've already met.

945
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:50,758
Are you happy?

946
00:59:56,883 --> 00:59:59,800
Bhimaa, I've a small request.

947
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:04,841
An ancient temple of our town
has been locked for five decades.

948
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:10,175
We were waiting for you.

949
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,258
We've been trying to
open the temple for years.

950
01:00:14,341 --> 01:00:17,341
There are legal cases
pending in the court.

951
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:20,716
A temple where we can't pray
is like a childless mother.

952
01:00:21,091 --> 01:00:26,425
I can't see the temple locked
when it should be full of energy.

953
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:31,008
Will you help us open the temple?

954
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:41,841
Boss, Bhimaa is troubling us a lot.

955
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:49,050
Since he came to this village
he has made sure our business shut down.

956
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:53,091
If this continues,
he'll find out about our tankers.

957
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:03,591
Can I send the tanker?

958
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:04,675
Yes, send it.

959
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:13,466
Let's inform our men in the jungle.

960
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:15,408
They'll kill Bhimaa, boss.

961
01:01:19,412 --> 01:01:20,996
Just give the order once, boss.

962
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:41,050
- Give me the register.
- Sir.

963
01:01:42,341 --> 01:01:43,466
- Give it.
- Okay.

964
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,091
Give me the phone.

965
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:29,925
Give me the torch.

966
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,050
Boss...

967
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:33,841
Bhimaa is at the check post.

968
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:23,550
Sir!

969
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:45,871
Sir, they've permit
for these two vehicles.

970
01:03:49,466 --> 01:03:50,966
Sir, shall I let them go?

971
01:03:52,258 --> 01:03:53,670
Let them go.

972
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:14,550
Sir, you know Bhavani is doing this.
Yet why are you quiet about it?

973
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:16,508
Are you waiting for Rudra?

974
01:04:18,508 --> 01:04:22,341
There's somebody else behind them.

975
01:04:30,258 --> 01:04:31,758
Why did you tell me to stop here?

976
01:04:32,413 --> 01:04:33,538
I've a small work.

977
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:35,330
Go to the police station.
I'll join you.

978
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,580
Boss, Ravindra Verma has asked
Bhimaa to help him open the temple.

979
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:44,923
What did you say?

980
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:46,663
"Hey Bhimaa!"

981
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:53,413
Tell Pandava to finish his work quickly.

982
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:55,787
"Hey Bhimaa!"

983
01:04:57,871 --> 01:04:59,371
"Hey Bhimaa!"

984
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:10,330
Oh no!

985
01:05:10,705 --> 01:05:11,996
What happened?

986
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,435
The tanker's driver
is not answering my calls.

987
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,544
Call him again.

988
01:05:26,705 --> 01:05:28,121
"Hey Bhimaa!"

989
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:32,080
"Hey Bhimaa!"

990
01:05:37,913 --> 01:05:40,371
Boss, I called him many times
but he is not answering my calls.

991
01:05:40,455 --> 01:05:42,163
What happened to the tanker?
Come on, tell me.

992
01:05:42,246 --> 01:05:43,496
Sir, an accident has taken place.

993
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:46,746
We got a call from the control room.

994
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,621
They couldn't connect
with the ambulance driver.

995
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:50,955
I'll go and get it.
Both of you stay with sir.

996
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,455
Sir, both the driver and cleaner are dead.

997
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,062
- Chandra...
- Sir?

998
01:07:04,413 --> 01:07:05,341
Sir!

999
01:08:28,812 --> 01:08:30,080
Brother, please come quickly.

1000
01:08:30,163 --> 01:08:34,219
What happened? The ambulance
driver is lying drunk on the beach.

1001
01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:35,765
The tyres are stuck in the sand.

1002
01:08:50,955 --> 01:08:53,583
The ambulance is stuck
in the sand of the beach.

1003
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:54,871
They won't spare us.

1004
01:08:55,121 --> 01:08:56,619
More of them can come.

1005
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,996
Sir, there's a shortcut
to the beach through the jungle.

1006
01:09:02,246 --> 01:09:05,538
But how will we go there
with the children?

1007
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:12,297
Brother, will we die?

1008
01:09:14,455 --> 01:09:15,330
Don't panic.

1009
01:09:16,732 --> 01:09:19,413
Death will get scared when
they see how brave you are.

1010
01:09:20,746 --> 01:09:25,181
As long as Bhimaa is alive,
nobody can harm you.

1011
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,330
It's my promise to you.

1012
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:44,205
Boss, we can't stop him.

1013
01:11:44,413 --> 01:11:45,996
You've to get into action.

1014
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:55,621
Chandra, stop.

1015
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:11,392
Sir!

1016
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:17,637
Brother!

1017
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:23,774
Go!

1018
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,580
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1019
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,163
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1020
01:14:08,996 --> 01:14:11,246
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1021
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,705
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1022
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,621
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1023
01:14:38,955 --> 01:14:41,413
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1024
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:41,523
"Hey Gangadhar, the lord of Gouri."

1025
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:46,091
"I seek refuge only at your feet."

1026
01:17:46,573 --> 01:17:50,788
"Hey Lord Shankar, you're my world."

1027
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:55,163
"I always have your blessings with me."

1028
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:59,788
"I always think of you."

1029
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:01,663
"You're my lord."

1030
01:18:01,746 --> 01:18:03,955
"My everything is yours."

1031
01:18:12,705 --> 01:18:16,871
"Hail Lord Shiva!
You are always with me."

1032
01:18:17,371 --> 01:18:21,288
"Hail Lord Shiva!
You're the lord of the world."

1033
01:18:21,788 --> 01:18:25,746
"Hail Lord Shiva!
You are always with me."

1034
01:18:26,172 --> 01:18:29,663
"Hail Lord Shiva!
You're the lord of the world."

1035
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:53,746
Won't you have oblation?

1036
01:18:53,955 --> 01:18:55,121
It's okay.

1037
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:57,580
May God always bless you.

1038
01:18:58,955 --> 01:19:00,371
I don't know what blessing I'll ask for.

1039
01:19:00,788 --> 01:19:03,913
Share your wish with the lord.
I'm sure He will appear before you.

1040
01:19:04,705 --> 01:19:06,288
He doesn't have time for it.

1041
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:08,330
- Did you bring what I told you to get?
- Yes.

1042
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,246
Why did you bring
only these many coconuts?

1043
01:19:13,621 --> 01:19:14,455
Uncle, I had no option.

1044
01:19:14,538 --> 01:19:16,125
Previously they used to give six
for hundred rupees.

1045
01:19:16,205 --> 01:19:17,455
The price has increased.
They gave only five.

1046
01:19:17,538 --> 01:19:18,955
You should've bargained with him.

1047
01:19:19,163 --> 01:19:20,955
Before I could tell him anything
he looked at me angrily.

1048
01:19:21,163 --> 01:19:23,205
My head is more precious than a coconut.

1049
01:19:23,496 --> 01:19:25,705
So, I kept quiet and came back.

1050
01:19:26,038 --> 01:19:29,163
You always remain quiet.

1051
01:19:29,246 --> 01:19:31,996
You should've got the priest's post
after your father.

1052
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,996
But idiot Siddhant got it instead of you.

1053
01:19:34,663 --> 01:19:37,580
If you stay simple
people will take advantage of you.

1054
01:19:37,663 --> 01:19:40,621
Coconuts are hard
but we break and eat it.

1055
01:19:41,371 --> 01:19:42,288
He'll not listen to me.

1056
01:19:42,371 --> 01:19:44,455
Okay, put 50 coconuts in this bag.

1057
01:19:44,788 --> 01:19:46,205
But there are only five coconuts.

1058
01:19:46,288 --> 01:19:48,996
Yes, I know but I've mentioned fifty here.

1059
01:19:49,246 --> 01:19:53,705
Oh god! You're taking fifty coconuts
instead of five and robbing god.

1060
01:19:54,746 --> 01:19:55,955
You've lost common sense.

1061
01:19:56,288 --> 01:19:59,621
God is not a glutton that
he'll devour fifty coconuts alone.

1062
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:02,121
It's for us.
Try to understand.

1063
01:20:02,205 --> 01:20:03,996
Do we need to think about our stomachs?

1064
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:08,371
It may not be important for us
but it's important for my fiancée.

1065
01:20:08,455 --> 01:20:09,413
Who is she, uncle?

1066
01:20:09,496 --> 01:20:10,580
Who else? It's Mandira.

1067
01:20:10,663 --> 01:20:12,746
Oh god! But she's Paro's mother.

1068
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:15,621
Idiot! Don't you remember
what Chanakya said?

1069
01:20:15,955 --> 01:20:18,496
It doesn't matter if the woman is married
or a spinster.

1070
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,996
It's important that she stays with us.

1071
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,246
Did Chanakya really say this?

1072
01:20:24,246 --> 01:20:24,913
You don't understand.

1073
01:20:24,996 --> 01:20:29,705
If you share your views in Chanakya's name,
the opinion becomes important.

1074
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,038
Why are you looking there?

1075
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,538
Does she know you love her?

1076
01:20:46,593 --> 01:20:49,218
If she knew she would've
definitely paid attention to me.

1077
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:51,371
- I didn't tell her.
- Are you scared to tell her?

1078
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:56,330
Idiot! Before I confess my love for her,
I need to make sure I can feed her.

1079
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,705
I'm earning so that I can marry her.

1080
01:20:57,788 --> 01:21:00,456
What's the use of falling in love
at this age?

1081
01:21:00,663 --> 01:21:02,080
Age is just a number.

1082
01:21:02,163 --> 01:21:04,580
Age doesn't matter in love.

1083
01:21:04,746 --> 01:21:07,038
- Okay, we're getting late.
- To confess my feelings for her?

1084
01:21:07,121 --> 01:21:07,996
- To make the calculations.
- Oh yes!

1085
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,580
Hurry up,
I've to go to teach the students too.

1086
01:21:09,663 --> 01:21:10,422
I completely forgot.

1087
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,163
Yeah!

1088
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:17,371
Rama!

1089
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,163
Children, silence.

1090
01:21:20,038 --> 01:21:21,413
The children are making so much noise.

1091
01:21:21,496 --> 01:21:22,580
Don't you find it irritating?

1092
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:24,288
Can't you ask them to keep quiet?

1093
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:26,746
If they don't enjoy life now,
then when will they enjoy it?

1094
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:30,080
They'll always remain irritated
and angry like you when they grow up.

1095
01:21:30,163 --> 01:21:31,913
We shouldn't stop them from enjoying.

1096
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:34,371
If you don't stop them,
they'll turn into idiots.

1097
01:21:34,538 --> 01:21:36,538
They are not idiots, they are God.

1098
01:21:37,871 --> 01:21:40,121
Our elders say that
God resides in children.

1099
01:21:40,205 --> 01:21:42,121
Sir, this God is biting me.

1100
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,038
You are also God, bite her back.

1101
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:46,330
A human is helpless between two Gods.

1102
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,441
Rama!

1103
01:21:49,052 --> 01:21:49,913
Oh god!

1104
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:51,455
Hey Rama!

1105
01:21:52,121 --> 01:21:53,205
What happened?

1106
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:54,788
Tell me.

1107
01:21:55,163 --> 01:21:58,955
You don't love me even 10% of
how much you love the children.

1108
01:22:01,496 --> 01:22:03,663
I said 'I love you' to you several times.

1109
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:05,830
Did you say that you love me even once?

1110
01:22:07,413 --> 01:22:09,121
Oh no! Keep quiet Paro.

1111
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,163
When will you take me with you?

1112
01:22:11,246 --> 01:22:12,621
If I lift you, I'll sprain my hips.

1113
01:22:12,705 --> 01:22:14,955
Did you hear that? Rama cracked a joke.

1114
01:22:15,038 --> 01:22:16,705
When will you elope with me?

1115
01:22:17,205 --> 01:22:18,496
Are you sure you are a man?

1116
01:22:19,163 --> 01:22:20,121
What are you saying?

1117
01:22:20,205 --> 01:22:22,746
I always went to the boys' toilet
when I was in school.

1118
01:22:22,955 --> 01:22:24,788
Only beard and moustache
doesn't make a person a man.

1119
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:26,496
You need to take care of others too.

1120
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,621
Paro...

1121
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,705
The idiot works with the
students of our school daily.

1122
01:22:30,788 --> 01:22:32,371
Hey! Whom did you call idiot?

1123
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,955
What's this, Paro?
Don't talk to me rudely.

1124
01:22:35,538 --> 01:22:38,871
I would've been your father.
But I missed the timing.

1125
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:43,788
Look... he is trying to romance
my mother at the age of retirement.

1126
01:22:44,913 --> 01:22:45,621
And you...

1127
01:22:45,705 --> 01:22:47,788
- How can I love your mother?
- Rama...

1128
01:22:48,038 --> 01:22:48,996
I can't do this.

1129
01:22:49,205 --> 01:22:51,038
I can't tolerate your stupid jokes.

1130
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:53,705
I love you and I'll elope with you one day.

1131
01:22:53,788 --> 01:22:54,955
Oh no! This is wrong.

1132
01:22:55,163 --> 01:22:57,746
You're engaged to Bhattacharya,
the priest's son. Right?

1133
01:22:58,205 --> 01:23:02,288
My dad was threatening to commit suicide,
so I agreed to get engaged.

1134
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:04,371
But I love you.

1135
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:07,205
He can't take care of his clothes.

1136
01:23:07,288 --> 01:23:10,496
If anybody snatches it from him,
he readily gives it.

1137
01:23:10,913 --> 01:23:11,955
Is this true?

1138
01:23:12,038 --> 01:23:14,913
Won't you take any action
if somebody tries to snatch me from you?

1139
01:23:14,996 --> 01:23:16,996
Do your clothes and I have the same value?

1140
01:23:17,496 --> 01:23:19,371
Bhattacharya is watching us.

1141
01:23:19,705 --> 01:23:20,830
Hey Rama!

1142
01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:26,080
I warned you several times
not to go near Paro.

1143
01:23:26,163 --> 01:23:28,580
Engagement is equal to half-marriage.

1144
01:23:28,663 --> 01:23:30,746
I'm her half-husband.

1145
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:33,639
Her mother is married
yet I consider her my wife.

1146
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:34,621
Sarangi.

1147
01:23:34,996 --> 01:23:36,246
Rama!

1148
01:23:37,205 --> 01:23:38,913
Sarangi, look at him.

1149
01:23:39,163 --> 01:23:41,455
He's well-built yet
he is scared of this timid guy.

1150
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:42,455
Look at him.

1151
01:23:42,538 --> 01:23:43,830
- What kind of man is he?
- Timid guy?

1152
01:23:44,038 --> 01:23:44,788
Hey!

1153
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:48,705
Paro, how can you love this coward?

1154
01:23:48,788 --> 01:23:53,746
If I show you how I love him,
you'll get jealous.

1155
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,621
Have you crossed the limit, Paro?

1156
01:23:55,705 --> 01:23:58,246
No... I've gone close to him.

1157
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:01,205
Paro! How dare you? Come on.

1158
01:24:01,288 --> 01:24:02,580
- Rama!
- Rama, I'll teach you a lesson.

1159
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:03,746
- Come on.
- Rama!

1160
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,746
- Rama!
- I won't spare you.

1161
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:08,746
I don't care who I get married to.
I'll come only to you.

1162
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,996
I love you.

1163
01:24:10,288 --> 01:24:12,871
Why is her mother not like her?

1164
01:24:14,746 --> 01:24:18,621
Rama, listen to me. Don't give
so much freedom to the children.

1165
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:20,171
They become stubborn.

1166
01:24:24,746 --> 01:24:25,955
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1167
01:24:29,205 --> 01:24:30,413
Why did you get scared?

1168
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,636
The same thing won't happen every time.

1169
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:34,314
Don't panic.

1170
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:37,121
Inside. Outside.

1171
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,621
Inside. Outside.

1172
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:40,371
Inside. Outside.

1173
01:24:40,871 --> 01:24:42,246
Inside. Outside.

1174
01:24:42,538 --> 01:24:43,746
Inside. Yeah!

1175
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,413
The priest's son is defeating
all of us in the game of cards.

1176
01:24:46,496 --> 01:24:49,371
Is it written anywhere that
a priest's son can't play cards?

1177
01:24:49,408 --> 01:24:50,533
The police has come.

1178
01:24:50,663 --> 01:24:52,788
- Come on, let's go from here.
- Let's go.

1179
01:24:52,955 --> 01:24:54,288
Everybody is running away on seeing me.

1180
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:55,496
But you are sitting here.

1181
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:56,621
Aren't you scared?

1182
01:24:56,698 --> 01:24:58,781
I make others run away.

1183
01:24:58,871 --> 01:25:01,455
Bhimaa is not scared of anyone
and won't run.

1184
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:02,830
Why are you so proud?

1185
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:06,288
I don't know if I'm proud,
but there's no machine to measure me.

1186
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:07,371
Naughty boy!

1187
01:25:07,455 --> 01:25:09,205
You've started playing cards
at a very young age.

1188
01:25:09,288 --> 01:25:10,621
Wait. I'll teach you a lesson.

1189
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:11,746
Where are you running?

1190
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:14,538
Stop! I'll teach you a lesson.

1191
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:16,121
Stop crying, Rama.

1192
01:25:16,205 --> 01:25:17,746
Today is Paro's birthday.

1193
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:22,205
I had saved one rupee with
much difficulty to buy a gift for her.

1194
01:25:22,455 --> 01:25:25,830
The rogue Bhimaa stole the one rupee.

1195
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,788
Look... look there.

1196
01:25:28,038 --> 01:25:29,080
Bhimaa is coming.

1197
01:25:30,163 --> 01:25:31,080
Why are you crying?

1198
01:25:31,163 --> 01:25:33,830
- You stole one rupee from me.
- Who are you?

1199
01:25:33,913 --> 01:25:36,288
I'm Shankar Bhagwati's son Rama...

1200
01:25:36,371 --> 01:25:37,205
Shut up!

1201
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:39,788
You are Bhimaa's brother.

1202
01:25:39,996 --> 01:25:42,455
You're more precious than Bhimaa.

1203
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:45,121
You'll give a precious gift to Paro.

1204
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:47,038
Take this. Ten rupees.

1205
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:48,163
Ten rupees?

1206
01:25:49,705 --> 01:25:50,455
What happened?

1207
01:25:50,538 --> 01:25:51,455
Call me brother and only
then I'll give it to you.

1208
01:25:51,538 --> 01:25:52,996
I'll say it. Come on, give it to me now.

1209
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,246
- Are you sure you'll call me brother?
- Yes, I'll call you brother.

1210
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:57,496
- Are you sure you'll call me brother?
- Yes, I'll call you brother.

1211
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,038
Come on, let's run.

1212
01:25:59,246 --> 01:26:01,205
- Call me brother.
- Get lost.

1213
01:26:01,288 --> 01:26:03,955
One day you'll address me as brother.

1214
01:26:04,038 --> 01:26:05,913
I'll never call you 'brother'.

1215
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:09,371
Buy peppermint for me, Rama.

1216
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:11,246
I'll buy bangles for Paro first.

1217
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,871
Give me a dozen bangles.

1218
01:26:12,955 --> 01:26:17,496
Hey! You pushed me. Right?
Now you've come here to buy bangles?

1219
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,163
- Sir... sir... it was not me.
- I will not spare you.

1220
01:26:19,246 --> 01:26:21,080
- Please don't hit me.
- Trying to fool the police.

1221
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:26,538
Priest, your son has been arrested.

1222
01:26:26,621 --> 01:26:28,288
Sir has called you at the police station.

1223
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:29,663
What did you do, Bhimaa?

1224
01:26:29,746 --> 01:26:32,371
If anything happens to Rama,
I'll kill you.

1225
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:33,538
Rama...

1226
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:36,080
Sir... sir, please pardon me.

1227
01:26:36,163 --> 01:26:38,746
It's not Rama but Bhimaa
who made the mistake.

1228
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:43,246
- Listen to me.
- I've brought him to apologize.

1229
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:45,330
The constable hit the child by mistake.

1230
01:26:45,496 --> 01:26:46,538
Please forgive us.

1231
01:26:46,621 --> 01:26:48,038
Please have a seat.

1232
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,788
Who hit you?

1233
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,080
Leave me.

1234
01:26:56,288 --> 01:26:58,121
I always land in trouble because of you.

1235
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:00,121
I don't like you.
Go away.

1236
01:27:08,705 --> 01:27:09,828
Hey stop!

1237
01:27:12,663 --> 01:27:13,913
Oh no!

1238
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,705
- Leave it, my child.
- Did you see him? He's a devil.

1239
01:27:17,788 --> 01:27:19,455
He took birth in my family by mistake.

1240
01:27:19,538 --> 01:27:21,871
God must've punished me
for some past sins.

1241
01:27:23,163 --> 01:27:24,955
God hasn't punished you.

1242
01:27:25,038 --> 01:27:26,330
- You are blessed.
- What?

1243
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:27,371
You're right.

1244
01:27:27,705 --> 01:27:30,246
Rama is aware of the rituals,
he'll serve God.

1245
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,746
But Bhimaa is strong.

1246
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,330
We need to guide him
in the right direction.

1247
01:27:34,413 --> 01:27:36,705
No, sir. He has ruined my life.

1248
01:27:36,788 --> 01:27:38,413
- Put him behind the bars.
- Listen to me.

1249
01:27:38,746 --> 01:27:42,746
If you don't mind,
I would like to adopt your son Bhimaa.

1250
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:46,330
Do what you like,
I'll perform his last rites today.

1251
01:27:46,413 --> 01:27:49,996
I have only one son Rama.
You're dead for me.

1252
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:54,663
Rama, let's go.

1253
01:27:56,996 --> 01:27:57,913
Hey Rama...

1254
01:27:58,788 --> 01:28:00,955
Address me as brother once.

1255
01:28:01,163 --> 01:28:01,913
Get lost.

1256
01:28:04,496 --> 01:28:05,413
Will you become a police?

1257
01:28:05,621 --> 01:28:06,663
Will you give me gun?

1258
01:28:07,163 --> 01:28:07,913
Gun?

1259
01:28:18,788 --> 01:28:19,663
What happened, Rama?

1260
01:28:19,746 --> 01:28:24,496
He's not here.
Yet his memories torment me.

1261
01:28:25,455 --> 01:28:27,621
I don't know what sins
I committed in past life

1262
01:28:28,496 --> 01:28:30,705
that I became Bhimaa's brother
in this life.

1263
01:28:31,746 --> 01:28:38,371
Either I've to die or kill him
to get rid of these memories.

1264
01:28:41,371 --> 01:28:43,288
Look there...
they've dropped somebody in the water.

1265
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:46,830
Come on, jump quickly.

1266
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:50,496
He's Bhimaa.

1267
01:28:51,538 --> 01:28:52,371
Carefully.

1268
01:28:53,705 --> 01:28:57,288
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

1269
01:28:57,371 --> 01:28:58,523
Brother Bhimaa...

1270
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:00,663
Brother Bhimaa...

1271
01:29:02,913 --> 01:29:04,996
You risked your life to save me.

1272
01:29:05,705 --> 01:29:07,288
I'll never forget this favour.

1273
01:29:07,663 --> 01:29:09,830
We're indebted to you forever.

1274
01:29:10,246 --> 01:29:13,246
There was a time when we were scared

1275
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:18,455
that Bhavani's men would harm our
families and so we stopped fishing.

1276
01:29:18,705 --> 01:29:21,830
After you came here
their dominance subsided.

1277
01:29:21,913 --> 01:29:23,496
The environment in the village
completely changed.

1278
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:28,788
Now we can leave our families in the
village and go to the ocean for fishing.

1279
01:29:28,871 --> 01:29:31,038
You are god-sent messiah.

1280
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,705
What happened, brother?
Why are you sitting alone?

1281
01:29:39,205 --> 01:29:40,705
I've got special tea for you.

1282
01:29:43,663 --> 01:29:44,913
Call me brother once.

1283
01:29:44,996 --> 01:29:45,996
Brother.

1284
01:29:49,455 --> 01:29:51,996
Why do become happy when
I address you as brother?

1285
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:55,038
- What is your name?
- Rama.

1286
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:05,455
Rama, don't be upset
that you lost your father.

1287
01:30:05,538 --> 01:30:06,281
I'm here with you.

1288
01:30:06,361 --> 01:30:08,871
- You can share anything with me.
- Paro, what are you doing?

1289
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:10,205
- What's going on?
- Dad...

1290
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:12,205
Dad...

1291
01:30:12,288 --> 01:30:14,746
I told you several times not to spend time
with this useless fellow.

1292
01:30:14,913 --> 01:30:17,496
Your father pretends to
be a great scholar. Right? - No...

1293
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,413
- He never let me do well in life.
- No.

1294
01:30:19,496 --> 01:30:21,371
Now, you're trying to trap my daughter.

1295
01:30:21,455 --> 01:30:25,330
If I see you around her again,
I'll kill you.

1296
01:30:25,413 --> 01:30:27,440
- Come with me. Come.
- Rama.

1297
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,996
How dare you hit my brother?

1298
01:30:46,496 --> 01:30:49,955
I won't let you enter the temple.

1299
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:52,205
You'll be punished
for being Bhimaa's brother.

1300
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,830
Worthless fellow.
Come with me.

1301
01:30:57,538 --> 01:30:59,080
Rama, what happened?

1302
01:30:59,163 --> 01:31:00,330
Come on, tell me.

1303
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:03,580
You won't let me live peacefully.
Why are you following me?

1304
01:31:03,788 --> 01:31:05,788
Whatever I do is for your well-being.

1305
01:31:05,871 --> 01:31:09,080
Your arrogant attitude
has made my life hell.

1306
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:10,163
Hey Rama...

1307
01:31:10,455 --> 01:31:11,871
Do you know what's the
biggest curse of my life?

1308
01:31:11,955 --> 01:31:13,205
That I have the same face as you do.

1309
01:31:13,288 --> 01:31:18,121
If you come before me again or if
you try to talk to me, I'll kill myself.

1310
01:31:18,288 --> 01:31:19,996
I swear on Lord Shiva.

1311
01:31:24,871 --> 01:31:27,580
Address me as 'brother' once
and I'll go away from here.

1312
01:31:27,746 --> 01:31:29,121
Hey! Get lost from here.

1313
01:31:35,913 --> 01:31:37,496
Call me 'brother' once again.

1314
01:31:38,205 --> 01:31:39,371
Brother.

1315
01:31:49,746 --> 01:31:52,465
Bhimaa... what happened?

1316
01:31:52,705 --> 01:31:54,205
What happened, Bhimaa?

1317
01:32:02,205 --> 01:32:03,621
It's a poisonous weapon.

1318
01:32:03,814 --> 01:32:08,371
In ancient times pirates used
to use this dangerous weapon.

1319
01:32:08,788 --> 01:32:13,871
Since you fell in the ocean,
the poison didn't affect you.

1320
01:32:14,913 --> 01:32:19,621
They poisoned you and threw you
into the ocean yet you came back alive.

1321
01:32:20,038 --> 01:32:21,889
This proves that you're
not an ordinary man.

1322
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:26,611
You're a person who
can manifest his own death.

1323
01:32:27,164 --> 01:32:28,413
Brother!

1324
01:32:32,163 --> 01:32:34,330
Brother, I hope you're fine.

1325
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:35,913
I'm absolutely fine, my child.

1326
01:32:36,955 --> 01:32:39,455
We don't know who our parents are.

1327
01:32:39,705 --> 01:32:41,288
We don't know which village we come from.

1328
01:32:41,496 --> 01:32:43,705
If we go to anybody they
scold us and throw us out.

1329
01:32:43,788 --> 01:32:46,496
They beat us if we say that we're hungry.

1330
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:50,663
You saved us and lovingly hugged us.

1331
01:32:50,746 --> 01:32:53,538
Your kind gesture made us cry, brother.

1332
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:57,663
I get strength when
I address you as brother.

1333
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:06,330
Where are the remaining children?

1334
01:33:08,955 --> 01:33:11,330
Children are very delicate.

1335
01:33:11,996 --> 01:33:17,205
They were mentally depressed
because of this fatal conflicts.

1336
01:33:17,996 --> 01:33:19,996
Bhimaa, you've saved these children

1337
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:25,205
but there are many children whom
we couldn't save from that hell.

1338
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,218
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1339
01:33:44,153 --> 01:33:45,830
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1340
01:33:46,837 --> 01:33:49,996
It won't take me too long to kill you.

1341
01:33:50,455 --> 01:33:52,830
How dare you play with
the lives of children? Rascal!

1342
01:33:53,121 --> 01:33:55,663
Bhimaa, you're concerned
about those useless children.

1343
01:33:55,746 --> 01:33:58,496
You are blaming me that I've
ruined their lives. What nonsense!

1344
01:33:58,705 --> 01:34:00,830
You're safe because I don't have evidence.

1345
01:34:01,038 --> 01:34:04,330
The day I get evidence against you,
I'll crush you.

1346
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:08,413
You are just SI. Don't show attitude.

1347
01:34:08,621 --> 01:34:13,080
It won't take me long to get you fired.

1348
01:34:13,163 --> 01:34:15,288
Come on, do it.
If you're brave enough then do it.

1349
01:34:15,371 --> 01:34:16,871
Do you think I'll become
silent after getting orders

1350
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:18,330
from my senior and sit quietly at home?

1351
01:34:18,413 --> 01:34:20,496
The uniform has kept the
wild animal within me in control.

1352
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,330
If I lose my uniform
I'll tear you apart into pieces.

1353
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:25,705
You're alive because I'm quiet.

1354
01:34:25,788 --> 01:34:29,455
You'll lose your life if I call my army.

1355
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:30,788
Come on, do it.
Let me see what you can do.

1356
01:34:30,871 --> 01:34:34,038
Will you send your men or hire goons?

1357
01:34:34,746 --> 01:34:40,788
If I take action the crematorium
grounds will be full.

1358
01:34:43,371 --> 01:34:47,250
Bhavani, my vacation is now over.

1359
01:34:47,705 --> 01:34:49,496
I've a final offer for you.

1360
01:34:49,996 --> 01:34:54,288
I'll kill you after I torture you and your
son the way you tortured the children.

1361
01:34:54,746 --> 01:34:56,746
No case. No charge sheet.

1362
01:34:58,121 --> 01:34:59,913
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1363
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,031
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1364
01:35:33,955 --> 01:35:35,455
Oh no! Bloody idiot.

1365
01:35:35,705 --> 01:35:37,371
He doesn't value time at all.

1366
01:35:39,288 --> 01:35:40,496
Hey Rama!

1367
01:35:42,099 --> 01:35:43,205
Rama!

1368
01:35:44,788 --> 01:35:45,996
Rama!

1369
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:47,830
Rama, stop.

1370
01:35:47,913 --> 01:35:50,080
- I've been calling you for so long.
- She's always after Rama.

1371
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:52,163
Your fiancée is getting married
in a week's time.

1372
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:53,913
Don't you have the courage to stop it?

1373
01:35:53,996 --> 01:35:55,996
Loving someone silently isn't enough.

1374
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,750
You should be brave enough
to get the love of your life.

1375
01:35:57,830 --> 01:36:00,455
She had given another
explanation two days back.

1376
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:03,038
Don't trouble me daily by explaining
how a man should behave.

1377
01:36:03,121 --> 01:36:04,830
- Spare me.
- Really? So, this is what you think.

1378
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,496
I've abandoned my family
and come to you with all my jewelry.

1379
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,663
Look at you.

1380
01:36:08,746 --> 01:36:10,246
How dare you think of leaving me?

1381
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:13,188
- Jewelry!
- Come on, tell me... tell me.

1382
01:36:15,871 --> 01:36:18,621
Rama, let's elope and start a new life.

1383
01:36:19,288 --> 01:36:21,496
He has already ruined his present life.

1384
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,246
He can't start a new life.

1385
01:36:23,538 --> 01:36:25,996
If he stays with you
and keeps wasting his time

1386
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,746
doing meaningless rituals,
his life won't change.

1387
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:31,121
He'll learn things if I elope with him
and take him to a new place.

1388
01:36:31,205 --> 01:36:32,496
You want to take me away
from this village?

1389
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:34,288
I don't know the way to any other village.

1390
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:35,288
Oh god!

1391
01:36:35,371 --> 01:36:37,330
You don't have to know the route.

1392
01:36:37,413 --> 01:36:39,163
Be strong so that we can go.

1393
01:36:39,246 --> 01:36:41,788
Hey... is it so easy to be strong?

1394
01:36:41,871 --> 01:36:44,163
He was never brave.
How can he change so soon?

1395
01:36:44,246 --> 01:36:45,080
Come on, let's go.

1396
01:36:46,108 --> 01:36:48,121
Don't worry, I'm here.

1397
01:36:48,788 --> 01:36:49,955
Who is he?

1398
01:36:50,038 --> 01:36:52,371
Who are you?
Why did you interfere in our conversation?

1399
01:36:52,455 --> 01:36:54,913
I'm not interested in interfering
in matters of strangers.

1400
01:36:55,205 --> 01:36:56,607
I'm their childhood friend.

1401
01:36:56,830 --> 01:36:58,996
Rama, didn't you recognize me?

1402
01:36:59,080 --> 01:36:59,746
Who is he?

1403
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:01,580
Somebody was stealing coconuts
from the temple two days back...

1404
01:37:01,663 --> 01:37:02,871
- Yes!
- I broke his head.

1405
01:37:02,955 --> 01:37:05,871
- Yes, he is the one.
- No... no... I'm their childhood friend.

1406
01:37:05,955 --> 01:37:07,580
Didn't you recognize me, Paro?

1407
01:37:07,913 --> 01:37:08,913
Who are you?

1408
01:37:09,663 --> 01:37:10,913
Are you Srinivas Sharma?

1409
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,663
Vishwanath Shastri?

1410
01:37:13,288 --> 01:37:14,830
- Satish!
- Yes, Satish. - Satish.

1411
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:17,080
- I'm Satish.
- Is he Satish?

1412
01:37:17,455 --> 01:37:19,496
He looked very ugly in childhood.

1413
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:21,955
He is not handsome even now.
He's dark and ugly.

1414
01:37:22,246 --> 01:37:24,705
It's wrong to do body shaming.

1415
01:37:24,955 --> 01:37:27,455
Paro, when our teacher used to teach us

1416
01:37:27,538 --> 01:37:29,992
we would suck sugarcane under the bench.
Do you remember it?

1417
01:37:30,621 --> 01:37:32,121
Yes, he is right.

1418
01:37:32,205 --> 01:37:33,996
Every child does this.

1419
01:37:34,246 --> 01:37:36,455
Paro, this man looks fishy.

1420
01:37:36,538 --> 01:37:38,413
He is not at all like Satish.

1421
01:37:38,496 --> 01:37:39,871
Do you still doubt me, Paro?

1422
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:42,830
Do you remember his cowardly
stories that I share with you?

1423
01:37:42,913 --> 01:37:43,996
You are Satish.

1424
01:37:45,163 --> 01:37:46,455
You've changed a lot.

1425
01:37:46,538 --> 01:37:48,080
You've also changed a lot.

1426
01:37:48,163 --> 01:37:50,621
- You've become more beautiful. Yes.
- Oh!

1427
01:37:50,724 --> 01:37:52,640
Rama is still a timid cowardly guy.

1428
01:37:52,705 --> 01:37:55,663
Will you still be like this?
Be brave and jump.

1429
01:37:55,719 --> 01:37:57,261
How can I jump if there's a trench below?

1430
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:58,330
Nobody gives attention to me
in this village.

1431
01:37:58,413 --> 01:37:59,288
Why should I shift to another village?

1432
01:37:59,371 --> 01:38:00,246
Not at all.

1433
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:02,913
Friendship is not just an ordinary bond,
it's a bond between two humans.

1434
01:38:02,996 --> 01:38:04,746
You won't have to beg
as long as I'm with you.

1435
01:38:04,955 --> 01:38:07,288
- What will you ask for in return?
- Your head.

1436
01:38:07,371 --> 01:38:11,788
I'll get them married and get him a job
of a priest in some renowned temple.

1437
01:38:11,871 --> 01:38:14,413
I'm not sure if he'll help me become
a priest or make me starve to death.

1438
01:38:15,455 --> 01:38:17,121
Rama, please accept it.

1439
01:38:17,913 --> 01:38:20,996
You can enter the temple
and we can start a family too.

1440
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,163
Paro is always in hurry
since her childhood days.

1441
01:38:23,246 --> 01:38:24,246
But her mother is not in hurry.

1442
01:38:24,538 --> 01:38:25,621
But her father is.

1443
01:38:25,871 --> 01:38:29,496
- Rama! Paro, don't commit this sin.
- We will not spare him.

1444
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,455
- I'll get you married to him today.
- You're absolutely right.

1445
01:38:31,538 --> 01:38:32,996
- Come here.
- No.

1446
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,080
Leave him.

1447
01:38:34,163 --> 01:38:36,705
- Aren't you ashamed of eloping with him?
- Aren't you ashamed?

1448
01:38:36,788 --> 01:38:39,205
I told you that he doesn't
deserve to be one of us. - He's right.

1449
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:41,455
You'll have to clean the temple stairs
if you become his wife.

1450
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:42,455
Yes, that's what you'll have to do.

1451
01:38:42,538 --> 01:38:44,746
I had told you that they are very proud.

1452
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:47,246
So, god has made him useless.

1453
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:49,746
I'll get you married to
Bhattacharya tomorrow morning.

1454
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,621
Marriage with you? Shame.

1455
01:38:51,705 --> 01:38:53,246
- Give me your blessings.
- Bless you.

1456
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:54,705
If you come the wedding won't take place.

1457
01:38:54,788 --> 01:38:56,496
- Rama!
- Rama!

1458
01:39:08,455 --> 01:39:09,467
Tell me, Paro.

1459
01:39:09,746 --> 01:39:11,538
I'm getting married tomorrow morning.

1460
01:39:13,205 --> 01:39:15,496
If you don't come and
take me with you tonight,

1461
01:39:16,413 --> 01:39:18,330
I'll drink poison and commit suicide.

1462
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:25,205
Instead of enjoying my wedding feast,
You'll enjoy my funeral lunch.

1463
01:39:29,288 --> 01:39:30,580
What shall you do now?

1464
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:34,580
The only person in this world
who loves me is Paro.

1465
01:39:35,531 --> 01:39:37,121
I can do anything for her.

1466
01:39:37,205 --> 01:39:38,913
This is the power of love.

1467
01:39:38,996 --> 01:39:41,788
Once he takes a decision,
nothing can scare him.

1468
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:52,080
If you had showed this courage earlier,

1469
01:39:52,371 --> 01:39:54,788
I would've become your
father-in-law long back.

1470
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:58,871
Paro... Paro...

1471
01:39:59,121 --> 01:40:02,955
Talk softly or the mosquitoes
will get disturbed. - Got it.

1472
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:04,788
- Paro...
- Shut up!

1473
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:07,382
Call her.

1474
01:40:11,777 --> 01:40:13,277
Who is speaking?

1475
01:40:14,003 --> 01:40:16,246
Uncle, I'm Paro's friend Pari.

1476
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:19,038
- Okay. So, you are Paro's friend.
- You are right.

1477
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:20,246
Do you think I'm a fool?

1478
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:22,455
Paro has only one friend, that's Rama.

1479
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,621
You should've called
from a telephone booth.

1480
01:40:25,705 --> 01:40:27,580
Your number is saved in this phone,
you fool.

1481
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:32,194
- Call her in her landline number.
- Okay. You're right.

1482
01:40:35,653 --> 01:40:38,080
Hello. Hello. Who is it?

1483
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:43,955
Who is this? Please talk.

1484
01:40:45,163 --> 01:40:47,038
Tell her that you're Sarangi.

1485
01:40:47,371 --> 01:40:48,413
Sarangi?

1486
01:40:48,496 --> 01:40:49,538
Who is Sarangi?

1487
01:40:49,621 --> 01:40:52,875
Auntie doesn't even know that
there's somebody called Sarangi.

1488
01:40:52,955 --> 01:40:56,038
Sarangi, so you are the one
who makes the blank calls daily?

1489
01:40:56,121 --> 01:40:58,746
- You've landed me in trouble.
- How dare you flirt with women?

1490
01:40:58,996 --> 01:41:00,663
You idiot! Get lost. Hang up.

1491
01:41:01,996 --> 01:41:06,038
You should've romanced at a young age,
but you're doing it now.

1492
01:41:06,121 --> 01:41:08,246
Love has no age.

1493
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:10,121
It's the feelings that matter. Got it?

1494
01:41:10,205 --> 01:41:13,205
- You are an old man.
- What have you done at a young age?

1495
01:41:13,288 --> 01:41:14,913
What shall I do now?
Come on, tell me quickly.

1496
01:41:14,996 --> 01:41:15,955
Tell him quickly.

1497
01:41:17,163 --> 01:41:19,330
Her parents will be in the hall.

1498
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:21,038
Go inside through the rear entrance.

1499
01:41:21,121 --> 01:41:22,871
- Through the kitchen?
- Yes.

1500
01:41:23,163 --> 01:41:24,285
Come on, go.

1501
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:26,788
If you had shown this courage earlier
we wouldn't have to wait so long.

1502
01:41:26,871 --> 01:41:28,871
- Let's go now.
- Uncle, take care of yourself.

1503
01:41:28,955 --> 01:41:30,038
We'll leave now.

1504
01:41:31,871 --> 01:41:36,455
We don't share any blood relation,
but you always called me uncle.

1505
01:41:36,913 --> 01:41:38,455
Now you're leaving me.

1506
01:41:38,807 --> 01:41:40,163
I'm feeling upset.

1507
01:41:40,496 --> 01:41:42,455
Okay, my son. Go. Come on, hurry up.

1508
01:41:42,538 --> 01:41:44,038
Go. Go.

1509
01:41:46,788 --> 01:41:47,955
Take care.

1510
01:41:48,205 --> 01:41:49,455
Won't you come with us?

1511
01:41:50,564 --> 01:41:52,746
I'll stay with my Mandira.

1512
01:41:53,121 --> 01:41:54,788
I bless that you start
getting calls from her very soon.

1513
01:41:54,871 --> 01:41:56,371
- Amen.
- Stop giving her missed calls now.

1514
01:41:57,121 --> 01:41:57,955
Where are you taking us?

1515
01:41:58,038 --> 01:42:00,580
I'll take you to a safe place.
We're going to your relative's place.

1516
01:42:00,955 --> 01:42:02,955
All my relatives abandoned me
in my childhood.

1517
01:42:03,038 --> 01:42:04,288
Which relative are you talking about?

1518
01:42:04,496 --> 01:42:06,163
You always have doubts. He said
that he would take us to a safe place.

1519
01:42:06,246 --> 01:42:07,871
Now keep quiet.
What are you waiting for?

1520
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:10,264
- Drive fast. Come on, hurry up.
- That's the spirit.

1521
01:42:10,468 --> 01:42:12,163
Bye, Sarangi.
Come on, let's go.

1522
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:32,907
"Hail lord Shiva!"

1523
01:42:34,288 --> 01:42:37,339
"Hail lord Shiva!"

1524
01:42:43,371 --> 01:42:45,330
Paro, where did he go?

1525
01:42:46,371 --> 01:42:49,038
There's a miraculous
temple in this village.

1526
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,788
He went there to make
arrangements of our wedding.

1527
01:42:51,996 --> 01:42:53,746
I'm sure he left his phone
as he was in hurry.

1528
01:42:54,455 --> 01:42:58,830
Paro, we took a rash decision
and left our village by trusting him.

1529
01:42:59,413 --> 01:43:02,288
Please think if we are
taking the right decision.

1530
01:43:02,496 --> 01:43:03,193
Rama...

1531
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:09,163
Boss, I called you many times
but you didn't answer my calls.

1532
01:43:09,327 --> 01:43:12,421
We duped the bus owner
and took 10 lakhs from him.

1533
01:43:12,501 --> 01:43:13,955
The police has come
to know about our fraud.

1534
01:43:14,038 --> 01:43:15,163
They are looking for us.

1535
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:17,830
We've escaped.
You also go underground.

1536
01:43:18,038 --> 01:43:20,510
Got it, boss.
I'll hang up.

1537
01:43:23,663 --> 01:43:24,912
Who are you?

1538
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,413
You are helping us so that
you can steal our jewelry. Right?

1539
01:43:28,663 --> 01:43:31,330
Rama, I'm your friend Satish.

1540
01:43:31,413 --> 01:43:33,621
- Paro, why don't you tell him?
- Don't lie to me.

1541
01:43:34,288 --> 01:43:36,705
Do you know it's a sin to cheat a Brahmin?

1542
01:43:37,028 --> 01:43:38,663
Will you commit a heinous sin for money?

1543
01:43:39,913 --> 01:43:45,496
Yes, I accept that there was a time
when I only thought about money.

1544
01:43:46,246 --> 01:43:48,663
This is the first time
I'm helping someone.

1545
01:43:48,913 --> 01:43:50,663
You cheated us and
now you are giving excuses.

1546
01:43:50,746 --> 01:43:52,288
I didn't cheat you, Rama.

1547
01:43:52,496 --> 01:43:54,455
I've brought you to your family.

1548
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:55,788
I don't have anybody in this world.

1549
01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:57,430
But you're the only one in his world.

1550
01:43:57,849 --> 01:43:59,390
Who are you talking about?

1551
01:44:00,894 --> 01:44:02,455
I hope it's not him.

1552
01:44:04,996 --> 01:44:06,913
Yes, I'm talking about him.

1553
01:44:08,038 --> 01:44:09,705
I'm talking about your own brother.

1554
01:44:09,871 --> 01:44:12,913
I'm talking about Bhimaa who always
fights for the well-being of people.

1555
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:17,121
There's something which
only you can do for him.

1556
01:44:17,205 --> 01:44:18,626
So, I've brought you here.

1557
01:44:21,371 --> 01:44:23,663
Sir, the children you saved are orphans.

1558
01:44:24,121 --> 01:44:27,371
They've no identity so nobody
filed any missing complaint.

1559
01:44:28,955 --> 01:44:30,871
We tracked the phone
you gave us and found out that

1560
01:44:30,955 --> 01:44:32,205
it belongs to Bhavani's man.

1561
01:44:32,288 --> 01:44:34,788
He called the men of Tandav.

1562
01:44:39,996 --> 01:44:42,330
Tandav is Bhavani's right hand man.

1563
01:44:45,455 --> 01:44:49,830
Whoever went into the forest
to kill him never came back.

1564
01:44:51,246 --> 01:44:53,038
He's a monster in human form.

1565
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:56,621
He can smuggle anything
from herbs to women.

1566
01:44:56,830 --> 01:45:00,830
He has strong political connections so
we never got the permission to raid him.

1567
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:03,746
Tandav forcefully brought some foreigners

1568
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:05,580
and made them board Rudra's boat.

1569
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:19,413
Rudra will come back
to the village after two days.

1570
01:45:37,913 --> 01:45:40,330
Hey Bhimaa! Come out.

1571
01:45:40,413 --> 01:45:42,621
I was not here for some time
so you got the chance to act smart.

1572
01:45:42,705 --> 01:45:43,830
Come out.

1573
01:45:44,246 --> 01:45:46,871
I killed her husband.

1574
01:46:03,996 --> 01:46:08,580
A true man doesn't hurt a woman,
but respects her.

1575
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:16,729
A man can't bear pain
so God created woman,

1576
01:46:17,896 --> 01:46:20,080
so never hurt her.

1577
01:46:22,205 --> 01:46:27,288
The day a woman turns into fierce goddess,
there'll be catastrophe.

1578
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:16,580
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1579
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:21,455
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1580
01:47:35,955 --> 01:47:37,455
Sir, shall I put them behind the bars?

1581
01:47:37,705 --> 01:47:39,455
For what? To give them free food.

1582
01:47:39,538 --> 01:47:40,496
You're right.

1583
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:41,371
Hey!

1584
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:42,663
Understood, my Lord.

1585
01:47:42,746 --> 01:47:44,327
I'll take all of them to the hospital.

1586
01:47:44,538 --> 01:47:45,871
- Mani...
- Yes, sir.

1587
01:47:45,955 --> 01:47:48,205
- Take Nandini home safely.
- Okay, sir.

1588
01:47:51,621 --> 01:47:54,913
Tell your boss that
his son is safe with me.

1589
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,288
Why did you come here?

1590
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:23,205
Yes.

1591
01:48:32,746 --> 01:48:33,913
Bhimaa, what happened?

1592
01:48:34,121 --> 01:48:35,205
My shirt ripped off.

1593
01:48:35,288 --> 01:48:36,246
Take off your shirt.

1594
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,580
What are you saying?

1595
01:48:37,663 --> 01:48:39,496
We shouldn't wear torn clothes.

1596
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:41,413
It's okay. Doesn't matter. Forget it.

1597
01:48:41,496 --> 01:48:43,080
It's considered a bad omen.

1598
01:48:43,163 --> 01:48:44,996
- I don't believe in such things.
- I'm telling you, it's a bad omen.

1599
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:45,871
Take it off.

1600
01:48:45,955 --> 01:48:47,996
If I remove my shirt
people will think I'm mad.

1601
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:48,955
I don't have a spare shirt.

1602
01:48:49,038 --> 01:48:51,080
- We'll manage something. Hold on.
- Vidya...

1603
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:53,246
This one is dirty.

1604
01:48:54,746 --> 01:48:55,621
Not this one.

1605
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,580
This one is perfect, wear this.

1606
01:48:58,913 --> 01:49:00,455
Okay. Turn around.

1607
01:49:16,955 --> 01:49:17,634
Lovely!

1608
01:49:23,913 --> 01:49:25,413
What happened, boss?

1609
01:49:25,746 --> 01:49:28,413
You seem to be in a romantic mood.

1610
01:49:28,913 --> 01:49:30,496
But I'm still worried.

1611
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:33,246
I'll tell you a story
to change your mood.

1612
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:35,246
A story? Okay, tell me.

1613
01:49:37,038 --> 01:49:40,663
- The sky is a man... like me.
- Okay.

1614
01:49:40,913 --> 01:49:43,705
- The earth is a woman like you.
- Okay.

1615
01:49:43,955 --> 01:49:46,830
They are always upset
that they can never meet.

1616
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:48,705
So, God couldn't tolerate their pain.

1617
01:49:48,955 --> 01:49:50,580
He created the ocean.

1618
01:49:52,288 --> 01:49:56,330
If you see from far you'll see
the earth meeting with the sky.

1619
01:49:57,288 --> 01:49:59,538
That's why I brought you here.

1620
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:01,867
You narrate romantic stories really well.

1621
01:50:02,366 --> 01:50:03,908
I don't only tell stories.

1622
01:50:04,165 --> 01:50:09,248
I want to be close to you
like the sky that embraces the earth.

1623
01:50:09,996 --> 01:50:11,455
I've a small wish.

1624
01:50:12,205 --> 01:50:14,205
Sleep with your head on my chest.

1625
01:50:14,913 --> 01:50:19,955
You'll hear nothing but my heartbeats
and the sound of the waves.

1626
01:50:21,038 --> 01:50:26,455
Nobody should touch you except
the cool breeze and my warm breath.

1627
01:50:27,996 --> 01:50:31,705
Nobody should see us except the stars.

1628
01:50:36,871 --> 01:50:38,621
Somebody is staring at us from there.

1629
01:50:38,705 --> 01:50:39,705
Who is it?

1630
01:50:42,205 --> 01:50:42,996
Hey!

1631
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,205
- Hello, sir.
- Who are you?

1632
01:50:44,288 --> 01:50:46,121
- Bhimaa, stop.
- Sir... sir... - Why are you scared?

1633
01:50:46,205 --> 01:50:48,038
- Did you steal?
- No sir, that's not the case.

1634
01:50:48,538 --> 01:50:50,538
Any person will panic on seeing police.

1635
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:55,871
- What's in your hand?
- It's a plant, sir.

1636
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,080
Open the box.

1637
01:50:59,746 --> 01:51:00,705
Mother plant.

1638
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:03,913
Mother plant?

1639
01:51:05,538 --> 01:51:06,455
Where are you taking this to?

1640
01:51:06,621 --> 01:51:08,705
- I'm taking it to Ravindra Verma sir.
- Oh!

1641
01:51:09,038 --> 01:51:09,968
So, you're going to Guruji.

1642
01:51:10,705 --> 01:51:12,913
- Okay, take it.
- This is a rare plant.

1643
01:51:12,996 --> 01:51:14,371
How did you get it?

1644
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:16,580
This plant is found only in this forest.

1645
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:21,705
The plant on which maximum fireflies sit
on a new moon night is the mother plant.

1646
01:51:21,913 --> 01:51:23,496
Sir, I'm taking it with me.

1647
01:51:23,871 --> 01:51:25,746
It's time for Guruji to make medicines.

1648
01:51:25,913 --> 01:51:26,788
I must leave now.

1649
01:51:26,871 --> 01:51:28,372
Did Guruji call you at this time?

1650
01:51:28,621 --> 01:51:29,580
Yes, he called me.

1651
01:51:31,996 --> 01:51:32,831
Let's go, Vidya.

1652
01:51:33,496 --> 01:51:36,080
'Guruji doesn't meet anybody
after sunset.'

1653
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:39,371
- Come on, let's go.
- No. Stop.

1654
01:51:39,746 --> 01:51:41,455
- I'll be back soon.
- Wait, I'll come with you.

1655
01:51:41,535 --> 01:51:43,538
No... you stay here.
Rudra is here.

1656
01:51:43,621 --> 01:51:44,705
I'll be back soon.

1657
01:51:44,788 --> 01:51:46,371
Hey! Listen to me.
Where are you going?

1658
01:51:46,455 --> 01:51:47,538
Please wait, I'll be back soon.

1659
01:51:47,746 --> 01:51:48,663
Okay, come back soon.

1660
01:51:48,746 --> 01:51:49,537
Yes.

1661
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:09,621
There's a back entrance to the temple.

1662
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:30,913
Does it work?

1663
01:53:31,913 --> 01:53:33,288
Will he come back to life?

1664
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:37,621
If you would've known about me,
you wouldn't have asked this question.

1665
01:53:37,705 --> 01:53:39,496
Ayurveda is that great?

1666
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:41,663
Ayurveda is great, of course.

1667
01:53:42,038 --> 01:53:43,830
But Ravindra Verma is greater.

1668
01:53:46,121 --> 01:53:51,371
If we make some chemical
changes in the mother plant then

1669
01:53:51,448 --> 01:53:58,531
we can make Sanjeevani medicine
as mentioned in Charak Samhita.

1670
01:53:59,121 --> 01:54:03,538
It's a divine medicine which
only Ravindra Verma can make.

1671
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:04,996
But why children?

1672
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,996
The bodies of children are delicate.

1673
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:11,830
They're less polluted
and more immune and pure.

1674
01:54:12,663 --> 01:54:15,080
So, the results are remarkable.

1675
01:54:15,538 --> 01:54:16,913
Continue the experiment.

1676
01:55:52,371 --> 01:55:53,832
No!

1677
01:56:01,746 --> 01:56:03,371
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1678
01:56:08,121 --> 01:56:09,413
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1679
01:56:14,496 --> 01:56:16,330
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1680
01:56:20,788 --> 01:56:22,496
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1681
01:56:29,996 --> 01:56:31,288
Brother!

1682
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:39,080
Brother!

1683
01:56:41,455 --> 01:56:43,455
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1684
01:56:47,913 --> 01:56:50,080
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1685
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:54,580
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1686
01:56:58,996 --> 01:57:01,205
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1687
01:57:03,413 --> 01:57:05,413
Come on, lift the boat.

1688
01:57:12,038 --> 01:57:13,371
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1689
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:18,955
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1690
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:23,580
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1691
01:57:43,121 --> 01:57:44,580
Bhimaa!

1692
01:58:05,205 --> 01:58:06,455
Hey!

1693
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:12,580
If you step forward,
she'll die a terrible death.

1694
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:19,580
If I prick this half an inch inside,
her blood will clot

1695
01:58:19,871 --> 01:58:22,121
and her nerves will burst.

1696
01:58:23,038 --> 01:58:27,705
She won't shed tears but blood.

1697
01:58:30,371 --> 01:58:32,205
She won't be able to bear the pain.

1698
01:58:32,288 --> 01:58:34,455
She'll beg that I kill her.

1699
01:58:37,621 --> 01:58:40,746
Nothing can save her.

1700
01:58:41,038 --> 01:58:42,455
Do you know what's the value of a life?

1701
01:58:42,538 --> 01:58:44,913
Yes, I know the value of life
so I'm conducting experiments

1702
01:58:44,996 --> 01:58:48,871
to make the medicine that'll
bring dead people back to life.

1703
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:50,496
You're not bringing back people to life.

1704
01:58:50,705 --> 01:58:52,080
You're killing innocent children.

1705
01:58:52,163 --> 01:58:57,496
Ants die when elephants walk.
Will they stop walking to save them?

1706
01:58:57,788 --> 01:59:02,871
Many petty creatures will be sacrificed
to attain a bigger purpose.

1707
01:59:03,496 --> 01:59:04,580
Let it happen.

1708
01:59:04,663 --> 01:59:07,205
You're not an elephant,
you're a mad animal.

1709
01:59:07,288 --> 01:59:09,038
This is not craziness.

1710
01:59:10,163 --> 01:59:11,705
This is my knowledge.

1711
01:59:12,371 --> 01:59:15,663
I'll make Sanjeevani and win over death.

1712
01:59:15,955 --> 01:59:19,246
I'll bring the world to my feet.

1713
01:59:20,288 --> 01:59:23,871
Ravindra Verma is the God of future.

1714
01:59:24,163 --> 01:59:26,371
God doesn't turn into a monster
for his selfish gains.

1715
01:59:26,455 --> 01:59:30,246
No God can bring a
dead person back to life.

1716
01:59:31,163 --> 01:59:34,246
I'm greater than God.

1717
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:35,871
You've lost your mind.

1718
01:59:35,955 --> 01:59:37,371
You're not great.

1719
01:59:37,455 --> 01:59:38,788
You're a mental patient.

1720
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:40,121
You are right.

1721
01:59:40,205 --> 01:59:41,580
We're patients.

1722
01:59:41,663 --> 01:59:44,996
Do you know what's our medicine? Money.

1723
01:59:45,746 --> 01:59:49,871
Money will cure us of everything.

1724
01:59:50,121 --> 01:59:53,955
This inspired us to work hard for days.

1725
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:58,580
Now when we're going to get the result,
you've come to stop us.

1726
01:59:58,746 --> 02:00:02,871
If I step forward I know you'll kill her.

1727
02:00:04,163 --> 02:00:08,996
If I step further,
I'll kill you and you know it.

1728
02:00:10,205 --> 02:00:11,955
Let Vidya and the kids go.

1729
02:00:12,663 --> 02:00:14,330
I'll step back.

1730
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,663
That's not enough.

1731
02:00:15,746 --> 02:00:17,163
What else do you want?

1732
02:00:18,705 --> 02:00:20,594
I want your life.

1733
02:00:24,288 --> 02:00:27,171
If my life can save so many lives,

1734
02:00:28,101 --> 02:00:29,125
then kill me.

1735
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:34,621
No, Bhimaa!

1736
02:00:47,746 --> 02:00:48,830
Brother.

1737
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:02,205
Bhimaa!

1738
02:01:08,871 --> 02:01:09,996
Please stop.

1739
02:01:29,496 --> 02:01:30,788
No, brother.

1740
02:01:39,621 --> 02:01:40,705
Bhimaa...

1741
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:50,246
Ravindra Verma,
if any of them lose their life,

1742
02:01:50,955 --> 02:01:54,330
if you shed a drop of Vidya's blood,

1743
02:01:54,996 --> 02:01:56,663
then you'll be finished.

1744
02:01:57,913 --> 02:01:59,751
I'll come back again.

1745
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:06,788
Kill me.

1746
02:02:10,413 --> 02:02:11,288
Brother.

1747
02:03:00,205 --> 02:03:02,871
This dead body should be found.

1748
02:03:03,288 --> 02:03:04,496
How?

1749
02:03:05,246 --> 02:03:09,621
It should look as if both of them
have died in an accident.

1750
02:03:14,246 --> 02:03:15,871
'I've a small wish.'

1751
02:03:16,371 --> 02:03:18,455
'Sleep with your head on my chest.'

1752
02:03:19,038 --> 02:03:23,663
'You should hear only my heartbeats
and the sound of the waves.'

1753
02:03:24,996 --> 02:03:29,788
'Nobody should touch you except
this cool breeze and my warm breath.'

1754
02:03:30,163 --> 02:03:33,871
'Nobody should watch us
except the stars.'

1755
02:03:41,663 --> 02:03:43,205
I think an accident has taken place.

1756
02:03:44,288 --> 02:03:47,746
Put the dead bodies in the burning bus
so that nobody finds the truth.

1757
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:49,330
Our work will be done.

1758
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:58,818
'SNL Bus travelling from
Bangalore to Anantapur'

1759
02:03:58,898 --> 02:04:01,746
'met with a serious accident
at Anantapur Ghat.'

1760
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:04,621
Number 14. Unclaimed body.

1761
02:04:14,205 --> 02:04:15,371
Bhimaa is dead?

1762
02:04:19,038 --> 02:04:20,141
Rama...

1763
02:04:21,718 --> 02:04:23,413
Bhimaa is dead.

1764
02:04:24,996 --> 02:04:27,455
That day I got to know about your brother.

1765
02:04:41,121 --> 02:04:43,830
He sacrificed his life for a purpose.

1766
02:04:43,913 --> 02:04:46,996
I handed over my body to him
so that he can take revenge.

1767
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:48,669
But...

1768
02:04:50,121 --> 02:04:54,496
Only a person from my family
can fulfill my incomplete task.

1769
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:56,205
Somebody who has my blood.

1770
02:04:56,413 --> 02:04:57,871
My body is dead.

1771
02:04:58,163 --> 02:05:00,663
But my blood is still flowing
in somebody's veins.

1772
02:05:00,955 --> 02:05:04,663
My representative is alive
to take revenge for me.

1773
02:05:05,413 --> 02:05:07,629
My brother Rama.

1774
02:05:11,955 --> 02:05:17,330
Within ten days after my funeral
go to Mahendragiri temple

1775
02:05:18,038 --> 02:05:26,121
and make Rama remove the rudraksha
necklace and ask him to chant.

1776
02:05:26,705 --> 02:05:29,538
You've to make him do it.

1777
02:05:37,496 --> 02:05:38,515
Hey!

1778
02:05:50,246 --> 02:05:51,038
Rama!

1779
02:06:00,288 --> 02:06:01,996
No! Don't hit him.

1780
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:04,455
Is he still alive?

1781
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:11,246
Don't beat him.

1782
02:06:12,121 --> 02:06:13,479
Rama...

1783
02:06:36,371 --> 02:06:38,455
This is not him.

1784
02:06:39,163 --> 02:06:41,288
He is not Bhimaa, he's Rama.

1785
02:06:44,955 --> 02:06:47,705
How long will you take to make Sanjeevani?

1786
02:06:47,913 --> 02:06:53,330
Fool, poison came out first
during the churning of the ocean.

1787
02:06:54,246 --> 02:06:58,538
It'll take us time
to get the elixir we want.

1788
02:06:59,371 --> 02:07:03,371
Kill them and throw them into the ocean.

1789
02:07:04,621 --> 02:07:06,163
Don't do that.

1790
02:07:07,455 --> 02:07:09,955
We've conducted the experiments
on children till now.

1791
02:07:10,548 --> 02:07:12,590
Let's conduct the experiment on them now.

1792
02:07:14,566 --> 02:07:17,191
After that you can throw him
in the ocean.

1793
02:07:21,387 --> 02:07:22,784
No!

1794
02:07:28,147 --> 02:07:31,064
I'm not telling this
as I'm scared of losing my life.

1795
02:07:33,068 --> 02:07:37,901
I want you to call him
so that you can save lives.

1796
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:47,033
Once... just remove the rudraksha
necklace once... and call Bhimaa.

1797
02:07:48,443 --> 02:07:51,985
I'm sure he's here waiting for you
to call him.

1798
02:07:54,705 --> 02:07:57,996
Your brother was killed in this place.

1799
02:08:02,830 --> 02:08:04,746
We must accept the fact that

1800
02:08:06,663 --> 02:08:12,080
they're doing a heinous crime
by killing children.

1801
02:08:13,913 --> 02:08:19,955
But it'll be a sin if you sit quietly
when you can save them.

1802
02:08:20,621 --> 02:08:23,455
The sin which can't be cleaned
even with your blood.

1803
02:08:27,496 --> 02:08:29,080
Look there.

1804
02:08:30,746 --> 02:08:32,121
Brother!

1805
02:08:33,413 --> 02:08:36,121
The girl is calling you brother.

1806
02:08:36,455 --> 02:08:37,619
Help!

1807
02:08:37,871 --> 02:08:41,038
She thinks that you are Bhimaa.

1808
02:08:41,996 --> 02:08:44,746
You always considered Bhimaa a devil.

1809
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:49,830
God takes the form of devil
while slaying demons.

1810
02:08:52,996 --> 02:08:55,480
A man who kills to satisfy his pride
is a monster.

1811
02:08:55,788 --> 02:08:58,330
One who kills to save religion is God.

1812
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,037
The final decision is yours.

1813
02:09:01,496 --> 02:09:05,163
Is your hatred for Bhimaa
and your stubbornness more important

1814
02:09:05,621 --> 02:09:08,246
than the faith of these children?

1815
02:09:09,663 --> 02:09:13,038
Bhimaa. You hate this name.

1816
02:09:13,413 --> 02:09:14,873
Get lost.

1817
02:09:16,121 --> 02:09:18,038
You detest his name.

1818
02:09:18,121 --> 02:09:19,621
Bhimaa!

1819
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,663
But even now, he's our protector.

1820
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:28,788
Only he can punish them.

1821
02:09:31,538 --> 02:09:32,746
Bhimaa!

1822
02:09:33,371 --> 02:09:34,580
Bhimaa!

1823
02:09:34,871 --> 02:09:36,330
Bhimaa!

1824
02:09:38,705 --> 02:09:42,621
Hey Rama, call me brother once.

1825
02:09:43,205 --> 02:09:44,163
Get lost.

1826
02:10:04,996 --> 02:10:06,913
I'm calling you with love.

1827
02:10:07,246 --> 02:10:09,330
My brother, Bhimaa.

1828
02:10:10,496 --> 02:10:11,580
Come.

1829
02:10:59,205 --> 02:11:01,080
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1830
02:11:03,913 --> 02:11:05,955
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1831
02:11:08,788 --> 02:11:10,955
"Hey Bhimaa!"

1832
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,621
You owned a kingdom,
yet you were greedy.

1833
02:11:28,996 --> 02:11:31,455
An irreligious priest.

1834
02:11:33,288 --> 02:11:35,705
Whenever there is irreligiousness,

1835
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:40,121
God will take incarnation
to slay the demon.

1836
02:11:40,788 --> 02:11:45,038
Your betrayal has helped me.

1837
02:11:45,455 --> 02:11:50,955
For the first time my brother Rama
called me brother.

1838
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,080
I'm feeling proud.

1839
02:11:55,788 --> 02:12:02,080
You'll get joys in return
of the joy you gave me.

1840
02:12:02,996 --> 02:12:04,746
Joy of death.

1841
02:12:06,330 --> 02:12:09,205
"You are the beginning, the end."

1842
02:12:09,809 --> 02:12:11,121
"You're everything."

1843
02:12:11,371 --> 02:12:15,746
"We need not fear when you're with us."

1844
02:12:16,038 --> 02:12:18,746
"You are the beginning, the end."

1845
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:20,621
"You're everything."

1846
02:12:20,862 --> 02:12:25,163
"We need not fear when you're with us."

1847
02:12:48,746 --> 02:12:51,913
"You are the beginning, the end."

1848
02:12:51,996 --> 02:12:53,562
"You're everything."

1849
02:12:53,788 --> 02:12:57,996
"We need not fear when you're with us."

1850
02:12:58,663 --> 02:13:01,580
"You are the beginning, the end."

1851
02:13:01,663 --> 02:13:02,871
"You're everything."

1852
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:07,871
"We need not fear when you're with us."

1853
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:30,371
"Hail Lord Shambhu!"

1854
02:13:30,455 --> 02:13:32,121
"The lord of destruction.
Hail Lord Shiva."

1855
02:13:32,205 --> 02:13:33,830
"Hail Lord Shambhu!"

1856
02:13:33,913 --> 02:13:35,830
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1857
02:13:51,871 --> 02:13:54,455
This is a strong bond.

1858
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:14,955
I know that many spirits want
to take revenge against me

1859
02:14:15,038 --> 02:14:17,913
as I've killed many children.

1860
02:14:26,345 --> 02:14:30,705
Ghosts and spirits can't cross
this boundary and come inside.

1861
02:14:32,538 --> 02:14:36,205
I'm the future God.

1862
02:14:39,205 --> 02:14:43,996
You can't defeat me.

1863
02:14:53,538 --> 02:14:55,966
Whenever and wherever there
is decline in religious practice,

1864
02:14:56,121 --> 02:14:58,205
O descendant of Bharata

1865
02:14:58,955 --> 02:15:00,996
and rose of irreligion

1866
02:15:02,663 --> 02:15:05,038
at that moment I'll descend on Earth.

1867
02:15:05,705 --> 02:15:07,788
Do you think God will come here?

1868
02:15:08,955 --> 02:15:11,121
In which age are you living?

1869
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:15,205
Will Lord Vishnu appear here?

1870
02:15:16,955 --> 02:15:20,038
Will he hear the pleas of Prahlad
and come here

1871
02:15:20,121 --> 02:15:22,705
in the incarnation of Narasimha?

1872
02:15:24,121 --> 02:15:27,621
Will he appear like Lord Shiva?

1873
02:15:28,455 --> 02:15:30,955
Come on, call Him.
Let me see if He comes.

1874
02:15:31,184 --> 02:15:32,080
Call Him.

1875
02:15:35,496 --> 02:15:39,480
Lord Rama vanquished Ravana
who was proud of his strength.

1876
02:15:42,538 --> 02:15:45,871
In order to vanquish a devil like you
in this Kalyug...

1877
02:15:48,455 --> 02:15:50,413
to kill the evil...

1878
02:15:51,413 --> 02:15:53,580
Parashuram is here.

1879
02:17:35,001 --> 02:17:39,708
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

1880
02:17:39,889 --> 02:17:43,895
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

1881
02:17:44,588 --> 02:17:49,333
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

1882
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:51,550
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

1883
02:18:21,330 --> 02:18:24,913
Hanuman got Sanjeevani
so that he could save a life.

1884
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:27,330
A fraud like you won't get it.

1885
02:18:28,288 --> 02:18:31,621
You'll get death from me.

1886
02:18:32,705 --> 02:18:34,413
I'm the future God.

1887
02:18:34,493 --> 02:18:37,913
I'll keep the world at my feet.
You said it, right?

1888
02:18:39,330 --> 02:18:44,080
I'll kill you and send you to hell.

1889
02:19:22,390 --> 02:19:24,099
Both were born from the same womb.

1890
02:19:24,163 --> 02:19:26,455
But they never walked together.

1891
02:19:26,705 --> 02:19:29,871
I was a fool and misunderstood
your love for me.

1892
02:19:30,455 --> 02:19:31,871
Please forgive me if you can.

1893
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:35,509
I want to relive the moments
that I missed out in my childhood.

1894
02:19:42,371 --> 02:19:44,330
Rama, you've been blessed with a son.

1895
02:19:44,439 --> 02:19:45,397
Really?
