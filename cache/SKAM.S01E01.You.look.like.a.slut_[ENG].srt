1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,820
The global mentality is moving towards
free world trade and increased market liberalism.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,950
A world full of opportunities.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,780
A world where dreams can come true.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,590
It sounds fantastic,

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,600
and it is fantastic.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,740
For a very small percentage of us.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,920
But for the vast, poor majority,

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,300
the capitalist system
only means one thing:

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,440
death and suffering.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,500
While we live out our days thoughtlessly,
and stuff ourselves with cheap food...

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,460
the poor people of the earth
struggle in factories.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,660
Wages are forced down to the minimum,
while the work hours keep increasing.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,460
Unionization is illegal,
and the working conditions are intolerable.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,530
Before applauding freedom,
we must remember one thing:

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,610
Our over-consuming society stands on
the shoulders of the coffee farmers from Peru.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,030
We gorge on cheap food produced by 
underpaid children's hands from India--

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,480
SHAME

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,180
- Was it good?
- It was really good!

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,660
What about the title? Should I change it to:
"Working conditions are inhumane"?

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,980
- No, it was good the way it was.
- Yeah?

21
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,700
Is there anything else you thought of?

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,660
You know, you wrote
"gorge on cheap food" twice in a row?

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,260
- Yes?
- Maybe you could change that.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,610
No, no, I meant to write it twice.

25
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,940
Because I use repetition
as a literary tool to emphasize--

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,020
- Was it good?
- Yeah, that was good. Cleverly written.

27
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,270
Hehe! I got a 5.

28
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,380
5+? Nice. Really good!

29
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,900
- Eva, what did you get? Come on!
- I'd rather not talk about it.

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,660
The thing is, Jonas is your boyfriend,
so you have to tell him everything.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,480
Jonas is my bro, so he has to tell me everything,
so I'll know anyway.

32
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,260
It's true.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,020
Okay, yeah. I got a 4-.

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,060
You got a 4-?

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,560
- That's bad.
- Yeah. You're good at a lot of other things.

36
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,150
You're able to dress yourself,

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,830
you can brush your teeth by yourself.
Think of that.

38
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,780
Jonas, we're leaving.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,780
- Now?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,630
- Where are you going?
- To Elias'.

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,860
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

42
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,720
TUESDAY, 8:32 P.M.

43
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,260

44

TASK

TASK 1:

49
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
The subscriber cannot be reached--

50
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,580
- Hello!
- Hey!

51
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,020
- What's up?
- Nothing special, really.

52
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,540
- Are you with Jonas?
- No, not now.

53
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,980
Weren't you going to Elias?

54
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,460
- Yeah, but that was a few hours ago.
- Oh.

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,590
Did you see Sara's picture?
I think she got fake lashes.

56
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,540
- No way?!
- Yeah, check the picture on Facebook.

57
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,020
- What's up with those girls?
- I know.

58
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,210
Have you heard they started their bus already?

59
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,140
- No.
- One month into high school they started a bus.

60
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,020
With who?

61
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,500
With some other girls,
they're calling themselves the Pepsi Max girls.

62
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,070
You know you can just talk to her, right?
She won't bite.

63
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,760
- Jonas is here. I have to go.
- What are you going to do?

64
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,400
I tried to call you,
but you never answered your phone.

65
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,340
Yeah, my battery was dead.

66
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,420
- Can't you just charge it at home?
- I wasn't home.

67
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,540
- Where were you then?
- I was at Elias'.

68
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,620
- Until now?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,340
But I talked to Isak.
He said you guys left Elias' hours ago.

70
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,740
Why so many questions? Isak left, I stayed.

71
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,860
Don't you trust me?

72
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,020
Don't you trust me?

73
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,500
Huh? Why don't you trust me?

74
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,220
- You're heavy.
- You're crazy...

75
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,380
- 3+? You said you got a 4-!
- It's almost the same.

76
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,940
- "Whoever has expelled..."
- Jonas!

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,540
"...must be blamed for their behavior.
In psychology, as well as..."

78
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,700
- Jonas!
- "...is guilt a state one experiences."

79
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,020
"A state one experiences"?
That was really sweet.

80
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,580
- What do you think you're doing?
- A kiss.

81
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,500
"A state one experiences."

82
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,510
WEDNESDAY, 11:30 A.M.

83
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,260
Task 1:
A society is

84
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,500
- What's your name?
- Ingrid.

85
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,940
- Are you guys in the same class?
- 1STA, yeah.

86
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,260
It's 150 kroner per ticket.

87
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,500
It'll be good. Are you guys excited?

88
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,070
Hi! Are you joining the revue?

89
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,500
We're from the stage group,
and we want to have you!

90
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,100
What do you do in the stage group?

91
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,290
We're hammering till we wail, we're sawing till
we complain, we're measuring till we drink,

92
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,740
we're painting till we purr, like a cat!

93
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,560
We have a pre-party tomorrow.
You're going to the party, right?

94
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,140
You have to go to the revue-party,
everyone is going!

95
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
You're a first-year.

96
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,120
This is when you lay the foundation of
your social life for the next three years!

97
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Wake up!

98
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,770
Nah, but if you want to come to the pre-party,
add me on Facebook:

99
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,100
Argentina Mikolovna Hoshka!

100
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,570
I don't think anyone actually likes him.

101
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,080
And when the teacher asks
obvious questions...

102
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,860
THURSDAY, 8:30 A.M.

103
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,740
- Hey... can't we go to the revue-party?
- Why?

104
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:55,100
Because the entire school is going.
And we are first-years.

105
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,580
This is when we lay the foundation
of our social life.

106
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,510
"Foundation of our social life"?

107
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,260
Come on! It's a revue-party.
It'll be so much fun!

108
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,030
- I promise.
- Yeah, okay, I'll come.

109
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
If...

110
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,720
Isak can come to the cabin next week.

111
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,600
Please! I know it was supposed to be
just the two of us,

112
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,390
but it's autumn break,
and Isak has nothing to do.

113
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,500
He's just going to sit around, all alone.

114
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,300
You can bring a friend as well.

115
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,070
What do you say?

116
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,590
- Okay, Isak is allowed to come along.
- I can come along to what?

117
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,260
- My cabin.
- The cabin? I'm going to the cabin?

118
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,720
On one condition.

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,470
That you guys come to
the revue-party tomorrow.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,140
- We can't.
- Why not?

121
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,660
The Kindred Fever tickets.

122
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,210
I completely forgot about those!

123
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,590
Sorry, but I didn't remember them at all!

124
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,820
Don't walk away, Eva!

125
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,390
FRIDAY, 7:37 P.M.

126
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,970
He's been pretending to go to work
for the past five years.

127
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,870
I was playing Solitaire.

128
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,580
After leaving the Air Force,
I did feel pressure, to land a great job.

129
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,710
The first job Mike lied about was

130
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,300
the government contracting job
in Germany.

131
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,060
Mike had me quit my job of...

132
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,800
about eighteen years, and...

133
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,530
in retrospect, I think there were warning signs.

134
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,960
What do you hear me telling you?

135
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,570
I know, it's just...
it's hard, I don't...

136
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,510
I'm hard on myself, I feel
like stupid, I feel like...

137
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,820
you know, I'm gonna be judged,

138
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,330
that I'm an idiot,
I didn't see this.

139
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,210
You're gonna decide
that you're either gonna be

140
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,510
a broken betrayed victim,

141
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,670
who has lost all confidence

142
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,480
because you didn't see
what was happening to you,

143
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,960
or you are gonna say,

144
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,200
as expensive as it was,

145
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,800
this was tuition,

146
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,700
and my image is,
"I am a stronger woman for it.

147
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,380
"I will lead myself,

148
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,120
"I will lead my son,

149
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,390
"I will not be broken by this,

150
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,970
"I will stand strong

151
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,420
"and I will walk out of my history--"

152
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,180
Hi! You came!

153
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,900
You can't ignore me forever.

154
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,980
We have to have a talk eventually.

155
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
Ingrid...

156
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,420
I miss you.

157
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,340
Come on, say something.

158
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,630
I would've lost the eyeliner
if I were you.

159
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,990
You look like a slut.

160
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,860
Vilde snapped.

161
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,460
She seemed cool.

162
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,270
I think we have Spanish together.

163
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,390
- Noora.
- Eva.

164
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,810
Girls who call other girls sluts

165
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,260
have a 90% higher risk
of getting chlamydia.

166
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,220
- Seriously?
- No.

167
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,900
But it would've been very cool
if it was true.

168
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,500
- Are you okay?
- Yes... yes.

169
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,980
Are you sure?

170
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Maybe...

171
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,420
Maybe I can get a friend of yours?

172
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,860
- Maybe Chris?
- Chris?

173
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,050
It was 40,000 kroner.
I don't have that much money!

174
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,540
It's toilet paper, Vilde!
Toilet paper! It's not so bad.

175
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,840
We can't use that much toilet paper.

176
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,740
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I got Chris for you.

177
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,930
Here I am!

178
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,360
- This is Chris.
- I am Chris.

179
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,500
- Are you also called Chris?
- Oh, my god!

180
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,180
- Twin names!
- Yeah, twin names!

181
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,260
We were actually
in the middle of something...

182
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,940
Yes, of course.

183
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,060
- Come, we're leaving.
- What's up? Weren't we going to talk?

184
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,900
You! Where are you going?

185
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,100
Hey, don't be such a dick tease!
