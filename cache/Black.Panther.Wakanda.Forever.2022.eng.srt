17
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,095

daughter of Lumumba,

43
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,445
sovereign ruler
of the kingdom of Wakanda.

44
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,627
Mr. Chairperson,

45
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:04,215
I believe I speak for
all the member states here

46
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,093
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed

47
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,262
in Wakanda's failure

48
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,808
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

49
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,977
to tackle
international challenges,

50
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,562
to share resources,

51
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,856
and full cooperation

52
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,399
concerning vibranium.

53
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,710
I now give the floor

54
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,712
to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

55
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,681
It has always been our policy

56
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:57,769
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

57
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:02,148
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

58
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,821
but because of the dangerous
potential of you.

59
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,115
You perform civility here.

60
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,201
But we know what you whisper

61
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,579
in your halls of leadership

62
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,540
and in your military facilities.

63
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,672
"The King is dead.

64
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,427
"The Black Panther is gone.

65
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,599

"Now is our time...

"to strike."

68
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,431
Aneka, where is your spear?

69
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,016
Shuri gave me these to try.

70
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,646
You know, I like them better.

71
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,397
Our foremothers
gave us the spear...

72
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,150
because it is precise,
elegant...

73
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,861
and deadly.

74
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,158
It will not change
under my watch.

75
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,537
Yes, General.

76
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,956
I told you not to bring them.

77
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,961
Last night
there was another attack

78
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,547
on one of
our outreach facilities.

79
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,301
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

80
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,389
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

81
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,393
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

82
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,624
Let our gracious
response to this incursion

83
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,127
be an olive branch.

84
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,090
Further attempts
on our resources

85
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,468
will be considered
an act of aggression

86
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,181
and met with
a much steeper response.

87
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,351
We mourn the loss of our king.

88
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,771
But do not think for a second

89
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,149
that Wakanda
has lost her ability

90
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,776
to protect our resources.

91
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,072
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some

92
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,326
to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda,

93
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,663

I thought I had too.

101
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,520
They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance

102

of finding vibranium.

103
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,940
Oh, less than that.

165
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,085
Just get us out.

166
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,628
We're good.

167
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,046
- We're good.

168
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,256
Where is the strike team?

169
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,633
It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... They were blue.

170
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,801
Everyone is dead...

171
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,430
Shit. What is going on?

172
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,348
We're getting pulled backwards.

173
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,934
Oh, my God.

174
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,858
- Oh, God! Hang on!

175
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,728
<i>Queen Ramonda
of the nation of Wakanda</i>

176
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,938
<i>gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday,</i>

177
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,482
<i>while members of her military</i>

178
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,233
<i>escorted captive mercenaries</i>

179
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,777
<i>onto the floor of the UN.</i>

180
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,695
<i>A year has passed
since Queen Ramonda</i>

181
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,822
<i>was reinstated
as ruler of Wakanda</i>

182
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,407
after King T'Challa's
sudden death

183
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,451
<i>from an undisclosed illness
last year.</i>

184
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,787
<i>All eyes are on the tiny,
powerful nation,</i>

185
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,456
<i>as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...</i>

186
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,710
Approaching the river border.

187
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,718
We are home.

188
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,978
<i>Princess.</i>

189
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,104
Just a moment.

190
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,522
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,232
<i>I understand,
Princess, however...</i>

192
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,025
You're disrupting
my train of thought.

193
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,447
Shuri.

194
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,990
Mother.

195
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,158
<i>I was trying to tell you.</i>

196
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
<i>The Queen is here.</i>

197
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,454
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

198
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,788
I think that one day

199
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,166
artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

200
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,085
My AI isn't like the movies,
Mother.

201
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,879
It does exactly
what I tell it to do.

202
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,548
Yeah, if only children
were the same.

203
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,469
Everyone seems to be
working diligently.

204
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,681
Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.

205
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,475
There could be any number of

206
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,226
unknown threats on the horizon,

207
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,978
and they're creating solutions.

208
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,023
Oh, what is this?

209
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,816
Exo Suits for our army.

210
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,402
It grants the user
super-human strength,

211
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,654
speed, and durability.

212
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,157
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

213
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,492
What were her notes?

214
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,951
She hates them.

215
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,036
Oh.

216
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,667
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

217
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,961
Have you made
any progress on that?

218
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,254
<i>Excuse me, Princess.</i>

219
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,549
<i>Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.</i>

220
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,634
<i>Maybe you should...</i>

221
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,469
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

222
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,720
as I instructed.

223
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,305
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

224
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,350
We do not need the Herb, Mother.

225
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,394
We need new technology.

226
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,729
What of the Black Panther?

227
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,611
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

228
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,863
The Black Panther
is a relic, Mother.

229
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,449
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the Herb,

230
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,701
I was trying to save my brother.

231
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
Oh, Shuri.

232
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,679
Do you know what day it is?

233
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,763
Tuesday.

234
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,558
The date, child.

235
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,065
Brother's passing.

236
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,025
One year ago today.

237
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,245
Have you planned anything?

238
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,249
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

239
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,251
- Right now?
- Right now.

240
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,545
And you can leave
your Kimoyo Beads here.

241
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,754
- Mother.
- No, no.

242
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,673
You won't need them
where we are going.

243
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,426
Hmm?

244
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,389
And the other two. Yes.

245
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,000
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

246
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,669
It is the only way
you are going to heal

247
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,088
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

248
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,465
I'm fine, Mother.

249
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,843
You don't have to worry
about me.

250
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,723
He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.

251
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,642
T'Challa is dead,

252
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,603
but that doesn't mean
he is gone.

253
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,981
When that illness
took your brother from us,

254
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:05,653
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

255
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,530
But I still took time
in the bush.

256
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,951
I wandered until I found water.

257
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,494
And I sat.

258
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,789
Then I did this ritual

259
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,333
that I am about to show you now.

260
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,131
I found your brother
in the breeze,

261
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,803
pushing me gently, but firm.

262
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,973
Like his hand on my shoulder.

263
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,810
It took some time,

264
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
but he was there.

265
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,779
He wasn't there, Mother.

266
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,032
The presence that you felt

267
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,034
was just a construct
of your mind.

268
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,999
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

269
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,126
That's all.

270
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,878
Hmm.

271
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,885
What construct
does your mind create

272
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,013
when you think of your brother?

273
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,932
Does it offer you comfort?

274
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,685
Or torment?

275
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,450
Come, child.

276
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,212
How did you get this?

277
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,505
What does it matter?

278
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,133
What does this have to do
with your ritual?

279
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,636
Burning of the funeral garments

280
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,056
marks the end
of the mourning period

281
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,142
and the beginning
of a new relationship

282
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,478
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

283
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm not doing this, Mother.

284
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,274
If I sit

285
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,985
and think about my brother
for too long,

286
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,281
it won't be these clothes
I'll burn.

287
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,076
It will be the world...

288
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,037
and everyone in it.

289
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,372
Shuri...

290
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,755
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you

291
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,548
about your brother.

292
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,096
Mother, wait!

293
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,640
- What are you doing?

294
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,333
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

295
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,751
It isn't.

296
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,046
Stop! Right there!

297
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,550
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

298
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,594
This place is amazing.

299
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,597
The air is pristine.

300
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,058
And the water...

301
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,728
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

302
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,232
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

303
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,734
That never have to change
who they were.

304
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,404
What reason do you have

305
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,281
to reveal your secret
to the world?

306
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,325
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

307
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,369
Who are you?

308
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,745
I have many names.

309
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,457
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

310
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,087
but my enemies call me Namor.

311
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,425
The American military
detected vibranium

312
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,093
under my nation's domain.

313
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,639
I was able to
stop them from minin' it,

314
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,850
but we need Wakanda's help

315
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,685
to prevent it
from happenin' again.

316
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,772
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

317
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,442
Vibranium only exists here.

318
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,943
In Wakanda.

319
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,486
Mother, he's covered in it.

320
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,119
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

321
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,997
In response,
other nations have begun

322
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,498
searching the planet for it.

323
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,085
His choice has compromised us.

324
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,255
I think Wakanda
could find the scientist

325
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,632
and bring them to me?

326
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,386
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

327
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,014
You do not sneak into my country

328
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,808
and tell me what is fair.

329
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,355
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

330
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,858
And they have
incomparable strength.

331
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,487
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

332
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,954
When you have the scientist,
blow into this,

333
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,455
place it in the ocean.

334
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,916
I'll be there
shortly afterwards.

335
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,671
For your own sake,

336
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,090
don't mention anything about me

337
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,967
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

338
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,602
Did you see the wings
on his ankles?

339
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,203
How did he do that?

340
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,580
We must convene the Council.

341
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,209
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence

342
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,003
of any activity at all.

343
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:02,926
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

344
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,469
If my soldiers were present,

345
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,097
this "fish man"

346
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,099
would be bound before us
as we speak.

347
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,435
If your muscle brains
were present,

348
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,894
they would still be there

349
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,771
choking on their
fuzzy adornments.

350
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,106
You bald-headed demon...

351
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
Show some respect, you two.

352
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,234
Respect?

353
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,820
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

354
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,988
Watch your tone, Jabari!

355
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,961
As I was saying,

356
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,922
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

357
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,341
And nothing
on the radar as well.

358
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,969
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

359
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,637
He was not alone.

360
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,015
And claims to command
a massive army.

361
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:54,394
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

362
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,520
So he can kill them?

363
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,688
Do it.

364
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,776
We never had to face an enemy

365
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,611
with access to vibranium before.

366
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,572
And we have no Black Panther
to protect us.

367
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,282
That is because
this wise Council

368
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,951
allowed Killmonger
to take the throne

369
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,079
and burn up all of your
precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

370
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,664
M'Baku,
what would you have us do?

371
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,209
We should find the fish man
and kill him.

372
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,963
If we do
what he is asking for now,

373
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549
what is to stop him
from coming back

374
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,426
and asking for more?

375
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,895
As you were.

376
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:42,734
Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?

377
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,069
It's you.

378
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,780
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

379
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,365
This thing can detect

380
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,659
the altered frequency
of vibranium

381
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,954
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

382
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,831
Whoever built this is brilliant.

383
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,582
Come, look.

384
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,836
Some are custom parts
and others look like

385
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,754
they gathered it
from a junkyard.

386
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,173
I am still struggling to believe

387
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,218
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

388
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,637
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

389
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,514
Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

390
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,682
so it's reasonable

391
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,809
that the other one
just landed there.

392
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,061
This changes everything
that we know.

393
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,690
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

394
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,276
Those stories
are seared in my mind.

395
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,236
That sounds very painful.

396
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,532
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

397
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,869
- I do have an idea.
- Mm.

398
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,996
I'm going to need the princess.

399
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,165
Out of the question.

400
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,459
She is in no state
to be in the field.

401
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,380
it may
do her some good to get out.

402
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,508
It might just be exactly
what she needs.

403
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,012
Besides, I can do
this American operation

404
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,180
with my eyes closed.

405
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,475
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

406
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,059
This Namor,

407
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,479
he snuck past our defenses.

408
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,564
That will never happen again.

409
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,232
He was not alone.

410
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,151
She'll be with me.

411
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,403
So,

412
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,447
when are we leavin'

413
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,699
so I can see
my favorite colonizer?

414
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,586
<i>Can't stop</i>

415
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,421
<i>- Addicted to the shindig</i>

416
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,798
<i>Chop Top,
he says I'm gonna win big...</i>

417
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:31,885
Whoa.

418
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,137
<i>Distant cousin
to the reservation</i>

419
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,890
<i>Defunkt the pistol
that you pay for</i>

420
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,309
<i>This punk, the feeling
that you stay for...</i>

421
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,854
Come on.

422
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,316
Yeah, I got it.

423
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,610
I got it.

424
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,113
Will you slow down?

425
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,372
You didn't think to call?

426
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,915
Now, why would I have
your number?

427
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,794
We are looking for the scientist

428
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,671
who built
the vibranium detector.

429
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,381
So it was you guys
in the Atlantic?

430
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,092
Come on. Mining ship.

431
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,510
Lot of casualties.

432
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,220
What happened?

433
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,429
Seriously?

434
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,309
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

435
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,437
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

436
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,605
friends of mine.

437
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,065
Gone.

438
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,275
Just like that.

439
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,734
You throw in the fact

440
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,819
that they were tracking
vibranium...

441
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,572
I can assure you Wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

442
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,574
So who was it?

443
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,035
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

444
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,246
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

445
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,999
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

446
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,251
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

447
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,919
before anything else happens.

448
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,505
You owe me, Ross.

449
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,173
You owe my brother.

450
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,012
Okay, look.

451
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,056
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

452
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,309
for less than
I'm about to give you now.

453
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,727
And we got a new director.

454
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,770
She's watching me like a hawk.

455
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,523
We will be very, very careful.

456
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,775
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

457
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,444
The US needs another machine

458
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,112
and this kid is
the only person in the world

459
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,447
who knows how to build one.

460
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,573
So they're comin' for her.

461
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,490
A kid?

462
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,753
- Hey.
- You forgot to Venmo me.

463
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,089
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

464
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,924
Eight hundred
was yesterday's price.

465
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,176
It's a band today.

466
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,969
That's predatory. I...

467
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,930
I built the whole robotic hand.

468
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,558
You just corrected
the grip algorithm.

469
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,101
And what grade did you get?

470
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,567
Thanks.

471
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,738
Is that an iPhone I see?

472
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,822
Primitive.

473
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,203
We have located the scientist.

474
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,038
She is
in the American equivalent

475
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,873
of a Wakandan village school.

476
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,166
<i>A school?</i>

477
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,086
<i>Please tell me
it is a professor.</i>

478
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,046
It's a student, Mother.

479
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,631
We can't give her to Namor.

480
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,134
<i>Bring this student
back to Wakanda.</i>

481
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,766
I've got it from here.

482
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,185
Wait. Maybe I should
speak with her.

483
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,645
It will be more discreet.

484
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,064
I can be discreet.

485
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:35,819
What?

486
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,404
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

487
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,488
No.

488
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,698
It's the wrong shade, isn't it?

489
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,865
It's the right shade.

490
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,534
Fenty 440. You look good.

491
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,121
I can blend in as a student.

492
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,248
I can do this.

493
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,586
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

494
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,850
Yo!

495
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,101
Riri Williams?

496
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,064
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.

497
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,232
You gotta go to the website.

498
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,610
It's an encrypted file.

499
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,945
I wanted to airdrop it.

500
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,281
You the...

501
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:23,825
Whew.

502
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,493
You're Princess Shuri.

503
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,663
What the hell
are you doing here?

504
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,457
Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?

505
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,251
No.

506
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,587
I'm here about
the vibranium detector

507
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,172
that you built for the CIA.

508
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,842
I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.

509
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,594
I made that
for my metallurgy class.

510
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,763
- A school project?
- Yeah.

511
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,931
My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.

512
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,602
To be young, gifted,
and Black though, right?

513
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,899
Y'all probably don't say that
in Wakanda.

514
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,235
How old are you?

515
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,488
Nineteen.

516
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,156
Brilliance at a young age

517
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,784
is not always accepted
by the elders.

518
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,787
How long did it take you?

519
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,038
Couple months.

520
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,873
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was

521
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,792
finding big enough
mylar sheets to cover the...

522
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,086
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

523
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,254
Not just us.

524
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,340
This place is no longer safe
for you.

525
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,635
Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.

526
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,514
I got Differential Equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

527
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,017
Okay.

528
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,311
Okay.

529
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,688
You wait right here.

530
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,192
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

531
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,610
Ooh!

532
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,280
I had it under control.

533
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,700
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

534
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,536
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

535
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,371
Get out!

536
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,539
Hey.

537
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,542
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

538
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,626
- toward me!
- Oh!

539
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,877
See how they teach the children

540
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,254
to treat their guests? Mm!

541
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,259
Oh...

542
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,677
You brought a spear in here?

543
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,137
You brought a spear in here.

544
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,973
I like her.

545
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,641
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

546
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,226
- Put it down, put it...
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

547
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,894
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

548
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,646
It's all right, Princess.

549
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,064
Small, small girl.

550
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,068
I am going to give you
two options.

551
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,404
You can come to Wakanda,

552
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,865
conscious or unconscious.

553
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,410
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

554
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,537
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

555
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,499
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

556
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,043
- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.

557
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,879
Calm down.
We'll leave, okay?

558
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,714
And she can deal

559
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,466
with that merman
with the winged ankles

560
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,553
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

561
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,847
- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.

562
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,181
- Come on. Let's go.

563
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:53,933
What?

564
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,942
What exactly is this place?

565
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,653
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

566
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,241
He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.

567
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,327
I just have to grab
my work laptop.

568
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,832
Please don't touch anything.

569
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,126
You don't have to worry
about that.

570
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,711
It may not look like much,

571
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,796
but it's my life's work in here.

572
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,881
Mm-hmm.

573
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,384
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

574
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,552
Yeah.

575
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,597
And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?

576
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,725
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

577
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,020
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

578
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,105
Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

579
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,316
Had to build a functional
quantum computer

580
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,401
just to crack my own encryption.

581
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,946
What is it you're building
here? Is it Stark Tech?

582
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,447
I said don't touch anything.

583
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,240
<i>Princess,

585
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,243
- Shit.
- Who was that?

586
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,662
My AI.

587
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,748
They are surrounding us.

588
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,380
I thought you said a merman
was after me.

589
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,589
That's the feds.

590
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,480
Oh, I do not need this shit
right now!

591
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,774
I swear to God,
I was doing so well!

592
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,568
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

593
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,279
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda

594
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,031
is gonna show up at my doorstep

595
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,741
and then shit about to pop off.

596
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,826
I think

597
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,578
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

598
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,374
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

599
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,961

Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.

607
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,724
General,
they've got us surrounded.

608
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,475
Maybe we should just split up.

609
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,060
Out of the question.

610
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,353
Does this vehicle work?

611
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
No.

612
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,235
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

613
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,237
Don't even think about it.

614
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,406
Besides, there are three of us.

615
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,034
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

616

Whoo!

617
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,995
I knew it.

618
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,581
Don't tell me that
you built this in two months.

619
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,709
I spent years
on this. On and off.

620
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,670
- Nice. Have you flown it yet?

621
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:28,963
That thing can fly?

622
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,007
There's an entire
YouTube channel

623
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,884
dedicated to sightings of me.

624

Once we get to
the other side of the bridge,

00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,031

657
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,127
GRIOT.

658
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,587
Give me a visual.

659
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,964
<i>They want the glow
They want my soul</i>

660
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,590
<i>They want the wave I keep a clip</i>

661
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,675
<i>I keep a pole</i>

662
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,052
<i>Who want the smoke
Who want the fade</i>

663
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,097
GRIOT...
<i>Yes, General?</i>

664
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,057
...take me to the princess

665
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,893
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU,

666
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,353
you will not be able to process

667
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,230
basic input for a millennia.

668
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,565
<i>Just one moment, General.</i>

669
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,191
Okoye, I'm on my way to you.

670
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,277
<i>Bounce, crouch or get slouched</i>

671
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,653
<i>My whole hood devout</i>

672
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,282
<i>My mama taught me
not to be a harlot</i>

673
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,409
<i>My granny help me
take the wise route</i>

674
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,244
<i>Although I'm itty bitty
sitting pretty</i>

675
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,455
GRIOT, give me control
of this vehicle right now!

676
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,666
<i>I am clearing you a path.</i>

677
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,797
<i>She's all yours, General.</i>

678
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,757
<i>Manual drive engaged.</i>

679
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,520
<i>Look, I know you on my bumper</i>

680
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,397
<i>I know you want my thunder</i>

681
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,399
<i>Why the laws wanna take us under</i>

682
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,942
We need to find
an extraction point.

683
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,611
There's one across the river.

684
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,321
<i>I know you want my thunder</i>

685
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,156
<i>Why the laws wanna take us under</i>

686
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,116
<i>Why the hell am I in this jungle</i>

687
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,327
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off
the bridge.

688
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,708
<i>Princess,
there is a surveillance drone</i>

689
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,585
<i>- locked onto you.</i>
- How high?

690
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,086
<i>Thirty-thousand feet.</i>

691
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,464
<i>We don't cry 'bout
how they try take us all out</i>

692
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,507
<i>- Look
- They want the drip</i>

693
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,009
<i>They want my soul</i>

694
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,093
Hang on.

695
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,803
I got it.

696
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,475
Come on, Riri.

697
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,144
You gotta find
these differential equations.

698
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,104
Once the relative velocity
evens out...

699
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,065
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone

700
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,233
without an oxygen mask.

701
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,529
<i>Oxygen level is now 55%.</i>

702
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,616
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

703
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,328
<i>Oxygen level is now 30%.</i>

704
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,832
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

705
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,459
my Euler angles
and that should...

706
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,461
that should drop it
right on the...

707
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,803
<i>Oxygen, 0%.</i>

708
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,141
<i>The drone is no longer
tracking you.</i>

709
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,061
<i>Altitude, 500 feet and falling.</i>

710
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,396
<i>Riri! Are you okay?</i>

711
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,773
<i>- Riri!</i>
- Yeah.

712
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,444
<i>I'm good.</i>

713
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,405
Incoming!
Get out of the way!

714
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:24,865
- Shit!
<i>- And no worries.</i>

715
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,951
<i>I got a special delivery
for y'all in three,</i>

716
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,536
<i>two, one...</i>

717
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,163
Nice one, Riri!

718
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,581
<i>We got the glow We got the soul</i>

719
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:33,874
<i>We got the wave</i>

720
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,418
Whoo!

721
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,465
- Riri!

722
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,579
What just happened?
Shuri!

723
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,122
Shuri!

724
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,474
<i>The Princess's vitals
are stable, General.</i>

725
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,226
<i>She should regain
consciousness momentarily.</i>

726
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,763
Take another step closer

727
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,057
and I will kill you all.

728
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:14,975
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

729
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,693
Hey, is she blue?

730
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,574
Drop your weapon!

731
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,751
Okoye!

732
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,254
Wait!

733
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,713
<i>Activating interpretation.</i>

734
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:50,965
- I'm Shuri.

735
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,341
Princess of Wakanda.

736
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,593
I demand that you take me
to Namor.

737
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,845
Do not bring harm to this girl.

738
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,642
<i>Do we take them both alive?</i>

739
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,228
<i>- Yes, Attuma.</i>

740
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,662
<i>Breathe.</i>

741
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,589
Shuri!

742
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,693
Ross, from the Agency.
You got any witnesses?

743
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,070
None. But we think
it was the Wakandans.

744
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,447
Excuse me?

745
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,656
Our field office
got a tip from Langley

746
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,741
that they were coming.

747
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,701
Right. Who made that call?

748
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,120
- She did.
- Director de Fontaine.

749
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,915
Director de Fontaine.

750
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,000
Really?

751
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,084
Well...

752
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,962
Uh, Agent thinks
it was the Wakandans.

753
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,006
Yeah, we've been
on every one of them

754
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,090
since they took out our ship.

755
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,592
That's why I wanted you here.

756
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,761
You're lookin' good.

757
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,429
Oh. Well, I try.

758
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,097
You put that home gym in?

759
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,182
Yeah. Last year.

760
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,060
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

761
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,811
Howdy.

762
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,647
- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.

763
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,899
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

764
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,234
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

765
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,527
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

766
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,738
Um, we think it was a car crash,

767
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,657
but we're having trouble
finding the cars.

768
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,783
What do you mean?

769
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,159
It was just like this
when you found it?

770
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,869
Yes.
We think someone involved

771
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,953
got rid of the vehicles.

772
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,205
Got rid of them how?

773
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,748
They dumped them into the river.

774
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,124
You're kidding me.

775
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,752
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

776
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,296
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

777
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,548
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

778
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,384
Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?

779
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,678
It's an eight-hour drive.

780
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,137
Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

781
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,682
Actually, wouldn't mind...

782
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,934
Apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said

783
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,060
during our marriage.

784
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,690
They were blue.

785
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,567
And they had
superhuman strength.

786
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:19,321
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

787
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,865
I struck down three of them

788
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,409
with blows
that should've killed them,

789
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,202
but they rose again.

790
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,622
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

791
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,635
Okoye,

792
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,430
you will be
stripped of your rank

793
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,515
as General of Wakanda's armies

794
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,560
and your status as Dora Milaje.

795
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,902
You may.

796
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,324
I have given everything.

797
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:09,079
Let me die saving my country
and that throne.

798
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,208
Allow me to make this right.

799
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,585
"Make it right"?

800
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,339
I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.

801
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,760
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

802
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,178
Mmm.

803
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:29,224
She raised a spear against
her own husband for Wakanda.

804
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,935
Where is her
treacherous husband now

805
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,398
but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...

806
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,568
is with the ancestors.

807
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:44,448
I am Queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

808
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,826
and my entire family is gone!

809
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,455
Have I not given everything?

810
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,549
On your feet, General.

811
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,933
I stood by you

812
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,728
after Killmonger
took the throne,

813
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,482
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

814
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:22,277
while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.

815
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,072
And I warned you

816
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,033
about taking my daughter
on this mission,

817
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,118
and you lost her.

818
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,371
So, today,

819
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,457
I am done.

820
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,089
Are you here, GRIOT?

821
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,675
<i>Yes, my Queen.</i>

822
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,096
Were you with Shuri
when she was abducted?

823
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,556
<i>I was.</i>

824
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,475
Are you able to track
her Kimoyo Beads?

825
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,061
Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.

826
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,230
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

827
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,315
Hmm.

828
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,150
I can't see how
they figured out who built it.

829
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,652
That information
is highly classified.

830
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:49,907
What is that?

831
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,408
- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

832
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,828
Uh, Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

833
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,121
It's enough with the titles.

834
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,372
Just take it. I don't care.

835
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,665
Hey, honey sweetheart.

836
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,375
Ooh.

837
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,003
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

838
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,088
Actually, she's leaving.

839
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,256
All right.

840
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,884
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

841
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,768
Everett Ross.

842
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,061
Queen Ramonda?

843
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,188
What are you doing
with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

844
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,231
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

845
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,567
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

846
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,736
Do you have the student?

847
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,573
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

848
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:33,951
What? Taken by who?

849
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,579
My agency assumes it was you.

850
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,706
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact

851
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,042
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

852
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,919
Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.

853
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,921
But I can't if I don't know
what's going on.

854
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,799
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

855
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,176
A country
that's already on our radar?

856
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,260
Or you mean someone else?

857
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,346
<i>That is all I can say for now.</i>

858
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,514
Please,

859
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,600
alert me if your government
decides to act

860
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,268
on their suspicions.

861
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,520
Yeah. Sure.

862
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:06,108
Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

863
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,068
I owe Shuri my life.

864
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,739
GRIOT, did Shuri have
her earrings with her?

865
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,450
<i>I lost track of them
in the North Atlantic,</i>

866
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,787
<i>but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.</i>

867
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,920
-Hmm?
<i>Oui,</i> Miss Nakia.

868
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,640
Queen Mother.

869
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,770
Everything is a lesson here
for the children.

870
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,939
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,

871
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,400
and they grow
everything we eat here.

872
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,195
I recognize
some of the concepts here.

873
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,322
But you are using
different material.

874
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,825
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

875
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,164
You were missed
at T'Challa's funeral.

876
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,293
Oh...

877
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,135
Queen Mother.

878
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,263
It's been six years
since you left us.

879
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,600
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

880
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,854
I was afraid

881
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,526
of how final
the funeral would be.

882
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,654
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,

883
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:20,826
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan,

884
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,621
and you know
death is not the end.

885
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,509
How is everyone at home?

886
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:40,011
Shuri has been taken.

887
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,721
What?

888
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,142
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

889
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,895
I was a different person then.

890
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,023
I need someone who can find
where she is being held,

891
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:55,235
and rescue her,
without being seen.

892
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,446
Who on earth would risk war
with Wakanda?

893
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:01,908
Oh, my God.

894
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,285
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

895
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,828
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

896
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,996
Where the hell are we?

897
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,290
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

898
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,374
Oh, my God!

899
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,501
What is that?

900
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,421
Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

901
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,423
- Just calm down.

902
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,717
Okay, is there, like,
a new Black Panther

903
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,051
that you can call
to come and get us?

904
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,136
No.

905
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,220
Why not?

906
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,097
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

907
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,433
The Black Panther is gone.

908
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,185
So y'all stopped
having Black Panthers

909
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,269
when I get kidnapped?

910
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,534
Do you understand her?

911
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,203
Not completely.

912
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,497
Nuh-uh.

913
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,000
That is some supervillain shit
right there.

914
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,501
That's in every movie.

915
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,920
Princess Leia.

916
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,338
Belle from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

917
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,049
That white chick
from <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

918
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,258
It's fine.

919
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,886
You should see what I have
to wear at Warrior Falls.

920
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,729
Wait.

921
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,273
You're not leaving me in here,
are you?

922
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,816
I'm coming back.

923
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,693
I'm coming back.

924
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,779
Stay calm.

925
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,451
Princess.

926
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,619
Welcome.

927
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,040
Please, feel free.

928
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,590
This is beautiful.

929
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,176
That was my mother's.

930
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,772
These are all
Mesoamerican artifacts.

931
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,109
Most likely 16th century.

932
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,529
Have you been alive since then?

933
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,032
Your mother was human.

934
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:13,493
She was.

935
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,870
Then she became something else.

936
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,081
- How?
- "How?"

937
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:21,126
"How" is never
as important as "why."

938
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,847
<i>My mother and her village</i>

939
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,515
<i>were driven from their farms</i>

940
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,436
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

941
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,480
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

942
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,984
Facing starvation,

943
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,986
war, and disease,

944
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,238
my people turned to Chaac...

945
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,783
our god of rain and abundance.

946
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,830
<i>Chaac gave our shaman
a vision...</i>

947
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,583
<i>-...a way to save his people.</i>

948
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:09,966
<i>Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.</i>

949
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,648
<i>My mother was pregnant with me
at the time,</i>

950
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,067
and she did not want to
ingest the plant

951
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,445
for fear
of what it may do to me.

952
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,491
But the Shaman was convincing.

953
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,191
<i>They all fell sick.</i>

954
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,194
<i>And their lives,</i>

955
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,488
<i>their existence there,</i>

956
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:14,948
<i>ended.</i>

957
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,087
<i>The plant took away
their ability to breathe air</i>

958
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:33,049
<i>but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.</i>

959
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,137
<i>They settled in the ocean,</i>

960
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,933
away from war and diseases.

961
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,256
My mother gave birth to me there

962
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,801
<i>and I became
the firstborn son of Talokan.</i>

963
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,345
<i>The plant gave me wings
on my ankles</i>

964
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,931
<i>and ears
that pointed to the clouds.</i>

965
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,641
I was a mutant.

966
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,812
I could swim in the sky
and age slower.

967
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,481
Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.

968
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,318
<i>As she grew older,</i>

969
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,239
<i>my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...</i>

970
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,909
and died with a broken heart.

971
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,289
She made me promise

972
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,625
to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

973
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,674
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

974
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,310
Huh?

975
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,014
A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

976
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,058
As he died by my hand,

977
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,267
<i>he called me...</i>

978
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,900
The child without love.

979
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,902
And I took my name from there.

980
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,992
<i>"Namor."</i>

981
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,995
<i>Because I have no love
for the surface world.</i>

982
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,083
Why are you telling me
all of this?

983
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:16,629
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

984
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,381
What if we took her to Wakanda?

985
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,967
Let us go.

986
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,386
I give you my word.

987
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,012
She will remain in my country.

988
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,681
I cannot risk that, Princess.

989
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,474
Then keep me instead.

990
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,061
I'd love to see your nation.

991
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:36,023
Well, you can't go
down there in that.

992
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,529
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

993
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,948
Your blood will become toxic

994
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,450
and the pressure of the ocean

995
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,952
will break every bone
in your body.

996
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,290
Or you can wear a suit.

997
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,459
We have some of them. Come on.

998
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:58,546
Stay close.

999
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,570
<i>Hey! Namor, wait!</i>

1000
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,741
<i>Whoa!</i>

1001
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,612
<i>Hello.</i>

1002
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,308
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1003
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,478
<i>It's made of vibranium.</i>

1004
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,646
Yes.

1005
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,314
In the depths of the ocean,

1006
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,984
I brought the sun to my people.

1007
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,195
I know you wished me

1008
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,531
to spare the life
of the scientist.

1009
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,158
But now you see
what I have to protect.

1010
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,060
<i>Nakia, your hunch was correct.</i>

1011
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,230
<i>I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.</i>

1012
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,224
<i>The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern</i>

1013
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,853
<i>approximately 140 meters
below the surface.</i>

1014
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,773
Queen Mother,
I've found her signal.

1015
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,067
It's coming
from an underwater cave.

1016
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,069
If she's down there,

1017
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,779
I'm sure
I'll encounter resistance.

1018
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,656
<i>How would you like me
to proceed?</i>

1019
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:22,953
Retrieve the princess
by any means necessary.

1020
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,332
I will attempt
to draw Namor out.

1021
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,910
You are the first person
from the surface

1022
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,495
to come to Talokan.

1023
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:07,540
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

1024
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,299
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

1025
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,470
You are young, Princess.

1026
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:25,266
When you age as I do,
you realize

1027
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:28,185
we all lose everyone we love.

1028
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,937
But when I lost my brother,

1029
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,730
it just felt different.

1030
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,566
He suffered in silence.

1031
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,153
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

1032
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,947
How does that make sense

1033
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,577
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1034
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,496
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

1035
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:49,999
Why?

1036
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,962
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1037
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,633
My ancestors would often say,

1038
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,429
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1039
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,351
I admire
what you have built here.

1040
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:14,106
And how you've protected
your people.

1041
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,943
But as princess of Wakanda,

1042
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,571
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1043
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:25,367
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

1044
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,913
I'm not leaving without her.

1045
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:33,375
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

1046
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,756
It is no longer
about the scientist.

1047
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,468
For centuries,
the surface nations

1048
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,346
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

1049
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,473
Over resources.

1050
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,143
Since the day
I buried my mother,

1051
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:52,937
I have prepared my people

1052
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,147
for the time
they will come for us.

1053
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:59,526
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

1054
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:06,742
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1055
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,036
There is no in-between.

1056
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:14,875
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1057
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,795
and you want Wakanda
to help you?

1058
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:19,880
That's madness.

1059
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,050
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1060
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,677
if given a chance.

1061
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,930
If we make an alliance,

1062
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,808
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1063
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:35,604
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1064
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,399
the scientist will be returned
to Wakanda.

1065
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,610
And if Wakanda
does not accept, what then?

1066
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,655
The scientist will die.

1067
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:48,575
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1068
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,369
An attack on my people?

1069
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,162
Yes.

1070
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,707
And I want you to listen to me.

1071
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,835
Wakanda cannot win a war
with Talokan.

1072
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,890
I heard you that night,

1073
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,976
with your mother at the river.

1074
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,022
You said you wanted
to burn the world.

1075
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,696
Let us burn it together.

1076
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,497
Queen Ramonda

1077
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,249
won't sell us any vibranium.

1078
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,543
And now they abducted
a young woman

1079
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,878
who built the machine.

1080
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,338
Yeah, with all due respect,

1081
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:44,048
Riri Williams is a child prodigy

1082
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,342
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1083
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,968
The Wakandans
were recruiting her

1084
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,386
as part of their
outreach program.

1085
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,971
Nothing more. And then,

1086
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:53,515
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night

1087
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,684
to arrest the Crown Princess

1088
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,102
of an international superpower.

1089
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,940
The President wants
to take offensive action

1090
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:03,067
against Wakanda.

1091
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,362
What type of offensive action?

1092
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,614
Destabilization.

1093
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:13,118
Well, Special Officer Ross
is our expert.

1094
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,496
So, Ross, what do you think?

1095
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,164
My sources are telling me

1096
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,457
that there's someone else
out there.

1097
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,293
- Another nation?
- Could be. I don't know.

1098
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,378
You've gotta give me enough time

1099
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:23,545
to investigate this properly,

1100
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,756
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

1101
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,758
with a country
whose military capacity

1102
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,802
we can't even comprehend.

1103
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,388
Director?

1104
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,099
I think he's the expert.

1105
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:38,185
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1106
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:45,984
<i>Yes?</i>

1107
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:46,944
We have a problem.

1108
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,968
Is my daughter alive?

1109
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,095
The princess is alive and well.

1110
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,640
She requested
to be taken to Talokan.

1111
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,184
She will remain there
for the time being.

1112
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:26,066
What can I offer you
in exchange?

1113
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:27,484
Nothing.

1114
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,653
I beg to differ.

1115
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,490
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda

1116
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,118
for your attack
on their mining ship.

1117
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,246
Return my daughter
and the scientist

1118
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,000
or I will inform them
of your existence.

1119
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,842
If you tell the Americans
about us,

1120
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,512
if you try to find us,

1121
01:22:56,597 --> 01:23:00,392
or if I discover a single
Wakandan ship in the ocean,

1122
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,644
I will kill the princess.

1123
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,981
I will come to Wakanda

1124
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,108
and I will kill you.

1125
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,494
So, what happened?

1126
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,373
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

1127
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,334
and asked me to help him.

1128
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,256
I need to think.

1129
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,092
We ain't never
gettin' out of here.

1130
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:44,144
Ey!

1131
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:08,544
Shuri...

1132
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:16,802
Are you okay?

1133
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:18,971
Are you okay?

1134
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,472
- Give me your Beads!
- Let's go.

1135
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,015
Give me your Beads.
I can save her.

1136
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,100
We have to go.

1137
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:24,393
Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,

1138
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,561
but we need to listen to her.

1139
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:26,895
Listen, I hit her
with a sonic round.

1140
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,314
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1141
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,275
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1142
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,777
- We have to go.
- Wait!

1143
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,405
Did they hurt you?

1144
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,115
No. No.

1145
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,868
Thank you.

1146
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,581
- GRIOT.
<i>- Yes, my Queen.</i>

1147
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,708
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1148
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,054
Princess,
it is good to have you back.

1149
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,389
The city has been on edge
since you left.

1150
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,308
Go.

1151
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:36,061
Fortify the sonic barriers
for all waterways.

1152
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,229
Princess?

1153
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,147
Neka.

1154
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,485
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

1155
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:47,030
I just wanted to return these.

1156
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,408
No. Keep them.

1157
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,077
Might need them soon.

1158
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,996
Did you get that
from down there?

1159
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:01,336
Is it true you saw
an underwater empire?

1160
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,339
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1161
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,591
It is beautiful.

1162
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,470
But these people
are dangerous, Aneka.

1163
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,013
Mm.

1164
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:33,451
So, Miss Riri Williams,

1165
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,371
what do you think of Wakanda?

1166
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:38,540
The stories just don't do
this place justice.

1167
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:42,711
It's great.

1168
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,629
But I really
would like to go home.

1169
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,674
You will need to be patient.

1170
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,885
Can I at least call my mom?

1171
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,726
The Princess
has been brought home

1172
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,603
by the War Dog Nakia.

1173
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,146
Glory to Hanuman.

1174
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,689
Glory to Hanuman.

1175
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:07,319
Mm. The spy saves Wakanda
once again.

1176
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,362
The Queen will reward her

1177
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,032
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1178
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:15,952
Okoye.

1179
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,834
<i>After Thanos' attack,</i>

1180
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:25,420
when you left
without saying a word,

1181
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:27,213
it hurt.

1182
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:34,596
I regret not being there
with all of you.

1183
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,390
It was not easy.

1184
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,184
He was...

1185
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:43,688
King and Black Panther
to everyone.

1186
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,524
But to me...

1187
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,990
He was everything.

1188
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,827
My T'Challa.

1189
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:02,123
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

1190
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,751
I had to step away

1191
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,295
and let myself break.

1192
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,174
I couldn't just...

1193
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,512
keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

1194
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,306
Mm-hmm.

1195
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,322
We are under attack.

1196
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,289
Here.

1197
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:53,633
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

1198
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:55,593
GRIOT, activate the <i>Sunbird.</i>

1199
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,928
Shuri, where are you?

1200
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,555
Making my way
to the city right now.

1201
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,181
Stand down! That is an order!

1202
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,642
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1203
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,185
<i>Aneka,
do not let her leave the lab.</i>

1204
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:05,353
Mother, you're...
you're breaking up.

1205
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:06,438
- We can't hear you.
<i>- Shuri!</i>

1206
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,522
Love you. Bye!

1207
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:10,942
You just hung up on the Queen.

1208
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,110
I just hung up on my mom.

1209
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,862
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

1210
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,188
Invaders!

1211
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:56,988
-Mama! Mama!

1212
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,414
<i>EMTs are suffering</i>

1213
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:08,291
<i>a form of sonic hypnosis.</i>

1214
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,130
<i>General, plug your ears.</i>

1215
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:15,381
Yes, my Queen.

1216
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,930
- Can I help?
- Come, quickly.

1217
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:15,608
Cross your arms...

1218
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:22,365
Nakia.

1219
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,047
The fish man.

1220
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,167
<i>Phambili!</i>

1221
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,448
Shit, he's too fast.

1222
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:28,533
He's even faster in the water.

1223
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:55,935
- Activating system override.
- No.

1224
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:57,020
-Wait! I'll fix it.

1225
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:58,688
-Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1226
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:16,497
Do you see her?

1227
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:17,957
Yes. Right there.

1228
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:33,139
-Go, child.

1229
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,475
Wait, what?
And leave you here?

1230
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:36,559
Run!

1231
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,700
Okoye, move now!

1232
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,519
She did this.

1233
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:06,732
In one week's time,

1234
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:09,485
I will return
with my entire army

1235
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:12,905
and you will join us
against the surface world,

1236
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:16,033
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1237
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:19,996
Mother.

1238
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,165
- Keep her back!
- Mother!

1239
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:25,209
- Mama! Mama!
- Bury your dead.

1240
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,503
Mourn your losses.

1241
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,425
You are queen now.

1242
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:33,676
Mother!

1243
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:35,386
No!

1244
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:40,099
Get off of me!
Mother!

1245
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,727
Mama!

1246
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,611
Mama!

1247
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:53,112
Mama!

1248
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:54,864
Mother!

1249
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:03,748
Help me!

1250
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,208
Mama!

1251
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,842
- Mama!

1252
01:40:55,550 --> 01:41:00,721
Jabariland offers you
their comfort for your loss.

1253
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:09,021
You must mourn her

1254
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:13,109
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1255
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,904
Do not bury yourself
in your technology.

1256
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,322
Why are you here?

1257
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:21,909
I promised your brother

1258
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,370
that I would provide you
with counsel

1259
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:25,955
and protection.

1260
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:30,626
But I am in need
of your advice today.

1261
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:36,215
Your tribal elders
have approached me

1262
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:38,092
with a proposition.

1263
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,763
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp

1264
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,432
in Jabariland.

1265
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:47,768
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

1266
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:50,104
who scoffs at tradition?

1267
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,148
Mm.

1268
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:55,318
The world...

1269
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,905
The world has taken
too much from you

1270
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:03,909
for you to still be
considered a child.

1271
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:08,956
It is in my people's interest
to know

1272
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,500
which way your mind is leaning.

1273
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,087
The elders are desperate.

1274
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,633
The city is vulnerable.

1275
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:23,012
If you are to provide for them,

1276
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,390
they will be
in great debt to you.

1277
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:30,186
And what of your heart?

1278
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:32,313
Hmm?

1279
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:35,733
Which way is your heart leaning?

1280
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,571
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1281
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,743
My heart was buried with her.

1282
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,739
Oh, man.

1283
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:26,534
Yeah, your olive oil's
about to go bad.

1284
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:27,702
What...
What are you doing here?

1285
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:30,538
I'm hungry. And...

1286
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,957
<i>Tragedy strikes
the international community.</i>

1287
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,208
<i>Sources can now confirm</i>

1288
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:37,253
<i>that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.</i>

1289
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,463
<i>Western allies say
that civil conflict</i>

1290
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:41,590
<i>was the likely cause
of the Queen's...</i>

1291
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,136
So...

1292
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:46,846
You have any comment?

1293
01:43:49,014 --> 01:43:52,184
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

1294
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:54,019
What are you talking about?

1295
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:57,690
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1296
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:02,278
What about the Beads?

1297
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,572
What?

1298
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:05,740
The Beads.

1299
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:07,032
I had them bugged

1300
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,868
before you ever even got there.

1301
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:12,872
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

1302
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:15,624
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1303
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:17,168
May she rest in peace.

1304
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:18,878
But it's good.

1305
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:20,087
Well, for us.

1306
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,965
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1307
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:25,092
- They're a good people.
- Mm-hmm.

1308
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:27,219
You ever thought for a second

1309
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:29,013
what they could be doing?

1310
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,598
Ever thought
what we would be doing

1311
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,893
if the US was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

1312
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:38,439
Oh, I actually dream about that.

1313
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,943
Val. Val, please.

1314
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:44,945
It's Director de Fontaine.

1315
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,993
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1316
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,747
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1317
01:44:57,082 --> 01:44:59,460
We need to find a way
to weaken Namor.

1318
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,796
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1319
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:05,382
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1320
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:08,135
I thought
the Black Panther was gone.

1321
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:19,188
My brother is dead.

1322
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,526
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1323
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:42,837
GRIOT?

1324
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,631
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

1325
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,591
between our attempts at creating

1326
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:49,385
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1327
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,056
and the fibers
from this bracelet.

1328
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:55,933
<i>Yes, Princess.</i>

1329
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,981
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

1330
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:05,484
they may share
some base-level similarities

1331
01:46:05,568 --> 01:46:06,694
that we can exploit.

1332
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:08,153
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

1333
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:14,869
Please upload
my brother's DNA also.

1334
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:16,161
<i>Uploading now.</i>

1335
01:46:32,761 --> 01:46:34,889
<i>Who do I turn to</i>

1336
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:37,141
<i>When I need saving</i>

1337
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:39,977
<i>'Cause you move mountain</i>

1338
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:42,396
<i>I can't do the same</i>

1339
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,732
<i>And did you think about</i>

1340
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:47,651
<i>When you left us</i>

1341
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:49,069
Why doesn't he look like them?

1342
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,447
His physiology
is completely different.

1343
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:54,283
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1344
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:55,784
The women that were guarding us,

1345
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:56,869
they had water over their mouths

1346
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:58,662
and on their necks.

1347
01:46:58,746 --> 01:46:59,747
He didn't have that.

1348
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:02,333
Several organisms
don't need gills

1349
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:05,336
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1350
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:07,046
It's like a jellyfish.

1351
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:11,008
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1352
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:13,344
It's a process called

1353
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:14,637
- diffusion.
- Diffusion.

1354
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:21,435
<i>Memories, oh, carry me go</i>

1355
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:25,898
<i>Carry me go, oh, nowhere</i>

1356
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:29,902
<i>Sick and tired of it all
Take me far-away</i>

1357
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:32,279
<i>Mr Dj Gbemi trabaye</i>

1358
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:35,032
<i>Now I no fit trust anybody</i>

1359
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:36,867
<i>Na e make I no fit shout</i>

1360
01:47:36,951 --> 01:47:38,869
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1361
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,747
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

1362
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,290
is a day wasted.

1363
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,042
We must deal with Namor

1364
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,877
before he brings
his warriors back here.

1365
01:47:47,044 --> 01:47:49,713
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1366
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,383
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

1367
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,717
he jumped back into the water.

1368
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:55,636
What if that's what
makes him strong?

1369
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:57,721
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

1370
01:47:57,805 --> 01:47:59,348
from the water on his skin.

1371
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:01,558
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

1372
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:02,768
he won't be as strong.

1373
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,353
Yo, that's it.

1374
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:07,648
GRIOT. We need to convert
the Royal Talon Fighter

1375
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,274
into a pervaporation chamber.

1376
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:10,526
Is that even possible?

1377
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:11,860
Yes.

1378
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:15,280
You're going to help us
trap him.

1379
01:48:16,115 --> 01:48:18,117
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1380
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:19,827
Right this way.

1381
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:24,665
<i>How old were you</i>

1382
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:26,166
<i>when you built
your first machine?</i>

1383
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,418
<i>Three.</i>

1384
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:31,046
<i>My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.</i>

1385
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:33,674
<i>He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.</i>

1386
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:39,888
<i>So who taught you
how to do all that you do?</i>

1387
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:41,473
<i>My big brother.</i>

1388
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:47,855
I was the tip of
the spear of Wakanda's army.

1389
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:50,441
This is not me.

1390
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,110
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1391
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,571
I turned in my weapon.

1392
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:57,865
I built you a new spear as well.

1393
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:00,743
A new one?

1394
01:49:00,909 --> 01:49:01,952
Yes.

1395
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,664
What is this contraption's
name anyway?

1396
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:07,291
The Midnight Angel.

1397
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:08,917
Midnight Angel?

1398
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:14,048
This will even
the odds against them.

1399
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,675
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1400
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,720
Please.

1401
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:22,347
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1402
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:24,224
<i>Make me Mara eh</i>

1403
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,517
Shuri.

1404
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:27,352
Yes.

1405
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,564
How many of these did you make?

1406
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,651
I looked for you
at the Jabari outpost.

1407
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,487
I won't be forced out
of my home.

1408
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:39,198
You have such
a rebellious spirit.

1409
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:40,741
Why did you join the Dora?

1410
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:42,951
Why do you care?

1411
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:45,996
<i>As far as I can see
Na the memories</i>

1412
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,624
<i>Wey Dey carry me From reality</i>

1413
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:50,125
<i>E no require visa</i>

1414
01:49:50,209 --> 01:49:52,711
I still have a lot of fight
left in me.

1415
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:56,340
Tell me, Aneka,
daughter of Kyana,

1416
01:49:57,007 --> 01:49:59,218
do you still have
some fight left in you?

1417
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:01,804
What do you have in mind?

1418
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:05,349
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1419
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:15,776
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1420
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:18,362
<i>Make me Mara eh</i>

1421
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:20,948
<i>When my whole world
is set on fire</i>

1422
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,826
<i>Don't leave me alone</i>

1423
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:27,454
GRIOT,

1424
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:30,457
what's the confidence rate?

1425
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:33,377
<i>98.7%, Princess.</i>

1426
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:36,421
<i>Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?</i>

1427
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,014
Thought
you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1428
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:48,684
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1429
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:53,730
So...

1430
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:57,985
this is what you've been up to.

1431
01:50:58,777 --> 01:50:59,945
Yes.

1432
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:02,030
What you have here, now,

1433
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:07,494
is a chance to restore
Wakanda's protector.

1434
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:13,000
It would be the greatest gift

1435
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:15,794
since Bashenga's discovery.

1436
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:23,177
We'll soon find out. Come.

1437
01:51:26,305 --> 01:51:27,764
- GRIOT?
<i>- Yes, Princess.</i>

1438
01:51:27,848 --> 01:51:28,932
Print it.

1439
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:34,813
How will we know if it works?

1440
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:36,857
If it glows.

1441
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:52,998
I mean, shouldn't we be

1442
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:54,374
burning incense or something?

1443
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,084
Only Bast knows

1444
01:51:56,168 --> 01:51:58,170
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1445
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:10,349
Are you sure you don't want me
to bury you?

1446
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:11,516
No.

1447
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,144
Need you to have access
to my chest,

1448
01:52:14,311 --> 01:52:16,355
just in case
I go through cardiac arrest.

1449
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:18,482
"Cardiac arrest"?

1450
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:20,609
She's joking,

1451
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,402
right?

1452
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,405
-Right?

1453
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:34,206
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb

1454
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:37,626
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther

1455
01:52:38,043 --> 01:52:40,462
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1456
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:00,751
Mother?

1457
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:15,349
N'Jadaka.

1458
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:17,100
Lil' cousin.

1459
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:18,477
How?

1460
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,396
How is never as important
as why, right?

1461
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,441
You chose me.

1462
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:27,486
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

1463
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:29,321
Why did you take the Herb?

1464
01:54:30,322 --> 01:54:32,282
- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.

1465
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:35,160
You didn't believe
the Ancestral Plane was real,

1466
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,244
did you?

1467
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:40,374
No.

1468
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:42,376
So, why did you take it, then?

1469
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:45,462
You don't have to lie to me.

1470
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:47,798
So I can be strong.

1471
01:54:48,173 --> 01:54:49,674
Strong to do what?

1472
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:53,553
See?

1473
01:54:55,097 --> 01:54:57,057
We're more alike than you think.

1474
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:00,936
I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.

1475
01:55:01,103 --> 01:55:02,270
I'm nothing like you.

1476
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,482
You took it for yourself,

1477
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:07,192
then destroyed the rest.

1478
01:55:08,693 --> 01:55:09,903
Unworthy king,

1479
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,239
afraid of being replaced.

1480
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:14,324
Just a coward.

1481
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:15,492
No.

1482
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:16,618
I had the courage to do

1483
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:18,245
what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

1484
01:55:19,663 --> 01:55:21,164
How many people
like your scientist

1485
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:23,625
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1486
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:25,669
Cowards.

1487
01:55:25,836 --> 01:55:28,088
That was the Panthers
that came before me,

1488
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,173
and before T'Challa.

1489
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,092
Don't mention my brother.

1490
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:34,094
You're the reason why he's dead.

1491
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:37,848
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1492
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,267
Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.

1493
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:42,269
Their blood is on your hands.

1494
01:55:43,437 --> 01:55:44,771
That ain't on me.

1495
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:46,690
And don't you dare

1496
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:48,692
take that away from your mother.

1497
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,444
She sacrificed her life
to protect

1498
01:55:50,527 --> 01:55:52,362
a young girl
from the lost tribe.

1499
01:55:53,738 --> 01:55:56,408
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1500
01:55:57,909 --> 01:55:59,661
He would've killed that girl.

1501
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:02,289
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1502
01:56:03,874 --> 01:56:06,543
T'Challa was too noble.

1503
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,047
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

1504
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,843
And here you stand.

1505
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:22,642
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

1506
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:24,895
or take care of business...

1507
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:26,730
like me?

1508
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:30,567
Are you okay?

1509
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:37,532
Who did you see?

1510
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:44,039
No one.

1511
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:50,337
I failed.

1512
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:52,631
- It didn't work.
- Hey, Shuri.

1513
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,136
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

1514
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:59,763
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1515
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,681
- I re-created the Herb.
- Okay.

1516
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,808
I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?

1517
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:05,519
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

1518
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:06,728
Just relax.

1519
01:57:13,818 --> 01:57:15,111
Shit.

1520
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:20,784
Can I get some of that too?

1521
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:29,251
I think...

1522
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,254
you're going to need a suit.

1523
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:05,870
There are more
people coming from the city.

1524
01:58:05,954 --> 01:58:07,581
They need more space.

1525
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:08,748
So what?

1526
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,876
You are visitors.

1527
01:58:12,043 --> 01:58:15,255
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

1528
01:58:40,405 --> 01:58:42,699
-The princess!

1529
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:17,525
She has done it!

1530
01:59:18,234 --> 01:59:21,237
-The Black Panther lives!

1531
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:41,508
Namor believes
Wakanda is on her knees.

1532
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,428
Our Queen murdered.

1533
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:49,474
Our capital destroyed.

1534
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:52,977
He believes
we have no protector.

1535
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:55,980
But now...

1536
01:59:57,774 --> 01:59:59,776
now is our time to strike.

1537
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:03,530
How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

1538
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:05,824
We'll bring Namor to us.

1539
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,534
- Here, again?
- No.

1540
02:00:07,701 --> 02:00:10,036
A distant location at sea.

1541
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,621
All right.

1542
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:13,164
Let's say this does work.

1543
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:17,210
Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man

1544
02:00:17,377 --> 02:00:20,422
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1545
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:25,593
is murdering him
the right solution?

1546
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:28,012
You were calling for his head

1547
02:00:28,179 --> 02:00:30,515
when his only crime
was intimidation.

1548
02:00:30,682 --> 02:00:32,475
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1549
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:33,852
His soldiers

1550
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:35,729
did not call him
General or King.

1551
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:38,481
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1552
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:39,858
What is that?

1553
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:42,152
The feather serpent god.

1554
02:00:42,736 --> 02:00:43,737
What?

1555
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,822
Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,

1556
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:47,866
we do not have access to books?

1557
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:49,617
- Elders,

1558
02:00:50,034 --> 02:00:51,411
with your permission,

1559
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:55,290
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1560
02:01:05,425 --> 02:01:06,760
Namor's not finished.

1561
02:01:08,178 --> 02:01:11,264
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

1562
02:01:11,431 --> 02:01:13,767
Now is our opportunity
to take him.

1563
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:16,186
- What are you afraid of?
- War.

1564
02:01:16,603 --> 02:01:19,939
If Namor is indeed
a god to his people,

1565
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:22,734
killing him
will risk eternal war.

1566
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,985
And so what?

1567
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,863
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

1568
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:28,406
Of course it was.

1569
02:01:29,407 --> 02:01:33,495
Of course she was.

1570
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:38,708
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1571
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:40,960
Hmm?

1572
02:01:44,172 --> 02:01:45,882
And it is not what I want...

1573
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:50,261
for my people.

1574
02:02:00,605 --> 02:02:03,650
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1575
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:06,569
Of what she would've
wanted for me.

1576
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:09,948
Her hopes and her dreams.

1577
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:14,619
But she's dead.

1578
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:16,663
She's gone!

1579
02:02:18,373 --> 02:02:22,252
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

1580
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:24,963
So, her dreams,

1581
02:02:25,129 --> 02:02:28,216
her goals, her hopes for me...

1582
02:02:31,553 --> 02:02:32,804
it doesn't exist.

1583
02:02:35,515 --> 02:02:37,058
It doesn't matter anymore.

1584
02:02:39,143 --> 02:02:42,021
What matters is what I want,

1585
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:44,899
and what I want is Namor dead!

1586
02:02:48,903 --> 02:02:50,572
And you're going
to help me get it.

1587
02:03:06,838 --> 02:03:08,464
We leave in the morning.

1588
02:03:34,282 --> 02:03:35,283
Hi.

1589
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:36,451
Good morning.

1590
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:40,288
If we survive this,

1591
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:45,168
I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.

1592
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:50,340
Here. Take my hands.

1593
02:03:59,015 --> 02:04:01,517
Shuri, I want you
to be honest with me.

1594
02:04:01,684 --> 02:04:04,729
Who did you see
when you took the Herb?

1595
02:04:09,901 --> 02:04:11,611
If you go to war for vengeance,

1596
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:14,197
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

1597
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:16,658
It will only grow larger,

1598
02:04:16,824 --> 02:04:18,284
and it will consume you.

1599
02:04:20,536 --> 02:04:21,913
It already has.

1600
02:05:51,294 --> 02:05:52,587
For the Queen.

1601
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:27,497
<i>Phambili!</i>

1602
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:08,412
<i>Riri, how's it going up there?</i>

1603
02:07:08,913 --> 02:07:10,164
<i>Hey, Mr. GRIOT.</i>

1604
02:07:10,248 --> 02:07:11,707
I could really use
that backup right now.

1605
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:13,835
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

1606
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:20,633
<i>Shit.</i>

1607
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:26,472
<i>Shit, he's fast.</i>

1608
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,349
<i>But I'm faster.</i>

1609
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,565
Whoo!

1610
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:49,370
<i>I love you.</i>

1611
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:57,044
<i>It's on you now, Shuri.</i>

1612
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:07,597
- Princess.
<i>- No.</i>

1613
02:08:08,097 --> 02:08:11,601
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1614
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:15,271
<i>Pervaporation cells activated.</i>

1615
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:25,698
What's wrong?

1616
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:27,742
You need a glass of water?

1617
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:33,456
- Yo, we got him.
- Good!

1618
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:34,832
Namor has been captured.

1619
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:42,465
Back to Wakanda!

1620
02:08:48,179 --> 02:08:49,180
Move out!

1621
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:16,165
-What is going on?

1622
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,125
The sonic emitter
has been destroyed.

1623
02:09:40,356 --> 02:09:41,857
That can't be good.

1624
02:10:13,973 --> 02:10:16,142
<i>Panther, the
Sea Leopard has lost power,</i>

1625
02:10:16,225 --> 02:10:18,269
<i>and they are experiencing
significant casualties.</i>

1626
02:10:19,812 --> 02:10:20,813
Okoye.

1627
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:22,231
<i>Panther.</i>

1628
02:10:22,356 --> 02:10:23,357
<i>Phambili!</i>

1629
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:24,442
Aneka.

1630
02:10:25,693 --> 02:10:26,694
Okoye!

1631
02:10:26,777 --> 02:10:28,154
It is time.

1632
02:10:32,742 --> 02:10:34,118
Phambili!

1633
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:40,082
For Wakanda!

1634
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:42,001
<i>Wakanda!</i>

1635
02:10:50,343 --> 02:10:51,886
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1636
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:52,970
<i>Catastrophic.</i>

1637
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:54,430
<i>His spear is made
of raw vibranium.</i>

1638
02:10:54,513 --> 02:10:55,931
<i>The ship could explode
at any second.</i>

1639
02:10:56,015 --> 02:10:57,016
Get us to the desert.

1640
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:17,119
<i>- No!</i>

1641
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:15,553
I got you, sis.

1642
02:12:15,636 --> 02:12:16,720
<i>Hold on.</i>

1643
02:14:00,908 --> 02:14:02,117
<i>Get off me!</i>

1644
02:14:14,171 --> 02:14:15,381
<i>All right, come here.</i>

1645
02:14:45,995 --> 02:14:47,746
May the ancestors save us

1646
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:49,456
if the princess does not hurry.

1647
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:51,250
We may be going to join them.

1648
02:14:52,167 --> 02:14:53,252
If so, hey,

1649
02:14:53,419 --> 02:14:55,671
let us take as many of them
with us as we can.

1650
02:15:25,784 --> 02:15:27,202
It could've been different.

1651
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:51,185
<i>Are you gonna be noble</i>

1652
02:15:51,268 --> 02:15:52,269
<i>like your brother</i>

1653
02:15:52,353 --> 02:15:53,687
<i>or take care of business</i>

1654
02:15:53,854 --> 02:15:54,897
like me?

1655
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:56,607
I'm not my brother.

1656
02:15:58,025 --> 02:16:00,027
Namor will beg me for mercy

1657
02:16:00,694 --> 02:16:03,238
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1658
02:16:46,699 --> 02:16:48,409
- Wakanda forever!

1659
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:38,560
Shuri.

1660
02:18:40,103 --> 02:18:41,104
Mama.

1661
02:18:44,066 --> 02:18:45,359
Show him

1662
02:18:45,734 --> 02:18:47,277
who you are.

1663
02:18:54,117 --> 02:18:55,118
Yield,

1664
02:18:56,328 --> 02:18:58,664
and Wakanda
will protect your oceans.

1665
02:18:58,831 --> 02:19:01,083
We will protect your secrets.

1666
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:02,251
Yield,

1667
02:19:03,502 --> 02:19:05,212
and your people will live.

1668
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:11,635
Vengeance has consumed us.

1669
02:19:12,094 --> 02:19:14,721
We cannot let it
consume our people.

1670
02:20:10,736 --> 02:20:12,613
Wakanda forever!

1671
02:20:13,071 --> 02:20:14,656
Wakanda forever!

1672
02:20:38,889 --> 02:20:40,515
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le</i>

1673
02:20:43,894 --> 02:20:46,104
<i>-Oou le le</i>

1674
02:20:50,067 --> 02:20:52,694
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le</i>

1675
02:20:52,778 --> 02:20:57,199
<i>Oou oou
le le oou le le oou le oou le</i>

1676
02:20:57,282 --> 02:20:58,951
<i>Well, I pray that the universe</i>

1677
02:20:59,034 --> 02:21:00,535
Thank you, my love.

1678
02:21:02,245 --> 02:21:04,915
<i>Gives you way more
than you deserve</i>

1679
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,586
<i>When the tears fall
like shooting stars</i>

1680
02:21:10,003 --> 02:21:11,838
<i>Remember who you are</i>

1681
02:21:12,547 --> 02:21:16,385
<i>Just look up to the sky
You'll see</i>

1682
02:21:16,468 --> 02:21:19,262
<i>Well, I pray that the universe</i>

1683
02:21:21,431 --> 02:21:24,267
<i>Gives you way more
than you deserve</i>

1684
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:25,519
Yo.

1685
02:21:29,022 --> 02:21:31,149
-All set to head home?

1686
02:21:31,233 --> 02:21:32,317
As long as you're sure
the police

1687
02:21:32,401 --> 02:21:33,860
won't be waiting for me
at the airport.

1688
02:21:34,027 --> 02:21:35,654
Don't worry.
Took care of that.

1689
02:21:35,821 --> 02:21:37,114
But you might want to slow down

1690
02:21:37,197 --> 02:21:39,449
on your
homework-for-hire business.

1691
02:21:39,533 --> 02:21:41,910
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1692
02:21:43,203 --> 02:21:45,038
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1693
02:21:45,205 --> 02:21:46,206
Yes.

1694
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:49,751
Your suit.
It's a great design,

1695
02:21:50,293 --> 02:21:51,545
but can't let you leave with it.

1696
02:21:51,712 --> 02:21:52,921
It's all good.

1697
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:54,297
Figured the least I could do

1698
02:21:54,381 --> 02:21:56,049
is help Wakanda
clean up my mess.

1699
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:58,802
I have one more thing
to show you.

1700
02:21:59,219 --> 02:22:00,220
Come.

1701
02:22:04,224 --> 02:22:07,310
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

1702
02:22:07,477 --> 02:22:08,854
but it was worth it.

1703
02:22:09,521 --> 02:22:10,522
How did you...

1704
02:22:11,857 --> 02:22:13,400
It's my dad's car.

1705
02:22:14,651 --> 02:22:16,361
We used to work on it before...

1706
02:22:16,445 --> 02:22:19,031
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le</i>

1707
02:22:19,114 --> 02:22:21,199
<i>I'm coming back for you</i>

1708
02:22:22,325 --> 02:22:24,202
- You sure this is her?
- Every part.

1709
02:22:24,369 --> 02:22:25,829
Have it shipped to Boston.

1710
02:22:25,996 --> 02:22:27,289
Be there before you arrive.

1711
02:22:32,836 --> 02:22:33,837
Bring it in, man.

1712
02:22:37,424 --> 02:22:41,720
<i>Panther, Miss Williams'
transport has arrived.</i>

1713
02:22:42,345 --> 02:22:43,889
Look after yourself.

1714
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:46,641
Sure you're not trying
to slide to Chicago?

1715
02:22:46,808 --> 02:22:47,893
Catch a Bulls game?

1716
02:22:49,144 --> 02:22:50,687
Sounds fun,

1717
02:22:50,771 --> 02:22:53,607
but I have something
I need to take care of.

1718
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:20,801
And now I present to you

1719
02:23:20,967 --> 02:23:22,135
Princess Shuri,

1720
02:23:22,302 --> 02:23:23,595
the Black Panther!

1721
02:23:42,072 --> 02:23:44,908
The Black Panther
sends her regards,

1722
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:47,702
but she will not be
joining us today.

1723
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:50,789
I, M'Baku,

1724
02:23:50,956 --> 02:23:53,500
leader of the Jabari Tribe,

1725
02:23:53,667 --> 02:23:55,127
son of Wakanda,

1726
02:23:56,628 --> 02:23:58,380
wish to challenge

1727
02:23:59,464 --> 02:24:00,632
for the throne.

1728
02:25:32,432 --> 02:25:33,767
What the hell is this?

1729
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:36,269
-Can we turn around?

1730
02:25:36,686 --> 02:25:38,647
I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

1731
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,483
Why don't you go check it out?

1732
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:42,859
Okay.

1733
02:25:45,654 --> 02:25:46,947
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1734
02:25:47,364 --> 02:25:49,366
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1735
02:25:49,532 --> 02:25:51,243
How do you want us to proceed?

1736
02:25:51,326 --> 02:25:52,786
-What the...

1737
02:26:03,421 --> 02:26:04,714
Ah!

1738
02:26:04,798 --> 02:26:07,133
A colonizer in chains.

1739
02:26:07,801 --> 02:26:09,844
Now I have seen everything.

1740
02:26:09,928 --> 02:26:11,054
Funny.

1741
02:26:35,787 --> 02:26:36,788
<i>Merci.</i>

1742
02:26:46,715 --> 02:26:47,716
Hey.

1743
02:26:52,387 --> 02:26:53,805
It's good to see you.

1744
02:26:54,556 --> 02:26:55,765
Everything is ready.

1745
02:26:55,932 --> 02:26:57,309
Just give me one moment, eh?

1746
02:26:57,475 --> 02:26:58,810
Actually,

1747
02:26:58,977 --> 02:27:00,854
I think I should do it
on my own.

1748
02:27:02,063 --> 02:27:03,440
Of course.

1749
02:28:56,636 --> 02:29:00,056
<i>Lift me up</i>

1750
02:29:02,016 --> 02:29:05,437
<i>Hold me down</i>

1751
02:29:07,397 --> 02:29:11,609
<i>Keep me close</i>

1752
02:29:12,819 --> 02:29:16,197
<i>Safe and sound</i>

1753
02:29:18,283 --> 02:29:23,037
<i>Burning in a hopeless dream</i>

1754
02:29:23,538 --> 02:29:29,002
<i>Hold me when you go to sleep</i>

1755
02:29:29,085 --> 02:29:32,672
<i>Keep me in the warmth
of your love</i>

1756
02:29:32,755 --> 02:29:35,925
<i>When you depart keep me safe</i>

1757
02:29:36,009 --> 02:29:38,136
<i>Safe and sound</i>

1758
02:29:39,888 --> 02:29:43,224

<i>Drowning in an endless sea</i>

1763
02:30:06,623 --> 02:30:11,836
<i>Take some time and stay with me</i>

1764
02:30:12,170 --> 02:30:16,508
<i>Keep me in the strength
of your arms</i>

1765
02:30:16,591 --> 02:30:19,177
<i>Keep me safe</i>

1766

<i>We need light We need love</i>

1775
02:31:06,307 --> 02:31:09,435
<i>-Lift me up

1776
02:31:09,519 --> 02:31:11,771
<i>In your arms</i>

1777
02:31:11,854 --> 02:31:14,983
<i>-Hold me down

<i>We need light We need love</i>

1781
02:31:38,464 --> 02:31:39,465
Shuri,

1782
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,510
can we join you now?

1783
02:31:45,597 --> 02:31:48,641
This is my son, Toussaint.

1784
02:31:49,809 --> 02:31:50,810
Toussaint,

1785
02:31:51,477 --> 02:31:54,606
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1786
02:31:56,024 --> 02:31:57,025
Hi.

1787
02:32:17,962 --> 02:32:20,632
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

1788
02:32:20,798 --> 02:32:23,885
Away from the pressure
of the throne.

1789
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:26,471
Your father,

1790
02:32:27,096 --> 02:32:28,848
your <i>baba,</i>

1791
02:32:29,015 --> 02:32:31,684
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

1792
02:32:36,356 --> 02:32:38,399
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

1793
02:32:39,233 --> 02:32:42,153
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

1794
02:32:42,862 --> 02:32:45,657
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

1795
02:32:47,408 --> 02:32:48,993
Did my mother meet him?

1796
02:32:49,077 --> 02:32:50,078
She did.

1797
02:32:59,671 --> 02:33:00,797
It's nice to meet you.

1798
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:02,173
Nice to meet you.

1799
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:03,883
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1800
02:33:04,384 --> 02:33:06,511
It holds a great history.

1801
02:33:06,678 --> 02:33:09,972
Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.

1802
02:33:13,267 --> 02:33:15,436
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1803
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,521
Is that true?

1804
02:33:17,772 --> 02:33:20,566
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1805
02:33:23,569 --> 02:33:25,863
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1806
02:33:30,910 --> 02:33:33,121
My name is Prince T'Challa,

1807
02:33:33,204 --> 02:33:35,123
son of King T'Challa.

1808
02:35:02,376 --> 02:35:08,090
<i>I give my heart to this place</i>

1809
02:35:10,426 --> 02:35:16,808
<i>I give my soul or whatever it takes</i>

1810
02:35:16,891 --> 02:35:18,976
<i>Never run away</i>

1811
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:25,233
<i>I've got enough angels to storm the gates</i>

1812
02:35:25,316 --> 02:35:27,318
<i>I'm not afraid</i>

1813
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:31,447
<i>Behold the brave</i>

1814
02:35:31,531 --> 02:35:35,326
<i>And I'll have it, no other way</i>

1815
02:35:35,409 --> 02:35:41,374
<i>I missed the emergence
and these moments of you</i>

1816
02:35:41,499 --> 02:35:45,461
<i>The mere reflection of me</i>

1817
02:35:45,545 --> 02:35:49,382
<i>That mirror can't change its view</i>

1818
02:35:49,465 --> 02:35:52,301
<i>So until those rivers run out</i>

1819
02:35:52,385 --> 02:35:57,932
<i>It runs through me wherever you are</i>

1820
02:35:58,015 --> 02:35:59,851
<i>I'll be there</i>

1821
02:36:01,102 --> 02:36:04,272
<i>We carry on</i>

1822
02:36:06,482 --> 02:36:07,984
<i>Born again</i>

1823
02:36:08,067 --> 02:36:12,321
<i>I give my heart to this place</i>

1824
02:36:12,405 --> 02:36:15,783
<i>I give my heart to this place</i>

1825
02:36:15,867 --> 02:36:22,164
<i>I give my whole soul and whatever it takes</i>

1826
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:24,166
<i>Never run away</i>

1827
02:36:24,292 --> 02:36:27,295
<i>And I'd relive this</i>

1828
02:36:27,378 --> 02:36:32,508
<i>Just to see your face again</i>

1829
02:36:32,592 --> 02:36:38,139
<i>I know that you'll do the same</i>

1830
02:36:39,265 --> 02:36:40,766
<i>Born again</i>

1831
02:36:40,850 --> 02:36:46,105
<i>Just tell me what I need to do</i>

1832
02:36:48,983 --> 02:36:54,488
<i>I'd die and come back
just to love you</i>

1833
02:36:57,241 --> 02:37:03,915
<i>Just tell me I'm begging you</i>

1834
02:37:05,458 --> 02:37:11,297
<i>Just tell me what I need to do</i>

1835
02:37:12,256 --> 02:37:13,883
<i>Oh</i>
