1
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,667
"No love for the losers"

2
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,708
"When love is over"

3
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,125
"Morning bound train"

4
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:54,542
"Thoughts are having a tug-of-war"

5
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,292
"A lonely path"

6
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,417
"making the babe weep"

7
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:06,500
"How the stunned kitty make up to it"

8
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,417
"Scenaries that flashing by"

9
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,583
"how unwillingly to let it go"

10
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:20,000
"babe would become a passenger"

11
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:22,875
So Tung

12
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,042
Do you like it?

13
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,042
The lyrics are done an hour ago

14
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:26,958
Hot and fresh

15
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,375
- "Being a happy fool is a way of life as well"
- Jonny made the tune pretty catchy

16
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,792
- "Being a happy fool is a way of life as well"
- The market can use a song with a fuss

17
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,167
Well, that's true

18
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,667
But we invested a lotto work it in the web series

19
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,750
If the song doesn't go viral

20
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,625
It's GG for our company

21
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,500
She is a natural born diva

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,333
the fans will buy whatever she performs

23
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,083
Is that so?

24
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,375
- "How deep is babe's love"
- What are you worrying about?

25
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,875
- "How deep is babe's love"
- Just wait for the money to pour in

26
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,833
"scared the pants off"

27
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:54,708
Hold on a second

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,875
This is what I am worried about

29
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,625
Amanda

30
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,625
The lyrics

31
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,125
I can't really relate to it

32
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,458
Babe

33
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,250
scared the pants off

34
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,792
How should I sing it?

35
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,167
A-Lin, if we don't do the recording now

36
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,750
it would be too late for the mixing

37
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,542
Just give it a try

38
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:14,958
Ok

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,292
I am not doing it

40
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,333
You can sing the song on your own

41
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,792
Hey,babe

42
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:19,583
Uh no, A-Lin

43
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,875
I am a natural born diva

44
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,250
A-Lin

45
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,167
Can you do me this favor?

46
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,500
I would like to help

47
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:32,375
But I just can't sing it with my emotions

48
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,917
I know, I know

49
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,042
These phrases are very popular on the internet

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,583
But they are totally unrelated

51
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,333
to the tone of the song

52
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,833
How am I supposed to convey that?

53
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,417
Excuse me

54
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,375
What?

55
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,292
There is a song in my phone

56
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,458
It has not been published yet

57
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,458
I wonder if you can use it

58
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,750
No need

59
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,208
Play it, Hsiao-Yu, I want to hear it

60
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,375
Sure

61
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:01,167
"I don't envy the sun"

62
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:06,792
"it can't illuminate your past"

63
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,500
"there are certain darkness"

64
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:14,625
- "in both of us"
- What is the title of the song?

65
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,042
The lyrics are well-written too

66
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,708
The song is called A Kind of Sorrow

67
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,417
Maybe we can hire him to write the lyrics

68
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,958
so the song would still have a chance

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,667
Who wrote the lyrics?

70
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,208
I have no idea

71
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,583
A friend of mine, A-Pang gave it to me

72
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:31,750
Take me to him now

73
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,583
"If there is no need to speak up"

74
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,083
"then there is no need to"

75
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,042
"hide"

76
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,375
A-Pang

77
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,083
Hsiao-Yu

78
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:50,917
What brings you here?

79
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,167
Hi, I am Amanda

80
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,375
A-Lin's manager

81
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,708
A-Lin

82
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,750
The A-Lin?

83
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,083
Hi, how are you?

84
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:57,875
I am A-Lin

85
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,833
Here, come in please

86
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,000
Coffee on the house

87
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,833
Close the door for me, Hsiao-Yu

88
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,042
A-Pang

89
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,458
Do you know the lyric writer?

90
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,000
There is a song from our company

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,292
We would like to hire him to write the lyrics

92
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,417
do

93
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,542
She is called Cream

94
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:14,500
The Cream that did Face-to-face Breakup?

95
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,208
Yuan-Yuan

96
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,250
Yuan-Yuan Sung

97
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,917
Do you have her contact information?

98
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,667
Line, WeChat, or facebook?

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,625
No one can reach her now

100
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,417
Or anyone she knew?

101
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,208
Like the one that sang this Demo

102
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,375
He could probably reach her

103
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,958
The singer is Che-Kai Chang

104
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,667
Che-Kai Chang

105
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,292
- Does he know Yuan-Yuan Sung?
- Che-Kai Chang

106
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,375
Yes, he does

107
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,208
They fell in love with each other before

108
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,708
Great

109
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,750
Can you give me his phone number?

110
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,917
Please

111
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,500
This is really important

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,208
I need to find him no matter what

113
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,375
He passed away

114
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,667
He's dead

115
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,167
I remember it now

116
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,083
Che-Kai is K

117
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,833
We worked in the same record company

118
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,250
When I first joined the company

119
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,500
I met him once

120
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,083
then later he left the company

121
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,667
So it was him

122
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,458
It's really much too sudden

123
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,875
The story of Che-Kai Chang

124
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,625
began when he was 16 years old

125
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,250
His family left him that year

126
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,917
He began living on his own

127
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,042
in the old house that was piled

128
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,833
with his father's heirlooms

129
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,958
that he was too frustrated to organize

130
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,292
He kept everything to himself back then

131
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,625
as if he was destined to be alone

132
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,875
as if living itself is a painful thing

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,667
Until the day he met her

134
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,042
Eh

135
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:44,458
My treat

136
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,375
What are you doing?

137
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,583
You're smoking?

138
00:06:58,542 --> 00:06:59,292
Hey

139
00:06:59,292 --> 00:06:59,958
What class are you from?

140
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,792
How dare you smoke in school?

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
No, ma'am

142
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:03,833
it wasn't me

143
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,125
Get up

144
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,125
There's always student like you

145
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:07,625
Ma'am

146
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,333
- Don't grab my hair, ma'am
- breaking the rules

147
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,417
- with no discipline
- it hurts

148
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,208
No shame and manners

149
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,833
When Che-Kai Chang first met Yuan-Yuan Sung

150
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,625
it's love at first sight

151
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,542
I asked him how can it be love at first sight

152
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,292
since he didn't even introduce himself

153
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,375
He said

154
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,000
If love can be explained

155
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,875
no one in the world would suffer from it

156
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:31,917
Eh

157
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,875
Let's go home together

158
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,333
Hey

159
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,750
I got a minor demerit because of you

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,417
Don't be a square

161
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,833
It's just a minor demerit

162
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,167
I'll repay you with comics and instant noodle

163
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,250
Let's go

164
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,500
- Instant noodle
- that's right

165
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,875
- Three cups please
- you sure can eat

166
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,625
extra meet, egg, and vegetables

167
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,083
Since that day

168
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,583
Yuan-Yuan Sung has entered my life

169
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,250
and changed it too

170
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,875
Her free spirit

171
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,375
Her cheerful personality

172
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,625
Che-Kai Chang

173
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,500
opens up my heart

174
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,208
Which college?

175
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,417
- The same one
- What?

176
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,208
We got into the same college

177
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,958
We decided to celebrate our birthdays

178
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,500
Happy Birthday

179
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,458
Let's go

180
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:40,417
Wait

181
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,167
We have a lot in common

182
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,292
Enjoy reading comic books

183
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,083
Enjoy eating instant noodles

184
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:52,708
The one who loses will pay

185
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,625
Why are we competing over this?

186
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,667
Oh Che-Kai Chang, you are so generous

187
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,750
taking me to Kyoto for graduation photos

188
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,250
It costs you a lot right?

189
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,792
There are cherry blossoms

190
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,458
- You're so dramatic
- How nice of you

191
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,000
Ok, look over here

192
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,292
300 dollars for the Kyoto shot

193
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,625
I thought it's 150, master

194
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,875
There's two of you

195
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,000
Look over here

196
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,042
I just looked the other way

197
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,125
It's all right

198
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,708
I will count to three

199
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,625
one two

200
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,167
that's 600 dollars

201
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,292
That's a rip off

202
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,875
Here comes the best one

203
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,958
She likes challenges

204
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:29,708
And I

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,667
like to do the challenges with her

206
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,500
Hurry

207
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,750
We both enjoy eating popcicles in winter

208
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,167
We like the rain

209
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,250
like the seasons that we share

210
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,500
We became inseparable with each other

211
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,292
You live alone?

212
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,375
Since I was 16

213
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,792
I started living alone

214
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,125
Here

215
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,750
Here, clothes for you

216
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,750
Oh, right

217
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,917
I can't change with you being here

218
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,458
Go away

219
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
You're drenched, go dry it off

220
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,583
No peeking

221
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,375
- I won't peek
- Turn around

222
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,708
Eh

223
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,500
Fine

224
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,667
Childish

225
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,875
No peeking

226
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,583
I am watching you

227
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,083
I am not peeking

228
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,167
That's more comfortable

229
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,458
Eh

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,333
I should move in with you

231
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,042
This is a big house

232
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,167
I

233
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,542
I am used to living alone

234
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,750
I am alone

235
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:56,917
Get up

236
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:57,750
Look at the hours

237
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:02,375
Since that day, Cream moved in here

238
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,542
She opened up a window for me

239
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,667
a window that trapped me in loneliness

240
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,167
She dispels my sadness

241
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,375
and let me realize

242
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,667
after all

243
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,583
I deserve to have someone here for me

244
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,708
after all

245
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,625
when people get used to loneliness

246
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,792
that is much sadder than sadness itself

247
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,708
Che-Kai Chang

248
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,500
Che-Kai Chang

249
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,583
I don't like the sound of it

250
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,792
Let me give you a new name

251
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,292
What are you talking about?

252
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,292
You should be called K

253
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,083
K

254
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:45,917
Right

255
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,833
That's a nickname, not a proper name

256
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,917
I will just call you K anyway

257
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,250
so it will be your name

258
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,833
Why K then?

259
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,750
Well because I am Cream

260
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,625
As in cream from ice cream

261
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,042
Then why are you Cream?

262
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,833
Because I like to eat ice cream

263
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,250
You like to eat ice cream

264
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,000
then you should be called ice cream

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,833
Why just Cream?

266
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,000
Cream is buttermilk

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,125
It means milk

268
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,375
milk

269
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,042
Where are you looking at?

270
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,083
Your boobs

271
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,042
Cream from Ice Cream

272
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,250
There's no milk in cream

273
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,167
You're talking nonsense

274
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,000
Fine, Cream

275
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:16,833
Cream

276
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,417
Cream

277
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:19,333
k

278
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,042
Eh

279
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,000
They said that people with Roman feet

280
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,875
their moms would live longer

281
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,708
What's Roman feet?

282
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,333
Like yours

283
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,083
Thumb of the foot is longer

284
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,750
That's not right

285
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:50,750
My parents died in a car accident together

286
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,125
She didn't live longer

287
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,875
But my mom is still alive

288
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,708
She left you when you're a kid

289
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,708
She is not in your life anymore

290
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,958
That doesn't count

291
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,708
Or maybe I don't have Roman feet

292
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,375
Check it out for me

293
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,917
Don't block the movie

294
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:15,833
Come on, check it out for me

295
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,958
- Do you think it's Roman feet
- You're really annoying

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,417
- It stinks
- that hurts

297
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,792
I am warning you

298
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,708
If you dare to die before me

299
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,750
you are so dead you hear me

300
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,667
Stop interrupting the movie

301
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,208
It's really sad

302
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,125
Are you watching it or not?

303
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,042
I cherish the moment I spent with her

304
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,125
but just like a prisoner sitting in a cell

305
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,750
when one fell in love

306
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,625
it is hard to get out

307
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,875
I fall in love with Cream

308
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,417
I love everything about her

309
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,167
I want to live with her forever

310
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,125
But I can't

311
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,250
I wouldn't dare to tell her my feelings either

312
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,042
because

313
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,583
something inside me is about to
act up the cancer cells

314
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,208
K

315
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,667
K

316
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:46,833
Che-Kai

317
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,417
Che-Kai Chang

318
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,167
You stayed up all night in the office again

319
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,833
You want the money more than your life

320
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,542
Keep it down

321
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,042
You are sweating all over in your sleep

322
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,083
Did I?

323
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,042
Yes

324
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,292
Your clothes are all soaked

325
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,542
I am probably too tired

326
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,250
One of the employee Lisa is getting married

327
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,000
I have to work so hard to cover her

328
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,583
I beg your pardon

329
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,750
You suddenly took a leave for a week last time

330
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,500
I nearly passed out trying to cover you

331
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,708
Lady

332
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,875
I really did pass out

333
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,750
Right

334
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,000
Seriously, Cream can't know about this

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,625
I know

336
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,792
You have already reminded me

337
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,125
the thrid time

338
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,875
You swear?

339
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,250
I swear

340
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,583
Ok?

341
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,417
Thanks

342
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,167
Go home already

343
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,208
I am not finished

344
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:36,958
Health comes first

345
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,667
No problem, I am really healthy

346
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,458
Hello

347
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:42,625
Hello

348
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:45,000
Hi, I am Lisa

349
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hi

350
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,833
Hi, I am Amanda

351
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,042
I start working today

352
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,417
- Looking forward to working with you
- Hi

353
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,625
I am Che-Kai Chang, just call me K

354
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,708
Hi, K

355
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,625
I am a manager

356
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,667
I am managing Feng-Yi now

357
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:56,792
Hi, I am Feng-Yi

358
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:58,583
What do you think?

359
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,292
Do you like it?

360
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,417
Very well

361
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,208
You coached him well

362
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,292
Thank you, K

363
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:03,333
Looking forward to working with you

364
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,667
Ok, we should get going

365
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,750
Sure, keep up the good work

366
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,083
Sorry to bother you

367
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,292
Thank you for your time

368
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,750
That's too fake

369
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,875
Didn't your father school you as a kid?

370
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:15,333
Hey

371
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,042
Say hi to Bonnie

372
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,083
K

373
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,833
Bonnie's new style

374
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,542
How is it? Looks great right?

375
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,583
Hi, K

376
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,375
Bonnie is the Galaxy idol

377
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,833
Supernova pretty kitty

378
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:31,583
I think it's pretty good

379
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,375
Not bad

380
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,542
Sorry, Chi

381
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:35,875
Can you turn off the music first?

382
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,625
Let me introduce you

383
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,292
This is my talent manager

384
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,042
A-Pang

385
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,292
Hi, K

386
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:41,958
Hi

387
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,375
Chi

388
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,792
Let's talk in the conference room

389
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:48,667
- Good
- Eh

390
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,667
This way

391
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,125
"You don't have to speak"

392
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,167
"Just meow with me together"

393
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,042
"Meow Meow Meow Meow"

394
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,792
"Bonnie hug"

395
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,333
"You are the one I rely on"

396
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,333
"Kitty bomb Bomb Bomb"

397
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,583
Time out

398
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:06,625
Eh

399
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,625
Bonnie

400
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,250
It's all right

401
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,167
You did good at the beginning

402
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,042
Very subtle

403
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,917
Don't try to yell at the high pitch part

404
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:14,875
Your throat might get hurt

405
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,958
Try it later

406
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,875
Use your strength from the belly

407
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,875
Hold your bottom

408
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:18,750
Ok

409
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:19,958
She can do it

410
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,250
- Ok, go on
- Ok

411
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,125
"Meow Meow Meow Meow"

412
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,042
"Bonnie Hug"

413
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,625
"You are the one I rely on"

414
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,750
"Kitty bomb Bomb Bomb"

415
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,917
Hold on

416
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:35,667
Bonnie wants to change You are the one I rely on

417
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,000
into You are my eternity

418
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Is that all right?

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,167
Sure

420
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,125
Bonnie can do whatever you like

421
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,500
What are you doing?

422
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,042
Come on, Bonnie likes it to be more romantic

423
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,750
What's so romantic about eternity?

424
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,708
It has pink bubbles

425
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,500
What pink bubbles?

426
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,667
Eternity is not the theme of this song

427
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,625
Why are you acting like this?

428
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,625
Yeah, why are you acting like this?

429
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,792
It's none of your business anyway

430
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,667
This song is given to Bonnie by Chi

431
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,667
Bonnie can do whatever she likes to it

432
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,208
Chi, look at her

433
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,333
Lady

434
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,542
she wants to change one line of the lyrics

435
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,208
You are making too big a deal out of it

436
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,625
You have no right to tell her what to do

437
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,333
Who said I have no right to speak up?

438
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,542
No, I mean her

439
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,542
I wrote the lyrics

440
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,583
Why don't I have the right?

441
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,500
Eh

442
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,208
Bonnie and Chi said that you can't

443
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,583
then you can't

444
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,292
Who the hell are you?

445
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,292
You really want to change it?

446
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,042
Yes

447
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,333
Bonnie wants to change it

448
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,292
I will change it for you

449
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,583
Sorry about that

450
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,333
- Let me ask you again
- I told you I want to change it

451
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,625
You has-been lyric writer

452
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,917
What did you say? Calling me a has-been?

453
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey

454
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,375
Stop it

455
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,167
Chi said stop it

456
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,792
You can hit me if you want

457
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,708
Stop it

458
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,083
You really hit me

459
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,042
Is there anyone home?

460
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,167
Don't cry

461
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,417
It's fine

462
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,000
It's fine

463
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,833
Here

464
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,500
What's with the veil?

465
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,625
Are you getting married?

466
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:23,000
Wow, your face

467
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,667
Why are you injured?

468
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,250
Some kitty girl Bonnie

469
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,917
She wanted to change my lyrics to eternity

470
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,042
Eternity sounds so low

471
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,000
Then?

472
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,625
Then I beat her

473
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,208
You're too impulsive

474
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,875
I have straighten it out for you

475
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,542
Chi still appreciates your talent

476
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,583
but you scratched his favorite kitty girl's face

477
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,083
You should apologize to her

478
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,833
I don't want to

479
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,667
My face is screwed too

480
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,417
Look at my face

481
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:58,958
and my hands

482
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,833
I got hurt as well

483
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,208
You hear me?

484
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,542
I will go apologize

485
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,875
How is the lyrics working?

486
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,083
I am not in the mood

487
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,375
Throwing a fit now?

488
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,958
Come on

489
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,583
I am here, I can work it with you

490
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,917
I don't like eternity

491
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,125
Then throw it away

492
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:30,750
Change it

493
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,500
Next life

494
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:34,875
I can accept next life

495
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:36,958
Next life

496
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,708
Next life

497
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,042
It feels like an appointment

498
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,750
but eternity is not

499
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,208
if one of the two people is gone

500
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,500
it won't be eternity

501
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,667
Then tell me

502
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,708
If there is a next life

503
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,458
what would you want to be

504
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:58,708
A human being

505
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,750
Who wouldn't want to be a human being?

506
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,875
You can be a pig

507
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,917
Fine, seriously

508
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,250
If I have a next life, I want to be

509
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,417
a ring

510
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,917
Ring?

511
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,458
Or maybe

512
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:14,958
Hold on a second

513
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,125
Ok, go

514
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,292
Hi, I am K

515
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,083
If I have a next life

516
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,083
I want to be

517
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,708
a ring

518
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,250
a pair of glasses

519
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,542
a bed

520
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:36,625
and

521
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,542
a notebook

522
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,375
Why would you want to be these things?

523
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,625
So I can accompany you

524
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,750
You're so gross

525
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,750
Gross, how?

526
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,667
The lyrics can be a bit cheeky

527
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,000
Right?

528
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,833
Isn't it supposed to be eternity?

529
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,042
Why didn't you change it?

530
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,167
I changed it to the next life

531
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,375
is it ok?

532
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:16,917
Actually

533
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:18,667
it doesn't sound that bad

534
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,375
Glasses, key, comforter and ring

535
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,792
can be expressed as companionship

536
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:24,833
Bonnie likes it

537
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,958
The word eternity

538
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,750
if one person is gone

539
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,917
it would not sustain

540
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,417
But the next life

541
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,417
it sounds like

542
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:34,333
an appointment

543
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,792
if one person is gone first

544
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,125
they could still have a chance to meet

545
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,458
Bonnie thinks it's so romantic

546
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,083
That is exactly what I want to express

547
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,292
You totally get it

548
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,042
Really?

549
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:46,542
Then Bonnie has the potential

550
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,167
to become a great lyric writer?

551
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,417
I think you are very talented

552
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,583
It should be a piece of cake

553
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,667
Wonderful

554
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,583
Bonnie happy

555
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,750
Meow meow

556
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,042
About the incident last time

557
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,750
I am really sorry

558
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,583
It's fine

559
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,500
Bonnie doesn't mind

560
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,625
Bonnie forgives you

561
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,583
Bonnie knows that

562
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,875
writing is very difficult

563
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,250
But Yuan-Yuan you are doing really well

564
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,083
You can call me Cream

565
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,292
Ok, Cream

566
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,917
You can call Bonnie Hui-Chun Chen

567
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,083
Who?

568
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:15,292
Hui-Chun Chen

569
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,083
Oh your real name?

570
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,458
Bonnie is Hui-Chun Chen

571
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,542
Hui-Chun Chen is Bonnie

572
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:25,333
In order to make Bonnie a famous lyric writer

573
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,417
Starting today

574
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,500
Bonnie Hui-Chun Chen will be friends with Cream

575
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,458
Good

576
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,417
Bonnie's friend

577
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,958
is me Chi's friend

578
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,917
Chi and Bonnie's friend

579
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,167
is me A-Pang's friend

580
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,042
Chi and Bonnie and A-Pang's friend

581
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,875
is our friend

582
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:53,750
"Cat's tears are like pearls"

583
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,833
Ok, this love song will be the first hit

584
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,958
What do you guys think?

585
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,292
What's wrong?

586
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,250
What about Kitty Bomb ?

587
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,792
I think Kitty Bomb is a good first hit

588
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,000
Starting with a fast song will be more impressive

589
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and Kitty is great for singing and dancing

590
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,792
The song is pretty cute

591
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,792
Cream wrote the lyrics?

592
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:28,542
Hmm

593
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,292
Yeah

594
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:31,458
Haven't seen her work for a while

595
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,125
But I still think the lyrics are a bit off tone

596
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,958
But Bonnie likes it very much

597
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,208
Bonnie wants to stay ahead in the trend

598
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,208
Meow

599
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,792
You are way too ahead in the trend

600
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,208
I think the song is great

601
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:47,208
You definitely need a Music Video for it

602
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,458
- It has strong visuals
- Music Video?

603
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,667
If the MV is well-produced

604
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:51,875
I think the young people would love it

605
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:54,333
Fine

606
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,542
Then this song will be the title track

607
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,792
What about the second one?

608
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,500
Anyone has any ideas?

609
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,833
- I do
- Huh

610
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,958
Bonnie is my babe

611
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,875
We need MV for every song at all costs

612
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,333
Bonnie is so touched

613
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,042
Bonnie is going to cry

614
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:12,917
Huh

615
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,125
You're crying

616
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,792
This can be a promotion material

617
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,042
What?

618
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,792
It's the title track

619
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:31,333
Does it mean that because of you

620
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,250
my song get to be the title track

621
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,167
I told you many times

622
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,500
It is your own skills that did it

623
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,667
Whether Face-to-face Breakup

624
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:38,625
or this song, OK?

625
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,083
I have nothing to do with it

626
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,000
I think so too

627
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,708
- How dare you hit me
- You hit me first

628
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,500
So? So what if I hit you?

629
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,875
This is embarassing

630
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,167
Did Bonnie

631
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,417
come at a bad time?

632
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,083
- Not at all
- Not at all

633
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:57,875
Oh

634
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,542
Uh, what do you want?

635
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,500
To celebrate

636
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,292
Cream's song

637
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:04,833
has just been picked as the title track

638
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,042
Let's go to the karaoke

639
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,167
Bonnie's treat

640
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,958
Sure

641
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,583
Che-Kai

642
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,292
I suggest you quit your job

643
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,000
and rest yourself at home

644
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:21,750
So my disease

645
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,042
is starting to break out

646
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:24,708
Your symptoms

647
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,125
are the same as your dad's

648
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,500
A bone marrow transplant is your best hope

649
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:31,958
Take his blood pressure again

650
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:32,833
Ok

651
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,500
Tell me

652
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,250
Do you have anything

653
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,083
you want to say to me?

654
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:52,917
What's going on?

655
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,625
Looking for inspirations for songs again?

656
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,875
Don't avoid my question

657
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,000
Come on

658
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:58,292
I mean

659
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,500
What am I supposed to say?

660
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,500
Just tell me things that

661
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,167
you would like to say

662
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,500
but you can only say it

663
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,792
when there is no one around you

664
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,667
Why am I so good looking?

665
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,667
Not that

666
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,792
It's like the things

667
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:20,375
you would confess to a priest in a church

668
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,958
those kind of things

669
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,458
Well, then I am not going to tell you

670
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,625
you are not a priest

671
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,750
Don't avoid my question

672
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,375
I want to hear it

673
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,375
Well, there is one

674
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,875
I like you

675
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,542
I knew that already

676
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,792
Then why are you asking me?

677
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,542
I have another question then

678
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:50,875
You certainly have a lotto ask

679
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,250
So what?

680
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,292
What is your wish?

681
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,083
To live long and happy

682
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,708
Not this kind of wish

683
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,458
I mean

684
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,833
that

685
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,917
Is there anything you really want to do

686
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,333
but you haven't done it yet

687
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yes

688
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,000
I wish you

689
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,250
can find a nice guy and get married

690
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,708
I thought you said you like me

691
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,042
You can marry me

692
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,958
I am not a nice guy

693
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,333
What is the definition of a nice guy?

694
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:42,625
Got a job

695
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,250
Some money

696
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,917
Who is kind and loves his family

697
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,875
and

698
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,125
with good health

699
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:56,958
What's that supposed to mean?

700
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,167
Nothing really

701
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,708
Have your meal, I thought you're hungry

702
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:02,542
Eh

703
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,667
This is really delicious

704
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,042
You don't want it, I'll have it all

705
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,167
Cream

706
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,250
Do you like K?

707
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,292
Why would you say that all of sudden?

708
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:23,417
Because Bonnie can tell

709
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:24,958
there is something going on with you and K

710
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,500
Have you told him that before?

711
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,292
We are not like that

712
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,417
I don't get it

713
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,125
We live together

714
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,000
but we are not together

715
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,333
So roomates but not a couple

716
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,708
How is that possible?

717
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,042
Well, some people still do that

718
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,083
That's what we are doing

719
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,333
I am used to it

720
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,083
How long have you been like this?

721
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,625
Ever since high school

722
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,958
over a decade I think

723
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,083
10 years?

724
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:54,208
So what are you doing in those 10 years?

725
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,958
What can we do at home?

726
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,292
Doing laundries, cooking, having dinners

727
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,792
No sex?

728
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,250
We...

729
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,125
How many times?

730
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,292
5 times

731
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,750
Only 5 times in 10 years?

732
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,083
No

733
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,750
0.5

734
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,542
What does that mean?

735
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,167
It means

736
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,208
only

737
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,500
kisses and hugs

738
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,292
but not that

739
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:23,500
What?

740
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,000
We are not in a relationship

741
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:27,583
So

742
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,375
You don't like him?

743
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,000
It's not that I don't like him

744
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,042
but we are not in a relationship

745
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,667
I don't want it to be too complicated

746
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:39,750
Cream, you want to keep living like this?

747
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,458
Don't you want to tell him how you feels?

748
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,875
Actually

749
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,750
He told me to marry someone nice

750
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,542
Is he sick?

751
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,292
I am telling you

752
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,875
Men are so bitchy

753
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:55,625
You should

754
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,208
go find someone and be with him

755
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,333
If he finds out about it

756
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,917
he will try to win you back

757
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,125
Trust me

758
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,792
Behind you

759
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,708
Go forward

760
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,042
Gordon is about to puke

761
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,917
Who is that guy?

762
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,500
The vampire?

763
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,750
That's one of my high school classmates

764
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,083
He is a dentist

765
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,333
Lisa, I'll go grab a drink

766
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,250
Sure

767
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,792
Are you done with that?

768
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,667
You don't have a glass?

769
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,500
Hmm

770
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,625
Can I borrow it?

771
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,625
Thanks

772
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,208
This doesn't count as a kiss right?

773
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:08,833
Does it?

774
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,000
Huh

775
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:12,375
Nevermind

776
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,917
Just a kiss

777
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,125
Thanks

778
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,292
Gordon hit it

779
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,167
"Yu-Hsien Yang"

780
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,625
You have great dental health

781
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,000
Nothing serious

782
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,542
Doctor Yang

783
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,333
We have seen each other 2 days in a row

784
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,208
We kissed in the first time

785
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,292
and the second time

786
00:34:50,292 --> 00:34:52,458
I showed you inside my mouth for cavity

787
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,500
What are we doing for the thrid time?

788
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,000
I want to know you more

789
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,000
Do you want to do that?

790
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,000
Eh

791
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,417
I found a nice guy

792
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,125
Huh

793
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,458
What did you say?

794
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:21,958
I said, I found a nice guy

795
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,000
He is a dentist

796
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,042
Lisa's high school classmate

797
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,292
That's great

798
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,583
I've been waiting for the transplant for 7 years

799
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,500
How much time do I have now?

800
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,375
You need to come back regularly

801
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,500
If the status is stable

802
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,667
you can still live on with your life

803
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,375
Uncle Te

804
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,542
Stop trying to comfort me

805
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,167
My disease

806
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,000
is in accelerated phase now right?

807
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,875
How long do I have left?

808
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:40,917
Probably

809
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,625
no more than a year

810
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,542
Chi

811
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:59,583
I want you to investigate someone for me

812
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,833
Investigate

813
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,708
That is my specialty

814
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,417
But K

815
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,833
I want you to do me a favor too

816
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,542
This is a token of my gratitude

817
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:18,375
Bonnie's promotion is counting on you

818
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,208
Dental implant for Mr. Chen at 16:30

819
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:22,917
34, 35

820
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,000
Turn on the CT for me

821
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,375
and get the other equipments ready

822
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:25,875
Ok

823
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:26,625
Thanks

824
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,042
This is for you

825
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,875
Thank you

826
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,917
I wrote it

827
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,208
You are a lyric writer

828
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,542
Hmm

829
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,833
That's impressive

830
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:45,958
What are you doing after work?

831
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,167
Nothing

832
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,542
Buy me a drink

833
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,542
I got you a CD

834
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:57,792
Come on

835
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,250
You have nothing to do, right?

836
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,833
Can we have a drink?

837
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,708
Can I ask you something?

838
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:06,292
Guys don't like to tell the truth, right?

839
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,458
Like when you clearly love someone

840
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,625
but would just say you like her a bit

841
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,833
How hard is it to tell the truth?

842
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,708
You have no romance before, right?

843
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,792
I am engaged

844
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,125
Can I borrow it?

845
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,042
Only two things would happen in a romance

846
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,875
one would be like this

847
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,417
falling deep in love

848
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,208
the other one

849
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:13,250
is dredging up the sunken love

850
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,125
You said you want to know me more

851
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,125
Hmm

852
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,708
Why me?

853
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,667
If love can be explained

854
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:33,250
no one in the world would suffer from it

855
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,083
One more shot

856
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,417
Yu-Hsien Yang

857
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,583
His family does business for a living

858
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,208
He graduated top in the class of a dental school

859
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,042
Now runs a clinic with his friend

860
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:47,083
No criminal records

861
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,500
No vices

862
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,542
No special diseases

863
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:50,833
with perfect health

864
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,083
He has a fiancee called Cindy

865
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,500
Simply put, a winner in life

866
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,667
So the one next to him

867
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,042
that is his fiancee

868
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:58,833
Hmm

869
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,583
She is a professional photographer

870
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,625
often works with celebrities

871
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,292
Then the promotion photos of Bonnie

872
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:07,625
we should get her to do it

873
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,042
Yes, I will arrange that right away

874
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,542
It's so cold

875
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:24,458
You went drinking?

876
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,542
Hmm

877
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,083
With him?

878
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,250
Hmm

879
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,583
What do you like about him?

880
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,083
I have no idea

881
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,000
No idea

882
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,042
No idea

883
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,833
Stop talking, go to sleep

884
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:15,333
Right

885
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,292
Left

886
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,208
- So the hands should be like this?
- K

887
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,750
Cindy is quite a gal

888
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,708
An honest man like Yu-Hsien Yang

889
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,583
would have no idea that his fiancee

890
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,333
is such a popular figure out there

891
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,792
Give us some more time

892
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,458
I can prove it with videos

893
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,042
No need

894
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:34,500
This is enough

895
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:34,917
Ok

896
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:36,167
k

897
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,042
Why is loving someone

898
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,542
so freaking hard?

899
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,250
Chi

900
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,583
What do you mean?

901
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:49,042
Hey hey hey

902
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,833
Watch your hands, you want trouble?

903
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:51,500
Chi

904
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,000
He is teaching Bonnie how to dance

905
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What are you doing?

906
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Just give your instructions

907
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,208
No need to grope her ass

908
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,125
I can dance too, maybe I should do it

909
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,208
How can you teach Bonnie?

910
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,292
You are not professional

911
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:01,417
Stay out of this

912
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,500
What do you mean professional?

913
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,833
I am good at cutting people up

914
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:05,458
- He is great
- Should I cut him up now?

915
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,583
He sucks, I can hire someone better

916
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,792
Bonnie don't care, I want Michael

917
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,500
I don't care

918
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,917
Chi, K passed out

919
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,417
Where's Che-Kai Chang?

920
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,375
Why did you pass out suddenly?

921
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,375
I don't know

922
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,208
The doctor told me that

923
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,000
I have Congenital anemia

924
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,625
Congenital anemia

925
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:43,625
Hmm

926
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:50,500
The reason he passed out is

927
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,708
that he was too exhausted

928
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:54,500
and lacking a bit of calcium

929
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,125
Usually, this kind of anemia

930
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,917
would not affect your daily life

931
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:58,917
Miss

932
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:00,208
you don't have to worry

933
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,375
I'm fine

934
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,542
Really, it's fine

935
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:05,833
Lacking calcium

936
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,458
That's weird, I eat the same with you everyday

937
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,917
Why am I not lacking calcium?

938
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:11,958
Because you eat more than I do

939
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:12,625
Eh

940
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,458
You are the gobbling monster

941
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:19,625
Anyway, stop working overtime from now on

942
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,000
And take your calcium everyday

943
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,333
It'll be fine

944
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,542
Fine

945
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:28,375
Help me store this to the archive

946
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:29,125
Ok

947
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:29,792
Doc

948
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,000
Your mail

949
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,833
Oh

950
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,083
What's up?

951
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:20,917
Take a look at this

952
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:38,750
Shit

953
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:42,958
Premarital investigation?

954
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,958
I didn't do the investigation

955
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,667
someone sent it to me

956
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:50,167
We have been together for 6 years

957
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,375
I funded you to become a photographer

958
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,167
I want to give you a home

959
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,625
And this is how you repay me?

960
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:59,208
Yu-Hsien

961
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,917
You are the one that wants to get married

962
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,708
We have been through this a longtime ago

963
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:08,083
Love is never my first priority

964
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:09,458
Even if it's not your first priority

965
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,458
doesn't mean you can take it for granted

966
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,125
I don't want to explain everything to you

967
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:15,875
As long as I have a clear conscience

968
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:16,875
in the relationships that I want to cherish

969
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:19,000
You're saying that to avoid any consequences

970
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,000
I need creative works

971
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,583
So being with me is for your creation

972
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,625
That is a very mean thing to say

973
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,542
So the things you did isn't mean?

974
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:37,167
Does anyone that can fund you

975
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,250
is your love interest?

976
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,417
What is that supposed to mean?

977
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:44,750
Then what are your actions mean?

978
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,417
I won't deny what I did

979
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,792
If you just want my apology

980
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,458
I can tell you I am sorry

981
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,167
Who the fuck do you think you are?

982
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,833
You have no right to investigate me

983
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,250
I can find the surveillance camera
even without an address

984
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:41,333
Hey

985
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:42,875
What are you doing?

986
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:44,750
That's enough

987
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,125
Let go of me

988
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,792
And

989
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,917
My life doesn't concern you

990
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,083
Hey

991
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,083
Give me that

992
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:58,167
Sorry

993
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,125
I am just hoping

994
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,708
You can break up with Yu-Hsien Yang

995
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,708
Are you nuts?

996
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:08,250
I don't know what is your purpose

997
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:10,875
But if you dare come bothering me again

998
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:13,458
I will get back to you with all I got

999
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:29,208
Che-Kai Chang

1000
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,458
K

1001
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:34,875
I don't know what you are thinking

1002
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,625
investigating that crazy woman

1003
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,292
And ask her to call off her engagement

1004
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:39,250
What do you want?

1005
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,708
Are you insane?

1006
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:42,667
I am insane

1007
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:44,958
I just want Cream to find a nice guy

1008
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,833
How old is she?

1009
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,542
Can't she find it on her own?

1010
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,667
Look at me

1011
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,958
Do you think she can?

1012
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,167
She can't, really can't

1013
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,250
And I am really running out of time

1014
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,625
What do you mean out of time?

1015
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,792
I am running out of time

1016
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,875
If Bonnie's record hits the market

1017
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,750
and sells less than 10 thousand copies

1018
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,125
Chi is going to fire me

1019
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:10,500
A-Pang

1020
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:13,708
- I would have nothing to worry about then
- A-Pang

1021
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,667
You are just going to lose the job

1022
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:19,042
or are you going to die

1023
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:22,917
Look at me K

1024
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:25,125
If I didn't show up in time

1025
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,833
you were really going to die

1026
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,333
A-Pang

1027
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:33,208
Thank you so much

1028
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,250
What a bro

1029
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:36,833
My man

1030
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,042
Come on

1031
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,833
Fine

1032
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,167
Tell you what

1033
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:48,208
I will go to Cindy with you tomorrow

1034
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:49,292
to negotiate with her

1035
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:50,333
What'd you say?

1036
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:08,583
Remember to close the door

1037
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,500
Do you want a drink?

1038
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,333
No

1039
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,625
Hey, don't touch the flower

1040
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,000
I have been shooting it for a week

1041
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,708
Oh

1042
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:34,958
Eh

1043
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,083
What are you guys doing here?

1044
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,375
This is to compensate you

1045
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:56,208
I hope you can leave Yu-Hsien Yang

1046
00:49:56,917 --> 00:49:58,833
and call off the engagement with him

1047
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:11,917
Did you see my studio?

1048
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,583
He funded me to do the photography

1049
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,875
I can get where I am now

1050
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,292
I have to give him half the credits

1051
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,792
If he didn't make a move first

1052
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,375
I won't leave him

1053
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,958
You understand?

1054
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:30,917
I still want to ask you

1055
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,875
I have less than a year to live

1056
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:39,833
I am dying

1057
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:49,833
"Diagnosis: chronic myelogenous leukemia"

1058
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:53,917
First year in high school, my dad died of cancer

1059
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,292
Unfortunately

1060
00:50:57,292 --> 00:51:00,208
When my mom knew I got leukemia too

1061
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,500
She couldn't take it anymore

1062
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,667
She gave me some money

1063
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,292
The savings

1064
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:08,625
and left me

1065
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,667
should support you to adulthood

1066
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:13,417
Take good care of yourself

1067
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:14,875
Don't leave me

1068
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:16,958
Mom

1069
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,875
In my loneliest moment

1070
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,958
Cream appeared in my life

1071
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
and she became my family

1072
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,917
and the one I love the dearest

1073
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:39,042
One Two

1074
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:43,458
Here

1075
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:45,000
Birthday gift

1076
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:46,875
You like rainy days, right?

1077
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,458
A black cloud for you

1078
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:54,375
Thanks, happy birthday to you too

1079
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,375
But today is not my birthday

1080
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,333
How many birthdays do you want?

1081
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,292
From now on this day will be your birthday

1082
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,958
but my leukemia has entered the accelerated phase

1083
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:06,583
I can't tell Cream...

1084
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,167
...what happened to me

1085
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,792
She might not do what my mom did

1086
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:13,333
just leave me because of pain and fear

1087
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:16,458
but I don't know what she would do

1088
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,250
and a blow like this

1089
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,333
I don't want her to take it

1090
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,083
I am really sorry

1091
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:29,083
my love one falls for your fiance

1092
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,208
I am begging you

1093
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:33,583
k

1094
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,292
Sorry

1095
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:44,792
I am probably pushing it too hard

1096
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:46,583
This is my business card

1097
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:49,333
If you change your mind

1098
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,875
Please contact me right away

1099
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,458
I can agree to your deal

1100
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,333
only under one condition

1101
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:09,958
I promise you

1102
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,750
I am going to present an exhibition

1103
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,708
the theme is about Death and Deadline

1104
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,000
Since you said you are going to die

1105
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,833
then you should be my model

1106
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,500
let me take your photos

1107
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:28,000
as my work for the exhibition

1108
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,208
I will go break up with him

1109
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,875
You're being ridiculous

1110
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,958
Anyway, this is my deal

1111
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,542
take it or leave it

1112
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:40,500
Let's go K

1113
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,458
Night snack time

1114
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,042
Why aren't you eating?

1115
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:05,167
The food is getting cold

1116
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:08,917
Well

1117
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,917
It just occurred to me

1118
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:12,875
She never brought me night snack before

1119
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,500
Don't think too much about it

1120
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,750
Just eat

1121
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:20,667
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

1122
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:21,625
Text me and let me know

1123
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,792
I will bring it to you again

1124
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,292
"You don't have to speak"

1125
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:37,208
"Just meow with me together"

1126
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,750
"Meow meow meow meow"

1127
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,667
"Bonnie hug"

1128
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:43,417
- "Next life again"
- Bonnie did great

1129
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,917
"Bonnie Bonnie"

1130
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:47,833
- Meow meow hug hug
- Shoot the smoke, Where is the smoke?

1131
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,167
"You are here with me"

1132
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:50,500
"Never let me go!"

1133
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,417
Dance

1134
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,625
"Bonnie hug"

1135
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,208
"Spring blossom loves the summer firework"

1136
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:58,042
- You're here
- Hmm

1137
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,333
Let me introduce you

1138
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,000
This is the dentist I told you about

1139
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yu-Hsien Yang

1140
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,667
Hi

1141
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,333
Hi, I'm Che-Kai Chang

1142
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,458
Welcome

1143
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,875
I know, I heard lot about you from Yuan-Yuan

1144
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,375
Ok, cut

1145
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,667
Director, is it ok?

1146
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:10,500
Great, give me five

1147
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
Give me five

1148
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,875
Chi

1149
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,208
How did Bonnie do?

1150
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:15,125
Pretty good?

1151
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,375
Very good

1152
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,792
Hey Cream

1153
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:21,833
What do you think about Bonnie's dance?

1154
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:22,625
Very good

1155
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,583
Oh well, that's for sure

1156
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:28,208
Bonnie is an international star

1157
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:30,167
And you are?

1158
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:31,417
- Oh
- Mei

1159
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:33,417
He is the dentist I told you about

1160
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:34,917
Hi

1161
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:37,042
So you are Yu-Hsien Yang

1162
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,042
Yes

1163
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,292
Not bad

1164
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:42,417
Meow

1165
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,292
- Don't frighten him
- Here, reshoot it

1166
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:46,667
Are you ok? You don't look too good

1167
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,167
- I'm fine
- Have a drink after work?

1168
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:50,667
Fine by me

1169
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,083
Let's go together

1170
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,292
I need to get back to the office

1171
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,375
What a bummer

1172
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:58,083
Don't you need to look after the scene?

1173
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,292
The scene

1174
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,583
Mei can handle it

1175
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:02,958
Sure, I got it here

1176
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,042
Just go do your thing

1177
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,125
Where is Bonnie?

1178
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:06,875
I am here

1179
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:07,833
I should go now

1180
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:08,375
Bye

1181
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:09,167
Go for it

1182
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:11,125
Ok, everyone standby

1183
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,333
Are you coming?

1184
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,875
I really have to work

1185
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,958
- Nice to meet you
- Music go

1186
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,583
Me too

1187
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,583
Bye

1188
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,417
Chi, I'm leaving

1189
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:23,333
Ready to roll

1190
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:26,208
Action

1191
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,125
Ok, start the snow now

1192
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:32,500
"Meow meow meow meow"

1193
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,125
"Bonnie hug"

1194
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,792
"Next life again"

1195
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,583
"Kitty bomb Bomb Bomb"

1196
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:41,042
"Bonnie Bonnie Meow meow hug hug"

1197
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:42,667
"You are here with me"

1198
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,875
"Never let me go!"

1199
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:58,375
When did you first meet Yuan-Yuan Sung?

1200
00:56:58,917 --> 00:56:59,792
High school freshman year

1201
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:02,708
What was she like in high school?

1202
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:03,625
Cute

1203
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:04,792
Outgoing

1204
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:06,333
Pretty eyes

1205
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,958
You have the chance to cherish her now

1206
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,542
and be with her

1207
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:10,958
Why don't you want to?

1208
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:14,917
Why don't you tell her the truth?

1209
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:18,292
What kind of truth?

1210
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,292
Do you know the pain?

1211
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,667
We lost our family when we were 16

1212
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:24,875
I am her only family now

1213
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,333
What do you want me to say?

1214
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:28,667
And what then if I said it

1215
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,167
To let her suffer once more

1216
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:33,750
Even if I told her

1217
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,500
you think she can live with that?

1218
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,417
We can all learn to live with it

1219
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:41,417
You think too less of yourself

1220
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,292
Yuan-Yuan Sung can be tougher than you think

1221
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,708
Perhaps

1222
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,958
I am surprised you have male chauvinism

1223
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:52,417
You are just finding her a cash cow

1224
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:53,542
Right

1225
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:54,500
I am finding her a cash cow

1226
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,000
So what?

1227
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I suck, I am selfish

1228
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:01,458
I am her only family now

1229
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,417
I wish her to be well

1230
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,917
Ok?

1231
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:11,750
I can leave Yang like you asked

1232
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,292
but you need to promise me one more thing

1233
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,333
What is that?

1234
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,625
I get all your belongings after you died

1235
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,083
No way

1236
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,417
All my belongings go to Cream

1237
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:28,625
You see the paradox here?

1238
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:30,625
You want her to forget you

1239
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,833
Then you should leave her nothing

1240
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,667
Sorry

1241
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,792
Let's break up

1242
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:11,417
All these days we been together

1243
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,000
I know you don't love me that much

1244
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,292
Maybe it's like what you said

1245
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:21,333
Love is not that important to you

1246
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,917
But I just can't let it go

1247
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,917
But you do now

1248
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,625
I think it's time for me to wake up

1249
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's about those photos I guess

1250
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:41,250
We are not together for love anymore

1251
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,667
It's just a habit now

1252
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,125
So you're saying

1253
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,333
The 6 years we had is not about love

1254
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:53,917
Anyway, since you want to break up

1255
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,833
I am here to break up with you too

1256
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,292
I met a girl recently

1257
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,583
but that has nothing to do with us

1258
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:06,167
Hope you will be happy

1259
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,542
I broke up with her

1260
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:35,917
Then I have something

1261
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:37,167
I want to tell you

1262
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:44,417
When I was a freshman in high school

1263
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:46,083
I was in the middle of a class

1264
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:47,750
the teacher rushed in suddenly

1265
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,042
and spoke to me with a weird look

1266
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:52,208
You should go to the hospital now

1267
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:54,625
I asked him why

1268
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,667
He said it's because

1269
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:57,875
your parents and your sister

1270
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:00,375
had a car crash in a tunnel

1271
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,542
and were all dead

1272
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,500
Afterwards

1273
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,458
I started living with K

1274
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:14,458
K

1275
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,083
K is Che-Kai Chang

1276
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,458
I thought his name is too tacky

1277
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,042
so I called him K

1278
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,292
He is really a weird guy

1279
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:27,750
When we're at home

1280
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,167
he's like a mother

1281
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,292
when he's at work, he's like a father

1282
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:37,833
when he comforts me he's like a brother

1283
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,000
sometimes

1284
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,625
he's like a lover

1285
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,208
but when the important moment comes

1286
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,208
he acts like a fool

1287
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,250
Why are you so honest to me?

1288
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,792
Because you didn't lie to me

1289
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:01,958
so I don't want to lie to you

1290
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,792
and
am

1291
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:07,333
afraid you would mind

1292
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:11,458
You mean K

1293
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:13,375
Hmm

1294
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:15,958
Not at all

1295
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:23,958
Good then

1296
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:10,167
A gift for Christmas

1297
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:13,958
Thanks

1298
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,500
Why do people get married?

1299
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,250
Married?

1300
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,083
Hmm

1301
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:45,083
So when you're old

1302
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:46,958
or you need someone to take care of you

1303
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:49,500
he can accompany you no reason asked

1304
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,708
Then I don't want to get married

1305
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:51,417
What?

1306
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,083
You have been with me since 16

1307
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:54,625
You're going to leave me when I get old?

1308
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:56,917
You idiot

1309
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,500
That's different

1310
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,750
Marriage is marriage

1311
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,500
It needs a ceremony

1312
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,958
to become a marriage

1313
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:03,917
Is it?

1314
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:05,500
Yes

1315
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,542
Nevermind

1316
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:09,833
I don't want to think about it

1317
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,125
I am so hungry

1318
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:12,542
Is there anything to eat?

1319
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:16,292
I don't want to eat this

1320
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:17,500
This is really good

1321
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:18,792
It really is

1322
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:19,208
No

1323
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,417
I'll go make some noodles

1324
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:23,792
Not for you

1325
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:33,542
"I don't envy the sun"

1326
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:39,208
"it can't illuminate your past"

1327
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:43,167
"there are certain darkness"

1328
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:47,667
"in both of us"

1329
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,000
Be merrier

1330
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,125
You are making it too sad

1331
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,750
It's a sad song already

1332
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:56,500
"I am too jealous of the time"

1333
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,583
That's too cheerful

1334
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:03,833
"it can leave in poise"

1335
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,208
"If there is no need to speak up"

1336
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,750
Do it right

1337
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:12,000
"then there is no need to hide"

1338
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:17,167
I think you are singing it

1339
01:05:18,292 --> 01:05:19,917
a bit careless

1340
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,792
I am singing it very seriously

1341
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,208
What if Bonnie sings it like you do

1342
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:25,792
and the new song fails

1343
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:26,958
Wait

1344
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:29,667
Dear lyric writer

1345
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:30,958
You should know that I did this

1346
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,500
only because you asked me to

1347
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:34,250
I know

1348
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,083
Thanks

1349
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:39,875
Thank you

1350
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,292
Taking care of Yuan-Yuan so much

1351
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:44,042
That should be my line

1352
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:46,500
Thank you for being there with her for so long

1353
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,875
You took good care of her

1354
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,208
Then you probably know

1355
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,208
that we live together

1356
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:52,583
But make no mistake

1357
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:54,833
we really are just friends

1358
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:56,000
Yuan-Yuan told me about it

1359
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,750
You two are great friends

1360
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,750
sort of like a family in a sense

1361
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,250
So she asks you to help pick the wedding dress

1362
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,000
sounds pretty reasonable to me

1363
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,042
About the wedding dress, I...

1364
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:08,917
This is what Yuan-Yuan wants

1365
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:11,625
I want to do as she asks

1366
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,792
And this would also be the last

1367
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:16,208
important thing you did for Yuan-Yuan

1368
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:18,875
You get what I am talking about right?

1369
01:06:31,792 --> 01:06:33,000
What do you think?

1370
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,917
Is it pretty?

1371
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:35,708
It's beyond pretty

1372
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,917
Do the groom like to try on the suit?

1373
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,417
I am not the groom

1374
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:43,292
It's ok, give it a try

1375
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:44,375
I want to see it

1376
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,417
Go

1377
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,000
Hurry up

1378
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,833
- Why would I try it on?
- I want to see it

1379
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,542
Very handsome

1380
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:01,458
Come on

1381
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,833
It's looks great

1382
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,208
How is it?

1383
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,208
Let me take a photo for you

1384
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,208
Sure

1385
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,583
Ok, look over here

1386
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,417
One two three, cheese

1387
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,250
Wait me here

1388
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,583
I will go put on another dress

1389
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,333
Thanks

1390
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:26,833
I have picked the wedding dress

1391
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,708
I'll send you the photo

1392
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,792
Hey listen

1393
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:31,917
I think my phone is running out of battery

1394
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:32,958
Later I will

1395
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:42,458
Borrow me

1396
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,542
Hello, my phone ran out of battery

1397
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:56,000
Hmm

1398
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:57,625
Right

1399
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,500
Ok, I will charge it later

1400
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,458
Hmm

1401
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:01,250
Get back to work

1402
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,250
I will call you later

1403
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:03,875
Bye

1404
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,958
Where have you been yesterday?

1405
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:12,667
You left me there by myself

1406
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:13,833
I felt so awkward

1407
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,208
Where did you go?

1408
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,833
Nowhere

1409
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:22,417
What do you mean nowhere?

1410
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:24,500
Hello?

1411
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,667
Hello, Che-Kai Chang, are you out?

1412
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,333
What are you doing?

1413
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,167
Why did you answer my phone?

1414
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,000
No, I thought it was

1415
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,292
Who do you think you are?

1416
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,958
This is ridiculous

1417
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:45,208
The dinner is ready

1418
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,000
Where are you going?

1419
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:48,917
I am going out

1420
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,792
You're dating that girl on the phone?

1421
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:53,417
It's none of your business

1422
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,917
So do you want to have the dinner or not?

1423
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:56,042
No

1424
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:00,792
You will never have it once I get married

1425
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:13,708
What are you worrying about?

1426
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,042
She only heard my voice

1427
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:16,833
She can't possibly know who I am

1428
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,042
She knows you are Yu-Hsien Yang's ex girlfriend

1429
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,417
I don't want to take that risk

1430
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:24,250
They why do you ask me to call you

1431
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,875
and pretend dating with you

1432
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,500
Pretty scheming of you

1433
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,125
I have to let her give up on me

1434
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:35,042
Floriography

1435
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,708
Everlasting love

1436
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,167
Solitarily powerful

1437
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:46,042
In the next three years

1438
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:47,542
you can help me give her cactus

1439
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:54,208
This is the last step

1440
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:55,583
that you are hoping for

1441
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,708
One for each year

1442
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,875
after three years

1443
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:04,083
she won't notice I am gone

1444
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:07,458
Doing this

1445
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:10,250
you sure it will make her happier?

1446
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,750
She will be happy

1447
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:18,375
if not right now

1448
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,333
but in the end she will be

1449
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:27,000
You are dying

1450
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,792
can't you live it more straightforward

1451
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:29,792
Cry when you want to

1452
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:31,167
Laugh when you want to

1453
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:32,458
Get angry when you want to

1454
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,167
And eat when you're hungry

1455
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:35,458
And if you are getting scared

1456
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:36,875
just call for help

1457
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,417
Something needs to be said before it's too late

1458
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:43,833
You know?

1459
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:48,458
Or do you want to be gone without a trace?

1460
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:07,375
"Sorry"

1461
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,958
"Have you ate?"

1462
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,917
Thanks

1463
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:06,250
"I don't want to talk to you today"

1464
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:13,917
"Sorry for all what I've done"

1465
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:22,125
"I am sorry too"

1466
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:27,667
"For what?"

1467
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:32,042
"For all what I've done"

1468
01:15:34,542 --> 01:15:38,833
"I love you"

1469
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:59,833
"Hope you will be happy"

1470
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:03,875
Thanks

1471
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,000
Tell me

1472
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,917
Why do people get married?

1473
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:36,042
So when you are old

1474
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:37,917
or when you need to be taken care of

1475
01:16:37,917 --> 01:16:40,500
he can accompany you no reason asked

1476
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,375
I thought you said you like me

1477
01:16:43,917 --> 01:16:45,125
You can marry me

1478
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:49,750
I am not a nice guy

1479
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:52,917
Doing this

1480
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:54,875
will she really be happier?

1481
01:16:58,292 --> 01:16:59,542
She will be happy

1482
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,083
if not right now

1483
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:04,292
but in the end she will be

1484
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:09,792
We lost our family since we're 16

1485
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,917
I am her only family

1486
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,250
I hope she will be well

1487
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:33,000
Or do you want things to be like this

1488
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,792
Leaving no trace

1489
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:36,500
and just gone from the world

1490
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:41,042
You think I want to die

1491
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:44,667
You think I want to die like this

1492
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:47,083
Who wouldn't want a wonderful life?

1493
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:48,958
You think it is possible for me

1494
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:51,542
You think I still have time

1495
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,250
I wish she will be marrying me

1496
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,750
Not him

1497
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:59,333
I wish we can grow old together

1498
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:01,667
taking care of each other

1499
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,250
but it's just an illusion

1500
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,625
a sad dream

1501
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,375
I don't want to dream anymore

1502
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:23,958
I didn't know K had such a story

1503
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,583
Too bad he's gone

1504
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:30,875
This is for you, A-Lin

1505
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,125
Thanks

1506
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,167
The last album they collaborated

1507
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,917
Keep this as a remembrance of them

1508
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:40,667
Oh right

1509
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:42,000
Let's do the recording tomorrow

1510
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:43,958
Seriously?

1511
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:45,083
Yes

1512
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,625
Then I will book the studio

1513
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:47,708
But

1514
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,125
I want to record

1515
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,917
A Kind of Sorrow

1516
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,333
I am home, Yuan-Yuan

1517
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:05,792
Yuan-Yuan

1518
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,458
Yu-Hsien

1519
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:22,375
I am sorry

1520
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,083
I am sorry

1521
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:27,292
I am really sorry

1522
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,750
The love between mortals

1523
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:34,083
can't be reached by hands

1524
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,375
be explained by words

1525
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:41,542
be seen by eyes

1526
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:45,625
My love

1527
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,125
started from meeting him

1528
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,375
and has been in my life

1529
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,958
and will never part

1530
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:01,417
I thought I don't have to suffer the loss again

1531
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:02,875
but it didn't occur to me

1532
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:04,458
from that day on

1533
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,833
K will be leaving me

1534
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,667
calling me a has-been lyric writer

1535
01:20:17,667 --> 01:20:20,125
you are the out-of-tune singer

1536
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,458
Meow Meow Meow

1537
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:23,917
Pig

1538
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,792
Kitty's target audience must all be guys

1539
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,208
Men

1540
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:38,250
What do men like?

1541
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:44,792
What is more important for them?

1542
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:07,917
Excuse me

1543
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:08,958
May I help you?

1544
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,125
What does this mediccation treat?

1545
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,667
Where did this come from?

1546
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:16,542
From my home

1547
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:24,417
Glivec treats cancer or leukemia patients

1548
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:27,333
And that is a strong dose of painkiller

1549
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:29,750
Using these two meds together

1550
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,208
means he is in pretty bad condition

1551
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:31,833
Bye

1552
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,375
- Bye Yuan-Yuan
- Take care of the house

1553
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,625
We are leaving sis

1554
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,958
- Take care of the house
- Bye Yuan-Yuan

1555
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:55,625
No

1556
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:59,125
Don't leave me

1557
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,583
No

1558
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,792
You can't be here

1559
01:22:03,792 --> 01:22:06,208
You can't leave me

1560
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,375
Don't you leave me

1561
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:10,917
Stop

1562
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,208
Is anyone home?

1563
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,458
I feel sorry for K to have endured the pain

1564
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:30,542
dealing it all quietly

1565
01:22:32,417 --> 01:22:34,375
I thank him very much

1566
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:38,500
Thinking about me even when he's sick

1567
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:43,417
maybe I can't grow old with K in this life

1568
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,875
But I look forward to the next life

1569
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:49,750
that we can meet again then

1570
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,417
That day

1571
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:56,167
The thing I was worried about has happened

1572
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:57,875
You really can't tell her

1573
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:59,417
really can't tell her

1574
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:02,792
really can't tell her

1575
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:06,208
But you need someone to look after you

1576
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,417
am fine

1577
01:23:09,042 --> 01:23:10,708
I can take care of myself

1578
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,583
How long you think you can keep it from her?

1579
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,250
I don't know for how long

1580
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:22,667
But if she finds out

1581
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:24,208
everything is over

1582
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,667
Before think about other people

1583
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:30,417
you should think about yourself first

1584
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:31,875
I am not important

1585
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:32,333
But she's different

1586
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:33,667
She is all alone

1587
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:37,458
She needs someone to be there for her

1588
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,208
You are all alone too

1589
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,833
aren't you?

1590
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:05,833
The first time I met K

1591
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:08,167
is a month after my family died

1592
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:11,083
Death has taken my family

1593
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:16,125
But K was abandoned by his family

1594
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:20,083
That day

1595
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:23,208
he looked pretty sad

1596
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:25,375
and needed a hug more than I do

1597
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,417
From that day on

1598
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:31,167
I decided to call him K

1599
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:33,625
As for me, I am Cream

1600
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,500
After all, two lonely people

1601
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,208
should have a name feeling less lonely

1602
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:45,042
You said that K is about to die

1603
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,542
You think

1604
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:51,500
I should tell him I already knew

1605
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,583
If he didn't want you to know

1606
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,792
he probably has his reasons

1607
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:01,375
Would expose him now

1608
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:03,000
make any difference?

1609
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,417
I only want K to be happy

1610
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,875
No matter what happened

1611
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:10,250
I will do anything to fulfill his wish

1612
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:14,625
Do you have any wishes?

1613
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,625
I hope you

1614
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,458
find a nice guy and get married

1615
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:20,875
What is the definition of a nice guy?

1616
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,292
Got a job

1617
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:25,958
some money

1618
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:29,208
I wanted so bad that his wish is to be with me

1619
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,208
and with good health

1620
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,292
but for K who is about to leave me

1621
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:38,208
even though I don't want to

1622
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:40,667
I will do everything for him

1623
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:47,167
Who is that guy?

1624
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:48,500
The vampire?

1625
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,958
He is my high school classmate

1626
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,417
He is a dentist

1627
01:25:51,417 --> 01:25:53,083
This doesn't count as a kiss, right?

1628
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,917
Does it?

1629
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:56,500
I want to know you more

1630
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,500
I am engaged

1631
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:02,375
Therefore,

1632
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:05,958
sorry, Yu-Hsien

1633
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:08,833
I used you

1634
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:11,375
If I am with you

1635
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,375
I think K would be relieved

1636
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:18,083
Sorry

1637
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,083
I used your kindness for me

1638
01:26:22,417 --> 01:26:23,958
Your consideration for me

1639
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,625
I know even if I am thinking of someone else

1640
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,500
you will still take me in

1641
01:26:32,542 --> 01:26:34,583
Waiting quietly for the time

1642
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:36,792
to move me

1643
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,167
Why do people get married?

1644
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,375
Because when you are old

1645
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:59,625
or need to be taken care of

1646
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:02,500
he can accompany you with no reason asked

1647
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:05,917
Then I won't get married

1648
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:07,833
Marriage needs a ceremony

1649
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:09,292
to be called a marriage

1650
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:13,375
When can we get married?

1651
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:16,292
If you really love me

1652
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:17,500
we can do it anytime

1653
01:27:20,792 --> 01:27:22,375
Please forgive me

1654
01:27:23,792 --> 01:27:26,125
My love one is about to die

1655
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,875
I really can't think it all through

1656
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,875
Hi, I am K

1657
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:48,167
If I have a next life, I want to be

1658
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,667
a ring

1659
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:51,667
a pair of glasses

1660
01:27:51,792 --> 01:27:53,250
I shouldn't detest eternity

1661
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,292
a bed

1662
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:57,875
I want to stay beside K forever

1663
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,750
One two Three, cheese

1664
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:08,792
Wait me here

1665
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:10,250
I will go put on another dress

1666
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:12,000
Thanks

1667
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:34,000
I will call you back

1668
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,625
Ok

1669
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:35,292
Sorry

1670
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:36,208
It's all right

1671
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:39,167
I am suffering from the great pain

1672
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:42,042
I know K is too

1673
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,375
I made a promise to myself

1674
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,792
If he turned around

1675
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:50,833
I would confess everything to him

1676
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:53,542
If he turned around

1677
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:56,625
I would give him a big hug

1678
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:25,542
"I love you"

1679
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,958
I wanted to say I love him out loud

1680
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,583
"Hope you will be happy"

1681
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:41,250
but I knew I would burst into tears once I said it

1682
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:43,750
I couldn't hold on anymore

1683
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:48,042
Thanks

1684
01:29:54,917 --> 01:29:57,167
Can you do the wedding rehearsal with me?

1685
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:00,042
Yuan-Yuan Sung

1686
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:03,583
for richer or for poorer

1687
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,417
in sickness and in health

1688
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:09,958
Will you take

1689
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:11,875
the man in front of you

1690
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:13,542
to be your husband?

1691
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,750
I do

1692
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:30,125
K and I became really husband and wife

1693
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,208
the happiest moment in my dream is fulfilled

1694
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:40,500
I thought we can go on together forever

1695
01:30:41,917 --> 01:30:43,375
But

1696
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:46,667
in the real world

1697
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:49,792
K gives my hand to another man

1698
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:08,583
The feelings I have for K

1699
01:31:09,292 --> 01:31:11,333
from 16 years old until now

1700
01:31:16,042 --> 01:31:18,333
has gone so deep

1701
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:24,125
it can never be dredged up again

1702
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,542
Yu-Hisen

1703
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:35,208
Thank you for everything you did

1704
01:31:36,292 --> 01:31:38,042
Thank you for loving me

1705
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,125
I have found K

1706
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:45,542
I want to go see him

1707
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:12,250
Hi

1708
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:22,708
Here you are

1709
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:24,417
I have been looking all over for you

1710
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,083
Silly

1711
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:37,125
You know you're having a fever

1712
01:32:38,917 --> 01:32:40,125
It's fine

1713
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,500
It will be fine soon

1714
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:53,167
I am warning you

1715
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:57,208
No more instant noodles from now on

1716
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:58,333
no more walking in the rain

1717
01:32:58,333 --> 01:32:59,417
no more popsicles

1718
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:00,292
no more extra shifts

1719
01:33:00,292 --> 01:33:01,333
you hear me?

1720
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:05,667
K

1721
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,833
I will look after you

1722
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:17,542
We are going to play baseball together

1723
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:21,792
You need to sing the terrible demo for me

1724
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:27,000
Don't leave me alone in my birthday

1725
01:33:28,792 --> 01:33:31,375
We had a deal when we were 16

1726
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:34,292
We would spend the birthdays together

1727
01:33:37,917 --> 01:33:39,458
I am right here

1728
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,583
It will be fine

1729
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,083
It will be fine

1730
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:49,542
It's ok

1731
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,083
I am here with you

1732
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,833
Feeling better now?

1733
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:12,000
We're home

1734
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,333
It'll be fine here

1735
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:21,208
Sorry Cream

1736
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:26,333
I arranged your romance

1737
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:29,500
without your approval

1738
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,042
Do you like it?

1739
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,458
Let's take another picture

1740
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:41,833
You asked me once before

1741
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:42,750
Let's take the photo

1742
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,958
about my wish

1743
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,792
My biggest wish

1744
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:49,833
Here

1745
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,542
is to be with you

1746
01:34:52,417 --> 01:34:54,208
together forever

1747
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:56,875
K

1748
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,750
and Cream

1749
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:03,333
We are a family

1750
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,792
We always have been

1751
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:10,583
Take the photo now

1752
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:06,250
Long time no see

1753
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,625
Hi

1754
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:16,958
Why are you here so early?

1755
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,333
I thought you might get busy later

1756
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:24,417
Let me show you around

1757
01:36:25,417 --> 01:36:26,375
Sure

1758
01:36:28,792 --> 01:36:30,833
Hi,I am K

1759
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:34,500
If I have a next life, I want to be

1760
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:36,250
a ring

1761
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:38,875
a pair of glasses

1762
01:36:39,667 --> 01:36:41,167
a bed

1763
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:43,167
I still can't understand now

1764
01:36:43,792 --> 01:36:45,875
An idiot like Che-Kai Chang

1765
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:48,375
really existed in the world

1766
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,417
If love can be explained

1767
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:58,417
no one in the world will suffer from it

1768
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:32,542
I underestimated love

1769
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:37,500
I told Che-Kai Chang before

1770
01:37:38,917 --> 01:37:40,500
Yuan-Yuan Sung

1771
01:37:41,417 --> 01:37:43,875
She could be tougher than you think

1772
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:47,792
She will do fine even if you're gone

1773
01:37:50,583 --> 01:37:52,500
But I was wrong

1774
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:58,000
The love in their point of views

1775
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:02,500
is based on each other's happiness

1776
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:10,167
"Then there is no need to hide"

1777
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:17,292
"a kind of sorrow"

1778
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:23,375
"is your name staying in my past"

1779
01:38:23,375 --> 01:38:29,125
"breathing with me, shaping my smile"

1780
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:35,042
"Can't seem to forget"

1781
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,125
k

1782
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:40,208
Do you know?

1783
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:43,250
After my family left

1784
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:47,000
I thought happiness left with them

1785
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:51,208
until I met you

1786
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:54,167
I realized that two lonely souls

1787
01:38:54,167 --> 01:38:56,333
as long as they can stay with each other

1788
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:58,458
can have the right to be happy

1789
01:39:01,208 --> 01:39:04,708
We are destined to meet each other

1790
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:06,875
No one can replace that

1791
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:12,333
Do you know?

1792
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:13,958
What I want

1793
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:16,625
is not someone that brings me
hot coffee in the cold winter

1794
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:20,458
but someone who eats popsicles with me in the rain

1795
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:22,167
so much so that our teeth hurt

1796
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:25,125
What I want

1797
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,417
is not a guardian

1798
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:29,875
but someone who would do the adventures with me

1799
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,833
I don't want anyone else

1800
01:39:32,792 --> 01:39:34,375
I don't want anyone else

1801
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:37,917
I want you

1802
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:40,208
K

1803
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:43,750
Thank you for everything you did

1804
01:39:44,542 --> 01:39:47,083
As long as I get to stay with you

1805
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:52,875
it would be the happiest thing for me

1806
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:56,458
"and stay in my past"

1807
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:57,292
Sorry

1808
01:39:57,292 --> 01:40:00,750
"Can't seem to be forgotten"

1809
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,125
I love you

1810
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,750
"a kind of sorrow"

1811
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:12,208
"Che-Kai Yuan-Yuan's grave"
"Is your determination to let love become"

1812
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:16,375
"the light that shines on me"

1813
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:19,375
"giving me warmth"

1814
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:21,792
"but not permitting me"

1815
01:40:21,792 --> 01:40:23,458
I keep wondering

1816
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:25,250
why call me K?

1817
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:28,125
Because I am Cream

1818
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,333
That's it?

1819
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:34,125
Because

1820
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:36,792
we have no family since we were kids

1821
01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:38,083
and we live together

1822
01:40:38,583 --> 01:40:39,500
K

1823
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,625
and Cream

1824
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:42,667
all have the same consonant K

1825
01:40:44,042 --> 01:40:46,083
Don't you think it sounds

1826
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:47,708
like a real family?

1827
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,958
"A kind of sorrow"

1828
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:53,375
"Don't want to be apart"

1829
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:58,875
"and miss you so back to back we look around"

1830
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:01,875
"You are everything"

1831
01:41:02,667 --> 01:41:05,583
"you are an eternal figure in a photo"

1832
01:41:06,917 --> 01:41:11,417
"to be remembered"

1833
01:41:22,917 --> 01:41:27,333
"2002-2015
What we share every day defines Eternity"
