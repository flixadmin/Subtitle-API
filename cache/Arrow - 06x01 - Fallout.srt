1
00:00:01,457 --> 00:00:03,062
Last season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,063 --> 00:00:05,657
Are you offering to
help me find my son?

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,801
I want us to find
both of our sons.

4
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:08,969
I need your help.

5
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,304
Agh!

6
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:11,638
Oliver's
gonna come for us!

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,373
Yeah. I'm counting
on it, sis.

8
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:17,311
Adrian,
where is my son?!

9
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:19,279
When we get to the airplane,
I'm not gonna get on it.

10
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:22,149
- What?
- I'm not leaving William behind.

11
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:23,483
Don't do that.

12
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:24,718
He's rigged
the entire island

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,520
with explosives.

14
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:27,821
They're remotely linked to
some sort of dead man's switch.

15
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:30,457
If he dies, it detonates
all the devices.

16
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,859
- Unh!
- William, come here.

17
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,126
Are you ok?
Are you all right?

18
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:34,928
He wants you
to kill him

19
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,563
so it kills all of us.

20
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:37,764
No, Adrian!

21
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,902
I'm on site.
No sign of Faust.

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,542
He's not at his
last known either.

23
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:24,111
Well, his ordinance is.

24
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:25,746
If Faust is moving
from bombs to missiles,

25
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:27,214
it makes you wonder
what else he's changed up.

26
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:28,882
Exactly. Stay sharp.

27
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,921
Boss said stay sharp,
Hoss.

28
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:41,495
Faust,
it's clear.

29
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:42,896
Apologies.

30
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:45,732
Won't be but a minute.

31
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:49,770
If...You have
the opportunity,

32
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:51,471
please advise your mayor

33
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:54,975
next time someone
threatens to launch

34
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,277
a ballistic missile
at his city,

35
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:01,515
he really should pay up.

36
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:15,595
Disappointing.

37
00:02:15,597 --> 00:02:18,932
Agh! Agh!

38
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:21,568
That's an MGM-140.

39
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,971
It's fire
and forget.

40
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:27,007
You can't stop it.

41
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,610
You can't disarm it.

42
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:34,848
No, but I have
a very smart friend who can.

43
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,192
My T-sphere's spoofed
the missile's guidance system.

44
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm drawing it back
to the water.

45
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:03,677
You look troubled

46
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:08,081
as if detonation stirred
unpleasant memories.

47
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,020
Chase sabotaged
the plane.

48
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:14,721
We can't get
off the island!

49
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,490
There's an Argus supply ship
on the eastern shore.

50
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:17,657
That's on the other
side of the island.

51
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,760
Slade knows where it is.
Go now!

52
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,795
Hey! Oliver says
there's a boat on the eastern shore.

53
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:24,398
You lot won't make it
in time.

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
- I'll take my own chances.
- I always hated that guy.

55
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,835
- What are we gonna do now?
- What about the plane?

56
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:30,070
Thought you said you
couldn't get it fixed.

57
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:31,872
For shielding us
from the blast,

58
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,306
- it should work just fine.
- It's not like there's a whole

59
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:34,741
- lot of other options.
- No. He's right, ok?

60
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:38,011
It's better than nothing.
Let's go!

61
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:40,680
No! I have to
find William!

62
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:41,748
Samantha!

63
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,150
Samantha!

64
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:45,218
You go to the plane, ok?
I'll get her!

65
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:51,091
- Careful. Let's go.
- Should be on the plane.

66
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:52,893
I'm not taking refuge
from 100 bombs without you.

67
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,628
- It's more like 250.
- Let's go. Let's go.

68
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,929
Go, go, go!

69
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:05,338
What's this?

70
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,573
Remarks for
the Police Academy

71
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,075
graduation ceremony.

72
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:09,443
Seems my promotion
came

73
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,044
with speech writing
duties.

74
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,512
- You can write?
- You can read?

75
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:15,515
I can kick both
y'all asses is what I can do.

76
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:18,919
This is, uh--
this is really good, Rene.

77
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,021
It's like I keep
telling you, Hoss.

78
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:23,023
I've got the soul
of a poet.

79
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,925
I don't think I have ever
heard you say that.

80
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,927
Who the hell asked
you, Blondie?

81
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,195
You totally missed
me redirecting

82
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:30,063
a ballistic missile
b-t-dubs.

83
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,065
Oh, man.
Well, I've already seen you do that once.

84
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,567
All right.
Just as you ordered--

85
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,735
a triple stack
with a side of heart disease.

86
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:36,937
Don't judge me.

87
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,405
Ah, yeah.
That's for you.

88
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,107
Surprise.
This is for you.

89
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,374
Here you go.

90
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,609
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

91
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:44,077
Sorry I was MIA.

92
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,979
I pretty much had to
knock my mother unconscious

93
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,380
to get her on a flight
back to Vegas.

94
00:04:47,382 --> 00:04:48,915
- She did not want to go.
- That's fine.

95
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,350
We--we had it
handled.

96
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:51,718
Yeah. Even
without Dinah in the field.

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,320
Come a long way
in a year.

98
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:54,721
Yeah. It also makes me
grateful for all the times

99
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:59,292
Oliver kicked
our ass almost.

100
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:00,594
I'm gonna go home.

101
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,095
We'll walk with you.

102
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,732
Wow. It's been
over 5 months.

103
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:07,767
Their subtlety hasn't
gotten better at all!

104
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:08,802
Heard that!

105
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:10,170
No, it hasn't.

106
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:12,139
Um, there's some
in there for William, too.

107
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:14,141
Got some fries and, like,
a mini cheeseburger and then a burger

108
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:15,775
without cheese because
I wasn't sure if he was, like, lactose--

109
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:16,977
Do you think there's
enough for 3?

110
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,945
Oh. Well,
I already ate, and--

111
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:20,180
- Mm-hmm.
- Unless you're asking

112
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,982
because you think
now's a good time.

113
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:23,650
- Like, do you need a buffer or--
- I don't need a buffer.

114
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:26,620
I could use some
company.

115
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:28,088
I know we talked
about it

116
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,422
and that he's
getting used to me

117
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:30,624
and it might be
a little weird to--

118
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:31,825
I mean, confusing,
right, for him--

119
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,894
for us--for me--for you.

120
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:39,733
Just not tonight.
Another night.

121
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,067
Promise?

122
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:42,769
Promise.

123
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:46,573
- Ok.
- Heh.

124
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:49,676
Hmm.

125
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:50,844
Hey. Look at me.

126
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,212
Where's my--my mom?

127
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:53,780
Yeah. No. I'm gonna
go find your mom,

128
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:55,982
but--but the island,
what happened,

129
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:58,485
it's very dangerous,
and you are safe by the shore,

130
00:05:58,487 --> 00:05:59,686
do you understand?

131
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:00,887
What happened?

132
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,155
The man who took you
when we saw

133
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:03,723
the explosions, ok,
he did this.

134
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:07,227
He said you're
my father?

135
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,629
I--I'm gonna go find
your mother.

136
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:12,199
I'm gonna find her
and make sure that she's safe,

137
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:16,203
I promise you,
but you have to stay here, ok?

138
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:17,571
Good.

139
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:23,977
That food is junk.

140
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,680
That's why kids
like it, Raisa.

141
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,381
How'd he do today?

142
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:30,350
New school.
It's hard.

143
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,651
It's been a few months.

144
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,887
You had trouble
fitting in at his age.

145
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,789
What? What are you
talking about?

146
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,424
I had Tommy.

147
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:38,825
I wouldn't call
having a friend

148
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:42,796
who helps you get
into trouble fitting in.

149
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:44,231
That's a fair point.

150
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:52,272
Hey, kiddo.

151
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:53,974
Brought home
some dinner.

152
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:55,875
Not hungry.

153
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,544
How's school?

154
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:58,745
Fine.

155
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:03,350
Yeah. Making friends?

156
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,785
This weekend, let's
go see a rockets game.

157
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,087
You know, as mayor,
I get pretty good seats.

158
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:10,724
I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

159
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:14,728
Ok. Good night,
William.

160
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,296
Good night, Oliver.

161
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,273
- Comfy?
- Could I get something to drink?

162
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,807
That will be up
to my lieutenant.

163
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:30,510
Thanks, Bob.
I got it from here.

164
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:35,615
Where'd you get
the muscle?

165
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:37,417
Kettle bell swings.

166
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,919
Oh. Ha.
Heh heh.

167
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:41,254
Ugh!

168
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:44,024
- The gun men, jerkwad.
- Agh.

169
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:45,759
Yeah. You were rolling
with some pretty highly trained

170
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,394
mercenaries tonight.

171
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:50,830
According to your friend
in the green hoodie.

172
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:55,135
Highly trained means
highly expensive.

173
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,970
You were probably
paying as much to hire them

174
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:59,572
as you were extorting
the city for.

175
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:00,874
So you're saying
there's a problem

176
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,242
with my business plan?

177
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:06,913
Well, can I get
something to drink?

178
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,848
I'd be more disposed
to linguistics

179
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,453
if I weren't so parched.

180
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:14,754
What do you want?

181
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:17,991
Anything carbonated
will do.

182
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:20,860
Don't look so dour.
Mr. Smug'll crack.

183
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,295
It's not the whack job,
Lieutenant.

184
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,364
It's Quentin Lance.
As deputy mayor,

185
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,965
he was supposed to be here
to review plans

186
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,167
for the academy
graduation.

187
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:28,868
- So?
- So his appointment

188
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,670
was an hour ago.

189
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:37,143
All right. It's ok.
I know where he is.

190
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:40,413
Um, get this guy
a soda or something, will you?

191
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,102
- Ahem.
- Ahem.

192
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:03,536
Hey.

193
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:04,771
Hey.

194
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:08,575
Thanks for coming.

195
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:10,410
You did the right thing
texting me.

196
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,546
Heh. It's not like I can
call my sponsor, is it?

197
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,682
Why not?

198
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:19,552
If I tell him
why I want to drink,

199
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:23,022
what I did,
why--why I did it--

200
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:25,992
Yeah. He'd think you're
on something a lot stronger than booze.

201
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:28,495
It's like all I got
is this guilt,

202
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:34,033
and all I can do is just run, run,
run away from it.

203
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:35,402
And go where?

204
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:38,371
To the bottom
of these glasses.

205
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:41,241
Well, you're not
gonna do that

206
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:42,876
because you know
and I know that is not

207
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:44,911
what Laurel
would have wanted.

208
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:46,312
Which Laurel?

209
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,951
Perfect.

210
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:53,787
Open it up for me.

211
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:03,196
Hey. If you think
you can claim some kind of police brutality--

212
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:07,834
Not at all. No.
I just needed to get this loose.

213
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:12,305
Ugh! Ha!

214
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:15,341
C4 implant. Boom.

215
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,116
Ha ha!

216
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,086
You're crazy.

217
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,421
I don't judge you!

218
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:29,689
Unh!

219
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:36,529
Well done, Alex.

220
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:37,797
Right on schedule.

221
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,666
One does one's
humble best.

222
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:42,135
Wire it up. Make it fast.
We're on a clock.

223
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,058
We're all set here.

224
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,695
Care to do
the honors?

225
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:20,807
Ha ha ha ha!

226
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:22,242
Let's go.

227
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:33,453

229
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,607
What's
the casualty count?

230
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:46,009
9 dead,
6 in critical condition,

231
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,411
and 4 injured.

232
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:48,879
Good thing
the Academy's turning out

233
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:50,547
a new batch
of replacements.

234
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,616
- Hey. Come on.
- Sorry, sorry.

235
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:55,052
Look. We might want
to consider canceling the graduation

236
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,253
or at least closing
it to the public.

237
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:58,522
This city does not bend
to terrorism.

238
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:00,591
Look. The media's going crazy,
wanting us to figure out

239
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:02,125
how we're gonna
handle all this stuff.

240
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:03,260
We have Argus connections.

241
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:04,628
I'll have them
handle security.

242
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,797
The question is
who would do this and why?

243
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,166
Well, I think
I've got an answer on that.

244
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:10,634
Got video footage.

245
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:16,073
Has anyone seen this?

246
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:19,276
I managed to get
to it before anyone else could.

247
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,612
I thought you
said she died.

248
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:24,081
You said Black Siren
died on Lian Yu.

249
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,484
She did.
She was dead,

250
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:28,952
buried under a ton
of rubble

251
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:31,121
when Quentin and I
found her.

252
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,656
Ok. Well, unless
our Laurel is

253
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:34,124
mysteriously
back from the dead--

254
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,292
something I wouldn't
put past either

255
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:36,493
of the Lance
sisters--

256
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:37,694
Black Siren is
not only not dead.

257
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:39,563
She is not
on Lian Yu.

258
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,633
Right. And running
with our old friend Alex Faust.

259
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:45,035
Ok. Clearly,
he was at SCPD

260
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:46,303
when the explosion
went off.

261
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,471
Which means he either
died or escape.

262
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,773
He escaped.
The question is

263
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,575
why is he working
with Black Siren?

264
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,644
And where did they
hire these mercenaries?

265
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,078
I'll get this image
over to Lyla.

266
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,513
She can tell us
where these guys are from

267
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:58,115
and when they started
working together.

268
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:00,317
I promised Raisa
that I would take William to school,

269
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,152
so I'll check in
when I'm done with that.

270
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:06,223
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.

271
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,524
Just that I--

272
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,364
he did not sleep
last night.

273
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:17,701
Was he having
nightmares?

274
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,870
I mean, he seemed fine
when I left.

275
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:22,072
I think he puts on
a good act for you,

276
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:24,508
but when you left
for the emergency,

277
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,810
he cried
about the bad man.

278
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:30,047
He says the bad man
is why his mother is dead.

279
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:40,524
Slade?

280
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,331
You all right, kid?

281
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,033
Yeah, I'm fine.
Where is everyone?

282
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:51,702
I came back here
looking for people.

283
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:54,871
Came back? What do you
mean you came back?

284
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:56,406
Two of your friends
went to the monastery

285
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,341
to look
for survivors.

286
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,812
Ra's al Ghul's daughter
went to the cages for that girl,

287
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:03,814
but your sister--

288
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:06,917
What about her?

289
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,720
Slade!

290
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:13,056
Where's Thea?

291
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:14,591
She's this way.

292
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,563
- Hey.
- Hi.

293
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,298
- What do you need?
- What do I need?

294
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,799
Well, you know,
lots of things.

295
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:24,701
I mean, you know,
more out of Rene for one.

296
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,203
You know, he's all right
at the new job, but--

297
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:29,339
- He's not Thea?
- No. He's not Thea.

298
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,342
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about, um--

299
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:33,944
about--about her.

300
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:35,679
- About Thea?
- No, no.

301
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:39,916
The other, uh, Laurel.

302
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,952
Dinah wasn't being
straight with you

303
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:44,888
when she told you that she was dead
when we found her.

304
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,491
Well, it--it's
complicated, isn't it?

305
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:49,292
Y-yeah.

306
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:51,094
But listen.
The--the point is

307
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:53,797
is that I was supposed
to be at SCPD last night,

308
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,068
and I think that
maybe she went there looking for me.

309
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,871
Wait. Why? Why--
why would she be targeting you?

310
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:05,742
Well--

311
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,411
Argus has a lead on Black Siren.
I have to go.

312
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:09,846
Ok. Well, listen.
I--I got to come with you.

313
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:11,448
I know it's not
my Laurel,

314
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,619
but I--I can't sit
this out either, so...

315
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:17,053
Ok.

316
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,478
Nice outfit

317
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,513
except for I would
have gone with fishnets.

318
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:00,730
Priority is
Black Siren

319
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:02,599
in custody and unharmed.

320
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:20,350
Quentin!

321
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,452
Ugh.

322
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,750
- How's Rene?
- Curtis and Lance took Rene

323
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,385
to Dr. Schwartz
for treatment

324
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:14,753
it's a collapsed lung.
It doesn't look so good.

325
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,350
Black Siren
and the mercenaries escaped,

326
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,784
but we pulled this
off the van.

327
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,985
- GPS?
- Yeah. Let's backtrace it,

328
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,187
figure out where
they came from.

329
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:21,955
On it.

330
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,058
Dinah, Quentin thinks
the attack on SCPD was targeting him.

331
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,795
- Any idea why?
- No.

332
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,996
If Laurel was
after Lance,

333
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:31,364
why blow up
the precinct

334
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,599
after discovering
he wasn't there.

335
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:33,800
Maybe Quentin was wrong.

336
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,335
Maybe our first
instincts were right.

337
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,003
That she's targeting
the police for some reason?

338
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,405
We need to figure out
what that reason is,

339
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,806
and we need to find her.

340
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,174
Oh, funny
you should say that.

341
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,742
GPS' last location
was a warehouse--

342
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,411
surprise, surprise--
outside Pennytown.

343
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,046
If this Laurel is half
as smart as our Laurel,

344
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,581
she would not go
back there.

345
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,316
Maybe she left something
behind for us to go on.

346
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,251
- John.
- We are on it.

347
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,861
The blast blew her
over there.

348
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,395
Thea?!

349
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:28,889
Clear!

350
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:30,223
Clear!

351
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,895
It's all packed up.

352
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:36,897
Doesn't look like they were planning
on coming back here.

353
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,366
The question is
where were they headed?

354
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,268
Stay sharp. Look around.
In my experience,

355
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,170
bad guys aren't very
good at covering their tracks.

356
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:48,909
You all right?

357
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,577
Yeah. Why?

358
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,179
Since the bridge,
you seem distracted.

359
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:57,083
Just worried
about Rene, that's all.

360
00:18:57,085 --> 00:19:00,420
Saw you take the shot
at that merc.

361
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,788
Never seen you miss.

362
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,657
Nobody makes
every shot.

363
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,996
What about you?

364
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,402
I don't know.
What about me?

365
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,170
I saw your reaction
when Oliver asked you

366
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,806
why evil Laurel
targeted Lance.

367
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,408
And I said
I didn't know.

368
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,642
And I didn't find
your answer that convincing.

369
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,177
Really?

370
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:32,238
What the hell
is that?

371
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
It's a map
of city hall.

372
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:43,516
With ingress and egress marks
and line of sight.

373
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,017
For an attack.

374
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,853
Why the hell would they
want to attack city hall?

375
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,488
After the SCPD
got bombed, they had to

376
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,991
move the academy
graduation to a different venue.

377
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:54,126
Oliver chose city hall,
but that decision was kept under wraps

378
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,428
for security reasons.

379
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,396
How the hell did
these guys find out?

380
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:59,165
I don't know, but we're running out
of time to stop them!

381
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,467
Bombs really did
their work in here.

382
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:03,302
Yep.

383
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:04,670
Maybe I should just
do this alone, huh?

384
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:06,739
What, in case you find
my fake daughter dead?

385
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:08,274
Or alive.

386
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,142
It's all right.
I'll be fine.

387
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,181
Oh. Now what's what,
in case she's not dead?

388
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:17,516
In case
Talia al Ghul isn't.

389
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,485
That's what John gave
me this for.

390
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:21,887
Besides, swords aren't
really my thing come on.

391
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,891
Think they knew
what they were signing on for

392
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,526
when they threw
in with Chase?

393
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:31,063
Seems to me they threw in
with Nyssa's sister.

394
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:33,232
Either way, I'm gonna
go with a no.

395
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:35,901
Dinah!

396
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,106
Hi, Daddy.

397
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,707
Laurel.

398
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:45,044
This might be
a late night, Raisa.

399
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:46,412
I remember when your
late nights were

400
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:48,080
more like
early mornings.

401
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,448
Thankfully, I've
exchanged club openings

402
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,617
for Police Academy
graduations now.

403
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,252
Raisa!

404
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:55,988
Another nightmare.
I know how to get him back to sleep.

405
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,490
No, no. I'll get him.

406
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:04,296
Hey, buddy.

407
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:08,100
W--where's Raisa?

408
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,035
I'm here.

409
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,504
It was just a dream.

410
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:15,508
The bad man
was in my dream.

411
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,810
He's why my mom's
gone.

412
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:20,679
Well, he can't hurt you
anymore, William.

413
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,148
He's gone.

414
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:28,621
No, he's not.

415
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:31,624
Buddy, I'm confused.
I'm...One.

416
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:34,026
Where do you think
the bad man is?

417
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:54,965
Hey. Is
everything ok?

418
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,900
I'm worried
about William.

419
00:21:56,902 --> 00:21:59,036
- You want to talk about it?
- I would love to talk about it,

420
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,039
but we have more
pressing business, ok?

421
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,240
- Right.
- Ok.

422
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:05,309
Ok. Well, I--I
cracked the code,

423
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:07,377
I mean, so to speak.
You are welcome.

424
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,313
These are
the targeted areas,

425
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:11,148
which means we can
almost be 100% positive

426
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,050
that evil Laurel
and friends will be attacking

427
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,785
the Police Academy
graduation tonight.

428
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:16,553
The question is why.

429
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:18,655
9 dead officers
wasn't enough for them?

430
00:22:18,657 --> 00:22:20,991
No, it wasn't...

431
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:23,427
Because she didn't get
who she was after.

432
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,761
You mean you?

433
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:26,697
Quentin.

434
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:28,465
Dinah, I appreciate you
having my back,

435
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:31,068
but I appreciate
the truth a little bit more.

436
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,970
Wait. What exactly
are we missing here?

437
00:22:32,972 --> 00:22:35,239
You're missing why I told
you guys that Dinah and I

438
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:38,942
found Laurel dead
back on Lian Yu.

439
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:40,978
Quentin, I don't think
you have to do this.

440
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Yeah, I do.

441
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:44,815
I've been living
with this guilt for too long.

442
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:48,218
I can't do it anymore.

443
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,088
Bad Laurel...

444
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,858
She wasn't dead when we found her
back on Lian Yu.

445
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:01,331
The bad news is is that you won't be
able to scream anymore,

446
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,302
but the good news is
is that you'll be too dead to care.

447
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,918
I told Quentin to say
she was dead when we found her

448
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,288
to spare him the pain
of telling you all the truth.

449
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,356
The truth is
he saved my life.

450
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:30,027
The truth is I killed
my daughter.

451
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,063
I killed my baby girl.
I just left her for dead.

452
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:34,197
That's the truth.

453
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,667
She was gonna kill me.

454
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:38,335
As sure as I am
standing here right now,

455
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:41,405
she was going to kill me,
and you saved my life.

456
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:44,308
Mm-hmm.

457
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,676
You're staying here
tonight.

458
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,144
I can't.

459
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:48,378
Quentin, if Laurel
is targeting you, then she--

460
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,514
Then she's not
gonna stop,

461
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,482
and the only way
we can stop her

462
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:55,385
is by dangling me
right in front of her,

463
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:58,855
so I'm gonna be there tonight
front and center, ok, you understand?

464
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:00,924
All right.

465
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,559
You're at
the graduation,

466
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:06,096
but we need SCPD canine units at
every entry point.

467
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:08,265
Actually, we can
kill the canines.

468
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:10,167
- What?
- Um, by kill,

469
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,102
I do not mean kill
the actual dogs. I--

470
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:13,804
Curtis, what
are those?

471
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:16,273
These are the latest
in high-tech sniffer devices.

472
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:17,741
Wait. Those are
bomb detectors?

473
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:19,343
They can spot as little
as an ounce

474
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:21,311
of explosive material
within a 1,000-foot radius.

475
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:23,213
Yeah. The only catch
is that we actually have to be there

476
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:25,148
to operate them,
which means Curtis and I

477
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,917
need to be on the field,
which means no one will be down here

478
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,318
operating the comms.

479
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,087
I'll do it.

480
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,122
Someone has to take
one for the team.

481
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:34,224
I can do it.

482
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:35,692
You sure?

483
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:37,794
Yeah. My gun would get
lost in all that Argus

484
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:40,797
and SCPD firepower
anyways.

485
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,132
I'll stay.

486
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:43,633
Ok.

487
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:47,337
Ok. Let's get
out there.

488
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:54,244
We have to get her
out of here.

489
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:56,013
Oliver?

490
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:57,647
Samantha?

491
00:24:57,649 --> 00:24:59,082
William?

492
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:01,284
He's fine, he's fine.
Are you ok?

493
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:02,786
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

494
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:05,222
Hey. No. He's fine.
He's fine.

495
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:06,656
We have to get you
medical attention.

496
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:09,393
No. I just needed to
make sure that he was ok.

497
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:10,660
He wants to see
his mom.

498
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:14,931
William needs a parent.
Promise me...

499
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,933
That you will be
his father.

500
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:18,468
I promise.

501
00:25:33,685 --> 00:25:35,485
Curtis, you got anything?

502
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:38,188
Negative, and shouldn't
you be calling me Mr. Terrific?

503
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,489
I am in the field.

504
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:40,991
Yeah, but you're not
in your suit,

505
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:42,426
so no suit,
no codenames.

506
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:43,860
Them's the rules.

507
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:47,130
How about we
try to focus instead?

508
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:48,799
Spartan, what do you see?

509
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,434
So far, so good.

510
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:52,369
Yeah. Maybe they
decided to rethink their plan.

511
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:53,937
That'd be a smart move.

512
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:55,539
Haven't seen this many cops
in one place in my life.

513
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:58,341
Me either.
I'm a cop.

514
00:25:58,343 --> 00:26:01,011
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
they're not gonna try something,

515
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:02,512
so everyone stay sharp.

516
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:04,648
Thank you all
for being here.

517
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,284
In light of the recent attacks
on the SCPD,

518
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:10,320
tonight's ceremony is
incredibly important,

519
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:13,557
and while we need to mourn
the loss of life,

520
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,159
I feel the need to mention
that this city

521
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,762
is better off than it
has been in quite some time.

522
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,597
Crime is down.

523
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,965
Our streets are peaceful.

524
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,900
People are
not only moving here,

525
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:27,704
they are staying here,
and do you want to know why?

526
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:30,740
It's because you help
them feel safe.

527
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:32,342
You have chosen
a profession,

528
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:35,378
one of the most dangerous
professions in the world.

529
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,280
Whereas other people
run from danger,

530
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:40,717
you run towards it
time and time and time again,

531
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:43,353
and for that,
we all owe you

532
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,956
a huge debt
of gratitude,

533
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,725
so thank you.

534
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:50,560
Thank you for protecting
our families,

535
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:52,562
for protecting us,

536
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:55,632
and for protecting
our beautiful city.

537
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:57,300
Thank you.

538
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,537
- Well done, Mr. Mayor.
- Of course.

539
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,572
You keep this up, they're gonna ask you
to run for governor.

540
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:05,542
Yeah? I'm just glad
a bomb didn't go off during the speech.

541
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:07,277
Anything from Black Siren
and her crew?

542
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,379
You mean the psychopaths
I unleashed on this city?

543
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:10,881
No, not yet.

544
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:12,849
You cannot take that
on, Quentin,

545
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:14,518
and this speaking
as one of the world's

546
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,386
leaders
in feeling guilty.

547
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:18,221
Um, have you ever
fired a gun at your own daughter?

548
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:21,224
That is--ahem--that's
not what happened.

549
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:25,428
Black Siren
is not Laurel.

550
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,331
She is Laurel.
You know it, and I know it,

551
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:32,235
and we both know that this parallel
universe crap is crap!

552
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:33,637
All right. Every time
I see her, I get

553
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:36,940
that--that feeling,
that instinct.

554
00:27:36,942 --> 00:27:38,642
She's my child.

555
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:42,479
She's--she's
my baby girl, Oliver,

556
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,414
and I tried to
kill her.

557
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,783
Well, from what I understand,
you were protecting a friend.

558
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:48,952
You are not just
a good man, Quentin.

559
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:50,420
You are a good father.

560
00:27:51,823 --> 00:27:53,757
I know because you're
a better father than

561
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,258
I could ever hope to be.

562
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,626
You got to give it
some time.

563
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:58,128
You only been at it,
what, 5 months?

564
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,429
It's not getting
any easier.

565
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:00,964
- Well--
- William blames me

566
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:02,465
for Samantha's death.

567
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:05,569
- Why?
- Because he's a smart kid,

568
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:08,805
and he knows what
happened happened

569
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:11,474
because I was involved.

570
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:12,842
He shouldn't be with me.

571
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:14,411
He should be
with Samantha's parents.

572
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:16,112
Well, listen. That's not what
Samantha thought.

573
00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:18,315
I don't know how to
reach him.

574
00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:19,816
Just be his father.

575
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:25,388
Hey. Anything?

576
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,491
Nothing. Curtis and
I have scanned every inch of this place.

577
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:29,926
Something seems
really off.

578
00:28:29,928 --> 00:28:31,094
Let's get in touch
with Spartan,

579
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:32,462
see if he saw anything
on the cams.

580
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,331
Spartan,
do you copy?

581
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,499
Yeah. Still here,
still nothing.

582
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:38,835
Maybe Argus scared them off.

583
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:41,037
Maybe they're targeting
Lance some other way.

584
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,138
Maybe he isn't the target--

585
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,991
John.
John, do you copy?

586
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:04,227
John, are you ok?

587
00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:05,495
Don't worry, Felicity.

588
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:06,529
John's fine.

589
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,767
He's just gonna be catching up
with an old friend.

590
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,192
Shouldn't you be protecting
the graduation ceremony?

591
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,655
Oh, but what's wrong?

592
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,590
Did you lose your nerve
along with your aim?

593
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:25,794
I don't know.
You tell me.

594
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,100
You want me to
kill him?

595
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,836
I'm not paying you
to keep him alive.

596
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,309
Let's get to work.

597
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:07,636
You're not gonna
feel a thing, promise.

598
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,531
You ok?

599
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,333
Unh!

600
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,168
Pissed!

601
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,969
Just about finished.

602
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:42,771
Make sure you put
one here, too.

603
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,578
Incoming!

604
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:01,757
Aah!

605
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,326
God, you are such a bitch.

606
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:06,261
Yeah. It takes one
to know one, sweetheart.

607
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,802
Hyaaah!

608
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:26,448
Good news.
The bomb sniffer works.

609
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,584
Bad news--it's
working in the bunker.

610
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,252
Yeah.
The whole place is wired.

611
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:31,620
Yeah. If you can take
the devices,

612
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:33,055
I can jam the detonation
signal remotely.

613
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,423
Is John ok?

614
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,559
I don't know,
but...I might not be.

615
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,497
Spartan's fine.
I have eyes on Black Siren.

616
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:49,972
Err!

617
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:56,912
To be continued.

618
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,752
Don't move!

619
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,622
I said don't move.

620
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,124
Well, this feels
familiar.

621
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:12,795
Maybe this time,
you'll aim for the heart.

622
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,229
I'm sorry.

623
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,799
For shooting me
or for leaving me for dead?

624
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,834
You were trying to
hurt my friend.

625
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:22,137
Oh. So--so you choose
your friend

626
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,440
over your own daughter?

627
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,974
Don't make me do
this, Laurel.

628
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:27,776
Please don't make
me do this.

629
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:29,678
So now I'm Laurel?

630
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,683
Don't torture yourself

631
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,652
because if we were back
on Lian Yu

632
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,987
and the roles were
reversed,

633
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:40,722
I would have
pulled the trigger.

634
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:55,726
Whoa. Hell of a mess.

635
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:58,429
Yeah. Ahem. What's
happening with the graduation?

636
00:32:58,431 --> 00:32:59,930
Uh, went off
without a problem

637
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:01,398
unless you count
some food poisoning

638
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,933
from the city
caterer.

639
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:04,335
The graduation was
a distraction.

640
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:06,170
Laurel left that map
for me and Dinah to find.

641
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,873
So when did she pivot
from targeting them to targeting us?

642
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,307
Maybe she didn't.

643
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:13,511
I mean, maybe the SCPD
and the bunker

644
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,546
were her targets
all along.

645
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:17,214
That seems pretty random, particularly
considering how much trouble Laurel

646
00:33:17,216 --> 00:33:18,582
went through to make sure
we wouldn't be here.

647
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,817
Well, what if planting
the explosives

648
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:21,218
wasn't her objective?

649
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,953
Planting the explosives
was cover her objective.

650
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:24,221
- Yeah.
- What if she was trying to

651
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:26,257
- steal something?
- Like what?

652
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,792
She doesn't need
weapons.

653
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,026
Mercenaries she's
working with do.

654
00:33:29,028 --> 00:33:30,594
We should inventory
the armory.

655
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:32,897
We--we should inventory
everything that we have.

656
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:35,065
If she stole something,
we need to know what it is,

657
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,168
and we need to know
fast.

658
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,905
Hey. You all right?

659
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:42,373
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

660
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,241
I'm just glad nobody
was hurt, you know?

661
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,410
- Yeah.
- Listen. I'm sorry

662
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:48,779
about, uh, lying to you
about what happened on Lian Yu.

663
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:51,916
Quentin, you don't
have to apologize to me.

664
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:54,351
I'm sorry that you had
to go through that.

665
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:57,588
When are you gonna stop
taking on everybody else's sins, huh?

666
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,490
No time soon.

667
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,835
- How you feeling?
- Oh. Like a million bucks.

668
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:13,437
Yeah?

669
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,039
All right. Maybe more
like a couple hundred,

670
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,441
but I'm alive, right?

671
00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:20,711
Dr. Schwartz would like you in here
for a few more days.

672
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:22,246
I feel good.

673
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,748
Besides, when have
I ever listened to anybody?

674
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,285
Not to get too personal,
but what would happen to Zoe

675
00:34:28,287 --> 00:34:30,020
if something
happened to you?

676
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:32,823
Not much.

677
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:34,391
Well, she's got
a new family now, Hoss.

678
00:34:34,393 --> 00:34:37,294
I mean, she probably
doesn't even think about me.

679
00:34:37,296 --> 00:34:38,462
She's your daughter,
Rene.

680
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,197
Of course she thinks
about you.

681
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,366
That ship's sailed.

682
00:34:42,368 --> 00:34:44,101
I blew that chance
months ago.

683
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:47,504
Chase blew that chance
for you.

684
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:50,574
One of the many reasons
why I think you deserve another one.

685
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:58,015
I tried getting
another hearing.

686
00:34:58,017 --> 00:34:59,483
Yeah. You're not
the mayor.

687
00:35:04,223 --> 00:35:06,156
- You got me another hearing?
- Not just me.

688
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:08,425
The new DA had something
to do with it.

689
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:10,527
Ahh. All right. Ok.

690
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:14,498
Thank you, Oliver.
I owe you one.

691
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,567
Pay me back
by getting better.

692
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:18,168
Copy that.

693
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:03,213
Hey, kid.

694
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:08,786
Hello, Slade.

695
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:09,920
How's she doing?

696
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:11,622
She's the same.

697
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:15,559
What are you
doing here?

698
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:17,594
I popped by to say
that the Intel that you gave me

699
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:21,932
on my son Joe,
it panned out...

700
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,936
So I'm heading
to Calgary.

701
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:28,405
Well, that's great.
I'm very, uh--

702
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:32,710
I'm happy for you,
and I hope that--

703
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,378
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

704
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,313
You don't think
I will?

705
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:39,350
Ahem.

706
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:43,053
I think that finding
your son

707
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:45,222
doesn't always go
as planned.

708
00:36:45,224 --> 00:36:48,859
Have things been
that hard with you and your son?

709
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:50,194
Yeah.

710
00:36:50,196 --> 00:36:53,197
Be patient

711
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,132
but be prepared.

712
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:56,734
For what?

713
00:36:56,736 --> 00:37:02,840
Choosing between being
the man that people need you to be

714
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:09,146
or the father that your
son needs you to be.

715
00:37:09,148 --> 00:37:10,981
What do you mean
by that?

716
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:16,053
You and I...walk
between two worlds...

717
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:21,658
But we can only do
that for so long.

718
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:30,734
Good luck...Mr. Queen.

719
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,369
Good luck, Slade.

720
00:37:58,097 --> 00:37:59,329
Gah!

721
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:02,166
You ok?

722
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:03,667
Yeah, I'm good.

723
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:07,071
Anything, uh, missing?

724
00:38:07,073 --> 00:38:10,374
No. It's all
accounted for.

725
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,875
Including your gun?

726
00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:14,912
Not that you seem to be
using it that much these days.

727
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:20,751
I, uh, checked it
after the fight down here.

728
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:22,086
You checked my gun?

729
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:23,554
You didn't even
fire it,

730
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:26,457
and none of the guys
down here got hit either.

731
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah. Dinah...

732
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,336
I found it!

733
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:40,904
And by "found it,"
I mean, I found

734
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:43,807
what Laurel--um,
Black Siren took,

735
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:46,110
which is actually more
like not finding anything at all,

736
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:48,178
but you get my point.

737
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,647
What poin--no.
We--no. I'm not sure we do.

738
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:53,317
She took one of my T-spheres,
prototype version.

739
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:56,386
A prototype,
meaning it's not weaponized?

740
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:58,122
Well, then they
can't use it against us.

741
00:38:58,124 --> 00:39:00,124
Question is
what can they do?

742
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:32,289
Hey, buddy.

743
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:40,497
William, I know that
the last few months

744
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:42,432
have been difficult
for you,

745
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:49,206
and I know that you
blame me for part of that.

746
00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:55,546
I used to blame
my dad for things.

747
00:39:55,548 --> 00:39:58,482
He wasn't perfect.

748
00:39:58,484 --> 00:39:59,850
Neither am I...

749
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:04,188
But he loved me.

750
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:09,159
I know how much
your mom loved you.

751
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:11,562
She really did,
but you need to know

752
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:17,935
that the last thing that she asked of me
was to take care you.

753
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,937
Now you don't have
to like me

754
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:21,738
for me to take
care of you

755
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,142
because I'm your dad.

756
00:40:25,144 --> 00:40:28,145
The way that works is
I am gonna be there for you

757
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:30,147
whether you want me
to be or not.

758
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:35,018
I am never, ever
walking away from you.

759
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,795
There's a game on
tomorrow if you want to...

760
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:47,431
Stay up late
and watch it.

761
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:53,403
Football
or baseball?

762
00:40:57,943 --> 00:40:59,209
Baseball.

763
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:02,446
Ok.

764
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:08,352
Ok.

765
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:21,265
Hi. I was just gonna
give you a call.

766
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:23,400
Turn on channel 52
right now.

767
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:24,801
Ok.

768
00:41:26,705 --> 00:41:29,239
...with the discovery
of a shocking photograph

769
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:31,575
that seems to finally
solve the mystery

770
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:33,877
haunting Star City
for the past two years--

771
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:36,413
who is the Green Arrow?

772
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:39,116
This photo, which was
obtained exclusively

773
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:42,552
by channel 52 provides
unequivocal proof

774
00:41:42,554 --> 00:41:44,621
of the identity
of the vigilante known

775
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,490
as the Green Arrow.

776
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:47,724
Oliver...

777
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:48,892
This is the latest
controversy to hit...

778
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:50,427
What are we
gonna do?

779
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,496
What else has the mayor
lied about?

780
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:54,998
As always, we'll keep you updated
with breaking news on channel 52.

781
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,633
I--I don't know.

782
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:04,041
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>

783
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,210
Greg!
Move your head.
