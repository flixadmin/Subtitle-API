1
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,616
Aah!

2
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,986
- Whoo!
- Ha ha ha!

3
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,998
Aah!

4
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,556
Oh, man! Heh heh.

5
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,063
- Did you see that?
- Woo!

6
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, my God. Ha ha!

7
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,066
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

8
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,441
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

9
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,467
Oh, babe. You missed out.

10
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,501
Yes!

11
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,947
I want to get off.

12
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,358
Whoo! Ow!

13
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,556
Ha ha ha!

14
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,928
That was intense, man.

15
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,195
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

16
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,032
Yeah, yeah. Maybe for you,
but our lives are actually goin' somewhere.

17
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,197
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

18
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,036
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

19
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,473
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line...

20
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,703
for, like, a day and a half,
and that's gonna kill me.

21
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,732
- OK!
- All right?

22
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:32,745
So let's go.

23
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,270
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

24
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,977
OK. Come on, it won't kill us to get
a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

25
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,451
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?
Yeah, that might kill me.

26
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,614
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

27
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,850
Ha ha ha!

28
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,071
- Unh!
- Ha ha!

29
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,405
Oh, I'll take that.

30
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,070
No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

31
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,442
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

32
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,446
Ha ha!

33
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,141
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

34
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,980
- Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
- Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

35
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,883
Ha ha!

36
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,114
- Ow!
- Nice.

37
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,850
Um, could you, like,
please delete that one of Stacy?

38
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,255
Ha ha!

39
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,123
These are for the yearbook.

40
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,287
And I have to turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline...

41
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,355
and, like, I doubt it if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

42
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,559
is gonna make it in there.

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,692
Whew. I'd buy two.

44
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,997
Ha ha ha!

45
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,401
Number 38, your order's ready.

46
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,462
That's us.

47
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,973
I am so sorry.

48
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,566
Kevin can get so out of control.

49
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,510
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

50
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,945
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak...

51
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,745
like I couldn't handle that.

52
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,683
I'm breaking up with him.

53
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,782
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.

54
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,156
I've been wanting to for a while.

55
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,787
But don't tell anybody, OK?

56
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,126
Whoa. Ha ha!

57
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,928
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

58
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,458
- I love it.
- I love it.

59
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,837
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

60
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,364
Come on, go, go, go,
go, go, go go!

61
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,809
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.
You're totally winning.

62
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,869
- Am I winning?
- Yeah, come on, hurry!

63
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,778
OK, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

64
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,382
Am I winning? Look around,
I don't want to look.

65
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,646
You're totally winning.

66
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,744
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

67
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,153
- Don't look!
- Oh, my God! Come on!

68
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,487
Oh, my God!
I'm winning! I'm winning!

69
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,353
Aah! Aah!

70
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,453
- I won!
- I knew you would.

71
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,124
Oh, my God! Gimme my prize.

72
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,690
- Good job.
- That was so awesome, Ashley.

73
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,792
Ashley.

74
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,838
Woo! Ha ha!

75
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,400
How ya doin', my brother?
You havin' a good time, huh?

76
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,037
- You like that?
- Ha ha!

77
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,982
Yeah! You like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

78
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,882
Whoo-ooh!

79
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,181
Sam!

80
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,283
Excuse me.

81
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,727
You're not a senior.

82
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,163
And what are
you gonna do about it...

83
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,430
Miss "Cutest Couple,"
Rah Rah? Ha ha!

84
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,198
Mom know you're here?

85
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,934
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

86
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,908
Proof where you were.

87
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,570
Take a shot of this.

88
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,839
Ha ha ha!

89
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,477
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

90
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,386
# That is three, number three #

91
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,324
# Oh, I'm the man, I'm the man #
Man, I am hot.

92
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,519
- Man, gimme some right here, man.
- Right here! Right here!

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,721
What you doin'?
Get the fuck back. Hoo!

94
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,061
My God, I am good. Here we go.

95
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,464
Boy, I'll tell ya...
Goddamn. Whoo!

96
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,298
Kind sir, step right up!

97
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,304
There ya go. Whaddaya want?

98
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,738
Here we go, baby.
3 for 3. It's all mine.

99
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,435
Here we go. Here we go.

100
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,635
Big prize. Watch out.
Come on.

101
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,700
Unh!

102
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,241
Ho ho ho!

103
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,182
# That's what I'm talkin' 'bout #

104
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,946
We gonna get that one.
You want that blue one?

105
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,010
That's the one we gonna get.

106
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,151
Ha ha ha!

107
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:13,429
Ha ha ha ha!

108
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:18,904
You can run, but you cannot hide.

109
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,906
- Yes!
- Whoo! Here we are, baby.

110
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,964
- Yes!
- Whoo!

111
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,033
- There it is.
- Awesome.

112
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,941
Here, get a pic of this. Ahhh!

113
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,742
This is the beginning of the end.

114
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,807
Ha ha ha!

115
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,046
Hey, guys, get in line.

116
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,886
Let's go on again!

117
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:41,951
What's wrong?

118
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,428
I'm...

119
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,626
I was having that feeling
like dejá vu, you know?

120
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,966
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

121
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,061
Hey, J.

122
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,332
Come on, man, let's go.

123
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,363
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

124
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,875
What, are you weirded out
by the ride?

125
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,738
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe...

126
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,339
you're nervous about
this roller coaster...

127
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,010
because they say the real fear
with these rides...

128
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,351
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

129
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,516
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

130
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,220
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

131
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,751
Never.

132
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,190
OK.

133
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,963
You can run, but you cannot hide.

134
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,698
Oh! Where you guys are right now
if you raise your hands and just...

135
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,706
Ha... cup them slightly...

136
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,140
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

137
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,007
And we'd wanna do that why?

138
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,376
When else you ever gonna see
a dick that big?

139
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,675
I'm lookin' at one right now.

140
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:40,243
Ha ha!
Man, you guys are smokin' hot.

141
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,550
- Get out, Frankie.
- Yeah, why are you even here?

142
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,385
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.

143
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,789
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

144
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,691
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

145
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,719
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.

146
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,961
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

147
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,195
Ha ha ha ha!

148
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,362
You're totally sad.

149
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,042
Try not to scream!

150
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,011
Ha ha ha!

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,450
That was totally awesome!

152
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,816
Yeah! Sweet!

153
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,742
You all right?

154
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,077
There's nothing to worry about.

155
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,309
A roller coaster
is just elemental physics.

156
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,376
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

157
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,547
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million...

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,920
of dying in a roller coaster.

159
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,289
Yeah, yeah,
thanks for that, McKinley.

160
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,624
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park...

161
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,652
than dying at one.

162
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,423
Whoo! Heh.

163
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,406
Here we go.

164
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,943
Whoo!

165
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,774
You like this?

166
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,411
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

167
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,048
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

168
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,820
I like this. It's old school.

169
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,885
Frankie Cheeks
is old school, ladies.

170
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,729
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

171
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,755
Ew.

172
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,700
Oh! Let's go.

173
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,363
Hey... Baby.

174
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,338
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

175
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,704
- 4.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,072
Uh, gate one.

177
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,371
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

178
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,536
Wait... No. No, please.

179
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,978
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.
I just... I can't sit in the front.

180
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,175
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

181
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,741
OK. Take it easy.

182
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,845
Uh, well, Carrie will sit in
the back with you. Right, babe?

183
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,880
Uh! Why me?
What? 'Cause we're girls?

184
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,950
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

185
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,188
I'm sitting in the front.

186
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,686
J, just go, OK? I'll live.

187
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,026
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

188
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,157
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

189
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,166
All right, you know what?
We'll just settle this like real men.

190
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,861
How about that? Hmm? Call it.

191
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,984
Heads.

192
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:34,582
Shit! Damn it.

193
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:38,026
All right, fine, what the fuck.
It's the same ride, right?

194
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,858
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

195
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:42,421
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

196
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:44,263
Keep an eye on her, OK?
She's kinda freaked out.

197
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:45,427
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

198
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:47,403
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

199
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,367
Ha ha ha!

200
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:00,945
Aaah!

201
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,396
Ohh!

202
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,495
Here we go. Hey!

203
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,701
J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

204
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,040
I'm serious. You know,
payback's a bitch, OK?

205
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:29,875
You know, she might need
some comforting...

206
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,505
and I'll be there for her. OK?

207
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,812
Hey, no! No.
Get out. Get out.

208
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,249
Hey! Find another cockpit,
Top Gun.

209
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:36,980
No. Get...

210
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,045
Let's just get in the back, OK?

211
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:42,247
Ha ha ha!

212
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,385
Ahem.

213
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,428
Guess who's back?

214
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:50,023
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

215
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,466
Hey!

216
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:54,470
I'll meet you at the end.

217
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:57,840
Here! All right!

218
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,034
Cool!

219
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,541
Hey. How'd you guys
get in here?

220
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,308
What? I'm 55 inches.

221
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,814
- Sure. Come on out.
- Oh, man.

222
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:07,146
You, too. Out.

223
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:08,378
- Ready?
- Ohh!

224
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,818
I told you
we wouldn't get away with it.

225
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:11,878
You OK?

226
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,446
Let's go on the bumper cars.

227
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,424
Come on. Here we go.

228
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,057
Yeah!

229
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:25,959
What's up, man? I'm good.

230
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:32,301
Dare you to, uh, flash me
them sweet, sweet titties...

231
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:33,570
when we go through the loop.

232
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:40,873
All right. Ha ha!

233
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:48,351
Yo! What, you can't read?

234
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:53,595
Oh. Well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man?

235
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,654
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,689
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

237
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:06,900
Oh!

238
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:08,774
Aw, shit!

239
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:13,341
Here you go!

240
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,018
Whoo-ooh!

241
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,587
Whoo! Win, baby!
Yes, baby! Win!

242
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,428
Come on!

243
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,263
Come on. Get hyped.

244
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,598
The first hill's so high.

245
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,069
Yeah.

246
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:36,971
This is what we need!

247
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,840
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

248
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,104
Whoo!

249
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:43,612
Whoo-hoo!

250
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:45,740
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

251
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:46,771
Ow!

252
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:50,619
Whoo!

253
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,682
Aw, yeah!

254
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,278
Whoo!

255
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,182
Whoo! Shit!

256
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:35,455
Aah!

257
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:37,295
Oh, man.

258
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,267
Oh, my God!

259
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,291
Here we go!

260
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:42,031
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

261
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,333
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

262
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:44,737
Aah!

263
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,799
Yeah! Whoo!

264
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:55,378
Aah!

265
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:59,515
- Aah!
- Aah!

266
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,215
Ha ha!

267
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:07,553
Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha!

268
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:09,553
Whoo!

269
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

270
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:15,035
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

271
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,335
- Whoo!

272
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,811
Aah! Aah!

273
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,418
Whoo!

274
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:38,689
Yeah! Show me your titties!

275
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:39,854
- Fuck off, Frankie!
- Oh!

276
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:50,502
Aah!

277
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,872
- Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

278
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,377
Aah!

279
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:00,946
Unh!

280
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,719
Oh, shit!

281
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:06,381
- Aah!
- Aah!

282
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:07,753
Aah!

283
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:12,192
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

284
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:13,718
Aah!

285
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:18,466
No!

286
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:30,473
- Aah!
- Aaah!

287
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,650
Aah!

288
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:38,545
Aah!

289
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:41,384
Oh! Oh!

290
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:48,524
Aah!

291
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,464
Unh!

292
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:55,460
Oh!

293
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:56,971
- Yow!
- Kevin!

294
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:59,134
No!

295
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,540
Aah!

296
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:08,877
Whoa!

297
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,208
Aah!

298
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,920
No! Aah!

299
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,499
Aah!

300
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,367
Erin, hang on!

301
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,771
Erin!

302
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,297
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

303
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:34,309
I can't.

304
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,436
Aah!

305
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,106
Aah!

306
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:39,637
No!

307
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:41,805
Aah!

308
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,614
Oh, God!

309
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,211
Hang on, Wen.

310
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:48,155
Hang on! Help me rock it!

311
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:54,787
Unh! Unh! Unh!

312
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,395
Unh!

313
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:02,059
Almost got it! Gently.

314
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,745
Aaaah!

315
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:18,386
No!

316
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,015
Unh! Aah!

317
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:24,026
Aah!

318
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:28,391
Yo. What, you can't read?

319
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:30,092
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

320
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,225
Yeah.

321
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,791
Thanks, bro.

322
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:34,167
Ahh. All right.
Let's do this, Wen...

323
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,069
What're you..?

324
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:37,698
Here you go!

325
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,970
Yeah! Let's do it, baby! Whoo!

326
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,034
We have to get off of here.

327
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,546
No, don't push the button!
Don't! Don't push the button!

328
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:47,243
Unh! Let me off! Let me off!

329
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:48,614
Wen, Wen! It's all right.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

330
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:50,380
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

331
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,409
Wendy?

332
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:55,049
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

333
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,558
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

334
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:57,890
Chick's on somethin'.

335
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:58,985
It's all right! You'll be OK!

336
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,052
OK, let 'em out. Just the back.

337
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,358
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

338
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,593
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

339
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,829
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

340
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,270
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

341
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:11,671
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

342
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,471
No, she was just a little upset before.

343
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,535
Man, please, can you please
control that bitch?

344
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:18,911
Damn. "It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

345
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,939
Man, she's just trying to get
some fuckin' attention.

346
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,713
You know what?
You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

347
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:24,219
- Fuck you.
- Fuck <i>moi?</i>

348
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:25,619
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

349
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:26,622
Ow!

350
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:27,645
Hey, hey!

351
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,884
Unh!

352
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:29,892
Just relax!

353
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,223
Fight, man!

354
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:32,319
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

355
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:33,954
Nobody else gets off this ride!

356
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:35,931
Dude, let me off.

357
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:37,262
So high school.

358
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,426
Let's out.

359
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:39,492
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

360
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:40,560
- Relax!
- Lan!

361
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:43,436
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

362
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:47,068
Get him out of here!
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

363
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,408
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's OK.

364
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,675
- Relax! Calm down!
- # Hey! Ho! Let's go #

365
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:53,341
- Get your big ass off me, man!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

366
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:55,783
- Let me out!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

367
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:57,080
Dude!

368
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,987
# Hey, ho, let's go,
hey, ho, let's go #

369
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:01,752
- Here we go!
- Let me off!

370
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,156
# Hey, ho #

371
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,227
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

372
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,252
Oh, my God!

373
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:09,697
Whoo!

374
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:11,700
Stop it! No! Stop it!

375
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,702
Stop it! Please!
Please, the tracks are broken.

376
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:18,707
Stop! Stop! Please!

377
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,265
Jason!

378
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,244
Hey, just relax, OK?

379
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,610
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right.

380
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:25,773
OK? Just let her settle down.

381
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,282
She can settle down at home!
Now listen...

382
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,909
what is your home phone number?

383
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:31,921
OK, we're gonna call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of...

384
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,946
Aah!

385
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:40,161
Oh, my God! Jason!

386
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,144
Ohh.

387
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:16,352
Hey, Wendy!

388
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:18,120
Hey!

389
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,856
Wait! Wendy!

390
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:22,488
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

391
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,226
I need... I need to talk to you
about something.

392
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,063
Just here to pick up my diploma.

393
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:27,363
You're not going to graduation?

394
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:28,699
No.

395
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:32,468
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked up place, OK?

396
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:35,169
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe...

397
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,235
it'd be good for you to be somewhere
where other people feel the same way.

398
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,268
At graduation?

399
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:40,042
No. Thanks.
I've had enough funerals.

400
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:41,480
Then do it for J and Carrie.

401
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,347
Do what? If you die,
then there's nothing...

402
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:45,717
then you're just dead,
and they don't know.

403
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:47,016
And if they are up in Heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi...

404
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:49,523
do you think they really care about
our high school graduation? No.

405
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,026
I am alive, and I don't care.

406
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,357
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot...

407
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:55,693
I am so out of McKinley.

408
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,095
Without J, what's here for me?

409
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,123
I'm here. OK?

410
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:02,603
I made a promise to J
that I would take care of you.

411
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:05,470
On the ride. For 3 minutes.

412
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,532
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

413
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,601
Kevin...

414
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:11,271
if it wasn't for
you and J being friends...

415
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:13,008
and me and Carrie being friends...

416
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:15,710
we wouldn't have even hung out.

417
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:20,582
We don't even like each other.

418
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,664
"Lan McKinley."

419
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,134
How pathetic is it
that my last name...

420
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:35,864
is the same as my high school?

421
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:38,737
Julie, look who
I got to sign my yearbook.

422
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:41,469
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

423
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,385
I think we should invite her.

424
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,909
- You think?
- Yeah.

425
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:58,890
Wen? Um...

426
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:01,487
So we're ready
for graduation tonight...

427
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,930
we're going to
the tanning salon after this...

428
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:06,399
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

429
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:07,560
Totally.

430
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:09,661
And just like, talk if you want.

431
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:13,238
Here's my cell.

432
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,539
I already have your number.

433
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:19,805
That was so nice of us.

434
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:31,158
You're not alone.

435
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:33,023
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

436
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:34,289
OK? I really do.

437
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,058
No, it's happened before.

438
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:39,123
OK? I went online looking for
an explanation about...

439
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,431
Wendy, just... just listen
to me, all right?

440
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:44,495
All right, look, I went online
looking for an explanation...

441
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:45,972
about what happened,
and I found out...

442
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:48,532
about this high school
French class from New York.

443
00:25:48,577 --> 00:25:51,569
Six years ago
they went on a trip to Paris.

444
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:52,910
When they were boarding...

445
00:25:52,948 --> 00:25:55,382
a kid had a vision that
the plane was gonna explode.

446
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:58,477
Just like you did.

447
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,078
He freaked out...

448
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:02,521
and seven people
got off the plane.

449
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:06,425
Just like us.

450
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:12,160
And on takeoff,
Flight 180 blew up.

451
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,532
And over the next several months...

452
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:18,733
everyone who got off that plane
started dying in weird accidents.

453
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:22,231
They died in the order they would've
if they had stayed on the plane.

454
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:25,678
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

455
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:28,274
Fuck you, Kevin.

456
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:31,217
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

457
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:58,043
Ohh, every time we come here.

458
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,310
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

459
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:04,079
We did that for all the funerals
and it turned out amazing.

460
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,552
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

461
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:07,145
I mean, we're still pretty bronzed.

462
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:09,053
I was just thinking
we could go for, like, a tune-up.

463
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,490
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

464
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,788
Yeah.

465
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:14,852
You know, for all those kids
that died that night...

466
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:16,830
who will never get a graduation.

467
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,123
You know what?
You're totally right.

468
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:22,466
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

469
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:48,387
This is my... my good guy
luck bracelet...

470
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,660
that Grandma left me in her will.

471
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,989
Ohh!

472
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:55,093
Julie?

473
00:27:56,938 --> 00:27:58,803
I need...

474
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:03,874
I could use some help.

475
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,610
I have such...
such guilt over Jason.

476
00:28:09,651 --> 00:28:12,677
I should never have let
that ride go.

477
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:16,213
God. I'm usually such
a control freak...

478
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,724
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.

479
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,251
I should've done everything
I could to stop it.

480
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:25,061
And I would give anything...

481
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,227
to have a second chance.

482
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:31,699
But I never can.

483
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:39,108
I don't want to some day
feel that way about you, Julie.

484
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:42,446
I mean,
I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

485
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:46,386
You're all I have left.

486
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,889
You think when I find a place...

487
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:52,154
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?

488
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:56,456
You know I will.

489
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,161
You...

490
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:03,693
keep this now...

491
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:06,229
and I'll get it
when I come see you.

492
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:11,242
Oh. And... hey,
how 'bout on your end?

493
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,442
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

494
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:17,315
Yeah. As long as you bring it back
to school on Monday.

495
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:18,842
Done.

496
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,014
Oh. Um...

497
00:29:21,055 --> 00:29:22,488
Actually, the battery is pretty low...

498
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:25,823
so why don't you go get ready,
and I'll recharge it a bit.

499
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,418
Cool.

500
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,802
In a hurry, Yuri.

501
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:45,836
Sorry, sorry.
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

502
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,848
I think tanning beds
mess with signal.

503
00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,349
I must go outside.

504
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:52,148
Why don't you just use that phone?

505
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:55,156
I would, but she talks forever,
then my boss gives me shit.

506
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,324
Shit. That's her.

507
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,293
Ohh!

508
00:30:00,328 --> 00:30:01,420
You know what? Just go outside.

509
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:02,793
We can deal with this ourselves.

510
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:04,355
OK.

511
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:10,363
Hey. No drinks in the room
this time, OK?

512
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:11,429
Good.

513
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,644
What are you doing?

514
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:27,177
Nobody is walking in here
and seein' me naked.

515
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:06,711
Oh, my God.

516
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:19,331
Dude, he said no drinks.
If you spill that shit...

517
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,164
we're gonna have to clean it
up like last time.

518
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:23,329
Mmm!

519
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:25,896
Happy, beyotch?
Nothing to spill.

520
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:30,105
Why does Yuri keep it
so cold in here?

521
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:33,002
Maybe it's supposed to be colder
for the machines or whatever.

522
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:35,105
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

523
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:21,482
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

524
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:23,518
Sucks, bitch.

525
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:25,723
They got CDs.

526
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,159
Ew. Celine?

527
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:32,602
Britney?

528
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,833
Dude, are we like the only cool people
that come here or what?

529
00:33:34,873 --> 00:33:37,774
Uh, yeah.

530
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,540
Ugh. Whatever.

531
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:57,890
Why are you wearing underwear?

532
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,160
Steinmetz says
he gets off on tan lines.

533
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,690
All right.

534
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:48,136
# Roller coaster #

535
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,477
# Of love #

536
00:34:49,515 --> 00:34:50,846
# Say what? #

537
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:53,010
# Roller coaster #

538
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:55,020
# Ooh ooh ooh #

539
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:56,248
# Roller coaster #

540
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:57,277
# Right #

541
00:34:57,323 --> 00:34:58,915
# Of love #

542
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:01,490
# Roller coaster #

543
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:03,620
# Ooh ooh ooh #

544
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:07,462
# Roller coaster of love #

545
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:09,194
# Roller coaster #

546
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:10,701
# Wow wow wow #

547
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:11,896
# Ooh ooh ooh #

548
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:15,373
# Roller coaster of love... #

549
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:38,596
# I #

550
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:40,565
# Huh, huh #

551
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,267
# I'm gonna ride, girl #

552
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:47,772
# Yeah #

553
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,364
# Whoo-hoo-hoo #

554
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:51,000
# Wow, yeah #

555
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,135
# Huh huh #

556
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:54,771
# Ow #

557
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:56,610
# Oh, oh #

558
00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:02,881
Whoo.

559
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:05,947
# Roller coaster of love #

560
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:07,219
# Love roller coaster, girl #

561
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:09,022
# Roller coaster #

562
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,928
# Lovin' you
in a freaky world, child #

563
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,933
# Roller coaster of love #

564
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,607
Camera charged?

565
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:27,544
Oh, um, sorry,
the battery's totally dead.

566
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:29,410
Camera's not working. Sorry.

567
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:35,881
Look, Julie, I need a minute, OK?

568
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:37,912
Like private.

569
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:45,429
# That feels nice,
roller coaster #

570
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,728
# One more time #

571
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:51,202
# Roller coaster of love #

572
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,034
# Roller coaster #

573
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:59,635
# Roller coaster of love #

574
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:04,305
Ugh.

575
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,817
It's way too warm in here now, huh?

576
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:15,026
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

577
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,584
Huh?

578
00:37:30,075 --> 00:37:31,474
Ow! Aah!

579
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:35,372
Hello?

580
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:38,406
- Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...
- Psych! Leave a message.

581
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:41,149
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

582
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,210
Gimme a call whenever
you guys are done.

583
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:43,221
Aah!

584
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:45,120
And thanks again for the invite.

585
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:47,216
- Someone help!
- Aah!

586
00:37:49,194 --> 00:37:51,162
Sorry I was too late.

587
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:58,929
Aah!

588
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:00,563
Aah! Aah!

589
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:03,097
Aah! Aah! Aah!

590
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:08,409
Aah! Aah! Aah!

591
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,512
Aah! Aah!

592
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:14,416
Oh! Oh!

593
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:15,920
Oh! Aah!

594
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:18,022
Aaah! Aaah!

595
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,186
Hey, open the door!

596
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:34,168
Help me!

597
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:39,270
Aah!

598
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:45,580
Aah!

599
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:48,609
Aah!

600
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:54,658
We may feel that our lives
are not our own.

601
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:58,686
That Death controls,
frames our lives.

602
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,097
Our birth's nothing
but death begun.

603
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:06,730
Yet, whether it is with
this tragic loss of young lives...

604
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:10,173
which we have
suffered much of late...

605
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:15,111
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

606
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:19,777
we are all equal in Death's eyes.

607
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,514
"Equal in Death's eyes?"

608
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:24,512
All of us?
How can you say that?

609
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:25,784
Shut up, McKinley.

610
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:28,486
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

611
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:30,552
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

612
00:39:30,595 --> 00:39:33,291
Pimps, vice-presidents
walking around.

613
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:36,027
- All the atrocities they've committed...
- Let's just go. Come on.

614
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,329
They're alive and well.

615
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:41,430
These two girls, who'd never
done shit to anybody...

616
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:43,668
- Shh!
- They don't get to make it to 18?

617
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,335
Where's the fucking
equality in that?

618
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:47,645
- What?
- Come on, man.

619
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,340
I can... Yeah. Fine.

620
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:51,008
Fine. All right. All right.

621
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:52,812
I'm fine. All right.

622
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,614
That's crazy.

623
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:59,386
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

624
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:02,587
please step forward at this time.

625
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:12,294
I so feel this is so my fault.

626
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:14,805
How could it possibly be your fault?

627
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:17,933
Seein' women as nothin' but fun bags.

628
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:21,969
I mean... if I'd've seen their...

629
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:24,811
whatever... humanity...

630
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:27,909
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

631
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:32,356
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorize.

632
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,757
Stretch. Tan.

633
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,387
Don't be down, Frankie.

634
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,193
Be proud of your ability
to make everything...

635
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,495
that happens somehow
a story about you.

636
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:48,636
God!

637
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,444
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

638
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:03,716
Fucking boring.

639
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,588
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

640
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,354
man, bring me a PSP or somethin'.

641
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:10,054
'Least I have somethin' to do then.

642
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:16,867
Whew.

643
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:19,597
Hello?

644
00:41:19,638 --> 00:41:21,196
I'm with J.

645
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:50,499
What are you doing up here
in the nosebleeds?

646
00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:53,937
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

647
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:57,203
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

648
00:41:57,242 --> 00:42:01,406
And I wondered if
maybe here I could feel J's...

649
00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:05,382
spirit or presence or...

650
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,408
whatever.

651
00:42:07,452 --> 00:42:10,250
But now that I'm here...

652
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:13,883
if there's any place that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

653
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,528
it's a cemetery.

654
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:22,400
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

655
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:25,164
And I've tried.

656
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:28,138
Real hard. Heh.

657
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,935
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

658
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:40,077
that night...
before I got on the ride...

659
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:42,018
Jason said...

660
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:43,645
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride...

661
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,485
he said...

662
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:50,085
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."

663
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:52,824
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

664
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:56,800
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination...

665
00:42:56,835 --> 00:43:01,431
but this fear is more
than just being scared.

666
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:04,033
It's like a presence.

667
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:07,977
Like a living thing
always with me.

668
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:11,138
You think it's J?

669
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:12,706
No, I know it's not.

670
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:17,620
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

671
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:21,955
It's cold and terrifying.

672
00:43:57,695 --> 00:44:00,255
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

673
00:44:00,298 --> 00:44:01,788
The photographic plate
was broken...

674
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,199
causing a line
that can't be removed.

675
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:06,066
Exactly where he was shot.

676
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,104
Look. See the shadow?

677
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:14,337
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

678
00:44:14,379 --> 00:44:17,746
Look. This occurred
one year to the day...

679
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:19,841
of the Flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.

680
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:21,909
Look, I guess you came
to me with this...

681
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:24,251
because I'm responsible
for putting this in your head...

682
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:25,517
with the Flight 180 thing.

683
00:44:25,557 --> 00:44:27,582
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here...

684
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,388
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there...

685
00:44:29,427 --> 00:44:30,553
because you're desperate
for an answer.

686
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:32,495
I took these.

687
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,498
That night.

688
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:43,237
These?

689
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,071
Are these it?

690
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:55,609
Oh, shit.

691
00:44:57,188 --> 00:44:59,088
Oh... shit.

692
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:02,216
Ohh.

693
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:06,322
Whoa, whoa, hey.
You all right?

694
00:45:06,364 --> 00:45:07,991
I'm feeling a little woozy.

695
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,601
When was the last time you ate?

696
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:14,429
I don't remember.

697
00:45:15,607 --> 00:45:17,302
All right, come on. I'll drive.

698
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,376
OK, those kids on Flight 180
died in accidents...

699
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:27,748
in the order they would've died
if they'd have stayed on the plane.

700
00:45:27,785 --> 00:45:30,413
OK?
So if this is that, then...

701
00:45:31,623 --> 00:45:33,750
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

702
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:36,323
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture...

703
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,386
I felt this instinct.

704
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:40,158
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even...

705
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:42,666
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

706
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,928
Well, what's
Frankie's picture look like?

707
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:44,992
It's right here.

708
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:47,368
- You got it?
- Yeah.

709
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,865
- Wait! Watch out!
- Oh!

710
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,969
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

711
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,037
Sorry!

712
00:45:58,516 --> 00:46:00,347
All right,
let's just eat over there.

713
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:01,613
And go through
the drive through.

714
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:02,847
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

715
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:04,582
Well, it's nice to see
that things haven't made you...

716
00:46:04,622 --> 00:46:05,987
any less of a control freak.

717
00:46:14,465 --> 00:46:16,092
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

718
00:46:16,134 --> 00:46:17,158
Here's Frank's picture.

719
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:18,725
All right.

720
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,136
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

721
00:46:21,172 --> 00:46:24,073
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

722
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:27,772
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.
All right, what's...

723
00:46:27,812 --> 00:46:29,040
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

724
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,776
Oh, what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

725
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,148
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

726
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:39,112
It's so sad that you know that.

727
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:41,182
All right. He won that tacky
mud-flap girl chain...

728
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:42,783
on this game, though, so...

729
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:44,795
aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?

730
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:46,091
Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,995
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

732
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:52,263
All right! God.

733
00:46:55,406 --> 00:46:56,737
All right.

734
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:01,638
Uh, can I take your order?

735
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:03,510
Yeah. What do you want?

736
00:47:08,586 --> 00:47:10,019
Are you OK?

737
00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:20,790
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

738
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:26,169
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

739
00:47:26,204 --> 00:47:28,297
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

740
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:29,931
Hey!

741
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:35,773
# There is someone #

742
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:37,303
Stop! Stop!

743
00:47:37,348 --> 00:47:38,337
# Walking behind you #

744
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,011
Watch out! Shit!

745
00:47:41,052 --> 00:47:42,178
- What the fuck?
- # Turn around #

746
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,313
- Oh, my God!
- # Look at me #

747
00:47:44,355 --> 00:47:46,414
- Get out! Get out!
- What? What?

748
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:48,118
Behind us!

749
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:49,524
There's no one in that truck!

750
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,117
# Watching your footsteps #
