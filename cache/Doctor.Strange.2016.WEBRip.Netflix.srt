We've already called brain death.

-A bullet?
-A perfect bullet.

59
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,557
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet
by alloying lead with antimony.

60
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,478
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

I didn't have to save his patient, either.

You had a second opinion.

that was implicit in my disgust.

against dating colleagues.

-I call it the "Strange Policy."

Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

114
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,286
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

115
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,038
And yet, somehow no one seems to want
to call it the "Strange Technique."

116
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,623
We invented that technique.

117
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,585
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,715
Multiple torn ligaments...

167
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,801
severe nerve damage in both hands.

168
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,928
[groans]

169
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,555
You were on the table for 11 hours.

170
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,682
[Doctor Strange] Look at these fixators.

171
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,269
No one could have done better.

172
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,152
I could have done better.

173
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,447
[rain pattering]

00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,221
[gasping]

175
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
No.

176
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,977
[Doctor West] Give your body time to heal.

177
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,397
You've ruined me.

178
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,482
[Doctor Strange]
How long until I can take...

179
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,567
[Doctor Weiss] Doctor Strange.

180
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,652
Those tissues are still healing.

181
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,778
So, speed it up.

182
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,489
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

183
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,825
It's possible.

184
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,871
Experimental and expensive, but possible.

185
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,664
All I need is possible.

186
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,522
[physical therapist] Up.

00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,815
[Doctor Strange panting]

188
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,900
Up.

189
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,402
Show me your strength.

190
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,657
[Doctor Strange grunts]

191
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,075
[sighs] This is useless.

192
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,411
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

193
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,957
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

194
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,710
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage

195
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,337
this severe to do this...

196
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,588
and actually recover?

197
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,505
One guy, yeah.

198
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,133
Factory accident, broke his back...

199
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,219
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

200
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,596
-[breathing heavily]
-He had pain in his shoulder,

201
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,680
from the wheelchair.

202
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,974
He came in three times a week.

203
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,768
Then one day he stopped coming.

204
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,144
I thought he was dead.

205
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,980
A few years later, he walked
past me on the street.

206
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,398
-[Doctor Strange] Walked?
-Yeah, walked.

207
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,485
[Doctor Strange] Bullshit.
Show me his file.

208
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,154
It'll take me a while
to pull the files from the archive.

209
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,823
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

210
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,408
Worth it.

211
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,463
[clatters]

212
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,092
[Etienne] I looked at all your research...

213
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,386
I read all the papers you've sent.

214
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,513
It's not gonna work.

215
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,306
[stammers] I don't think you realize...

216
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,892
-how severe the damages are.
-Here's the thing...

217
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,435
The best have tried and failed.

218
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,021
I understand. Here's the thing.

219
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,315
What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.

220
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,608
Come on.

221
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,318
I've got my own reputation to consider.

222
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,153
-Etienne, wait. No.
-I can't help you.

223
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,822
-[speaking French]
-No, no, wait!

[panting]

226
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,870
[Christine] Hey!

227
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,540
[rain patters]

228
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,251
[Christine sighs]

229
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,378
He won't do it.

230
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,507
He's a hack.

231
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,427
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

232
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,012
They culture donor stem cells...

233
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,346
and then harvesting them

234
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,806
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

235
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,974
If I could get a loan together...

236
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,058
Stephen.

237
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,685
A small loan, just $200,000.

238
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,729
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

239
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,856
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

240
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,859
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

241
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,487
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

242
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,282
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

243
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,075
But this isn't medicine anymore.

244
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,744
This is mania.

245
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,288
[sighs] Some things just can't be fixed.

246
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,332
-Life without my work...
-Is still life.

247
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,625
This isn't the end.

248
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,587
There are other things
that can give your life meaning.

249
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,297
Like what? Like you?

250
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,885
This is the part where you apologize.

251
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,095
This is the part where you leave.

252
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,849
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

253
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,309
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

254
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,227
Yes, it is.

255
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,855
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

256
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,940
-No, don't pity me.
-I'm not pitying you.

257
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,025
Oh, yeah? Then what are you doing here

258
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,527
bringing cheese and wine
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

259
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,904
We are not friends, Christine.

260
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,363
We were barely lovers.

261
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,491
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

262
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,784
Is that what I am to you now?

263
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,495
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

264
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,829
"He finally needs me."

Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

back into the world...

Yeah! All day.

Come on, man! Where's the competition?

278
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,822
Talk a lot.

279
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,658
[Doctor Strange] Jonathan Pangborn...

280
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,661
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

281
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,163
Who are you?

282
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,247
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

283
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,457
Partial paralysis in both hands.

284
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,751
-I don't know you.
-I'm Stephen Strange.

285
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,754
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

286
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,175
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

287
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,386
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

288
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,263
I never got past your assistant.

289
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,141
You were untreatable.

290
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,643
No glory for you in that, right?

291
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,398
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

292
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,571
[stammers] I'm trying
to find my own way back.

293
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,576
[man] Pangborn, are you in or you out?

294
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,330
[players chattering]

295
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,918
All right.

296
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,380
I'd given up on my body.

297
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,591
I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

298
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,593
I should at least try to elevate that.

299
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,262
So, I sat with gurus...

300
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,931
and sacred women.

301
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,309
Strangers carried me to mountaintops
to see holy men.

302
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,435
And finally...

303
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,354
I found my teacher.

304
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,023
And my mind was elevated...

305
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,359
and my spirit deepened.

306
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,319
And somehow...

307
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,403
Your body healed.

308
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,488
Yes.

309
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,325
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

310
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,910
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

311
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,080
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

312
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,588
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

313
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,923
But the cost there is high.

314
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,049
How much?

315
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,510
I'm not talking about money.

316
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,763
Good luck.

317
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,685
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

[indistinct chattering]

00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,746
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,707
Uh, Kamar-Taj?

321
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,583
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

322
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,735
Kamar-Taj?

323
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,779
Kamar-Taj.

324
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,850
OK.

325
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,980
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

326
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,732
Your watch.

327
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,235
No, please. It's all I have left.

328
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,361
Your watch.

00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,824
All right.

00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,289

[groans]

336
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,200
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

337
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,001
[indistinct chattering]

338
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,640
[gurus chanting prayers]

339
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,982
[Doctor Strange] Really?

340
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,692
Sure we got the right place?

341
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:08,405
That one looks a little more Kamar-Tajey.

342
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,865
[Doctor Strange chuckles]

343
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,741
I once stood in your place.

344
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,953
And I, too, was...

345
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,122
disrespectful.

346
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,250
So, might I offer you some advice?

347
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,670
Forget everything you think you know.

348
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,382
All right.

349
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,186
[Mordo] The sanctuary of our teacher.

350
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:40,896
The Ancient One.

351
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,064
[Doctor Strange] The Ancient One?

352
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,232
What's his real name?

353
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:46,818
Right.

354
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,613
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

355
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,167
Um, thank you for... Whoa!

356
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,085
[grunts]

357
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,213
OK, that's a thing.

358
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,757
Thank you for...

359
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,008
Hello.

360
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,344
Oh, thank you.

361
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,304
And thank you.

362
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,597
-[liquid pouring]
-Uh, thank you...

363
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,308
Ancient One, for seeing me.

364
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,101
You're very welcome.

365
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,981
The Ancient One.

366
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,901
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

367
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,152
Mr. Strange.

368
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,072
Uh... Doctor, actually.

369
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,616
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

370
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,076
Isn't that why you're here?

371
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,078
You've undergone many procedures.

372
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,872
-Seven, right?
-Yeah.

373
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,667
It's good tea.

374
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,126
[softly] Yes.

375
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,133
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

376
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,218
A paralyzed man?

377
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,386
In a way.

378
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,221
[Doctor Strange]
You helped him to walk again.

379
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,806
Yes.

380
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,434
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

381
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,852
Well, I didn't correct it.

382
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,729
He couldn't walk.

383
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,481
I convinced him that he could.

384
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,400
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

385
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,443
When you reattach a severed nerve...

386
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,862
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

387
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,072
It's the cells.

388
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,740
The cells are only programmed...

389
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,867
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

390
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:18,785
Right.

391
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,496
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

392
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,041
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

393
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,837
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

394
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,673
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

395
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,508
Is that why you're working here?

396
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,302
Without a governing medical board?
I mean...

397
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,178
Just how experimental is your treatment?

398
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,015
Quite.

399
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,517
So, you've figured out a way...

400
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,562
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

401
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,772
No, Mr. Strange.

402
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
I know how to reorient the spirit...

403
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,986
to better heal the body.

404
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,032
-The spirit to heal the body?
-That's right.

405
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,616
[Ancient One slurps]

406
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,703
[stammers] No. All right.

407
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,787
How do we do that?

408
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,331
Where do we start?

409
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,047
-Don't like that map?
-Oh, no.

410
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,716
It's really good. It's just,
I've seen it before...

411
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,676
in gift shops.

412
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,053
[chuckles]

413
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,512
And what about this one?

414
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,390
-Acupuncture, great.
-Yeah?

415
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,435
What about that one?

416
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,188
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

417
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,107
Each of those maps
was drawn up by someone...

418
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,818
who could see in part, but not the whole.

419
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,363
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

420
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,407
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

421
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,077
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

422
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,411
-[scoffs]
-You've spent your whole life

423
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,746
trying to widen that keyhole...

424
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,873
to see more, to know more.

425
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,126
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

426
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,128
in ways you can't imagine...

427
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,755
you reject the possibility.

428
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,174
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

429
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,301
about chakras or energy...

430
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,427
or the power of belief.

431
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,055
There is no such thing as spirit!

432
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,683
We are made of matter and nothing more.

433
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,853
You're just another tiny, momentary speck

434
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,355
within an indifferent universe.

435
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,773
You think too little of yourself.

436
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,775
Oh, you think you see through me, do you?

437
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,943
Well, you don't.

438
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,696
But I see through you!

439
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,625
[gasping]

440
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,507
What did you just do to me?

441
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,634
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

442
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,344
[breathing heavily] What's in that tea?

443
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,304
Psilocybin? LSD?

444
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,389
It's just tea...

445
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,266
with a little honey.

446
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,059
What just happened?

447
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,645
For a moment, you entered
the astral dimension.

448
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,730
The what?

449
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,774
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

450
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,651
Why are you doing this to me?

451
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,987
To show you just how much you don't know.

452
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,489
Open your eye.

453

Oh, shit!

Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

456
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,751
No, no, no!

457
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,835
What's happening?

458
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,004
This isn't real! This isn't real!
This isn't real! This is--

[Ancient One] You think
you know how the world works?

00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,866
You think that this material universe
is all there is?

[chanting in distance]

471
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,581
What is real?

What mysteries lie beyond

At the root of existence...

mind and matter meet.

476
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,263

No.

502
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,155
No!

503
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,407
No, no, no!

No!

505
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,871
Open the door! Please!

506
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,876
[Ancient One] Thank you, Masters.

507
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,799
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

508
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,218
[Mordo] Five hours later,
he's still on your doorstep.

509
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,180
There's a strength to him.

510
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,058
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

511
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,809
I've seen it all before.

512
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,354
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

513
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,941
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

514
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,068
only to lose him to the darkness.

515
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,696
You didn't lose me.

516
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,324
I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.

517
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,786
You gave me the power to defeat my demons.

518
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,164
And to live within the natural law.

519
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,959
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

520
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,586
We only learn to live above them.

521
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,591
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

522
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,427
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

523
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,553
upon us all.

524
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,848
There may be dark days ahead.

525
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,018
Perhaps Kamar-Taj
could use a man like Strange.

Meditate...

534
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,470
if you can.

535
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,306
The Ancient One will send for you.

What's this? My mantra?

537
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,361
The Wi-Fi password.

538
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,156
We're not savages.

[scoffs]

540
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,857
[Ancient One] The language
of the mystic arts...

541
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,193
is as old as civilization.

542
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,528
The sorcerers of antiquity...

543
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,740
called the use of this language "spells."

544
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,117
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

545
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,703
you can call it a "program."

546
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,956
The source code that shapes reality.

547
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,292
We harness energy...

548
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:51,130

of the Multiverse...

00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,515
and weapons...

552
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,559
to make magic.

[gasps]

554
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,952
But even if my fingers could do that...

555
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,705
my hands would just be
waving in the air. I mean--

556
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,958
How do I get from here to there?

557
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,128
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

558
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,422
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

559
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,675
Study and practice, years of it.

Hey.

Mr. Strange.

Uh, Stephen, please.

-And you are?
-Wong.

565

Wong.

Just Wong?

567
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,490
Like Adele?

Or Aristotle.

Yup.

but at my discretion, others may use it.

582
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,489
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

583
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,827
How's your Sanskrit?

584
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,956
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

585
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,876
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

[Doctor Strange clears throat]

587
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,089
What are those?

588
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,842
[Wong] The Ancient One's
private collection.

589
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,636
So, they're forbidden?

590
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,430
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.

591
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,973
Only certain practices.

592
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,227
Those books are far too advanced

593
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,395
for anyone other
than the Sorcerer Supreme.

This one's got pages missing.

596
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,037
[Wong] That's The Book of Cagliostro.

597
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,247
A study of time.

598
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,708
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

599
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,212
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

600

Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

601
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,927
and relieved him of his head.

602
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,932
I am now the guardian of these books.

603
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,727
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

604
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,937
I'd know it...

605
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,607
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

606
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,196
What if it's just overdue? You know?

607
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,199
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

Did they work for you?

611
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,084
All right. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you.

Thank you for the books...

and for the threat upon my life.

615
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,290
We will now receive the power

616
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,292
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

617
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,005
The one who betrays the world.

The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

the gateway will come.

632

You cannot beat a river into submission.

You have to surrender to its current...

and use its power as your own.

That doesn't make any sense.

00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,492
From what?

832
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,537
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

833
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,456
Like Dormammu.

834
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,375
Where did you learn that name?

835
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,254
I just read it in
The Book of Cagliostro. Why?

836
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,012
[Wong] Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

837
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,181
Beyond time.

838
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,975
He is the cosmic conqueror...

839
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,394
the destroyer of worlds.

840
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,856
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

841
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,359
on a quest to invade every universe...

842
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,612
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

843
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,823
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

844
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,327
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

845
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,871
A ritual to contact Dormammu

846
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,790
and draw power from the Dark Dimension.

847

00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,004
OK.

850
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,923
Um... I'm out.

851
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,551
[chuckles] I came here to heal my hands.

852
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,514
Not to fight in some mystical war.

Daniel, I see they made you

You know what that means?

That you'll die protecting it.

You understand the laws of nature.

All things age. All things die.

But the Dark Dimension...

it's a place beyond time.

That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

This world can take its rightful place

[Kaecilius] The same as you.

The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

People think in terms of good and evil...

945
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,197
when really time
is the true enemy of us all.

for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

955

Time is an insult.

01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,056
Death is an insult.

we don't seek to rule this world.

959
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,064
We seek to save it...

960
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,651
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

961

the why of all existence.

What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

964
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,287
Was it enlightenment?

965
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:55,248
Power?

[Kaecilius laughs]

967
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,752
You came to be healed, as did we all.

968
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,131
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

969
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,300
We all come with the promise
of being healed...

970
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,636
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

971
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,348
The real magic she keeps for herself.

972
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,560
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

973
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,272
I...

974
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,151
I saw the rituals
in The Book of Cagliostro.

975
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,195
So, you know.

976
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,866
The ritual gives me the power
to overthrow The Ancient One...

977
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,701
and tear her Sanctums down.

978
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,036
To let the Dark Dimension in.

979
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,664
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

980
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,165
Dormammu gives freely.

981
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,626
Life everlasting.

982
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,838
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

983
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,840
-He's the savior of worlds.
-No. No.

984
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,009
No. I mean, come on.

985
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,594
Look at your face.

986
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,305
Dormammu made you a murderer.

987
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,473
Just how good can his kingdom be?

[sighs] No, not that.

For all of it. I mean, you were right.

Well, after Western medicine failed me

I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:32,788
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

Oh. So you joined a cult.

No, I didn't. No, not exactly.
No. I mean...

that I never even knew existed.

Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

1102

It's not a cult.

Can you tell me the truth?

1110
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,068
Well, a powerful sorcerer

1111
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,903
who gave himself over to an ancient entity

1112

tried very hard to kill me.

But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village

1114
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:11,994
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway

01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,162
that I opened up in the mop closet.

Doctor Strange!

When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

And I have just killed a man!
I'm not doing that again.

1154
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,633
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

I see what I've always seen...
your over-inflated ego.

You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

even death...

1161

Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange.

Not even Dormammu?

1164
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,452
He offers immortality.

1165
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:01,163
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:02,331
He feeds off it.

1167
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:03,665
Like you feed off him?

1168
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,627
You talk to me about controlling death?

1169
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:07,794
Oh, I know how you do it.

1170
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,672
I've seen the missing rituals
from The Book of Cagliostro.

1171
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,801
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

1172
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,720
Because you might not like them?

1173
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,890
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

1174
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:21,391
What is he talking about?

1175
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:24,561
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

1176
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,524
She draws power from the Dark Dimension

1177
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,983
-to stay alive.
-[scoffs]

1178
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,070
That's not true.

1179
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:35,614
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

1180
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,574
I know how you do it.

1181
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:41,119
[Ancient One] Once they regroup...

1182
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,496
the Zealots will be back.

1183
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:44,748
You'll need reinforcements.

1184
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,299
She's not who you think she is.

1185
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,176
You don't have the right to say that.

1186
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:59,179
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

1187
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,139
No, and I don't want to know.

1188
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:02,641
You're a coward.

1189
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:04,059
Because I'm not a killer?

1190
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,644
These Zealots will snuff us all out

1191
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,313
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

1192
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,856
[shouts] What do you think I just did?

1193
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,567
You saved your own life!

1194
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,237
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

1195
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,572
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

1196
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,741
You've no idea the things I've done.

1197
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,452
And the answer is yes.

1198
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,414
Without hesitation.

1199
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:26,623
Even if there's another way?

1200
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,584
There is no other way.

1201
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,002
You lack imagination.

1202
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,169
No, Stephen.

1203
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:35,048
You lack the spine.

1204
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,927
[distant rumbling]

1205
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:41,221
They're back.

1206
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,104
We have to end this.

1207
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:50,606
Now!

You can't affect the real world in here.

Who's laughing now?

1215

-[echoes] Run!
-[groans]

1221

[Mordo] Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

1222
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,753
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

1223
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,172
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

1224
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:00,092
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1226
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,443

[Mordo] It's true.

She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

I tried to protect you.

His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

[Doctor Strange] What are you doing?

1274
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:08,942
Come on, you're dying!

1275
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:20,286
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1276
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,705
Time is relative.

1277
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,374
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1278
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,128
I've spent so many years...

1279
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,921
peering through time...

1280
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:32,507
looking at this exact moment.

1281
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,217
But I can't see past it.

1282
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,013
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

1283
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:40,640
And after each one,
there's always another.

1284
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,767
And they all lead here...

1285
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:44,769
but never further.

1286
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,938
You think this is where you die.

1287
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,858
You wonder what I see in your future?

1288
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,192
No.

1289
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,237
Yes.

1290
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:56,197
I never saw your future.

1291
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,408
Only its possibilities.

1292
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,828
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1293
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,747
You always excelled...

1294
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:05,832
but not because you craved success...

1295
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,501
but because of your fear of failure.

1296
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:10,920
That's what made me a great doctor.

1297
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:13,465
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1298
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,885
Arrogance and fear still keep you

1299
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:20,013
from learning the simplest
and most significant lesson of all.

1300
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,598
Which is?

1301
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:25,310
It's not about you.

1302
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:31,149
When you first came to me

1303
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:34,402
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1304
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,237
I didn't.

1305
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,073
[thunder rumbling]

1306
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:42,619
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1307
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,621
He uses magic to walk?

1308
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:45,872
Constantly.

1309
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:48,041
He had a choice...

1310
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,002
to return to his own life...

1311
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:54,005
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1312
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,007
So I could have my hands back again?

1313
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,051
My old life?

1314
01:24:59,010 --> 01:24:59,844
You could.

1315
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,681
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1316
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,394
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1317
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,271
But as you well know

1318
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,607
sometimes one must break the rules

1319
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,484
in order to serve the greater good.

1320
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,194
Mordo won't see it that way.

1321
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,322
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable

1322
01:25:19,405 --> 01:25:21,366
forged by the fires of his youth.

1323
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,576
He needs your flexibility

1324
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,411
just as you need his strength.

1325
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:30,500
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1326
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,835
I'm not ready.

1327
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:35,505
No one ever is.

1328
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,342
We don't get to choose our time.

1329
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:45,682
Death is what gives life meaning.

1330
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:49,018
To know your days are numbered.

1331
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:51,229
Your time is short.

1332
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:56,192
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

1333
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,986
But look at me.

1334
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,364
Stretching one moment out into a thousand

1335
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,908
just so that I can watch the snow.

1336

[heart monitor continues flat lining]

Are you OK?

1338
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:54,626
I don't understand what's happening.

1339
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:55,627
I know.

1340
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,214
But I have to go away now.

1341
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,347
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1342
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,640
That it could be a beginning.

1343
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,058
Yeah.

1344
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:14,562
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

[sighs]

1346
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:18,524
A harder way.

1347

-A weirder way.

1348

1349
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,242
Doctor Palmer to the ER.

[Wong] Choose your weapon wisely.

1357
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,500
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1358
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,254
No one.

Kaecilius.

1361

You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.

1362
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:36,829
She's dead.

1363
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:38,748
[Mordo] You were right.

1364
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,584
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1365
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,337
She was complicated.

1366
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:50,468
[Mordo] Complicated?

1367
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:55,932
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1368
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,475
Dangerous.

1369
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,061
What if it overtook her?

1370
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:03,773
She taught us it was forbidden...

1371
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:09,070
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1372
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:10,738
She did what she thought was right.

1373
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,615
[Mordo] The bill comes due.

1374
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:14,575
Don't you see?

1375
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:20,123
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1376
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:23,668
Kaecilius... was her fault!

1377
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:25,294
And here we are...

1378
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,922
in the consequence of her deception.

1379

A world on fire.

1380
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:34,929
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1381
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,181
The New York one has been attacked twice.

1382
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,891
You know where they're going next.

Hong Kong.

1384
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,728
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it

1385
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:43,896
because one day, it might.

1386
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:45,481
Well, today is that day.

1387
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:48,234
I cannot defeat them alone.

The Dark Dimension.

1391
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,558
Dormammu is coming.

1392

It's too late.

1393
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,063
Nothing can stop him.

1394
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:29,358
Not necessarily.

No.

Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:16,176
A world beyond time.

1499
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,264
Beyond death.

1500
01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:33,694
What have you done?

1501
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:35,279
[Doctor Strange] I made a bargain.

1502
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:38,198
[sighs]

1503
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:39,950
What is this?

1504
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:43,120
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1505
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:46,665
Eternal life as part of the One.

1506
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:51,253
[chuckles] You're not gonna like it.

1507
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:53,714
[grunting]

1508
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:58,677
[Zealots grunting]

1509
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,525
Yeah, you know, you really should have
stolen the whole book

1510
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:14,651
because the warnings...

1511
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:17,738
The warnings come after the spells.

1512
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:20,199
[Wong laughing]

1513
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:28,999
Oh, that's funny.

1514
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:33,170
[sighs]

1515
01:41:36,965 --> 01:41:39,092
[rumbling]

1516
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:46,809
[indistinct chattering]

1517
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:57,820
[Wong] We did it.

1518
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:01,865
Yes. [scoffs]

1519
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:03,700
Yes, we did it.

1520
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:06,411
By also violating...

1521
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:08,080
the natural law.

1522
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:10,999
Look around you. It's over.

1523
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:14,795
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1524
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:17,714
No price to pay?

1525
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:21,301
We broke our rules, just like her.

1526
01:42:22,594 --> 01:42:26,056
[slowly] The bill comes due.

1527
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:27,975
Always!

1528
01:42:29,142 --> 01:42:30,310
A reckoning.

1529
01:42:33,522 --> 01:42:35,566
I will follow this path no longer.

1530
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:08,098
[sighs]

1531
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:11,602
Yeah, OK.

1532
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:16,315
[sighs deeply]

1533
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:22,070
[Wong] Wise choice.

1534
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:24,823
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1535
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,742
once you've mastered its powers.

1536
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:28,452
Until then...

1537
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:32,539
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1538
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:33,498
A what?

1539
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:38,587
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,
but you still have much to learn.

1540
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:43,383
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1541
01:43:44,217 --> 01:43:46,511
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1542
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:49,014
-We must be ready.
-We'll be ready.

1543
01:46:36,014 --> 01:46:39,142
[Thor] So Earth has wizards now, huh?

1544
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:42,312
Tea?

1545
01:46:42,854 --> 01:46:44,231
I don't drink tea.

1546
01:46:44,397 --> 01:46:45,398
What do you drink?

1547
01:46:46,608 --> 01:46:47,943
Not tea.

1548
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:53,115
So, I keep a watch list...

1549
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:54,950
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1550
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:56,743
that may be a threat to this world.

1551
01:46:56,827 --> 01:47:00,455
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1552
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:03,834
Worthy inclusion.

1553
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:05,377
Yeah.

1554
01:47:07,003 --> 01:47:10,006
So why bring him here to New York?

1555
01:47:10,632 --> 01:47:11,925
It's a bit of a long story.

1556
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:13,969
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1557
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:15,762
But we're looking for my father.

1558
01:47:17,055 --> 01:47:19,724
Oh, OK. So if you found Odin...

1559
01:47:19,808 --> 01:47:23,270
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1560
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:24,855
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1561
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:26,356
Great!

1562
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:28,984
Allow me to help you.

1563
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:05,361
[machine whirring]

1564
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:21,169
[whirring continues]

1565
01:53:30,428 --> 01:53:31,554
Can I help you?

1566
01:53:32,805 --> 01:53:35,517
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1567
01:53:37,185 --> 01:53:39,395
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1568
01:53:40,813 --> 01:53:41,814
Mordo.

1569
01:53:44,817 --> 01:53:46,402
So what can I do for you, man?

1570
01:53:46,694 --> 01:53:48,530
[Mordo] I've been away
for many months now,

1571
01:53:48,613 --> 01:53:49,906
and I've had a revelation.

1572
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:53,159
The true purpose of a sorcerer

1573
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:56,579
is to twist things
out of their proper shape

1574
01:53:57,664 --> 01:53:58,790
stealing power

1575
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,167
perverting nature.

1576
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:03,002
Like you.

1577
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:06,798
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1578
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:09,217
-Mine.
-Power...

1579
01:54:10,843 --> 01:54:11,719
has a purpose.

1580
01:54:14,889 --> 01:54:16,182
[Pangborn groaning]

1581
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:27,652
Why are you doing this?

1582
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:31,864
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1583
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:34,117
[panting]

1584
01:54:37,328 --> 01:54:38,788
Too many sorcerers.
