1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,772
(Music playing)

2
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:09,742
Uncle:
The flute of the immortals.

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:17,383
Uncle: Within it lies
the chi of the sky
demon hsi wu.

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,952
Jade: Who else is up
for a spin?

5
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,521
Jackie: Jade!
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,823
Jade: Like I'm gonna come
all the way down to Australia

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,993
and not ride a kangaroo? Tch!

8
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,034
Uncle: <i> Yu mo gue guai</i>
à <i> fi de ziao...</i>

9
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,536
<i>Yu mo gue guai</i>
à <i> fi de--yeow!</i>

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,707
Jackie:
Drago! Uncle, hurry!

11
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,610
Uncle: Aiyaaa!
Nephew has ants in pants.

12
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,945
Magic cannot be rushed.

13
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,115
(Chanting faster)

14
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,717
Jade: Hyah!

15
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,689
Both: Whoa!

16
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,924
(Screaming)

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,199
Drago: Time to throw
this shrimp on the Barbie.

18
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,069
Jade:
Definitely not a g'day.

19
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,805
Jackie: Jade!

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,907
Jade: Whoooaaa!

21
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,951
Jackie: Whoa! Unh! Aah!

22
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,189
Uncle: Jackie!

23
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,292
Must stop drago from
extracting sky demon chi!

24
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,562
Jade:
Oh, man, I'm gonna hurl!

25
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,165
Jackie:
Hang on tight, Jade!

26
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,033
Unh!

27
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,576
Drago: Aah! Unh!

28
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,681
(Uncle chanting)

29
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,194
Jade: We came, we saw,
we kicked demon butt!

30
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,429
(Tires screech)

31
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:52,037
Uncle: Hmm. Tohru,
put steering wheel
back where it belongs.

32
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,243
Drago: Unh!

33
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,516
Drago: Chan!

34
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,359
Jade: Hey, since
we're still on
Australian time,

35
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,563
technically it's tomorrow and
I've already been to school.

36
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:21,667
Jackie: Ha ha ha.
"A" for effort,
but "f" for logic.

37
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,937
Now go to bed.
You have your big
field trip tomorrow.

38
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,405
Jade: Ohhh!

39
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:37,783
Uncle: Aiya! Sky demon chi
did not transfer into
containment tank.

40
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,084
Jackie: Do you need help?

41
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,720
Uncle: Yes, very important.
Write down.

42
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,990
Mung bean, bulb of garlic,

43
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:48,627
essence of sea salt,
with mustard, on wheat.

44
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,829
Jackie: These ingredients
will repair the chi-o-matic?

45
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,599
Uncle: No!
Ingredients for sandwich.

46
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:57,469
You fix uncle snack,
uncle will fix chi-o-matic.

47
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,009
Jade: Lunch, check.
Permission slip, check.

48
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,645
Jackie: Jade,
it is a long bus ride.

49
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,514
Take something
to occupy yourself.

50
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,020
Jade: Boredom buster,
check-o-matic.

51
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:18,657
Ms. hardman:
...And the windsor mansion is
not only a national landmark,

52
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,426
it's on
the national registry of homes

53
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,430
as a perfect example
of 19th century architecture.

54
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,935
Now, I expect you all to be
on your very best behavior.

55
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,304
Drew: I know this girl,
who has this friend,

56
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,207
who has this cousin,
who went there with his family

57
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,976
and his sister
saw a really freaky ghost.

58
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,347
Jade: As if!
Everybody knows there are
no such things as ghosts.

59
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,384
But demons?
They're real, big time!

60
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:50,522
And this little baby here
can suck up demon chi
like nobody's business!

61
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,757
Ms. hardman: Jade!

62
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,026
I will not have
you disrupting this field trip

63
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,962
with any of your silly
"forces of darkness" stories,

64
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,032
and no electronic games
during school hours.

65
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,067
Jade: But, Ms. hardman,
it's not a game. It's--

66
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,136
Ms. hardman:
No "buts," young lady.

67
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,838
You've just earned the class
a 2-page report

68
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,075
on the historical significance
of the windsor mansion.

69
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:13,211
All: Aw, man!
I can't believe that!
Thanks a lot, Jade!

70
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,547
Ms. hardman: Or would you
care to make it 3 pages?

71
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,491
Jade: Hey, it's not
my fault Ms. hartless
has it in for all of us.

72
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,428
She loves torturing kids.
Why do you think
she became a teacher?

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,167
(Bus driving over gravel)

74
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,515
Drago: The sky demon chi.
I'm back in business!

75
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,355
Uncle: Jackie!

76
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,126
Uncle:
Chi-o-matic is missing!

77
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,961
Both: Jade!

78
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,101
(Thunder)

79
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,047
Drew:
Whoa! Total creepfest.

80
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,416
Jade:
Please. Tourist trap.

81
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,991
All: Aaah!

82
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,829
Guide: Windsor mansion
was built in 1857
by Gladys windsor...

83
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,900
But is now quite famous for
its more "spirited" guests.

84
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,235
(Slam)

85
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,703
Drew: Aah!

86
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,872
Jade: That's a big goose egg
on the goosebump meter.

87
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,875
Ms. hardman: Jade!
One more negative
comment and--

88
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,109
(gasps)

89
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,017
Drew: Whoa!
Definitely haunted!

90
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,888
Guide: You may not believe
what you're about to see next.

91
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,991
This way...To the basement.

92
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,362
Ms. hardman:
Oh, these shoes!

93
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,099
I guess that's the price
you pay for high fashion.

94
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,046
Ms. hardman:
Oh, dear, someone's missing.

95
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,381
Jade.

96
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,117
Guide: Prepare yourselves...

97
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,786
(Gasping)

98
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,556
Guide: For the most complete
antique doorknob collection

99
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,791
west of the Mississippi!

100
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,726
Girl: Aww, that's it?!

101
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,596
Ms. hardman: Everyone remain
here with Mr. Freedman.

102
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,898
I'll be right back.

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
Guide: Well, now,
who knows the difference

104
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,803
between a doorknob
and a door pull?

105
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,939
Anyone? Hands?

106
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,813
Jade: Duh,
pre-recorded ghosts.

107
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,151
Jade: Player piano.
I knew it!

108
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,021
I've been in libraries scarier
than this tourist trap.

109
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,059
Jade: Aah!

110
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,633
(Jade screams)

111
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,402
Ms. hardman: Jade?

112
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,374
Drago:
Oh, did I scare you?

113
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,410
Jade: Yeah,
but looks aren't everything!

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,484
Drago:
I want the sky demon chi!

115
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,419
It's here!

116
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,622
I can smell it!

117
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,092
Ms. hardman: Jade!

118
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,660
Jade: Ms. hardman?

119
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,466
(Screeches)

120
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,968
Drago: The sky demon chi?!

121
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,846
Ms. hardman: Oh, my!
What's--what's happened to me?

122
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:11,182
Jade: Claws for hands?
Demon wings?

123
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,251
Evil twinkle in the eye?

124
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:16,922
Something tells me
uncle never emptied
the chi-o-matic.

125
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,860
That's 2 demons against
one chan. I'm outta here!

126
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,696
Ms. hardman:
Jade! Come back here!

127
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,600
Drago: Raah!

128
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,403
Guide: And that, students,
is the fascinating history

129
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,906
of the doorknob
in 19th century America.

130
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,609
Now, if you'll follow me
to the gift shop...

131
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,044
(Slams)

132
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,280
(Nervous laugh)
Well, that's strange.

133
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,316
The door
- appears to be stuck.

134
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:47,118
Drew: I knew it!
We're ghost chow!

135
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,655
(Screaming)

136
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,357
Guide: Aaah!

137
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,262
Children: Help!

138
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:02,167
Help! I want to get
out of here! Mommy!

139
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,342
(Screeches)

140
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,743
(Claws scratching)

141
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,145
Jade: Oh,
- this is all my fault!

142
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,947
I turned my teacher
into a drooling demon

143
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,283
at an all-you-can-eat
student buffet!

144
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,452
don't worry, guys.
I got your back.

145
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,487
Yo, Ms. hartless!

146
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,755
Ms. hardman: Jade?

147
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,357
Jade:
You want fresh meat?

148
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,359
Well, here's
some prime "grade j"!

149
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,426
Come and get it!

150
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,197
Ms. hardman:
Come back here, young lady!

151
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,135
(Panting)

152
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,371
Jade: Definitely not
a special effect.

153
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,506
Aah!

154
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,974
Ms. hardman, don't eat me!

155
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,644
I didn't even shower
this morning!

156
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,947
Uncle:
Teacher eat students?

157
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,150
School has changed
since uncle was a boy.

158
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,919
Jade:
Uncle Jackie! Ms. hardman took
the chi-o-matic on the bus

159
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,122
and must have zapped herself
with the sky demon chi,

160
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:00,125
and now she wants to eat me
and the rest of the class who
are trapped in the basement!

161
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:04,462
(Gasps) Oh, and drago's
here and the house is
really spook central.

162
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,667
Jackie:
- Uh, Jade, calm down.

163
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,269
I am sure Ms. hardman
does not wish to harm you.

164
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:15,373
Jade: Oh, yeah, she just
loves kids! Medium rare.

165
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,176
Tohru: Uh,
did you say haunted?

166
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,278
Jade: So, what's the plan?

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,915
Jackie: You go to the bus
with uncle while he fixes
the chi-o-matic.

168
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,285
And you will stay
there until we sort
this whole thing out.

169
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,420
Jade: No way!

170
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,788
Jackie: Yes way!

171
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,223
I will see that drago does
no harm to Ms. hardman.

172
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,292
(Tohru groans)

173
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,368
Uncle:
(Sighs) Good as new!

174
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,637
Now, Jade, stay on bus--

175
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,205
Jade?

176
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,643
Tohru: There are
no such things as ghosts.

177
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,646
There are no such things
as ghosts.

178
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:55,880
Aaah!

179
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,229
Jackie:
- Aah! Oh, this is why
I prefer carpeting!

180
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,566
Jade: Aah!

181
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,435
Jackie: Jade, I told you
to stay on the bus!

182
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,770
Jade: What's your point?

183
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,806
(Ms. hardman screeches)

184
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,478
Ms. hardman:
What do you want?

185
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,379
Drago:
What do you think, lady?!

186
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,749
You just sprouted wings
out of thin air?

187
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:34,185
You have my sky demon chi
and I want it back!

188
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,386
(Loud thud)

189
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,588
(Ms. hardman screeches)

190
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,590
Drago: Yeow!

191
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,327
Ms. hardman: Maybe next time
you'll remember the
magic word.

192
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,207
Jackie: Leave her alone!

193
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,277
Drago: Back off, chan!

194
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,626
Uncle: Aiya!

195
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,229
Jade: Keep away from me,
birdbrain! Aah!

196
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,364
Jackie: Jade!

197
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,906
Jade: Uncle Jackie!

198
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,943
Uncle: Uh-oh.

199
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,947
Aiyaaaa!

200
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,302
(Roars)

201
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,979
Uncle: Bear should go into
permanent hibernation!

202
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,418
Jackie: Aah!

203
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,854
Ha ha! Happy birthday?

204
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,495
Drago: Aaah!

205
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:28,867
Jackie: Uh, uncle?
This place...Explain.

206
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:33,938
Uncle: Double dose of
demon chi has awakened
angry spirits in house.

207
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,207
Jackie: We must find Jade.

208
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,477
(Children yelling)

209
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,179
Tohru: Ooh!

210
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,014
(Children yelling)

211
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,084
Tohru:
Ohh...A laundry chute.

212
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,954
(Grunting)

213
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,624
I'm coming to get you!

214
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,425
(Tohru grunting)

215
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,827
(Screaming)

216
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,863
Tohru: Unh! Hello.

217
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,332
Guide: Ohhh...

218
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,338
(Ms. hardman humming)

219
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,077
Jade: Heh,
you must be working up
quite an appetite.

220
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,815
Why don't I just hop out
and dig you up some
juicy jumbo-size worms?

221
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,518
Ms. hardman:
You're not going anywhere.

222
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,320
Jade:
Ms. hardman, don't hurt me!

223
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,957
Ms. hardman: Hurt you?!
Oh, my goodness!

224
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,694
Jade chan,
- what an imagination you have!

225
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:33,731
I brought you up here
to protect you from
that awful lizard boy.

226
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,371
(Uncle panting)

227
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,074
Uncle: Fancy mansion
needs elevator!

228
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,810
(Panting)

229
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,048
(Rumbling)

230
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,787
Guide: Aaah! Aaah!

231
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,790
(Guide whimpering)

232
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:08,566
Ms. hardman: (Laughs)
And to think I used
to be afraid to fly.

233
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,470
Jade: So you don't hate kids?
You don't hate...Me?

234
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,773
Ms. hardman:
Oh, Jade, I adore children.

235
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,208
Why else would I be a teacher?

236
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,817
Drago: I'm back!

237
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,819
Both: Aah!

238
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:32,590
Ms. hardman: Stay here!
I know exactly how to deal
with an unruly student.

239
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,193
Jade: Ms. hardman, no!

240
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,730
Drago: Teacher's got a pet.
How cute.

241
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,605
Jade: Hey, scaly!

242
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,243
(Growling)

243
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,745
Jade: Ms. hardman!

244
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,019
Jade: No!

245
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,295
(Panting)

246
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,764
Jackie: Jade!

247
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,268
Jackie: Aah!

248
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,611
(Eerie moan)

249
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,080
Jade: Aaaah!

250
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,676
Jackie: Aah! Oof!

251
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,188
Jackie:
Come and get me, drago.

252
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,296
Drago: Ow! Ow! Ow!

253
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:23,134
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

254
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,103
Ms. hardman:
Class dismissed!

255
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,408
Drago: Aah!

256
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,851
Ms. hardman: Huh. Well,
this certainly has been

257
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,086
more exciting
than grading papers.

258
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,589
Jade:
I think it's about time
we get you back to normal.

259
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:48,693
Ms. hardman: Oh, but
I was considering flying
south for the winter.

260
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,895
Jade: Ms. hardman,
the class can't lose you.

261
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,897
You're everyone's
favorite teacher.

262
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,766
Ms. hardman: I am?

263
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,604
Ms. hardman:
(Sighs) I'm ready.

264
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,440
(Uncle chanting)

265
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,793
Jade: So everything was
just bogus special effects.

266
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,729
Drew: Ha! Knew it!

267
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,265
Ms. hardman:
- But I-I'm certain I had wings

268
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,635
and I saved Jade.
I was a hero!

269
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:34,005
Jackie: Uh, Ms. hardman,
I am afraid the mansion

270
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,176
has a way of playing tricks
with people's minds.

271
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,678
Ms. hardman:
But, Jade, you did tell me

272
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,615
I was everyone's
favorite teacher,
isn't that right?

273
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,051
Class, follow me!

274
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:54,825
Uncle: With the demon chi
gone, spirits have returned
to rest.

275
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,230
Tohru: I was never
really scared, <i> sensei.</i>

276
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,734
Tohru: Uncle?

277
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,877
Jade: Have you ever
dressed up for a costume party
or Halloween?

278
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,145
Jackie:
When I'm very young,

279
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,948
yes, I do wear
a cowboy costume,

280
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,650
but when I get in
the film business, never.

281
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,919
Why? Because
every day I'm on the set,

282
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,055
dressed as different people.

283
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,458
I'm dressed like an old man,
young man, girl, old lady,

284
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,329
uh, magician, vampire--
I dress everything already.
