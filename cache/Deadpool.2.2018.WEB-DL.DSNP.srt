What am I gonna do, Al?

323
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,612
Probably something terrible.

I fucking did this.

And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

can you speak up?

we feel like we're dying.

an inch of my life.

1431

He was torturing me!

1432
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,520
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1433
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,855
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

1434
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,482
So we can go after him
without me.

I ain't letting Cable

teabag him to death.

and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1450

Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...
