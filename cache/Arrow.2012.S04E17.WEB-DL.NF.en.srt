Don't think so.

The judge granted me
a minimum of 30 minutes per week.

I have 90 more seconds.

No, it's not!

Just because you can't see me,

You gotta sense my presence,
even when I'm not in your eye-line.

What advice would you
give to me? Humor me.

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,314
Getting tired,
you're dropping your shoulder

19

22
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,540
{\an8}(GRUNTS) Yeah, well, taking care of
a toddler is a marathon in itself.

23
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,334
{\an8}Right, but when you
sacrifice your endurance,

24
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,504
{\an8}you're losing steam too early
in our sessions. Let's go again.

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,921
{\an8}I'll pass.

26

we took Darhk off the board.

HIVE is still out there.

{\an8}Yeah. And when they rear their head,
we'll take care of them,

31
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,186
{\an8}but we have to celebrate our victories.

{\an8}If we don't, we forget

{\an8}-(SIGHS)
-What's wrong?

34
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,609
{\an8}Alex has a new job interview.

00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,694
{\an8}With Ruvé Darhk.

36
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,820
{\an8}What?

37
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,907
{\an8}She's looking for a new chief of staff
for the April 6th election.

{\an8}Oh, still don't know see
why you just can't

00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,535
{\an8}put yourself back in the race, Oliver.

40
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,205
{\an8}You know, voters, they hate flip-flopping
and that would be a pretty big one.

41
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,708
{\an8}I can't let him work for the wife
of the prince of darkness.

42
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,502
{\an8}And what if he got a better offer?

43
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,045
{\an8}Are you gonna run for mayor?

{\an8}Palmer Tech.

{\an8}They're hiring
a new head of public relations.

46
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,008
{\an8}Oh.

47
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,970
{\an8}I just heard that from someone.

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,224
{\an8}Laurel, she's not Voldemort.

49
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,059
{\an8}And I'm fine.

50
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,354
{\an8}That's a good idea.
You should tell Alex to talk to Felicity.

51
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,148
{\an8}Mmm-hmm.

52
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,692
{\an8}-What?
-Nothing. It's just...

53
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,945
{\an8}What, it's shocking that you know
who Voldemort is.

54
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,905
{\an8}Well, I mean,
I'm not immune to pop culture.

55
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,532
{\an8}I read a few of the <i>Harry Potter</i> books.

56
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,327
{\an8}Really? I was gonna bet Thea
that you just saw the movies.

57
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,662
{\an8}There were movies?

{\an8}BARON: Mr. Queen. Where are my men?

{\an8}I don't know, Reiter.

60
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,756
{\an8}They're your men.

61
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,426
{\an8}I wasn't gonna wait around
for them to kill me.

62
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,678
And what of Ms. Venediktov?

63
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,930
She's still here.

64
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,640
Don't move.

65

Where's my idol?

66
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,354
It's not your concern anymore.

67
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,981
{\an8}It's nearby. I can feel it.

68
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,442
The powers it bestowed
are on the wane, but...

69
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,568
Enough!

70
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,702
As I was saying, the magics
are losing their potency,

71
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,956
{\an8}but I still have enough to make
short work of the two of you.

{\an8}A quarter of a million dollars per unit.

73
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,756
{\an8}It's hard to believe something so small
could cost so much money...

74
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,719
{\an8}When Digital Equipment Corporation
released the first VAX, it cost $700,000.

00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,688
{\an8}Except we're not starting
a computer revolution here.

00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,452
{\an8}He already has.

to discuss how many zeroes

{\an8}he can add to

{\an8}get some rest.

{\an8}Hi, honey.

91

{\an8}Fine, but only because my cold medication
is starting to make me see double.

He thinks we look like twins.

94
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,896
{\an8}I don't think that's what he said.

95
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,398
{\an8}(CHUCKLES) I think he did.

Oh, my God. I don't know what's worse.

The fact that you just spelled out

Yes. This, I know. What I'm less clear of?

128
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,849
Is why my resources haven't been deployed
to get me out of here.

129
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,518
Well, that's what I'm here to explain.

Although my time in here might be

That's cute.

and they don't seem to have any
particular love left for you, Damien.

00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,793
(STUTTERING) I literally just had a dream
where you were the Green Arrow.

307
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,629
Wait. This is happening.

308
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,339
-(GASPS) You're the Green Arrow?
-Yeah.

309
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,383
I could have sworn it was
Neal Adams in data processing.

310
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:48,554
(GASPS) And this is the Arrow cave.
Oh, my God.

311
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,058
Actually, we call it the bunk...
It's the bunker, but yeah.

312
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,517
You're Laurel Lance, the ADA.

313
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,436
(STUTTERS) I've seen you on TV before.

314
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,979
(GASPS) And you're Captain Lance.

315
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,522
And you're...

316
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,649
I'm sorry, I know I've met before

317
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,276
but I can't really place
your name right now...

318
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,154
Curtis, that's John Diggle.
I need you to focus for a second, please?

319
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,033
Oh, my God. This place is unbelievable.

320
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,243
I mean, you guys must be
drawing some crazy electricity.

321
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,954
How do you keep it off the grid? (GASPS)

322
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,584
This is STAR Labs 5000 Exostation.
What are the specs on this?

323
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,627
Curtis! Get it together.

324
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,671
Okay, now I'm starting to see
the whole Green Arrow thing.

325
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,340
And I'm actually starting
to feel better too.

326
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,093
That's because we gave you
an IV to rehydrate you.

327
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,510
It should keep you going for a few hours.

328
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,346
Okay, forget the how for a second.

329
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,598
What are you doing here?

330
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,725
I saw the beehive on the news.
Felicity's in there.

331
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,602
Yeah, we were just about to mount
a rescue mission.

332
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,894
Do you guys even know what that is?

333
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,064
That is an army of robotic bees.

334
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,024
Yeah, that's my life now.

335
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,946
Brie Larvan. Apparently, she hacked
the prison computer network

336
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,198
and got herself an early release. Clever.

337
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,532
Feel free to use that by the way.

338
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,368
I mean, you can't put me in front of
this beautiful machine

339
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,036
and expect me not to
take it for a test drive.

340
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,499
Looks like Felicity keeps files on
various criminals. Who's The Dodger?

341
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,460
Looks like we have ourselves a taller,
more dude-like version of Felicity.

342
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:05,256
And I can help. Now, look, these bees,
they're tiny computers, okay?

343
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,342
With Felicity trapped inside, you guys are
gonna need someone to hack them,

344
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,511
but I'll have to "bee" careful.

00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,017
Let's assume that it is.

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,226
-Yeah.
-LAUREL: Curtis,

349
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,021
can you immobilize enough bees
to give us a way in?

350
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,189
There's only one way to find out.

00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,913
You see now,
the value of my prize, Mr. Queen?

357
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,706
What have you done to yourself?

358
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,502
There are primordial energies
that flow through all things.

359
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,422
I now command them.

360

of perspective, Mr. Queen.

understanding what I have achieved.

And what will you do about it?

you have hidden my idol,

462
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,430
Like some kind of...
I can't believe I'm saying this,

463
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,806
but some kind of digital
honey or something?

464
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,183
Not exactly. But if these are really
modeled after bees then...

465
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,645
They'll operate on a singular frequency
to orientate themselves.

466
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,689
If we can disrupt it, then we
can disperse the colony.

467
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,524
But, only problem is that
we need to generate

468
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,818
a high enough frequency
to damage their network.

469
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,029
But unless you guys have a portable
sonic projector handy, then, uh...

What?

471
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,244
This technology is amazing.

472
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,372
It reads your own vocal emissions and then

473
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,999
reprocesses it via a digital output
into a multichannel.

474
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,209
Yeah, we get it. It's badass.

475
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,252
But how is this going
to help us save Oliver?

476
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,879
Just give him a full Mariah Carey

477
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,549
and it should disrupt whatever connection
the bees are operating on.

478
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,301
All right, man. You sure about this?

-So why did you come back?
-I came back because of Felicity.

611
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,711
She convinced me that
we could do this job,

612
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,214
that we could save the city, and not...

614

I don't... I don't think that we can.

615

you're in 10 different kinds of pain.

00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,604
But the harsh truth is that Felicity,

617
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,900
she broke up with you
because of your choices.

618
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:58,737
Because the lies that you told.
You, Oliver. Not the Green Arrow.

619
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,863
I know.

620
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,036
It just doesn't seem fair that I can save
a city, and not save my relationship.

621
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,329

some of that hope for yourself.

but how can I help you?

this time, Darhk. We made sure of it.

has to kill two of you.

00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,383
It turns out your friend,
my new friend, Mr. Amar,

636
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,386
has a soft spot for his
only surviving relative.

637

A grandmother in Monument Point.

638

It is amazing what people will tell you
with a few phone calls and a kind voice.

Are they dead? Are they dead?

641
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,482
No! I had this wonderful speech about how

642
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,318
I was gonna kill your grandmother
had you not killed them...

643
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,863
Never mind. On to other matters.

644

You many now call your organization
and have that other message delivered.

(LAUGHING)

I thought we were locked out.

647
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,463
Well, we're gonna have to see
if I haven't lost my touch.

648
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:43,008
And I have to see if my mom
and the board members made it to safety.

649
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,593
You really shouldn't have given
Brie what she wanted.

650
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:48,471
I'm sick of people being put
in vulnerable positions.

651
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,891
Yeah, well, now there's nothing
stopping her from bringing those

652
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,225
bee things back on us.

653
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,937
Well, at the very least it buys us,
the team... Your team, time.

654
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,689
Ollie's gonna be fine.

655
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:00,901
He always is.

656
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,944
Well, unfortunately,
in Oliver's case, "he always is"

657
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,737
isn't an accurate predictive metric.

658

I'm sorry. I'm just sick of worrying.
I'm sick of the violence...

Hey, so am I, okay? Of course I am.

660

But we put up with it, we push past it.

661
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,876
Because what we do is important, okay?

662
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,502
We have to be that beacon of hope.

663
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,213
Nobody else is.

664
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,464
You're the beacon of hope.

665
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,634
I quit the team because I couldn't
stand to work with Oliver, but...

666
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,889
But now that I'm out, I look at life from
a different perspective.

667
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,140
I mean, look around you.

I'm not but whatever it is, it's not this.

672
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,952
You know, I'm beginning to see why
you and Felicity didn't work out.

673
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,245
Probably deserve that.

674
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,332
Look, I'm all for hugs and learning
but, like you said, there's still danger.

675
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,917
Yeah.

676
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,543
And you are a very scary man.

677
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,462
DIGGLE: Any luck with the bees?

678
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,505
Curtis is doing his best.

679
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,756
Thanks, Laurel.

680
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,009
Now that I've been able to actually
examine the bee,

681
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,802
I've deciphered their upgrade protocol.

682
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,263
The next time they adapt,
I can upload a virus

683
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,723
that will disperse into the entire hive.

684
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,433
Like what they did in
<i>Independence Day</i>, right?

685
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,103
What? I can't watch movies too?

686
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,270
So what's the plan?

687
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,983
I rigged an arrow with
a computer virus payload.

688
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,775
Shoot it near one of Bee Arthur's minions,

689
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,612
the virus will transmit to the rest
of the colony and we're done.

690
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,490
That's nice work.

-What about us?

Oh, yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

773
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,911
Hey. Nice apology.

774
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,955
Well, I'm just trying to
be a beacon of hope.

775
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,209
And like you said, save a little bit
of that hope for myself.

776
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,175
(SOFTLY) Taiana. Hey, hey.

777
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,844
All right. All right. Hey, Jesus.

778
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,471
Come on, come on.

779
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,558
Oh, thank God. Hey, Taiana, wake up. Hey.

780
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,975
Oliver...

781
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,019
It's okay. You're okay...

782
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,313
-No.
-It's all right.

783
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,772
No, Reiter...

784
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,649
He's gone.

785
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,944
He must be in the tunnels
searching for his idol.

786
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,696
We can't let him find it.

787
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,489
If he's in the tunnels,
searching for his idol,

788
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,408
that means he's not going to the prison.

789
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,411
This our chance to save your friends.

790
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,829
And what of Reiter's men?

791
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,789
They are still up there.

792
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,500
(PANTING)

793
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,629
That's why we're gonna
kill all of them first.

794
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,094
(DOOR OPENS)

795
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,474
I don't suppose it's too late
to reheat that soup?

796
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:33,894
Where have you been? You bolted
out of here like a crazy person.

797
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,981
Like some kind of a superhero
off to save the day.

798
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,942
I was chasing some silly fantasy
that I can help the police.

799
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,489
It was scary and thrilling and
dangerous and... Did I mention scary?

800
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,075
The... The point is, is that I saw enough

801
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:51,371
to know that this is where I belong.

802
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,164
At home, with you.

803
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,834
So no more disappearing acts?

804
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,587
I promise. (COUGHING)

805
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,714
(SIGHS) Let's get you some of that soup.

806
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,176
Terrific. (CHUCKLES)

807
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,097
(GRUNTS) Maybe I should burn
some incense in here or something.

808
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,559
Probably a very good idea.

809
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,854
Remind me to never wear
black and yellow ever again.

810
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,022
(CHUCKLES)

811
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,940
Wait, where'd your mom go?

812
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,526
Oh, Captain Lance drove her home.

813
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,028
Yeah, that is something I'll never
be able to wrap my brain around.

814
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,113
-(CHUCKLES) Kinda cute.
-(CHUCKLES)

815
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,116
Don't you miss this?

816
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,038
I mean, I... I know you said that you
wanted to get away from it all but...

817
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,416
How could you?

818
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:38,333
What do you mean?

819
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,045
This. The, the thrill of this. The rush.

820
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,631
I mean, we just took down
a bad "bee-yotch" tonight.

821
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,799
(CHUCKLES)

822
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,258
It doesn't get any better than this.

823
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,843
I was never in it for that.

824
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,638
Not ever.

825
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,724
I wanted to make a difference.

826
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,019
Be part of that
beacon of hope you speak of.

827
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,813
So come back.

828
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,940
Rejoin the team.

829
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:03,651
I think I figured out another way.

830
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,239
It's actually, that insane bee lady
who gave me the idea. Ironically.

831
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,075
(SIGHS)

832
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,827
To remake this company.

833
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,663
To use the technology that
helped me walk again

834
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,872
to make people's lives better.

835
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,461
To make Palmer Tech into a beacon of hope.

836
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:31,887
Our mutual friends in HIVE have abandoned
our other mutual friend Mr. Darhk.

837
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,389
But he reached out to me.

838
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,767
Told me about you.

839
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,688
He said you were his ace in the hole.

840
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,022
(CHUCKLES)

841
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,899
Is that what you'd like me to call you?

842
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,278
Or do you prefer Mr. Diggle?
