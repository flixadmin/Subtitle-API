1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,413
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:06,643
Twitch, and I will
open your throat.

3
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:08,767
Slade Wilson.

4
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:10,453
Oliver Queen.

5
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:13,788
Let me show you
how I'm going to die.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,459
There might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

7
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:26,768
Sorry.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,136
For what?

9
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,605
For not telling you
how I really feel.

10
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:36,378
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,946
No! No!

12
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:40,782
No!

13
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:43,985
Whoever did this to her

14
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:45,787
is going to suffer.

15
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:49,591
You cannot die
until you have known...

16
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:52,127
Complete despair.

17
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,130
And you will.
I promise.

18
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:58,199
A new player
we've been tracking.

19
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:02,270
We've been calling him
Deathstroke.

20
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:05,307
Slade's goal is to create
in the Mirakuru.

21
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:10,645
I can't stop him
from doing anything.

22
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:13,481
Five years ago,
I made you a promise.

23
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:14,983
I'm here to fulfill it.

24
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,656
There is still one person
who has to die

25
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:23,258
before this can end.

26
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:29,197
Oliver.

27
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:32,067
Oliver, man, you ok?

28
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:37,572
The cure's not working.

29
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:39,808
We don't know that.

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,377
He still has a lot of Tibetan pit viper
venom in his system.

31
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,980
What's that?

32
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:46,514
Proximity alarm.

33
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:48,316
I rigged the tower
with sensors

34
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:50,452
just in case Slade's
goons came here to kill us.

35
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,356
Slade's goons
are here to kill us.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,260
Talk to me, Felicity.
They're inside,

37
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:00,295
they're right
underneath us.

38
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:03,865
Where am I?

39
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:14,142
They're inside, there's
too many of them!

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,678
Felicity!

41
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,581
Down the cable!

45
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:20,608
What the hell
happened?

46
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,844
Slade's army. You were right about
this place being compromised.

47
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:24,979
Lyla, your boss is going to bomb
the city at dawn.

48
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,281
Yeah, Waller's never
seen a problem she didn't think

49
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,183
couldn't be solved
with a drone strike.

50
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:30,418
Why do you think I'm here?
You knew Waller was

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,787
looking to level the city and you
came here anyway?

52
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,156
You're here.

53
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:37,125
You need to go back
to A.R.G.U.S.

54
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,427
You need to stop Waller
or buy us enough time to stop Slade.

55
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,597
Not without me.
Till death do us part, right?

56
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,632
This time it might.

57
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:47,769
Guys? I need you to scrounge
as many weapons as you can find,

58
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,738
especially
injection arrows.

59
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,640
We're going to fill them with the cure--
which clearly works--

60
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:56,111
and this ends tonight,
without killing.

61
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:59,180
There's been enough
death already.

62
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,586
No!

63
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:33,946
Thea.

64
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:43,427
It's called Kevlar.

65
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,442
If you're going
to kill me, just...

66
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:49,910
Get it over with.

67
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,912
Kill you? Why?
Because you shot me?

68
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:53,480
I'm glad you did.

69
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,115
You're sick.

70
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:56,750
Perhaps.

71
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:58,819
How else to explain
the fact that not a year ago,

72
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:00,721
your brother held a gun to
my face as well.

73
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:02,789
Tommy?

74
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,459
He lacked conviction.
The strength to pull the trigger,

75
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:07,294
but not you, Thea.

76
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,663
You are made of iron.
You are truly my daughter,

77
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:12,599
and I could not
be more proud.

78
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:21,316
Remember your training.

79
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,887
You be smart,
you take clean shots,

80
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:24,809
and you don't miss the--

81
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,877
Fall
back to Meltzer Avenue.

82
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,945
We need SWAT at Union Plaza.
City hall's a crater.

83
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:32,182
They're--they're everywhere!

84
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:34,718
Fall back,
fall back, I'm hit!

85
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:42,159
Ok, listen,
I know you're scared.

86
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:44,061
You wouldn't be human
if you weren't.

87
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,663
But tonight,
this city, our city...

88
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:49,633
It's counting on each
and every one of you.

89
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:51,236
So you go out there
and you be the heroes

90
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,805
I know you all to be.

91
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:56,406
Go.

92
00:05:58,342 --> 00:05:59,910
Where's your sister?

93
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:02,245
I don't know.
Detective.

94
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:04,881
I've got one-P-P
on the line.

95
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:07,584
Lieutenant Pike in the field,
you're the ranking officer.

96
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,719
You should go.
I'll find Sara.

97
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:12,622
Listen, I don't want you stepping foot
outside this precinct, you hear me?

98
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:15,492
I won't. I promise.
All right, sweetheart.

99
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,294
What do we got?

100
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,929
My sister can't be
a part of this.

101
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:20,797
I don't want her getting hurt.
Sara!

102
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,199
What's going on?
Laurel...

103
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:39,316
Well, it seems like
I missed a lot.

104
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:42,052
Well, what do you remember?

105
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:44,921
Leaving town
and heading to Blüdhaven.

106
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:47,624
Was I out cold
the whole time?

107
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:50,861
Felicity.

108
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:52,496
You were out.

109
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:54,631
The whole time.

110
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:58,001
Slade has at least 50 or
so of those human weapons.

111
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,504
We'll need a whole army if we plan
on hitting 'em with the cure.

112
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:03,740
I know.

113
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:07,944
Which is why an army
is what I've brought.

114
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,744
Gee, Sara, you could have
called before you invited...

115
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:23,148
5, 6, 7 assassins down
into our top secret lair.

116
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,083
What is she
doing here?

117
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:27,185
I asked her to come.

118
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:29,187
I'm Nyssa,
daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

119
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,822
Heir to the demon.

120
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:34,492
Felicity Smoak.
MIT class of '09.

121
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,361
This is where you
went? Nanda Parbat?

122
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:38,530
The League of Assassins?
These people are mercenaries, Sara.

123
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:41,700
Whatever they promised you,
it comes at a price.

124
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,469
You don't have to worry about it,
because I've already paid it.

125
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:47,639
You agreed
to go back.

126
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:51,576
Look, I'm not going to let Slade Wilson
hurt Laurel or my father.

127
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:53,111
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

128
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:55,113
to keep the ones
that I love safe,

129
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:58,316
and I hope you're ready
to do the same.

130
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:00,919
Especially after what happened.

131
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,289
Ollie, I'm sorry
about your mother.

132
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,726
I am willing to do
whatever it takes,

133
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,828
but that doesn't mean
cold-blooded killing

134
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,731
is the answer, Sara.
We have the cure now.

135
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,099
To fight the unthinkable,

136
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:18,303
you have to be willing
to do the unthinkable.

137
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,041
You may not want
my help, Mr. Queen,

138
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:25,343
but there's little question you are in
desperate need of it.

139
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:28,280
First we need to find
Slade's base of operations.

140
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:30,582
Slade Wilson
and Isabel Rochev are using

141
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,118
your former office
building as their base of operations.

142
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:39,124
How are you feeling?

143
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,493
Ready to serve up
some payback.

144
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,095
Then remember your training.

145
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:47,632
Remember everything
that you've learned.

146
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:55,540
Are--are you
for real?

147
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:58,643
Someone--a friend--

148
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:01,012
once told me that if you
survive a crucible,

149
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:02,681
you grow the stronger for it.

150
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:06,151
This is to remind you of that.

151
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,622
What happened to
Thea? Is she...Ok?

152
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:13,892
She's fine. She was
headed out of the city

153
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,493
before this started.

154
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:21,166
We do this my way.

155
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,500
The league does not
take prisoners.

156
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:24,502
It does tonight.

157
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,810
Thea, it's dangerous
out there.

158
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:34,479
Better than here
with my psycho-villain dad,

159
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:37,682
who's happy
I tried to kill him.

160
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,690
Roy?

161
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:47,125
Thea, it's--
it's me.

162
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,427
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

163
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,230
I'm fine.

164
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:54,899
I'm at the train station.
Thea, listen to me.

165
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:58,069
You're not safe there. Can you
please meet me at my place?

166
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:01,072
I'll be there.

167
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:02,841
Soon as I can.

168
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:05,944
Ok, be safe.

169
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:07,379
Who was that?

170
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:09,748
Roy?

171
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:12,734
You're my daughter. There's not
much I don't know about you.

172
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:15,787
Interesting how
you run back to him

173
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,624
after resolving to run away to
escape all the lies

174
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,427
and half-truths.
He's no different, Thea.

175
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:25,263
No different from
your mother or Oliver.

176
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:28,199
If you don't
believe me,

177
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:30,969
then you should
go to him.

178
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:33,538
I will.

179
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,375
And if you try to follow me,
I'll shoot you again.

180
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:42,180
When you need me,
I'll be there.

181
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:03,234
Elevator bank's clear.

182
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,139
Conference room's clear.

183
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,380
You must have
quite a bit

184
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,982
of faith in this cure
if you've come alone.

185
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:19,484
We didn't come alone.

186
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:46,244
Sara, don't!

187
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,850
Kill me.

188
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,218
Don't kill me.

189
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,353
It doesn't matter.

190
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:58,389
I beat you.
I took away the one--

191
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:04,004
Your reticence to do
what is necessary

192
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,172
is why your city burns.

193
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:11,639
This isn't working.

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,541
I can't get close enough to Slade to
hit him with the cure.

195
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:17,110
So what do we do?

196
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:26,259
Another
disappointment!

197
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,893
Bring me another!

198
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:29,995
Come on, Slade,
what are you doing?!

199
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,235
Advancing
the cause of science.

200
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:40,739
Wait, no, no, wait,
I know you blame me for Shado's death!

201
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:44,209
I blame myself!
He should!

202
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:47,012
It's his fault
we aren't together.

203
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:50,215
You said once
that we were brothers.

204
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:52,851
And right now,
I am begging you,

205
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:56,755
brother to brother,
just listen to me!

206
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,725
Don't listen to him!
All his words are lies.

207
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:03,228
I wouldn't be alive
right now if it wasn't for you.

208
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,930
I would be alive
if it wasn't for him.

209
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:08,033
Think about Shado!

210
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,736
She--she cared
for both of us.

211
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:12,404
She wouldn't
want this.

212
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:14,506
She wants us
off Lian Yu.

213
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,241
She'd want all
of this to end!

214
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:19,778
He's right!
This needs to end.

215
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,381
You need to kill him.

216
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,596
Two hours now.

217
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:45,637
Prosti menya, moy drug.

218
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,007
I'm sorry, Oliver.

219
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,484
Do it.

220
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,621
Slade, no!

221
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:03,989
Pull the trigger!

222
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:06,792
Slade!

223
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,530
Laurel! Laurel!

224
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:13,465
Sweetheart, sweetheart!

225
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,367
What--what happened?!

226
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,302
Sara!
She's gone, sweetie.

227
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:18,837
Oh, my God.
You ok?

228
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,006
She's with that woman!
The woman that took mom.

229
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,975
Please, no!

230
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,811
Stay right here.

231
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:31,517
Stop right there!
Don't take one more step.

232
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,153
One more step!

233
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,393
Slade Wilson
wants to see you.

234
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:42,494
No, no!

235
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,663
Drone's locked
on target.

236
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:46,965
Starling City.

237
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:54,492
Why does this
Wilson guy have such

238
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,131
a mad-on for the Queens?
I don't know.

239
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,167
Good thing Thea and Oliver got
out of town in time.

240
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,504
So they have to go
after my family?

241
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,031
What's she doing here?

242
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:06,001
She's here to help.

243
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:08,436
Just trust me,
please.

244
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:11,406
I guess today I'll have
to work with anybody

245
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:12,741
who can help get
my daughter back.

246
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,342
What?

247
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,144
One of these masked guys,
they took Laurel.

248
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,214
I--I couldn't stop them.

249
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:20,915
Believe me,
I-- I tried.

250
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,784
Oh, we have a new,
big problem.

251
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:25,153
Which, considering our other ones,
is really saying something.

252
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:28,857
I hacked a satellite and tasked it for
thermographic imaging--

253
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,959
all of Slade's men are gathering at
the Giordano Tunnel.

254
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,328
I thought these guys were trying
to destroy the city, not escape it.

255
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,529
A.R.G.U.S. is going
to level the city

256
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,798
to stop them
from getting out.

257
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
That's what Slade's planning on.
He knows Waller's tactics.

258
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:40,935
Fortunately,
with Slade's men

259
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:43,071
attempting to leave
via the tunnel,

260
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:44,939
all our targets will be grouped
in a single place.

261
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:46,908
We need to take it.
Gather your men.

262
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,778
What about Laurel?
Wilson took her for a reason.

263
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,246
I know what it is.

264
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:54,349
But the city
comes first.

265
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,986
This is my daughter.
This is your sister!

266
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:00,321
You can't just
leave her like this!

267
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:03,058
Look, I know you said

268
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,083
you were trying another
way, and I respect that.

269
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:08,063
But Slade Wilson? His men?
They're monsters.

270
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:11,099
And monsters, they need
to be destroyed.

271
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:15,270
You've killed
before.

272
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:19,140
Tonight, I suggest
you get back in the habit.

273
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:26,514
He's wrong.

274
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:31,118
He's right.

275
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,355
I've lost everything
because I'm fighting Slade Wilson

276
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:36,957
with one hand tied
behind my back.

277
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,461
The man murdered
my mother.

278
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:43,597
I have to kill him.

279
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,223
You told me you had
a choice.

280
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:47,236
That years ago, you could
have cured Slade

281
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:48,150
but you chose to kill him instead.

282
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:50,739
This isn't happening because
you're not willing to be a killer;

283
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,473
it's happening
because you were one.

284
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,609
You're right. That's
how this started.

285
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:57,979
It's how it has to end.

286
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,682
The only move that
he has left for me is to kill him.

287
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,350
I can't cure him,
I can't capture him,

288
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,918
I can't even
out-think him!

289
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,887
Then don't. Don't...

290
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:09,357
Just make him out-think you.

291
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:14,462
Residents are being urged
to stay in their homes

292
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:17,966
amidst unconfirmed rumors that
mayor Blood is among the casualties

293
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:21,402
as masked men
terrorize the city...

294
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:27,041
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:30,311
I'm sorry
for everything.

296
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:34,415
I...

297
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,284
No, it's ok.

298
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:38,386
I know--I know that
I haven't exactly

299
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,021
been myself
for the past few months.

300
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,956
I was injected with...

301
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,359
With some drug. I know.

302
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,227
Sin told me.

303
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:49,831
But are you ok now?

304
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,866
Yeah, I'm fine.

305
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:55,903
I woke up here. I lost
a lot of time, but...

306
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,872
And what about the Arrow?

307
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:02,310
He said he was going
to take care of you?

308
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,747
I don't know anything
about the Arrow.

309
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:09,784
I'm done with all
of that, but I...

310
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:14,555
You're the only person that I've
ever cared about.

311
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:26,901
Are you okay?
Did something happen to you?

312
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:29,670
It doesn't matter.

313
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:32,774
Look, let's just--
let's just get out of here.

314
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:36,511
Let's start over.
We can be whoever we want to

315
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,913
without anyone
getting in our way.

316
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:42,517
I'm never
losing you again.

317
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,761
Yeah, there's just--

318
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,533
there's just one thing
I need to take care of

319
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,567
before we go, ok?
So just stay here

320
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,302
and get some stuff
packed and I'll be right back.

321
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:04,405
No, Roy, it's dangerous.
I know.

322
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,507
But I have to do this.

323
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:08,776
I wouldn't feel
right if I left without trying.

324
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:12,070
Do you trust me?

325
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,583
Yes.

326
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:19,487
Then when I get back, we're getting
out of here forever.

327
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,757
I love you.

328
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,102
Oliver.

329
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:37,505
What are we doing here?
 The whole city's falling apart.

330
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:39,273
I know.

331
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:41,776
You need
to stay here.

332
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,544
What?!

333
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,780
Why? You can't just ask me to--
I'm not asking.

334
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:49,617
I will come and get you when
this is all over.

335
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,686
No!
Felicity...

336
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:52,787
No! Not unless you tell me why.

337
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:54,155
Because I need you
to be safe.

338
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:55,957
Well, I don't want to be safe.

339
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,025
I want to be with you.
And the others, unsafe!

340
00:19:58,027 --> 00:20:00,161
I can't let
that happen.

341
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,363
Oliver.

342
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,432
You're not making any sense.

343
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:09,637
Slade took Laurel because he
wants to kill the woman I love.

344
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:10,938
I know, so?

345
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,707
So he took
the wrong woman.

346
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:17,011
Oh...

347
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,318
I love you.

348
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:32,160
Do you understand?

349
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,228
Yes.

350
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,830
Johnny.

351
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:57,599
Yeah?

352
00:20:58,305 --> 00:20:59,295
Never mind.

353
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:01,009
Hey, Lyla.

354
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:03,938
I love you.
You know that, right?

355
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,474
I do, actually.

356
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:09,477
But it's good
to hear it.

357
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,915
Time to impact?

358
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,384
Drone is 52 minutes
out from target.

359
00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:19,420
Get me sergeant Gomez
at the Giordano Tunnel.

360
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:23,291
Easy company's not
responding, ma'am.

361
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,193
I need a visual.

362
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:27,328
They're in a tunnel,
ma'am, I can't get a picture.

363
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,565
What the hell is going on
in that tunnel?

364
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:34,035
Sergeant Gomez,
come in! Sergeant Gomez!

365
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,842
No kill shots.
Let the cure do its work.

366
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:45,446
Ready?

367
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,617
Ready?!

368
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,453
Ready, fire!

369
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,769
Agent Michaels, this area's restricted
to all unauthorized--

370
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,848
What the hell is this?
Early parole?

371
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,784
Waller's looking
to bomb Starling City.

372
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:24,619
We need your help
to stop her.

373
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:26,821
As much as I'd love to show
the Wall what we think of her,

374
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:28,589
there's just that little matter
of tick, tick, boom!

375
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:31,326
Ok? We've got all that
miniature bombs in our spines.

376
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,927
You have
to trust me.

377
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,797
And Lawton,
no dropping bodies.

378
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,466
Yeah, sure, take
the fun out of it.

379
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:14,202
Nyssa!

380
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,501
Get off the ship!

381
00:23:46,503 --> 00:23:49,504
Not without you!

382
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:52,707
Give it to me!
Give me the Mirakuru!

383
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:55,309
No!

384
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:04,385
Ollie!

385
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:06,721
Sara!

386
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:39,353
Prep the drone to fire.

387
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,289
Weapons hot was set
for oh-six hundred.

388
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,057
Prep the drone to fire!

389
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:50,731
Down, now!

390
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:53,267
Everybody get
down, down, down!

391
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:55,770
Waller, call that drone off!

392
00:24:55,772 --> 00:24:59,073
This is treason,
agent Michaels.

393
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:02,109
Treason that risks hundreds of
thousands of lives.

394
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:03,878
Have you thought
about that?

395
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,480
Have you thought
about how

396
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:07,048
you're going
to explain that to your son?

397
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,250
Or is it
your daughter?

398
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:10,819
Did doctors specify,

399
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,155
or did you want to
keep it a surprise?

400
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:20,595
Congratulations, Mr. Diggle,
you're going to be a father.

401
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,834
Go!

402
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,436
You've
been busy, kid.

403
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:32,340
It's over, Slade!
Your army is broken.

404
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,975
And I pity them.

405
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:38,179
But once again,
you miss the point.

406
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:41,549
I have the one you love.

407
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:46,220
You're going
to meet me where I say.

408
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:48,122
Otherwise,
I'm going to kill her.

409
00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:51,559
No, you do what you have to.
I'm done playing your games!

410
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:53,794
You're done when
I say you're done!

411
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:56,531
I was surprised.

412
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:58,799
I thought you had a thing
for stronger women,

413
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:00,668
but now that I've met her...

414
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,571
I can see the appeal.

415
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:07,390
She is quite lovely...

416
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:10,978
Your Felicity.

417
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:32,564
Twitch, and I will
open your throat.

418
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:35,300
My first words to you.

419
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,537
Do you remember? I do.

420
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,472
I remember the exact moment.

421
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,141
My blade against your neck.

422
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,879
Just like my blade is against
the neck of your beloved.

423
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,648
If only I'd killed you then,

424
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,818
everything
would be different.

425
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,221
Drop the bow, kid.

426
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:02,027
Do it.

427
00:27:15,107 --> 00:27:18,109
Yes.

428
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:19,711
Countless nights dreaming

429
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:23,548
of taking from you
all that you took from me.

430
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,551
By killing the woman I love?
Yes.

431
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:29,588
Like you love Shado.

432
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,357
Yes.

433
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,326
You see her.

434
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:37,062
Don't you?

435
00:27:37,064 --> 00:27:40,866
Well, what does she look like
in your madness, Slade?

436
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,368
What does she say to you?

437
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,770
I remember her being beautiful.

438
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:48,473
Young. Kind.

439
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:51,710
She would be horrified

440
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,578
by what you've done
in her name.

441
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,382
What I have done?

442
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,917
What I have done

443
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,988
is what you lack
the courage to do!

444
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,156
To fight for her!

445
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:08,627
So...

446
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:11,563
When her body
lies at your feet,

447
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:15,033
her blood wet
against your skin,

448
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:19,170
then you will know
how I feel!

449
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:21,206
I already know how you feel.

450
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,676
I know what it's like to hate.

451
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:27,812
To want revenge.

452
00:28:27,814 --> 00:28:31,149
And now I know how it feels

453
00:28:31,151 --> 00:28:34,819
to see my enemy
so distracted,

454
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:38,523
he doesn't see the real danger
is right in front of him.

455
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,610
Do you understand?

456
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,546
Yes.

457
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,550
Kill her!

458
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,455
Get them out of here!

459
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:17,662
Poor Sara.

460
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:20,398
How many times
you going to watch her die?

461
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:46,291
You can't kill me.

462
00:29:55,301 --> 00:30:00,205
The Mirakuru isn't
what made me hate you!

463
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:07,479
The end is near.

464
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:09,814
But maybe
I'll be merciful enough

465
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:14,185
to let you live
and see your city burn!

466
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:47,686
We both know
there's only one way

467
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:49,621
that this can end.

468
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:52,957
To beat me, kid,

469
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,859
you're going
to have to kill me.

470
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:58,096
But in the moment
of my death,

471
00:30:58,098 --> 00:31:01,066
you'll prove one thing--

472
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:05,236
that you are
a murderer.

473
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,247
What are you going
to do, kid?

474
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,550
Stick me with the cure?

475
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:21,286
It doesn't matter.

476
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:24,022
I'll keep my promise!

477
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:26,458
I'll take away everything

478
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,560
and everyone you love!

479
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:31,129
Sara was only the first!

480
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:33,431
She was only the first!

481
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,167
Your sister,
Laurel, your mother!

482
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:22,514
You can kill me,
or not.

483
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:27,218
Either way, I win.

484
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:39,097
Amanda, it's over.

485
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,832
Slade's down,
his army's been taken out.

486
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,935
Call back the drones.

487
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:46,771
Amanda, it's over!

488
00:32:58,717 --> 00:33:01,953
So what now, kid?

489
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,099
It's time.

490
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:18,002
Why--why are they
making you do this?

491
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:19,637
Why are you making her do
this, huh? Why?

492
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:22,573
Dad, she's not
making me do anything.

493
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:25,043
I chose this.

494
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,511
What am I going to
tell your mother?

495
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:30,114
Tell her that for the first time
in my life,

496
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:32,684
I'm deciding my own fate.

497
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:35,353
She'll understand that.

498
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:37,322
Yeah.

499
00:33:39,124 --> 00:33:41,826
I love you,
sweetheart.

500
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:44,629
I love you, too, Dad.

501
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,532
I know the power
of a father's love,

502
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:50,902
and I would die before
I let anything happen to your daughter.

503
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,105
Well, here's hoping.

504
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,109
So, where
you're going,

505
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:00,111
will you be able
to email or call?

506
00:34:00,113 --> 00:34:03,181
I'll see you again.
I know.

507
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:05,683
If there's anything that
I've learned this year,

508
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:07,485
it's that you always
find your way home.

509
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:10,221
And we'll always
be here waiting.

510
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:13,257
I love you.

511
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:16,961
I love you.

512
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:20,802
Oliver needs you.

513
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:27,375
And, hey...

514
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:32,113
I think that this would
look good on you.

515
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:47,529
It fits.

516
00:34:50,232 --> 00:34:53,768
Bye, Dad.
Bye, sweetheart.

517
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:04,312
About that jacket...

518
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:06,314
Don't get any ideas.

519
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:13,121
I could really use a meeting.

520
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:16,357
Yeah, probably a good
idea for the both of us.

521
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:18,193
Listen, I got to pick up
a little pepto on the way, though,

522
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:19,727
'cause I'm feeling
kind of weird.

523
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,429
Dad, she'll be ok.

524
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:23,731
Yeah, I know she'll be ok,
but ok what is what bothers me.

525
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:26,100
Dad?

526
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:28,102
Dad!

527
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:30,939
Oh, my God. Dad!

528
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:32,674
Dad!

529
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:34,008
Oh, my God!

530
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,910
I can't get
my breath!

531
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:37,845
I can't...

532
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,051
Dad, stay with me!
Daddy, daddy, stay with me!

533
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:44,953
Hello?!

534
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:47,355
I need an ambulance.

535
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:49,891
My father's with SCPD. Yes, now!

536
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:53,061
Daddy, stay with me!

537
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:54,829
Thea.

538
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:57,465
Thea!

539
00:36:11,076 --> 00:36:15,479
Roy...I'm sorry.

540
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,531
I made a mistake.

541
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:19,966
I thought I could
still be with you.

542
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:22,602
I thought I could
still be Thea Queen.

543
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:26,005
But Thea Queen was trusting.

544
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:27,774
And I don't trust you.

545
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,444
Or anyone. Not anymore.

546
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:33,112
Thea Queen was also weak.

547
00:36:33,114 --> 00:36:36,649
And no matter what it takes,
I will be strong.

548
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:41,888
Don't try to find me.
You won't.

549
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,158
Even I don't know
where I'm going.

550
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,460
I only know one thing--

551
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:50,029
I am never coming back.

552
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,825
Where am I?

553
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:17,984
As far away from the world
as I could get you.

554
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:21,766
Where you can't hurt
anyone ever again.

555
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:25,069
That's your
weakness, kid.

556
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:28,106
You don't have
the guts to kill me.

557
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:32,777
No. I have the strength
to let you live.

558
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:35,913
Oh, you're a killer.

559
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:39,584
I know, I created you.

560
00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:42,920
You've killed plenty.

561
00:37:42,922 --> 00:37:45,189
Yes, I have.

562
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:50,094
You helped turn me
into a killer when I needed to be one.

563
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:53,564
And I'm alive today
because of you.

564
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:57,635
I made it home because of you.

565
00:37:57,637 --> 00:38:01,672
And I got to see
my family again.

566
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:08,946
But over the past year,
I've needed to be more...

567
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:11,816
And I faltered.

568
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,890
But then I stopped you.

569
00:38:18,892 --> 00:38:20,491
Without killing.

570
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:35,876
You helped me become
a hero, Slade.

571
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:40,948
Thank you.

572
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:50,390
You think I won't
get out of here?

573
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:57,164
You think I won't
kill those you care for?

574
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:00,674
No, I don't.
Because you're in purgatory.

575
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,809
I keep my promises, kid.

576
00:39:08,811 --> 00:39:11,545
I keep my promises!

577
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:15,883
I keep my promises.

578
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:31,398
Last time I didn't notice;
It's actually kind of beautiful here.

579
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,799
Don't get me wrong,
I'm counting down the seconds

580
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,702
until we shove off
minefield island.

581
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:38,138
So you think
that'll be enough to hold him,

582
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,007
A.R.G.U.S.'
super Max?

583
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:41,942
Him, and anyone else
we send here.

584
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:45,412
This battle may be over,
but there will be others.

585
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:48,549
Starting with getting
my family's company back.

586
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,417
That's not going to be easy,
since you're poor now.

587
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:52,152
You're going to have
to get a job.

588
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:54,855
If Slade doesn't
scare you, that's got to.

589
00:39:54,857 --> 00:39:56,400
Do you know anyone hiring
ex-billionaires

590
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:58,369
with superior archery skills?

591
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:04,031
Hey, why
don't I, uh,

592
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:06,466
give you two
a second?

593
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:12,005
Well, you did it.

594
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:15,075
I had help.
Yeah.

595
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,577
That's really smart.

596
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:18,245
How you out-foxed him.

597
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:21,014
Talk about unthinkable.

598
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:23,517
You and me, I mean.

599
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,386
When you told me
you loved me,

600
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:28,956
you had me fooled.
For a second,

601
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,290
I...

602
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:32,759
Maybe you might have meant it.

603
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:36,129
What you said.

604
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:39,533
You really sold it.

605
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:44,738
We both did.

606
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:50,244
Let's go home.

607
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,119
Dig, what was the news
about you and Lyla?

608
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,854
It can wait.

609
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:03,090
I'm flying.
Be my guest.

610
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:04,491
I got one more
question!

611
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,159
Wouldn't be you if you didn't.

612
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:07,794
If you spent
five years on this island,

613
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:10,497
when did you
learn how to fly a plane?

614
00:41:30,752 --> 00:41:32,886
Gun ngo lei.

615
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,700
My name is Amanda
Waller, Mr. Queen.

616
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:49,303
We have a lot
to discuss.

617
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:58,111
Welcome to Hong Kong.
