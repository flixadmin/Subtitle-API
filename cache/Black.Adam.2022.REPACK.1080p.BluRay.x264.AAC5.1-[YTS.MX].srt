00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,250
[young man] Before Rome,
before Babylon,

2
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,044
before the pyramids,
there was Kahndaq.

3
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,679
The first self-governing people
on Earth,

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,139
Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

5
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,850
For centuries, they thrived.

6
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,817
-But then...
-[people screaming]

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,947
...came King Ahk-Ton.

8
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,660
Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

9
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,954
But he had
even darker ambitions.

10
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,255
Obsessed with dark magic,

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,676
Ahk-Ton's real goal was
to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

12
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,890
If infused with the powers
of the six demons

13
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,268
-of the ancient world...
-[thunder crashing]

14
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,478
...it would make Ahk-Ton
invincible.

15
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,231
To make the crown,
he needed Eternium.

16
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,941
A rare mineral
of magic properties,

17
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,235
-found only in Kahndaq.
-[miners grunting]

18
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,321
So he enslaved his own people...

19
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,824
...and forced them to dig.

20
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,536
[grunting with effort]

21
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,213
Eternium.

22
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,970
Eternium.

23
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,096
Eternium.

24
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,556
Eternium.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,225
[miners yelling in Kahndaqi]

26
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,649
[young man, in English] Kahndaq
was teetering on the brink.

27
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,275
[men shouting in Kahndaqi]

28
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,860
[young man]
What they needed...

29
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:32,903
Get off him!

30
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,987
Get off him!

31
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,114
Get off him!

32
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,866
[shouting subsides]

33
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,825
[young man] ...was a hero.

34
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,037
Why are we fighting each other?

35
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,872
Remember who our real enemy is!

36
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,457
Come with me.

37
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,710
Look!

38
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:49,670
Eternium.

39
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,005
Let me see that.

40
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,676
-[tools clattering]
-[birds calling in distance]

41
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,388
The King thanks you.

42
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,390
He's supposed to reward him.

43
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,724
Is that right?

44
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,518
I want what I'm owed.

45
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,228
Hm.

46
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,608
You want a reward?

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,736
-[miner grunts]
-[boy gasps]

48
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,488
The King thanks you for your service.

49
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,657
[miner screaming]

50
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,122
[panting]

51
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,499
You want the King's reward too?

52
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,796
No, but my son accepts the King's mercy.

53
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,846
I won't always be here to protect you.

54
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,681
I don't need protection.

55
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,224
I want to be free.

56
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,102
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the King.

57
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,603
Let someone else be the hero...

58
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,814
...the graveyards are full of them.

59
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,025
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

60
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,237
[miners grunting]

61
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,824
[young man] Someone
to hold the hopes of the people.

62
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,996
Even when all hope seems lost.

63
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,458
If we had more heroes...

64
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,170
...then maybe our freedom
wouldn't be a dream.

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,381
[soldier yells]

66
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,549
Freedom!

67
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,300
Freedom!

68
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,180
-[boy grunts]
-[soldiers yell]

69
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,898
[miners yelling, cheering]

70
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,699
[young man] King Ahk-Ton
knew that this spark

71
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,326
could quickly ignite a fire.

72
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,120
And so, he ordered
that it be snuffed out.

73
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,456
[crowd chanting]

74
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,001
They thought they were
getting a martyr.

75
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,213
Instead...

76
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,632
-[murmurs in Kahndaqi]
-...they got a miracle.

77
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,181
[low voices chanting]

78
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,518
[young man]
The Council of Wizards,

79
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,436
the magical guardians
of the Earth...

80
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,647
You have been chosen.

81
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,898
[young man]
...sought to restore the balance.

82
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,024
The stamina of Shul!

83
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,192
-They empowered him with the gifts
-The swiftness of Heru!

84
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,693
-Of the ancient gods.
-The strength of Amon!

85
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,694
And turned a boy...

86
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,570
The wisdom of Zehuti!

87
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,696
The power of Aten!

88
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,989
-The courage of Mehen!
-...into a champion.

89
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,950
"Shazam!"

90
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,743
[thunder crashing]

91
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,286
Hurry.

92
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,204
Give it to me!

93
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,539
[young man] But the crown
had already been completed.

94
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:31,915
Give it to me!

95
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,543
[people chattering excitedly]

96
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,961
[young man] And when the Champion
arrived at the palace

97
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,212
to challenge him...

98
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,966
...King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.

99
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,807
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

100
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,017
but the Champion was victorious.

101
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,103
The wizards hid
the Crown of Sabbac

102
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,689
so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

103
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,526
And the Champion
was never heard from again.

104
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,237
["Bullet With Butterfly Wings"
by Smashing Pumpkins playing]

105
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,868
Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

106
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,371
the Intergang, the latest
in a series of foreign invaders.

107
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,543
But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

108
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,589
the Champion will return to
restore freedom to the people.

109
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,924
It has been a long, long wait.

110
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,593
[horn honks]

111
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,473
[soldier] Hey!

112
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,060
[vendors shouting, indistinct]

113
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,814
Show me your papers.

114
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,735
[horn blaring]

115
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,695
[checkpoint soldier]
Move it along!

116
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,363
[checkpoint leader]
Have your documentation ready.

117
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,782
[indistinct chatter]

118
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,409
[driver] It's all our
three documents, yeah?

119
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,702
Don't judge the picture,

120
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,078
it's after my girlfriend
broke up with me.

121
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,045
[soldier 2] Open the back.
Need a look inside.

122
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,049
-[indistinct chatter]
-[faint radio chatter]

123
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,759
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

124
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,221
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

125
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,688
-Hey!
-[young man grunting]

126
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,690
Watch where you're going.

127
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,567
You know the drill,
back of the line.

128
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,903
Come on, man,
you see me every day.

129
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,154
[checkpoint leader]
And every day I tell ya,

130
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,948
if it's got wheels,
it's a vehicle.

131
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,491
Back of the line, mate.

132
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,159
You're not my mate.

133
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,704
I'm heartbroken.
Now, go on, piss off.

134
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,291
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

135
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,210
from halfway around the world,

136
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,379
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

137
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,173
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

138
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,591
oppress our heritage,

139
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,426
and make us wait in lines
all day.

140
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,057
-[bangs van door]
-Hey, boss man. Can I go?

141
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,142
Hey!

142
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,648
Go on, get out of here.

143
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,483
-Yeah, yeah.
-[thumps door twice]

144
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,535
[driver] Adrianna, we're clear.

145
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,044
Kahndaq isn't safe
for us anymore.

146
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,546
Let's just move the crown first,

147
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,839
and then we can
worry about safe.

148
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,757
I got Intergang
watching my house.

149
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,342
I gave up my job
at the university

150
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,635
and moved four times.

151
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,345
It doesn't mean I'm gonna
abandon my country.

152
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,265
I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever.

153
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,517
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

154
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,562
If I'm right, they're days away
from finding it.

155
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,063
[thudding]

156
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,234
What are you doing?

157
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,777
I want to come with you.

158
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,987
You know it's too dangerous.

159
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,739
You shouldn't have
gotten involved.

160
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,450
Come on, I want to help you
beat those bastards.

161
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,368
Adrianna,
keep your head down, please.

162
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,287
-You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

163
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,247
Go home, do your homework.

164
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,001
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

165
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,335
Go!

166
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,379
Go, little man. You did good.

167
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,579
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

168
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,498
Is that real Eternium?

169
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,417
Show us a little magic.

170
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,669
It doesn't work like that,
it's unrefined.

171
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,921
You guys should get some rest.

172
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,423
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

173
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,466
Hey, come on. Stop it.

174
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,967
I'm just curious how she got it.

175
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,803
My grandmother gave it to me.

176
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,804
How did she get it?

177
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,722
It's not a museum piece.

178
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,433
It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back

needs to be locked down

He'll be disoriented at first.
The longer he has to adapt,

That's where Atom Smasher

Thank you again

You know, I used to watch you
all the time as a kid?

This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my--

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let anything happen to it.

It's vintage.

403
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,384
And don't let anything
happen to you, either.

Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.

Uncle Al. I promise.

That's why I called in Kent.

408

Kent's been out of action
for a little while,

409
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,068

It might take
a lot more than that.

Are you sure they can take him?

414
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,584
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him...

415

...we'll take care of the rest.

I'll be in the cockpit
if you need me.

It's pretty cool.
You got any snacks?

Uh, my mom's
not much of a doctor,

leave th--

You're Teth Adam, right?

Everyone in Kahndaq
knows your story.

a bunch of Intergang soldiers
in the desert.

463
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,372
Because they wouldn't move
out of my way.

464
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,957
So you can really fly
and stop bullets,

465

'cause that's really crucial
to my plan.

466
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,336
And is it really you stopping
the bullets or is it the suit?

Wait, what's your top speed?

I'm sure you're fast,
but how fast?

Wait, did you really not have
mirrors back then?

Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

Five thousand years?

Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,295
-His father's dead.
-I'm sorry.

533
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,340
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

534
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,093
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?

535
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,219
No one.

536
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:19,057
I want a champion to help
free Kahndaq from Intergang.

537
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,643
Please, help us.

538
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,652
[panting]

539
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,954
[Amon] Wait! Wait.

540
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,791
-Where are you going?
-I shouldn't be here.

541
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,294
You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?

542
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,587
Not really, no.

543
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,505
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

544
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,048
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

545
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,759
but having superpowers is
kind of a big deal in our world.

546
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,344
Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,

547
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,637
get a cape, change your name.

548
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,514
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

549
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,599
It's a little outdated.

550
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,225
And you definitely
need a catchphrase.

551
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,019
Something blackout
bad-ass to say

552
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,271
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

553
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,772
I don't waste words on the dead.

554
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,482
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

555
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,817
I was thinking, like,

556
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,153
"Tell them the Man in Black
sent you."

557
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,738
-Them?
-You know, gods, demons...

558
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,197
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

559
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,742
And you wear a lot of black, so
we should really lean into that.

560
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,077
My point is,
you could be famous.

561
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,496
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

562
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,207
And the superhero industrial
complex is worth a lot of money.

563
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,293
I don't need a box for my lunch.

564
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,337
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

565
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,133
What else are you gonna do?

566
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,428
[people exclaiming]

567
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,640
Wait! Where are you going?

568
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:44,100
[people chattering excitedly]

569
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,075
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

570
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,826
Most of this was
considered a myth

571
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,703
until yesterday afternoon.

572
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,623
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

573
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,167
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

574
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,211
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

575
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,671
[wry chuckle]

576
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,547
What are you laughing at?

577
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,801
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

578
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,220
I know. That's how you laugh.

579
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,846
I've missed having you around

580
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,849
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

581
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,893
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

582
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,604
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

583
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,899
This is not a very good plan.

584
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,363
Yeah, well...

585
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,783
A bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

586
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,412
If only there were
a third option.

587
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,913
[sucking on mint]

588
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,000
[Cyclone] I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

589
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,502
Why not?

590
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,629
"Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

591
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,005
It's millions of years old.

592
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,757
It chooses who it lets touch it.

593
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,593
-Like Kent?
-Yeah.

594
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:04,055
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

595
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,890
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

596
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,185
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

597
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,105
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

598
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,356
[Hawkman] Coming up on it.

599
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,817
Ready stations in five.

600
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,236
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

601
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,529
He's not some dude.

602
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,948
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

603
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,367
You don't have to
raise your hand.

604
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,370
Question: if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

605
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,457
If we can get him
to say the word, "Shazam,”

606
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,625
Teth Adam will lose his power.

607
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,002
And we're hoping since he's had

608
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,421
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

609
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,841
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

610
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,885
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

611
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,970
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

612
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,263
Correct.

613
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,639
Look alive.

614
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,101
We're here.

615
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,023
[sighing]

616
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,903
-[entry bell chimes]
-[townspeople chattering]

617
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,223
[sobbing]

618
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,308
[wailing]

619
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,436
Forgive me.

620
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:43,696
[indistinct chatter]

621
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,618
[Amon] This is a message

622
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,994
-for all Intergang soldiers.
-Hey! Stop!

623
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,372
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

624
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,712
[grunting loudly]

625
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,605
Teth Adam!

626
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,067
[quietly] Please.

627
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,779
-There he is! Move!
-[people exclaiming]

628
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,573
-Teth Adam!
-[checkpoint leader] Move!

629
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,826
-Teth Adam--! [grunting]
-[grunts]

630
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,704
Get up!
Who's gonna save you now, mate?

631
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,208
The statue?

632
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,044
[Adrianna] That's my son.

633
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,755
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

634
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,133
What are you doing?

635
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,428
Hang on. I recognize you.

636
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,138
Where is the crown?

637
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,016
-[grunting]
-Let's go!

638
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,018
[Adrianna grunts]

639
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,940
[crowd murmuring]

640
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,572
[screaming]

641
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,781
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

642
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,074
But that was dope.

643
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,623
We need backup down here.

644
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,167
[gun clicking]

645
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:38,019
[music from "The Good,
The Bad and The Ugly" playing]

646
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,656
[grunting]

647
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,367
[screaming]

648
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,035
[screams, grunts]

649
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,411
[Amon laughs]

650
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,540
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

651
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,543
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

652
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,671
But before you zap them.

653
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,506
-Catchphrase, then Kill.
-Yes.

654
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,049
[machine guns firing]

655
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,096
[tower soldiers screaming]

656
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,277
[grunts]

657
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,154
He's here.

658
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,531
You sense his presence?

659
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,573
No.

660
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,203
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

661
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,289
[Cyclone gasps]

662
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,670
[soldiers gasping, whimpering]

663
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,466
Fate and I'll take the lead.
Listen...

664
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,969
Now, you two hang back
'til we call you.

665
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,595
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

666
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,513
You're ready.

667
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,016
-[soldiers screaming]
-Uh, he just dropped the, um...

668
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,934
-[soldiers screaming faintly]
-Shit!

669
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,813
[wind whistling]

670
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,233
Be prepared.

671
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,696
[electronic alert beeping]

672
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,451
Um...

673
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,998
[screaming]

674
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,086
[both yelling]

675
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,297
Behind you!

676
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,633
[soldiers yelling]

677
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,516
[grunts]

678
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,769
[crowd jeering]

679
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,353
Let us be!

680
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,857
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

681
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,485
these men should face
due process.

682
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,946
[crowd cheering]

683
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,823
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

684
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,283
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

685
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,285
You don't look like
an Intergang.

686
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,704
We're the Justice Society.

687
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,832
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

688
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,211
We're here to restore peace
to Kahndaq.

689
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,381
And we will use force
if necessary.

690
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,010
Force is always necessary.

691
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,345
[Dr. Fate] Teth Adam.

692
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,640
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

693
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,602
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

694
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,021
You have two choices:

695
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,482
Kneel or die.

696
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,026
I was a slave until I died.

697
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,696
Then I was reborn a god.

698
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,200
I kneel before no one.

699
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,955
[grunts]

700
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,334
Fate, give me a distraction.

701
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,209
[people screaming]

702
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,307
Just say, "Shazam."
We all go home.

703
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,516
[grunts]

704
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,060
I don't have a home.

705
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,400
[loud grunt]

706
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,776
[grunting with effort]

707
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,404
[strained grunt]

00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,324

Whoo!

712
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,429
Look at that suit. It's cool.

713
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,097
-Thanks. You, too.
-Thank you.

714
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,308
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

[Teth Adam & Hawkman grunting]

716
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,691
[Atom Smasher] Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?

717
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:36,984
[Cyclone] Nope.

-Let's roll!

Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

I got him! Guys, I got him.

756

It's, uh... it's me, Al.
In case you didn't recognize me.

757
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,162
There's something different
about you.

758
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,455
Can't quite put my finger on it.

759
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,748
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

760
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,333
But you-- You're like a tornado.

761
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,586
I thought the two of you
did great work.

762
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,921
First time out--
[clicks teeth] Bravo.

763
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,424
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

764
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,800
but, uh,
it all worked out, right?

765
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,469
You're damn right it did.

766
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,721
Let's hope Waller
has that cell ready for him.

[grunting] You want me
to keep my hand here, right?

You'd better not let him up.

Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing.

[chanting subsides]

785
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,505
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

786
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,048
We're not strong enough.

787
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,592
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction

788
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:56,095
to figure that out
before we get our asses kicked.

789
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,429
I'm working on it.

790
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,681
Miss?

791
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,891
Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?

792
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,268
Yes, I do mind.

793
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,769
Where are you going
with this, Kent?

794
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,229
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

795
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,022
[Hawkman]
One catastrophe at a time.

796
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,524
We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

797
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,359
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

798
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,653
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

799
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,446
Why do you want Teth Adam
to surrender?

800
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,490
He's the Champion of Kahndaq.
Who are you?

801
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,908
The Justice Society?

802
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,786
We have been living
under military occupation

803
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,497
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

804
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,208
You didn't come when Intergang
invaded our country,

805
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,877
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

806
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,338
But now, we finally
have our own hero

807
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,800
and you decide to fly down here
and save us?

808
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,177
Thank you, but... we're covered.

809
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:40,848
Go and protect international
stability someplace else.

810
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,601
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

811
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,269
Let me spell it out for you.

812
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,646
Teth Adam can't be
Kahndaq's champion

813
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,189
because he is not a hero.

814
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,608
Tell that...

815
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,653
...to all the people
he just liberated.

816
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,865
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

817
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,199
But I can assure you that my t--

818
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,409
-[loud crashing]
-[gasps]

819
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,661
[all exclaiming]

820
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,289
I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?

821
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,293
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

822
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,211
-Yes, sir.
-Me and you.

823
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:12,630
I...

824
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,257
Can we please
just see the crown?

825
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,134
I don't have it.

826
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,724
[indistinct chatter]

827
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,770
[horns honking]

828
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,196
We don't have time for this.

829
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,281
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

830
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,742
You don't have
any authority here.

831
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,951
Teth Adam has done nothing--

832
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:45,829
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

833
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,331
And how would you know?

834
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,957
We have access to ancient texts

835
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,959
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

836
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,629
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

837
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,924
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

838
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,468
And we flew
all the way over here

839
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,804
to stop it from happening again.

840
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,350
[Hawkman]
You want to go in there alone?

841
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,434
Are you sure?

842
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,854
You want to go in and fight
Teth Adam again, be my guest.

843
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,273
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

844
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,442
without destroying
the rest of my city,

845
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,985
I'm your only shot.

846
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,051
[Teth Adam] You brought
the invaders with you.

847
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,095
They only want to talk.

848
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:47,141
They can talk. I won't listen.

849
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:51,395
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother told me the story

850
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,440
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot

851
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,316
to free the enslaved people
of Kahndaq

852
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,485
by defeating King Ahk-Ton
in battle.

853
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,529
But according
to the Justice Society,

854
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,947
that's not really what happened.

855
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,159
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

856
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,912
Hurry.

857
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,122
Give it to me!

858
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,667
[crowd exclaiming]

859
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,128
[Adrianna] That you came
to exact revenge.

860
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,604
And in your anger...

861
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,189
[energy crackling]

862
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:39,401
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

863
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,113
This is what I want.

864
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,824
[Adrianna] ...your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.

865
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,243
[people screaming]

866
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:56,126
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

867
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,878
of the gifts that
you were granted.

868
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,464
We have chosen recklessly...

869
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,424
...and humanity has paid the price.

870
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,426
And now, Teth Adam...

871
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,512
...you must pay.

872
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,941
[energy building]

873
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,318
[yelling]

874
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,951
It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

875
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,330
It was your prison.

876
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,542
And now there's a statue of you.

877
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,796
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

878
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,798
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it.

879
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,883
[Teth Adam]
I never said I was a hero.

880
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,718
I never claimed to be anything.

881
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,513
You may not have been a hero.

882
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,349
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

883
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,358
I will hear them out.

884
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,361
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

885
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,490
[door unlocks, opens]

886
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,450
Uncle Karim!

887
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,244
I can't believe you're
sitting around watching TV

888
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,996
when the most epic day ever is--

889
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,373
-[Ishmael] In here, little man.
-[gasps]

890
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,544
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

891
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,879
Funny story, he didn't.

892
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,131
-[laughs]
-Where's Adrianna?

893
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,340
She's back at the square--

894
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,592
We should go bail her out
right now.

895
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:27,718
But she's the one
who sent me home

896
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,886
to make sure the crown's safe.

897
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,637
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

898
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,223
Definitely not here.
Let-- Okay--

899
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,683
-Put the bag down.
-What are you doing?

900
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,394
Back away.
Put the bag down, now.

901
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,316
Give him the bag.
Give him the bag.

902
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,067
[crown clanking]

903
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,611
Very good. Back away.

904
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,321
Back away.

905
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,864
Okay, I'm--

906
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,910
[bag unzips]

907
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,375
[Ishmael] It's all going
to be okay, little man.

908
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,669
Let me teach you some history
that you've never learned

909
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,129
in one of your mother's classes.

910
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,881
When we had a powerful king,

911
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:09,259
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

912
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,802
It used to be great.

913
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:12,429
Run, Amon, run!

914
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,806

[loud grunt]

918
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,240
Crash the building.

919
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,201
I lost the kid.
He has the crown.

920
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,338
[Atom Smasher chewing]

921
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,135
[Hawkman] We're here
to negotiate the terms

922
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,221
of your peaceful surrender.

923
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,183
I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

924
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,310
[Dr. Fate] What have your powers
ever given to you?

925
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,895
Nothing but heartache.

926
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:03,647
You have no idea.

927
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,691
Then why are you making this
hard on us?

928
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,901
We both know
you're not supposed to be here.

929
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,612
It is you who
is not supposed to be here.

930
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,948
I want you all to leave Kahndaq
and never return.

931
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,368
Gladly,
with you as our prisoner.

932
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,496
How 'bout I rip
your little wings off instead?

933
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,331
I'd like to see you try.

934
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,916
Okay, more fighting
won't solve this.

935
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,501
-I disagree.
-Me, too.

936
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,044
Looks like we found
common ground.

937
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,754
This can only end one way.

938
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,506
[cell phone buzzing]

939
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,924
-[Amon] Mom?
-Amon.

940
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,884
I got home and Ishmael
was in the kitchen.

941
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,011
Ishmael's dead.

942
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,221
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

943
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,889
[terse chatter]

944
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:38,807
[female soldier] Ground forces...

945
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,393
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

946
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,185
They're coming!

947
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,855
Intergang are after my son.

948
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,150
They don't want him,
they want the Crown of Sabbac.

949
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,818
I know you're not a hero.

950
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,153
But you're not a monster,
either.

951
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,362
I don't care what anyone says.

952
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,364
You saved me in that cave.

953
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,325
You didn't know me and your
first instinct was to save me.

954
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,829
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

955
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,209
[soldier]
Check the whole place clean.

956
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,170

with your word choice next time.

Put me down! Put me down!

991
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,401
You should be more careful with
your word choice next time.

992
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,069
And tell them that
the Man in Black--

01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,564
I'm counting on it.

1063
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,574
[gasping, panting]

1064
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:54,325
[grunts]

1065
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,952
Please don't. [screaming]

1066
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,787
Teth Adam. Where are you?

1067
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:58,746
You followed me?

1068
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,540
My mind and body can exist

1069
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,709
in different places
at the same time.

1070
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,002
Did you find the boy?

1071
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,962
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

1072
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,298
Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.

1073
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,049
Uh...

1074
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,178
You killed him, didn't you.

1075
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,723
[pilot screaming in distance]

1076
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,142
[faint impact]

1077
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,728
He didn't make it.

1078
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:25,356
[Cyclone] The bullet's extracted.

1079
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,484
The tissue damage
has been repaired.

1080
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:31,321
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

1081
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,573
He'll be back on his feet
in no time.

1082
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,949
[exhales]

1083
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,327
That is insane.

1084
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,996
The nanobots did
most of the work.

1085
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,415
No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

1086
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,417
I literally just witnessed
a miracle.

1087
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:45,960
Mm-mm. [chuckles]

1088
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,170
What? I say something stupid?

1089
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,590
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

1090
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,217
grow a hundred times
your own size.

1091
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,552
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

1092
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,262
-[chuckles]
-I don't know, it's...

1093
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:58,264
It's cool.

1094
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,683
Thank you.

1095
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,436
But it's not as cool
as nanobots.

1096
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,315
That's how you
do your wind thing.

1097
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,984
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

1098
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,945
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

1099
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,488
by this really
messed-up scientist

1100
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,989
who kidnapped me
when I was 15.

1101
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,162
I'm... so sorry.

1102
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,914
No, you're good.

1103
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,083
It seems like you
really turned it around.

1104
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,960
Found your calling.

1105
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,546
Hoping this is mine.

1106
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,882
[crying softly]

1107
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,845
[Dr. Fate] There's no point
in dwelling in the past.

1108
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,350
It's already moved on from you.

1109
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,438
Why did you say that?

1110
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:50,191
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

1111
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:53,403
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

1112
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,071
not those you can't.

1113
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,240
[whispering] You see the future?

1114
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,659
Tell me how I get my son back.

1115
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,203
By trusting us.

1116
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:05,039
Karim will live.
We will save Amon.

1117
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,166
It's what we do.

1118
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,340
I suppose they didn't have doors
in your day.

1119
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,843
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

1120
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,846
What I did there
is called sarcasm.

1121
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,056
Where is Amon? Did you find him?

1122
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,182
Not yet, but I will.

1123
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,684
The men who took him
will suffer.

1124
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,352
[soldiers grunting]

1125
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,146
Maybe these guys can help.

1126
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,066
There's an upside
to keeping prisoners.

1127
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,193
They can answer our questions.

1128
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,570
What did you do with my son?

1129
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,822
[soldier grunting in pain]

1130
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:44,245
-[blows landing]
-[men grunting]

1131
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,414
-Adrianna. Adrianna.
-[panting]

1132
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,499
I've learned that
in this modern world,

1133
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:49,876
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

1134
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,628
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

1135
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,339
[Adrianna] No.

1136
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,050
Let's start with just
one simple question.

1137
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,302
-Can either of you fly?
-[both gasp]

1138
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,596
-[screaming]
-Shit.

1139
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,308
I think I'll sit this one out.

1140
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,894
[soldiers screaming]

1141
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,396
[thunder crashing]

1142
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,566
Tell me what you did with Amon.

1143
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,986
You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

1144
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,655
I'm not going to drop them.

1145
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,200
I'm going to drop one of them.

1146
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,535
Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?

1147
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:25,703
I don't know.

1148
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,622
[screaming]

1149
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,295
He's at our mine in the desert.

1150
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,880
I can show-- [screaming]

1151
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,676
-[Hawkman grunts]
-[gasping in fear]

1152
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,177
[second soldier screaming
in distance]

1153
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,680
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1154
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,016
You said you wouldn't
hurt the prisoners.

1155
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,893
That was sarcasm.

1156
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,354
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

1157
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,772
Intergang have a mine
in the desert.

1158
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,107
-Amon is there.
-I know it.

1159
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,401
It's near
the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

1160
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,402
Let's go.

1161
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:58,986
[soldiers screaming, grunting]

1162
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,322
I told you, stop killing people!

1163
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,615
They look alive to me.

1164
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,283
Because I saved them.

1165
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,952
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

1166
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,955
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

1167
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,081
I did it your way.

1168
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,749
He does have a point.

1169
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,919
I know it got lost
in all the confusion,

1170
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,338
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

1171
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,257
We know where Amon is.
We have to go.

1172
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,925
There is no "we" here.

1173
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:24,512
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

1174
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,764
You think yourself a hero,

1175
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,474
but you would let these
criminals go free,

1176
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,685
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

1177
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,853
unless we end them now.

1178
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,605
Heroes don't kill people.

1179
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,402
Well, I do.

1180
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,363
Here we go.

1181
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,991
[both grunting]

1182
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,837

[Hawkman yells, grunts]

1186
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,494
[yelling]

1187
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,289
[Teth Adam grunts in pain]

1188
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,051
Is that what I think it is?

1189
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,387
[Hawkman]
23 pounds of pure Eternium,

1190
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,932
much denser than
typical artifacts of the period.

1191
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,767
King must have had
a really strong neck.

1192
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,811
No, it snapped
when I killed him.

1193
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:57,939
What's that?

1194
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,816
There's writing on the inside
of the rim.

1195
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,068
"Life is the only path
to death."

1196
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,320
That's what it says.

1197
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:07,490
Life is the only path to death.

1198
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,743
Well, that's
surprisingly obvious.

1199
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,411
Could it have another meaning?

1200
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,413
What if it means, like, um...

1201
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,873
"Life is short.

1202
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,125
You gotta hold on
to what you love."

1203
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,087
Stop.

1204
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:22,672
Deep.

1205
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,340
It doesn't matter what it means.

1206
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,300
It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity.

1207
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,094
That's not far from what
we had in mind

1208
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,595
for you when this is over.

1209
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,138
Or I could bury you with it.

1210
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,642
We can't get rid of it now.

1211
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,352
It's the one thing
that Intergang wants.

1212
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,105
Believe me,
I know more than anyone

1213
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,731
what this crown is capable of.

1214
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,317
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

1215
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:45,027
Adrianna...

1216
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,946
Trust me,
we will get your son back.

1217
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,282
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

1218
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,075
Hand it over.

1219
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,497
We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands.

1220
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,917
We'll find another way.

1221
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,253
No.

1222
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,298
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

1223
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,718
but that's easy to do when
you're the one drawing the line.

1224
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,678
All I care about is Amon.

1225
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:14,807
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

1226
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:18,644
And you...
you will work together.

1227
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,820
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

1228
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,239
We'll go in at dawn.

1229
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,034
I hope you can be a team player.

1230
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,744
I love teams.

1231
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,913
That was sarcasm again, yes?

1232
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:37,955
Very much so.

1233
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,374
Good. Just checking.

1234
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,304
A wise man
once told me a bad plan

1235
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,805
is better than no plan at all.

1236
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:58,225
That was before we had
a very bad plan.

1237
01:13:58,309 --> 01:13:59,518
Let it go.

1238
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,897
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

1239
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,482
He's a murderer, Kent.

1240
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:07,318
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

1241
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:11,113
You don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

1242
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,033
That's... up to Fate.

1243
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:15,993
What's the helmet telling you?

1244
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,788
Somebody's gonna die.

1245
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,958
Who is it, Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

1246
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,168
Surprisingly, no.

1247
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,253
Is it me?

1248
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:29,924
[intense scream]

1249
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,930
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

1250
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,267
All I can tell you is...

1251
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:45,106
There's still time
to change the future.

1252
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,191
Let's use it.

1253
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,776
Hm.

1254
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,533
Well, I guess we're sticking
with the very bad plan.

1255
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,796
[Hawkman] The Al Hadidiyah Mine

1256
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,047
is Intergang's
most valued asset.

1257
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:13,968
I'm gonna land us right here,

1258
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,928
cut off their access
to reinforcements.

1259
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:19,181
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

1260
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,434
There's only one way in,
one way out.

1261
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,602
We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol.

1262
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,438
Communication is key.

1263
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,898
We keep in step
or we get outflanked.

1264
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:30,067
We move through the mine,
inch by inch,

1265
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:31,235
until we find Amon.

1266
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,030
This is where you come in.
Are you ready-- Damn it.

1267
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:36,490
["Power" by Kanye West playing]

1268
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,628
[soldier screams]

1269
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:52,965
Or we could just do that.

1270
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,803
[man yelling, screams]

1271
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,809

[Ishmael] Pure Eternium shield.

1273
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,233
Unbreakable,
even with your powers.

1274
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:19,784
Amon!

1275
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,744
You hurt him,
I will kill all of you.

1276
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:24,789
[chuckling] Nobody has to die.
We just want the crown.

1277
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,457
We don't have it.

1278
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,878
Believe me, nothing good
will come from that crown.

1279
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,966
No crown, no negotiation.

1280
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,177
I have it.

1281
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,097
It's right here.

1282
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:45,017
Release my son, you can have it.

1283
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,313
What do you think you're doing?

1284
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,399
Intergang killed my husband.

1285
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,111
I'm not letting them
take my son, too.

1286
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,448
[sharp grunt]

1287
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:00,658
[Adrianna gasps]

1288
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:03,327
Not your son. Not your country.

1289
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,163
Not your decision to make.

1290
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,499
Stop there!

1291
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,627
It's okay.
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1292
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,212
Hand it over, now.

1293
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:15,506
I'm sorry, Mama.

1294
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:16,674
No.

1295
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,931
Now, let Amon go.

1296
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,981
[Ishmael] I thank you.
And I thank your friends

1297
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,233
for returning the crown
to its rightful owner.

1298
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:40,114
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders?

1299
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,615
You have what you want.

1300
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,450
Let him go.

1301
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:44,869
Ishmael, what are you doing?

1302
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:46,620
Taking back what's mine.

1303
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,583
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

1304
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,127
And you have just given me
everything I need

1305
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,922
to become the next...
king of Kahndaq.

1306
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,509
My family passed
the knowledge on, you know,

1307
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,844
one to the next.

1308
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,556
The crown,
crafted by our ancestors,

1309
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,350
stolen by the wizards
and hidden away.

1310
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,352
But still a source
of great power,

1311
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,897
if only we can wield it.

1312
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:16,859
[strained laughter]

1313
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:17,902
[sniffles]

1314
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:22,615
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

1315
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,576
I wonder if you'll
do the same for them.

1316
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:26,619
Please, Ishmael.

1317
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:27,870
Sorry, Amon.

1318
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,832
Fate, get ready.

1319
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:36,212
Death is the only path to life.

1320
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,383
Amon!

He's alive.

1333
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,499
But we need to get him
to the medical bay.

1334
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:57,418
-Where is he shot?
-It wasn't a bullet.

1335
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,086
[Teth Adam] It was me.

01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,634
[breath shaking]

1337
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:08,929
Come.

1338
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,898
We're going with you.

1339
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:22,526
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

1340
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:38,751
I found the crown.
But, um... it's not alone.

1341
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,139
How long we gonna
keep doing this?

1342
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:59,521
There's no point in fighting.
We both know no one can stop me.

1343
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:01,482
You're right.

1344
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,109
Only you can.

1345
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,530
Ishmael said you cried
when Hurut died.

1346
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,786
Who's Hurut?

1347
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,210
Hurut was a true Champion
of Kahndaq.

1348
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,468
And he was also... my son.

1349
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:33,931
I won't always be here to protect you.

1350
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:35,849
I don't need protection.

1351
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,309
I want to be free.

1352
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,270
Freedom is for the birds.

1353
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,439
Let someone else be the hero...

1354
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,776
...the graveyards are full of them.

1355
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,862
[people yelling,
shouting in distance]

1357
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,408

I tried to protect him.

[Teth Adam]
But I wasn't strong enough.

1361
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:08,173
[wizards] Shazam!

1362
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:13,470
[Teth Adam] The wizards decided
that he would be their champion.

1363
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,223
But after the Champion's
many victories,

1364
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,934
the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.

1365
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:21,228
[yelling]

1366
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:23,397

[Teth Adam coughs]

1369
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,457
Hold on, Father.

1370
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,001
Stay with me.

1371
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,295
[Teth Adam grunts softly]

1372
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,008
[coughing weakly]

1373
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:52,676
With my powers...

1374
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:55,387
...you'll be safe.

1375
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,015
I couldn't protect your mother.

1376
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,643
Repeat what I say.

1377
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:03,687
-Shazam.
-Shazam.

1378
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,607
[thunder crashing]

1379
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:18,911
[Teth Adam]
Instead of battling the king...

1380
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,997
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

1381
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,792
Hurut chose to save...

1382
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,461
...me.

1383
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,762
[arrows clattering]

1384
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,974
[bow string creaking]

1385
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,480
[Teth Adam]
But he couldn't save himself

1386
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,273
from the king's assassins.

1387
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,192
[yelling in Kahndaqi]

1388
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,528
[Teth Adam, in English]
The powers were not a gift

1389
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:53,779
from the wizards...

1390
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:55,197
[whispering in Kahndaqi]

1391
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,114
[Teth Adam, in English]
...but a curse.

1392
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:59,159
[powerful yell]

1393
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,002
Born... out of rage.

1394
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,924
The statue of the Champion
isn't you.

1395
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,262
It's Hurut.

1396
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,642
My son dreamt of a better world.

1397
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,728
That's why he saved me.

1398
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:33,485
But the world was only
a better place with him in it.

1399
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:50,877
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1400
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,256
Instead, it got me.

1401
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,594
All this power...

1402
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:02,723
And the only thing
I can do with it is hurt people.

1403
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,392
I will speak the word
my son gave me...

1404
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,853
...and I will give up my power.

1405
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:14,067
And when I do, you must ensure
I never speak it again.

1406
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:21,199
Shazam.

1407
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,035
[thunder echoing]

1408
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,501
Some men are not meant...

1409
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:33,962
...to be heroes.

1410
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,257
Hey!

1411
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:40,237
[chuckling] So beautiful.

1412
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,139
Surprised to see us?

1413
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:10,559
Surprise is a dirty word
in this business.

1414
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,394
Are you sure you can handle him?

1415
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:14,938
You're the one who can
see the future,

1416
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:16,314
you'll tell me if we can't.

1417
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:18,859
Just be careful with this one.

1418
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,361
You know,
they say the gods created us,

1419
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:23,905
but we're the ones
who always wind up burying them.

1420
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,617
Waller sends her regards.

1421
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,917
[Dr. Fate] They'll know
how to deal with him.

1422
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,879
To keep him
from regaining his powers,

1423
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:40,964
they'll keep him
in suspended animation.

1424
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:52,350
As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.

1425
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,316
He'll never say
another word again.

1426
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,045
Hey! There he is.

1427
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:23,298
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1428
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,467
-[laughs]
-Well, statistically,

1429
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,220
most heroes don't wear capes.
But yeah, try it on.

1430
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:32,974
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1431
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,353
[light wind blowing]

1432
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:37,896
That's a nice touch.

1433
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,606
[mimics wind]

1434
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:55,705
[faint, distorted voices
chanting]

1435
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,463
[voices whispering, indistinct]

1436
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:06,508
[distant rumble of thunder]

1437
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,179
[powerful scream]

1438
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,265
[pained exhale]

1439
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,643
[Dr. Fate moans]

1440
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:19,604
Kent.

1441
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:22,607
-Kent!
-[gasps]

1442
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:26,903
Mission accomplished?

1443
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:28,613
My vision hasn't changed.

1444
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:31,366
But Teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1445
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,244
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1446
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,204
What is the helmet telling you?

1447
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,959
My vision has always shown me
a great calamity.

1448
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,878
The world in flames.

1449
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,421
We can stop it...

1450
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:47,924
...but you die.

1451
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,344
You should've told me sooner.

1452
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,266
I have no fear of death.

1453
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:58,268
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1454
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,604
The world needs
the Justice Society.

1455
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,522
The world needs you.

1456
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:05,483
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1457
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,110
That's Fate, right?

1458
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,863
[rueful chuckle]

1459
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:12,073
That sounds familiar.

1460
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,912
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1461
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:22,208
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1462
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,754
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1463
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:26,963
Mm.

1464
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,215
But I didn't cheer.

1465
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:32,719
Even though I was only a boy.

1466
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:37,098
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1467
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:39,601
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1468
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:41,394
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1469
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,521
I've seen the world change

1470
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:45,774
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1471
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,737
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1472
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,449
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1473
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,203
[sighs]

1474
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,413
[groaning]

1475
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:06,169
Ishmael said, "Death is the only
path to life."

1476
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:09,381
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1477
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:12,759
Right. "Life is the only
path to death."

1478
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:13,969
Maybe he got it backwards,

1479
01:31:14,052 --> 01:31:16,596
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1480
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,555
That's it.

1481
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:20,642
In Kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1482
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,352
are sent
to the Rock of Finality.

1483
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:24,771
The underworld
IS a mirror to our own.

1484
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,940
Here, turn the crown around.

1485
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,693
Now mirror the letters.

1486
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:32,821
See? That's what I missed.

1487
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:36,950
"Death is the only
path to life."

1488
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,537
[gasping]

1489
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,164
[Adrianna] He kidnapped Amon
on purpose,

1490
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:45,500
because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.

1491
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,752
And he believed
the Champion's magic

1492
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,796
would send him
to the Rock of Finality.

1493
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,841
As life is the path to death.

1494
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:57,220
[demon] Now your death
is a path to life.

1495
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:59,389
[demon 2]
The wizards have their champion,

1496
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,641
now we have ours.

1497
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,561
[demon 3] You will take
the throne of Kahndaq

1498
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:08,481
and unleash hell on Earth!

1499
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,692
[demons] Speak our name.

1500
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,569
"Sabbac."

1501
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:17,032
[screaming]

1502
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:35,800
[Dr. Fate] What
the bloody hell is that?

1503
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,594
[Hawkman] Readout says
it's the demon, Sabbac.

1504
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,679
Get me closer.
Now, right now!

1505
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:41,848
We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!

1506
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,775
The King has returned!

1507
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,903
The throne will be mine!

1508
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:58,448
Brace yourselves!

1509
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,994
[roaring]

1510
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:04,287
[all yelling]

1511
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:05,497
Hold on!

1512
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,290
[alarm beeping]

1513
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:08,166

01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,366
[scattered shouts, yelling]

1519
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:43,827
[Sabbac, in English]
Now prepare to die.

1520
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,453
[sharp grunt]

1521
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:48,581
[both grunt]

1522
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:51,251
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1523
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,046
[Atom Smasher coughing]

1524
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,385

[grunts]

1527
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:11,271
[Hawkman] No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1528
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,359
-[Atom Smasher] Copy that.
-[Cyclone] We're on it!

1529
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:17,193
Heads up!

1530
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,073
[loud grunt]

1531
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:27,453

Activate infrared.

[Cyclone cries out]

1539
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:08,786
Sabbac, show yourself!

-[people yelling]
-Adrianna! Amon!

1541
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:17,879
[Sabbac yells]

1542
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,923
That's for my cruiser.

1543
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:22,008
-[grunts heavily]
-[Sabbac screams]

1544

[groaning]

1550
01:35:58,544 --> 01:35:59,754
[Dr. Fate] This is it.

1551
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:02,674
We can't win, Carter.

1552
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,802
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1553
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,348
Bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

1554
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:15,728
[panting]

1555
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,661

[shield resonating]

1557
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,252
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1558
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:41,129
Giving us a third option.

1559
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:42,505
It's supposed to be me.

1560
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:44,882
I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend.

1561
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,302
I did see your death.

1562
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:49,762
But I also found a way
to prevent it.

1563
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:51,889
It has been
an extraordinary life,

1564
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,309
but always with one foot
in the future.

1565
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:57,603
Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,

1566
01:36:57,687 --> 01:36:59,272
when I look ahead...

1567
01:37:01,607 --> 01:37:02,817
...I see nothing.

1568
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,901
No, Kent.

1569
01:37:03,985 --> 01:37:04,986
And...

1570
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:07,030
...it's...

1571
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:08,823
...beautiful.

1572
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:09,949
Wait, Kent!

1573
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:11,117
Goodbye...

1574
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,910
Kent! [grunting loudly]

1575
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,078
...my dear friend.

1576
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:15,288
Kent! [grunts]

1577
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:19,459
[Hawkman] Hit it from every side.

1578
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,463

1580
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,383
No!

01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:46,736
[growling]

1582
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:51,991
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1583
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:55,119
defender against darkness
and chaos,

1584
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:58,748
but even my powers
cannot defeat you.

1585
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:01,834
[Sabbac grunting]

1586
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:10,468
There's no one that
can defeat me.

My name is Amanda Waller.

1769
01:56:07,544 --> 01:56:10,338
Congratulations,
you have my attention.

1770
01:56:10,422 --> 01:56:13,258
This is gonna be
your only warning.

1771
01:56:14,593 --> 01:56:16,803
You don't want to stay
in my prison, that's fine.

1772
01:56:17,429 --> 01:56:19,931
Kahndaq is your prison now.

1773
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:23,852
You step one foot outside of it
you will not live to regret it.

1774
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:28,231
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1775
01:56:28,315 --> 01:56:30,025
[Waller] I can call in a favor
and send people

1776
01:56:30,108 --> 01:56:31,860
who aren't from this planet.

1777
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:35,739
Send them all.

1778
01:56:37,073 --> 01:56:38,200
As you wish.

1779
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:43,663
[thunder rumbling]

1780
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:56,551
It's been a while since anyone's
made the world this nervous.

1781
01:57:02,557 --> 01:57:03,725
Black Adam.

1782
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:07,020
We should talk.
