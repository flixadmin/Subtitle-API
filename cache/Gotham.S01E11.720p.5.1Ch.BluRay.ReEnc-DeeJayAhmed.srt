Yes.

So who are we looking for?

What does it take to pull this off?

177
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,211
Uh, some basic knowledge
of human anatomy.

178
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,806
Um, basic electrical skills.

179
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,570
Circuit boards and wiring.

180
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,841
Is that all?

181
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,610
And the door keys, of course.

182
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,451
The door keys. Right.

183
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,921
No, man, I got my keys right here.

184

Tell me the truth.

187
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,122
Why you picking on me? There's five
other guards with keys to this wing.

188
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,245
True, and you're the only one who looks
and smells like a hunted animal.

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,924
Look, Steven,
whoever fried Frogman had keys.

190
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,925
Now, we've searched
all of the inmates' cells. No keys.

191
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,323
But I know they're out there
and I need to know where.

192
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,763
I'm backed up against a wall.
And I'm starting to lose my patience.

Do you understand?

194
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,926

195

...during the play...

196
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,847
...right after I noticed my keys were gone.

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,083
You lose equipment, that's a big deal.
They'd dock me a week's pay.

198
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,720
- So I tracked down a spare set.
- Who took the keys?

199
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,167
I don't know.
Anyone could have taken them.

200
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,845
Walk away.

201
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,365
- Sorry--
- Walk away!

202

And then he raises our taxes,
after his money blows up.

203
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,371

I'll say it.

...I wish something would happen to old man
Falcone before he comes after one of us.

- That's where this is going.
- Slow down.

206
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,082
Now, let's imagine-- God forbid anything
happened to Falcone. --just for kicks.

207

Who would take over then?

That's how the system used to work,

I had no opinion of him.

234
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,848
He was called the Frogman
because he believed a giant bullfrog...

...lived inside his abdomen,
controlling his thoughts.

- You're not the type.
- Cop skills?

325
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,843
You can read people.

326
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,725
Some people.

327
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,681
A staff member? That's absurd.

328
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,769
- It was an inmate.
- I don't think so.

329
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,962
Your job is to oversee inmate security.

330
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,169
You're not authorized to conduct
an investigation of the staff.

331
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,810
Whoa!

332
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,769
You're trying to force my hand.

333
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,924
- You want me to call the police.
- No.

334
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,601
I already called them.

335
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,482
Barbara, you need to wake up.

336
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,290
Good morning.

337
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,010
I got you coffee.

338
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,890
Extra sweet.

339
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,531
You always remember.

340
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,326
Yeah.

341
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,445
Have you spoken to Jim recently?

342
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,926
Why would I?

343
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,731
Renee, you don't have to be jealous
of Jim.

344
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,845
I'm over him.

345
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,485
This was a mistake.

346
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,841
What was?

347
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,404
This. Us.

348
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,006
I should have never let it
go on for this long.

349
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,611
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,044
Oh, I see.

351
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,321
Barbara.

352
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,201
No, I mean--
No, you are absolutely right.

353
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,521
This was a mistake.

354
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,001
This has been a really
long process for me...

355
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,322
...and I've worked too hard
to get right with myself.

356
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,371
I wanted this to be good
but I can't fall back now.

357
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,443
The drinking, the drugs.

358
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,324
We are toxic together, you and me.

359
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,211
Please, Renee, stop.
There's no need to say another word.

360
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm sorry that I interfered
with your process.

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,561
You need help I can't give you right now.
Let me call Jim for you, please.

362
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,370
No.
Where's my purse?

363
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,525
You don't need to go. Stay here,
take time to get yourself together. I'll go.

364
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,762
I am perfectly together, thank you.

365
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,570
I am just toxic, that's all.

366
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,166
- Now where is my damn purse?
- Barbara, stop!

367
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,731
Calm down, please, all right?

368
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,688
I'll go. Please.

369
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,169
Fine.

370
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,370
Do what you want, go.

371
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,328
- I'm sorry.
- Just go.

372
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,005
Hey, pal.

373
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,921
In a cowslip's bell I lie.

374
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,249
There I crouch when owls do cry.

375
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,687
All right. I can dig that.

376
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,520
- Detective.
- Jim! Ha, ha! Partner!

377
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,883
Let me take a good look at you.
Lord have mercy, you're screwed.

378
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,451
- Excuse me!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

379
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,610
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.
Freaky as advertised.

380
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,366
Nobody of authority called on you, sir.

381
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,971
This is not a police matter.

382
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,249
You must be Director Dr. Lang.
See, I beg to differ.

383
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,002
This is third degree assault,
at the very least.

384
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,843
A friend of yours, is it?

385
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,521
Egregious insubordination.

386
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,922
Your job here was already
hanging on a thread.

387
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,441
This is the end of your career
in law enforcement, count on it.

388
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,570
Whoa, take it easy, hot shot.
Officer Gordon did the right thing.

389
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,767
Why wouldn't he call the police?

390
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,089
Anyone would think
you want to keep this business quiet.

391
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,010
Gerry-- It is Gerry, isn't it?

392
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,640
Now, did you do this terrible thing, Gerry?

393
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,807
That doesn't even merit a reply.

394
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,444
No, I did not do this terrible thing.

395
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,530
But you have the skill though, as a doctor.
You could do it lickity split.

396
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,887
- Now, why would I do this?
- Why would anyone?

397
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,610
Exactly, Officer Gordon.

398
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,888
Gerry, I think we'll have to
take you down to the precinct.

399
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,726
You're raising a lot of questions that need
clearing up in a more formal setting.

400
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,530
- But you can't do this.
- Shh, shh, shh.

401
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,048
As of this moment this is
an official GCPD investigation.

402
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,766
You, sir, will cooperate or face arrest.

403
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,208
Officer Gordon, would you mind
going through the, uh, staff records...

404
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,601
...while I take Gerry here
downtown for a chat?

405
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,807
Will do, detective.

406
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,407
Sir.

407

Good to see you.

Come on.

Ha, ha.

What happened, man?

414
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,686
In my head, we're still kids
chasing girls in Harlow Park.

415
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,410
Caught a couple of hot ones, huh?

416
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,005
Especially me. Ha, ha.

417
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,328
Thanks for meeting with me.

418
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,329
What did you tell your boss lady?

419
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,486
I suggested I reach out to you,
she agreed.

420
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,688
Talk some sense into me?

421
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,087
It's a "new dawn."

422

Yeah, like that.

She's not wrong, you know.

424
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,205
City's changing.

425
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,925
You really want Falcone's job?

426
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,360
Since we were kids
I love you like a brother.

427
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,921
I love you too, always, you know that.

That's why I trust you...

I mean, Butch, without you
and your crew, what's she got?

435
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,771
Very little.

436

Everybody knows it, you know it.

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,249
Maybe.

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,081
What's it gonna take
to make you make a move?

439
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,688
- What are you offering?
- Name it.

That's a good question.

00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,451
Yeah.

Don't think too long, huh?

Thank goodness you're here.

456
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,209
There's been some silly mistake.

457
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,971
Looks like it. Unless you irritated
someone important.

458
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,485
You didn't do that, did you?

459
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,721
Me?

460
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,041
Of course not.

461
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,844
Are you sure?

462
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,043
Examine your soul, Penguin.

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,281
Wait!

I'm sure.

But see, I like having you here.

468
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,521
I can sit at my desk and look at you.

469
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,285
It's soothing...

470
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,130
...like a bonsai tree.

471
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,489

So...

00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,283
...did you see our friend?

475
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,847
I saw him.

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,331
And?

Enh. I'm working him.

478
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,050
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

479
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,683
So give him a little time.

Okay.

When a real doctor like you does it,
what's it supposed to do?

Electroshock therapy is a common procedure
