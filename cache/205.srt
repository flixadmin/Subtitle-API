1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,800
He's the most unsympathetic, selfish person I've ever met.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,140
I would never touch him.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,140
And you shouldn't either.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,780
You like me.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,980
You should've seen him at William's party, 
he was so jealous.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,560
<i>[I heard that the little hipster ex of your friend 
got together with Isabel from my class?]</i>

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,180
Oh my god, look at this.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,940
Looks good? You think it looks good?
It's hideous.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,540
Can you picture a girl in this?

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,220
Yeah, maybe in Syria. 
But like, in Norway? No.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,020
Hey welcome back, Noora.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,680
I didn't know you were coming back this afternoon.

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
This is Lito.

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,580
My name is Lito.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,840
We're just going through some of your clothes
to see if there's anyhting you don't need.

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,880
Like this, for example?

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,680
Eskild, what are you doing? You can't take 
my clothes without asking me first.

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,740
Oh I'm sorry, are we imposing?

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,240
No, no. Don't be silly.
She never uses clothes like this.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,780
Yeah, we're just going through
your clothes as I said because..

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,940
.. as you know there's a big crisis
in Syria right now.

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,780
There's a lot of Syrian refugees
that need your help.

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,060
So I was just thinking you
could donate some.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,480
Okay..

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,260
Yes, I guess. But maybe just not that top.

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,960
Because it has meaning to me so..

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,900
What meaning?
-It's from when I lived in Madrid.

28
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,560
Isn't he handsome?
 I think he's gay.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,000
Eskild, what are you doing? You can't 
just give away my clothes..

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,920
.. to a Syrian refugee just to
check him out.

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,080
He's not a Syrian refugee. 
He studies in Norway.

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,000
His father is the Turkish ambassador.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,320
Lito has taken leave from university.
To help the refugees full time.

34
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,280
Sexy?

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,560
Sexy? There's nothing sexy about the refugee
crisis. It's incredibly serious.

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,680
It's incredibly serious, and you say stuff like:
"Oh no, not that top. It has meaning to me."

37
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,640
See, here she comes. A saint!

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,420
Little princess here is rising. 
Very good!

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,220
Tennis racket, we have a CD player, Rubik's cube.
Lots of hoodies and sweatpants.

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,800
Don't know if it's clean.
-Thanks so much, Linn.

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,800
You know what Noora,
you're actually a bit stingy.

42
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,000
There are many people who need it
so much more than you.

43
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,900
I'm not stingy.
I care a lot aobut the refugee crisis.

44
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,460
You can't just come into my room and-

45
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,120
Is everything good?

46
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,320
Yes.

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah it's all good.
-Everything's fine.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,660
Yeah, it's okay. It's just like..
she loves this top, so..

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Yeah but I mean, we got a lot of clothes
and stuff, don't we?

50
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,600
If I take this and this,
you can take the rest.

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,020
I'll take this top here, Noora.
You don't need it.

52
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,020
Excuse me?
-Noora, don't be so stingy.

53
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,780
I love dresses with pockets.


54
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,020
It looks hot.

55
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,700
It starts to sing when you have your
cellphone in it.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
But this is ugly.

57
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,960
No, nothing is ugly. 
But it's a little..

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,700
Bye bye.

59
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,960
That one was nice.
I don't wear it. I can't go in white.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,520
I'll get make-up on it and I'll
spill while eating.

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,880
You should wear it.

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,720
Do you want it?

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,780
No, we have to give stuff away.
-Yeah, you need it more than me.

64
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,160
We have to show that we care.
-I care!

65
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,520
You know Eskild..
He said that I don't care.

66
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,200
I do care about the refugee crisis.
It's Eskild who doesn't care.

67
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,840
He's just trying to get with 
that Lito guy.

68
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,840
He's convinced that he's gay.
Though he's not.

69
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,760
I don't understand why people who are gay
just assume everyone else is gay too.

70
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,380
What's the deal with that?

71
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,160
Did you happen to hear that it's 
over between Isak and Sara?

72
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,280
No.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,020
I think she who broke
up with him.

74
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh!

75
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,380
This is from Jonas.

76
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,200
I have to give it back to him, right?
It's not that nice, so..

77
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,100
Have you talked to Jonas since
we've come home?

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,720
Eh, no. I've tried but I feel like
he's trying to ignore me.

79
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:53,560
Oh? - I think he's a little embarrassed
about what happened at William's party.

80
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,200
But if he still has feelings for me,
we have to be able to talk about it.

81
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,900
I want us to be friends.
I don't want it to get in the way.

82
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,860
I think it's important that you
guys talk to each other.

83
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,040
Yeah I will. He can't ignore me when
school starts again.

84
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,360
How's it going with you and William?

85
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,380
There is no me and William.

86
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,000
No, I know. I was only joking.

87
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,960
I know that. Vilde would have a 
breakdown if she knew.

88
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,500
I've never seen someone so obsessed
with another person. Have you?

89
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,880
No..

90
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,980
You don't think she's going to pay 
to hook up, right?

91
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,080
What hook up?

92
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,700
Didn't you see the Penetrator stuff? They're
having a fundraiser. You didn't see it?

93
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,280
No?

94
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,180
Are you kidding me?
Okay, I have to show you.

95
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,720
It's really sick.

96
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,080
During Easter they trashed 
a cabin in Trysil.

97
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,820
They got a bill of 
300 fucking thousand Kroner.

98
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,340
It's so sick.

99
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,020
So now they're having a fundraiser.

100
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,120
Look: Help the Penetrators.

101
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,640
They're selling sweaters and
there's an auction to hook up with someone.

102
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,420
Hooking up with William starts
at 1000 Kroner. So sick!

103
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,800
They will have a charity party on Friday.

104
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,860
Hello, this is prostitution.

105
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,400
It wouldn't suprise me if Vilde ends
up paying to hook up with William.

106
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,500
Hi.

107
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,900
Willhelm!

108
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,900
Fucking hell, it's 
lovely to see you.

109
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,600
Did you miss me?
-No!

110
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,500
Not even a little bit?
-I didn't.

111
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,540
Did you have a good Easter?

112
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,500
Yeah. Did you?

113
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,980
Good, yeah. Just a little wild.

114
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,060
I saw your event on Facebook.
Charming stuff.

115
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
You have to come.
-No!

116
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,820
Why not?

117
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,980
Because it's the dumbest thing I've seen in
my entire life.

118
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,140
Hook up auction? Seriously?

119
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,800
You know it's actually illegal? It's prostitution.

120
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,620
Are you jealous?

121
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,200
No.

122
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,520
Because I'll hook up with someone else?

123
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
That's why you're
being so grumpy.

124
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,360
I'm not grumpy. And I'm definitely not jealous.

125
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,040
I just think the entire event is horrible.

126
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:22,100
Europe is in a state of emergency. 
Twelve million Syrians are fleeing.

127
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,340
People are dying of hunger.

128
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,080
What does it have to do with this?
-It has everything to do with this!

129
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,980
You guys trashed a cabin
for 300 thousand!

130
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,120
While the world is starving.

131
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,800
Imagine how much people are willing
to spend to hook up.

132
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,300
How high will they go?
Ten thousand Kroner to hook up with someone? No!

133
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,940
Think of... William. It's sick!
-Those people are stupid.

134
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,100
They'll fail to raise it all
on Friday anyway.

135
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,980
There's the hooking up, the sweaters, 
partying on their bus with them.

136
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:28,140
They make a lot of effort.
They care about both-

137
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Hello!
-Hi!

138
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,620
I brought lunch for you as well.

139
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,680
Oh, yeah.

140
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,300
Will you ask Noora, Vilde?
-Yeah!

141
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,700
We were talking about helping the
Penetrator-boys, out of solidarity.

142
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,760
We can use some of the money from our
bus budget for their bus.

143
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,280
But it's a bit boring to just donate money.

144
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,060
So we discussed participating in the hook up
auction. It's for a good cause.

145
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,440
Vilde, what world do you live in?

146
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,640
You know that millions of
refugees are starving?

147
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,180
And you think this is a good cause?

148
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,100
You think that we should give money
to a bunch of asshole kids?

149
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,400
Guys who just got themselves drunk
and trashed an entire cabin?

150
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,000
You don't always need to be so uptight.
Try to have a little humor.

151
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,740
It's a social event that gets the entire
school together. It's not just for fun.

152
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,600
It helps the refugees more than when we
sit at home and be sad for them.

153
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,540
If you used half of the energy you use
to think about William..

154
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,620
.. to think of refugees instead, 
it might have helped a little bit.

155
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,980
So no hook up auction then?
-No, Vilde.

156
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,540
What about the party?
-Of course we're going to the party.

157
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,160
Are you guys serious now?
-Come on, Noora!

158
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,720
If even Sana thinks it's fun! She knows a litte
bit more about being a refugee than you.

159
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,680
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

160
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,900
Why do I know anything about being a refugee?
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

161
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,100
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

162
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,280
I was born in Norway.
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

163
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,960
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

164
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,040
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

165
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,300
Because you're from another culture.
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

166
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,060
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

167
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,180
No.. I'm from the same culture as you.
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

168
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,220
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

169
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

170
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,360
You're a muslim.
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

171
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,800
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

172
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
Eh, yeah?
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

173
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,160
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

174
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,860
Muslim is another culture.

175
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,300
Islam is a religion, Einstein.

176
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,300
What's up today? Is it the pick-on-Vilde day?

177
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,360
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

178
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,840
Why are you all ganging up on me?
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

179
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,340
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

180
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,060
Have you thought about how much of my soul I put into this project?
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

181
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,400
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

182
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:12,740
<i>[20%]</i>

183
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,860
It's not to be popular, but to be with you guys.
<i>[20%]</i>

184
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:16,940
<i>[20%]</i>

185
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,260
It's you I love.

186
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,640
Can you not try to give back a little?
I'm giving you everything. Everything!

187
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,580
<i>[Deal. But then you should be bloody sweet at the party.]</i>
Can you not try to give back a little?
I'm giving you everything. Everything!

188
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,500
<i>[Deal. But then you should be bloody sweet at the party.]</i>

189
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah alright!

190
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,180
We're going to the party. Okay!

191
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,180
And.. the hook up auction?

192
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,580
No, Vilde.

193
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,380
Do you want to pay to 
hook up with William?

194
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,460
Yes.

195
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,420
You know it's illegal?
It's prostitution.

196
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,700
Not if there's no sex.

197
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,460
It's hooking up.
Sex doesn't fall under hooking up.

198
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,320
Everyone knows that.

199
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:27,100
<i>[And you've already won the hook up auction.
So you no longer have to be jealous.]</i>

200
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:46,160
<i>[I'm not jealous and I'm not joining the auction.]</i>

201
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>[Yes you are.]</i>

202
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,420
You see that? They care about refugees.

203
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,680
They're not a bunch of assholes.

204
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,080
Hey, there's Jonas!

205
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah..

206
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,380
There's something I have to tell you.
-Yeah?

207
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,540
I had hoped Jonas would 
have told you himself.

208
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,380
Jonas is together with Isabel.

209
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,320
They got together on Easter.

210
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,520
Perhapes I should've told you..

211
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,500
.. but I thought it would be best
if you heard it from Jonas.

212
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,160
But he never said it, so..

213
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,980
What are you thinking?

214
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,820
I'm fine.

215
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,800
Sure?
-Yeah, yeah!

216
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,760
Eva, you're allowed to be upset.

217
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,960
He's your ex-boyfriend.

218
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm not upset. I'm fine, really.

219
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:11,640
I think it's only good that he moved on.
We really are just friends.

220
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,660
It's fine.

221
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,180
You sure?

222
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,700
Yes, I'm totally sure.

223
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,920
Come, let's party now.

224
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,560
I think he's terribly in love with her.

225
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,940
They say you can see it in the way
he looks at her.

226
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:37,720
When he looks at her
when she's not looking at him.

227
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,920
He looks so.. He smiles at her
 in a certain way.

228
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,780
Not really smiling, but you see
something in his eyes.

229
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,880
That he.. I don't know.

230
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,400
Do you think she's prettier than me?

231
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,780
Huh?

232
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,040
She is. Much, much prettier than me.

233
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,060
Eva, you have to stop now.
She's not prettier than you.

234
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,940
I just don't understand why
he didn't say anything.

235
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,780
He just pretends like it's nothing.

236
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,280
He has to say he has a girlfriend.
He has to introduce me.

237
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,400
They're going to announce who won 
the hook up auction soon.

238
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,560
Where did you see that? -The girl who will 
make out with William has paid 3000 Kroner.

239
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,820
You know what? If he hadn't thought 
of introducing us to each other..

240
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,180
.. then I'll do it myself.

241
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,500
Hi! Isak!
-What's up?

242
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,240
I've missed you.

243
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,000
We never hang out anymore.

244
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,540
You know what?
You're so sweet.

245
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,880
Jonas has a girlfriend!
Did you know? She's a third year.

246
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,100
I've really missed you.
It's so good to see you.

247
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,160
No.
-What?

248
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,100
We'll just drop it.

249
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,620
Don't you want to make 
out with me? Huh?

250
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,660
No, we'll just drop it.

251
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,160
Is it because you like guys?

252
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,860
He doesn't want to 
make out with me.

253
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,280
We should go drink some water.

254
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,740
.. who has won the hook up auction?

255
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
The girl who won is..

256
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,140
What are you saying?
I can't hear what you're saying.

257
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,460
I'm not going to say it.
-You're not saying it?

258
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,240
Vilde! Take care of Eva.

259
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,940
She should have water.

260
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,360
Vilde..
-Hi.

261
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,280
I love you.

262
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,280
Should we get you some water?

263
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,760
Isak doesn't want to make out with me.
-No, he doesn't?

264
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,080
But.. Hi!

265
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
Do you want to make out with me?

266
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,520
There you are.

267
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,120
What's this stuff about the announcement
of the hook up auction?

268
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,420
And you're pissed as usual.

269
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,740
I mean it.

270
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,660
Have you gone around telling
people bullshit? -Bullshit?

271
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,820
You have to relax a little. 
Have some faith in me.

272
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,420
Faith? Why should I have
faith in you?

273
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,560
You don't care about anyone
but yourself.

274
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,320
I care. 20% of the funds
goes to the refugees.

275
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,720
Because I'm here.

276
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,700
They don't care why 
they're getting money.

277
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,760
You don't care about them. Not for real.

278
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,680
I care about you.

279
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,040
For real.

280
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,420
No. You don't.

281
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,460
If you really did you wouldn't have pressured me
to come to the party like this.

282
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,340
You don't have to be here
if you don't want to.

283
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,720
Yes, I do! How else will the 
refugees get their money?

284
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,580
The refugees will get their
money anyway. So relax.

285
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,540
Yeah, but eh..

286
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,460
I have to be here and watch Eva. 
So she doesn't do something stupid.

287
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,760
How do you think that's going?

288
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,320
I think I have to puke.
-You have to puke?

289
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,440
You have to puke?! 
You can't puke here.

290
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,680
Aren't you getting tired of this game soon?

291
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,620
What game?

292
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,000
Pretending as if you don't like me?

293
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,580
That's not a game. 
I'm not pretending.

294
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,360
Okay. This is what we'll do.

295
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,040
Look into my eyes.
And tell me you don't like me.

296
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,940
That's the dumbest thing I've heard.

297
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,940
Look at me.

298
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,240
Say you don't like me,
and I'm gone.

299
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,020
I swear.

300
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,940
I don't like you.

301
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,560
You don't have the right
to be pissed at me.

302
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm not pissed at you.

303
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,120
I'm just trying to do what's 
right here. What you're doing is shit.

304
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,160
As long as you get your way.

305
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,880
Okay.

306
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:16,160
You're insanely selfish, manipulating,
and self-involved.

307
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,640
And spoiled.
That's why I don't like you.

308
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,560
Was that all?

309
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,580
No!
