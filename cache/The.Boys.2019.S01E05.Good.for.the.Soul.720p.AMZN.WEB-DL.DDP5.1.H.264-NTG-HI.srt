("A Lo Caliche"
by Sr Ortegón playing)

2
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,159
Hey, baby.

3
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,634
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,788
Where have you been?
It's been days.

5
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,657
Yeah. I've been
handling business.

6
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,004
It's okay now, it's okay.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,668
You said I had to hide, you said
we were in trouble and...

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,168
You know, I think, I think
I got it worked out.

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,210
I think I have
some-some good news.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,716
Good news?

11
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,047
Stillwell. She's open
to us going public.

12
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,505
Don't you lie to me.

13
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,346
Hand on a Bible.

14
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,943
Yeah. But, listen,

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,570
for us to go public,
you have to come clean with me.

16
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:09,239
Like, I have to know
who you told about Compound V.

17
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,294
Hey, come on.

18
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,919
This is, this is you and me.

19
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:25,587
I mean, we're Bonnie and Clyde.

20
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,418
Ride or die, right?

21
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,888
I...

22
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,758
Oh, shit.

23
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,693
I told these guys,

24
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,318
you were running the V
down near the Noodle Palace.

25
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:49,687
I'm so sorry, baby.

26
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,025
I had to. I...

27
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,570
Why?

28
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,163
What do they have on you?

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,790
I don't know their names,

30
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:01,248
but there was this British guy,

31
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,078
dark hair, real smug asshole.

32
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,504
Buzz cut French guy,
big black guy with a goatee,

33
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,924
and a skinny white kid.

34
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:11,512
I think they were all
working together. Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,387
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- Nah.

36
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,719
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

37
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,434
- I fucked up so bad.
- It's all right.

38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,942
You know what I was
thinking about

39
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,148
on my run over here?

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,187
Our first date.

41
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,824
Most first dates

42
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,823
order, like, a scallop

43
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,866
and a bottle of water.

44
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,793
But you...

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,840
(chuckles)
...got a dark beer,

46
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,497
a New York strip,

47
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:53,755
- and chocolate chip cheesecake.
- (laughs)

48
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,589
I remember thinking,

49
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,724
"Here's someone

50
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,221
who isn't afraid to be happy."

51
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,225
And I fell for you,
right then and there.

52
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,653
I love you.

53
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,652
I love you, too.

54
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,339
Why?

55
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,669
(gasping)

56
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,361
Well?

57
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,612
Heroin overdose.

58
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,946
(Homelander sighs)

59
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,581
I'm sorry to hear that.

60
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,789
And the V?

61
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,788
- She told some guys about it.
- No, no.

62
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,830
I mean you.

63
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,672
(scoffs) Come on, A-Train.

64
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,672
You've been shooting it up
for weeks.

65
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,474
You really think
I wouldn't notice?

66
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,638
I'm done, man.

67
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,428
Nah, I'm fucking,
I'm fucking done.

68
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,261
- Cold turkey.
- Really?

69
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,676
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

70
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,064
Good.

71
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:31,062
Yeah.

72
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,435
You know,

73
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,942
you really screwed up, kiddo.

74
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,111
But you did the right thing
coming to me,

75
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,445
and I'm proud of you.

76
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,660
Thanks, Homelander,

77
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,411
for giving me the chance.

78
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,293
I appreciate it.

79
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,340
Hey. Come on.

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,125
I love you.

81
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,513
We're family.

82
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,260
I'll always be
watching over you.

83
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,887
Always.

84

85
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,599
Oh, and the misplaced

86
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,856
I'll find her.

- Oh, my God.
- (laughs)

a Nikki Minaj thing going on.

121

Oh, yeah, the other one sucks.

122
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,756
They're only letting me
wear this one

123
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,596
because, apparently,
it's family friendly.

You know,
I'm surprised you came.

126
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,516
I seem to remember
you inviting me?

127
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,436
No, I mean,
I'm-I'm glad you came.

you don't really strike me
as the religious type.

Well, yeah, lapsed, but I served

Hi.

00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,964
Okay, so, do you know
everybody here,

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,630
or just, like, 99.9%?

135
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,708
No. My mom and I, um,

136
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,423
we would drive coast to coast
in her brown Honda Civic,

137
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,335
just doing the whole
Christian Circuit thing.

138

142
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,056
the tires off of that car.
These people are like

143
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,692
family to me.

144
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,069
After everything
that's happened,

145
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,357
it's actually...

146
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,451
it's really nice
to see them again.

147
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,698
- Sweetheart.
- (gasps) Mom! Hi.

148
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:11,831
Mm.

149
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,261
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it was a nightmare.

150
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,745
I think we sat on the runway
for 45 minutes,

151
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,167
and then there was all the,
you know, Flight 37 stuff.

152
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,587
But a Xanax and a couple
of Pinot Grigio later,

153
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,667
- here I am.
- (chuckles)

154
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,092
Oh, hello. Uh, do you want
a autograph?

155
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,721
H-Honey, give him an autograph.

156
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,008
Oh, no, no. We...
I mean, I know her.

157
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,512
- I mean, I don't...
- Yeah.

158
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,906
- We know each other. Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,350
- Yeah.
- Oh. Do you work at Vought?

160
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,559
No. No, no, no.

161
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,309
Mom, this is, this is Hughie.

162
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,941
He's... uh, he's a friend.

163
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,607
- Hi.
- Uh, how nice.

164
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,900
Starlight. You hydrating?

165
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,904
Hey, Donna.

166
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,965
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it-it was perfect in every w...

167
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,989
You have that "Teen Roundtable"
in about 15, are you ready?

168
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,345
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, she was born ready.

169
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,619
I should know, I was there.

170
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,002
Great. (laughs)

171
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,868
Um, do you want to come?

172
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,206
Uh... You know what?
I'll let you go ahead.

173
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,382
Go, uh, go roundtable
those teens.

174
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,590
- Mm.
- We'll catch up later?

175
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,630
Yeah, sure.

176
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,431
EZEKIEL:
So, Jesus...

177
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,773
Jesus said, "Hey, bro.

178
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,139
"Hey, bro, bring it in.

179
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,936
"You shouldn't need proof.

180
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,321
"You should just

181
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,648
"believe because I say so,

182
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,744
"because you have

183
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,819
- faith."
- (cheering, applause)

184
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,374
"People who have faith,

185
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,119
those are my peeps, y'all."
That's what Jesus said.

186
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,167
But I am gonna ask you
one question...

187
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,127
Two twats at every entrance,

188
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,127
armed to holy hell. In church.

189
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,550
Well, that's America for you,

190
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,838
isn't it?

191
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,881
And God's watching
from up above.

192
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,675
Right there.

193
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,389
Over there.

194
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,559
BUTCHER:
Yeah.

195
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,096
Security's tighter
than a choir boy's asshole.

196
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,102
So let me ask you something:

197
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:05,194
Why could Jesus walk on water?

198
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,900
Why does Homelander fly?

199
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,531
(cheering, applause)

200
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,238
How about A-Train, why does he
get to run the way he runs?

201
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,867
(crowd gasping)

202
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,369
Or how do I get to hold
the whole world

203
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,285
in my loving embrace?

204
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,455
Why were we chosen?

205
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,424
Because of the Lord.

206
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:36,346
Because we were born
with his power.

207
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,806
Because we believe!

208
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,097
(cheering)

209
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,354
- We believe.
- $15,000

210
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,904
for an exclusive
VIP experience with Ezekiel.

211
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,108
Seriously?

212
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,818
There's not an easier,
cheaper way

213
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,399
for us to get to him?

214
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,775
We ain't getting to Ezekiel.
You are.

215
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,833
- I am?
- Whoa, whoa, wait. What?

216
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,803
- Well, Starlight's one of the headliners, right?
- Wait.

217
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,287
- She'll get you in.
- Whoa.

218
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,459
Look, we've only been on, like,
a date and a half, okay?

219
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,539
I can't just ask her
for a Diamond Club Pass.

220
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,924
What's the matter? You worried

221
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,981
your fake Supe girlfriend's
gonna think you're using her?

222
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,005
Okay, then what?

223
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,509
I just go up to Ezekiel,
"Hey, man. What's up with you

224
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,351
smuggling blue dope
into Chinatown basements?"

225
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,677
Yeah, pretty much.
Once you show him this.

Jesus.

227
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,188
This is from that club
you took me to?

228
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,249
You remembered our first
night together. I'm touched.

229
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,733
Okay, why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this plan?

230
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,646
This kid needs
to be trained up, Butcher.

231
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,164
Yeah. Yeah, what he said.

I-I don't know how

Hughie, you've done a murder.

234
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,540
Comparatively speaking,
this will be a piece of cake.

I know it's kind of

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,949
to love your neighbor.

297
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,950
But if you love your neighbor,

00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,872
don't you want to save them
from damnation?

328
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,237
just call God a C-word?

329
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,717
Yeah. He's got a hard-on
for mass murder

330
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,951
and giving kids cancer,
and his big old answer

331
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,663
to the existential clusterfuck
that is humanity

332
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,035
is to nail his own
bleeding son to a plank.

333
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,292
That is a cunt move.

334
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,769
Come on, even you got to agree
with me there.

335
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,062
- Hey, hey, hey, please...
- We should lob

336
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,897
a fucking nuke at him,
get it over and done with.

337
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,381
- You know what I'm saying?
- We're sorry, sir. We apologize. My man...

338
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,860
All right.
Good talk. Think about it.

339
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,184
- I'm here all day, all right?
- You mind

340
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,531
piping it down
just a little bit? Huh?

341
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,907
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to offend

342
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,181
your inner black Baptist mum
shouting "Praise the Lord."

343
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,805
Fuck you, I'm Episcopalian.

344
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,454
And there's nothing wrong
with having a little church

345
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,018
up in you, you know?

346
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,443
Said the bishop to the nun.
What about you, Hughie?

347
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,862
You believe in God?

348
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,111
I mean, I don't know.

349
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,573
- What? Come off it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

350
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,675
I don't think it's Morgan
Freeman up there or anything,

351
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,119
but it can't all be
random chaos.

352
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,721
So you think that
what happened to Robert

353
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,097
was some kind of
divine intervention?

354
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,831
- Is that what you're saying?
- Come on, Butcher.

355
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,424
(phone rings)

356
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,460
Hang about. Hello?

357
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,474
DONNA: So what were
you supposed to say?

358
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,046
"Yes, I've had premarital sex,
go nuts."

359
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:35,262
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't
supposed to lie to them, Mom.

360
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,055
Aw, baby.

361
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,768
You're Starlight of The Seven.

362
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,519
Millions of kids are looking up
to you now.

363
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,482
You're a shining light to them.

364
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,362
How am I supposed
to live up to that?

365
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,399
Because that's the way
God made you.

366
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,164
You're a miracle.
You're my miracle.

367
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,411
Hey... hey, you two.
How's it going?

368
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,751
You know what?
I'll, I'll catch up.

369
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,037
- DONNA: You sure?
- Don't worry, I'll be right there.

370
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,710
DONNA:
Mm-hmm.

371
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,039
Keep an eye on the lad,
all right?

372
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,134
Where the fuck are you going?

373
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,801
Just do it.

374
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,009
STARLIGHT:
Yeah.

375
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,009
- You okay?
- Fine.

376
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,433
It's just... this place isn't
what I remember.

377
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,515
Hey...

378
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,988
Hughie?

379
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,370
Hey, can I ask you something?

380
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,248
Anything.

381
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,906
Is there any way you could
hook me up with one of those

382
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,746
Diamond Club Passes?

383
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,751
You know, to-to see Ezekiel?

384
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,383
I mean, I couldn't get one
unless I robbed a bank.

385
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,210
But... you know.

386
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,086
Ezekiel?

387
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,052
Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay.

388
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,354
Confession time. My dad is,
like, Ezekiel's number one fan.

389
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,979
Hmm.

390
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,306
So what do you think?

391
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,312
Pull a few strings, you know?

392
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,024
Hook me up with some tickets?

393
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,439
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,526
Sure, of course.

395
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,583
- It's the least I can do.
- Thank you.

396
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,917
- (cheering, applause)
- Good to see you!

397
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,550
Thanks, guys. Oh!
How are you, girls?

398
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,129
Hey, pal, how are you?
How are you?

399
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,013
Great, thanks for coming along.

400
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,890
- God bless you guys!
- Thanks!

401
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,557
God bless you one and all!

402
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,177
Take care now.
Keep believing, ha-ha.

403
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,635
Grab Madelyn.

404
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,746
I need to talk to her about
these fucking talking points.

405
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,820
Um... uh...
(chuckles nervously)

406
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,168
Ms. Stillwell isn't here today.
I thought that you knew that.

407
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,902
But I'm here to help you
with anything,

408
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,954
I'll go through the talk...

409
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,827
Ashley?

410
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,367
Where is she?

411
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,165
(whooshing)

412
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,184
What are you doing here?

413
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,178
Skipping work now?

414
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,769
I am taking Teddy
to the pediatrician.

415
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,056
Maybe reschedule it.

416
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,439
I've already rescheduled
three times.

417
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,807
What is the emergency?

418
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,903
My speech.

419
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,229
- Your speech?
- Yes. My speech.

420
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,033
It reads like corporate
fucking mayonnaise.

421
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:38,447
We're talking Believe here.
These are my people.

422
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,568
But you're not just
talking to them.

423
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,985
Every dove and Democrat
in Congress

424
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,994
is going to be
watching you on CNN.

425
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,430
- You need to appear moderate...
- No.

426
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,714
- Humble.
- No!

427
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,037
You... There is
an opportunity here.

428
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,504
People are scared.
They don't trust Washington

429
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,795
or the coastal elite,
and they hate foreigners.

430
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,050
What they want is a little
John Wayne frontier justice.

431
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,965
And that is what I do.

432
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:13,226
Don't forget... it was me that
saved that Flight 37 thing.

433
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,072
I turned that into a win.
For us.

434
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,359
You're really gonna talk to me
about "saving" Flight 37? Ha-ha.

435
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,124
Well, why wouldn't I?

436
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,236
Look, can I please just
talk to you later?

437
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,454
The speech is perfect.

438
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,584
- Trust me.
- Trust you.

439
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,541
Okay.
That's what you always say.

440
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,059
- Come here.
- You're not even fucking listening to me.

441
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,213
You're so full of shit!

442
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,001
You say you want my input,

443
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,094
but you don't.

444
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,089
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

445
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,971
- And you never did.
- I do. Can we please just talk later?

446
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,270
Why? You gonna run off
and play "strong single mom"?

447
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,306
Please...

448
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,691
That baby is an accessory.

449
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,775
We need boundaries.

450
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,437
(car alarm chirps)

451
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,782
(Teddy crying)

452
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,163
(laughing)

453
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,169
(knocking on door)

454
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,929
Hey, Billy.

455
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,514
Rachel.

456
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,432
(Rachel sighs)

457
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,766
Just took a lovely little stroll
around St. John's.

458
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,232
And you'll never guess
what I happened across.

459
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,777
Who told you?

460
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,360
Well, I'll tell you who didn't
fucking tell me.

461
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,946
Me own fucking sister-in-law.

462
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,331
Would you like some tea?

463
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,038
I got the English stuff.

464
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,786
When'd you do it?

465
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,174
Last Sunday.

466
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,463
We used your last name.

467
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,876
We said "beloved wife."

468
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,054
You buried an empty
fucking coffin?

469
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,303
We didn't bury anything.
Just, um, a headstone.

470
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,074
Well, that's a sick fucking joke
then, isn't it?

471
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,348
And you're wondering why we
didn't tell you. (chuckles)

472
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,482
Look...

473
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,270
my mom's getting old.

474
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,324
She just wants a place to talk
to her daughter.

475
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,358
Yeah, well, she's talking
to dirt, isn't she?

476
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,571
- It's something.
- No.

477
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,992
It's fucking nothing.

478
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,780
It's nothing, 'cause there's
nothing fucking down there.

479
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,615
And for all you know, Rebecca's
still out there somewhere,

480
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,451
and you put up
a fucking headstone.

481
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:34,456
Stop!

482
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,747
You need to stop.

483
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,671
It has been eight years since
she's been missing.

484
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,170
The cops never found anything.
You never found anything.

485
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,675
She's not alive.

486

She got killed
or she killed herself.

You watch your fucking mouth.

488

You're not the only one
whose life was ruined.

489
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:59,022
She is my sister,
and I love her.

490
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,233
But she's gone.

491
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,487
We need this to be over.

You got the right

I did not kill your partner.

This guy's got 34 addresses

Right?
You're Starlight's friend.

She got you in here.

526
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,451
- Yeah.
- (chuckling): There you go.

527
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,292

Good to meet you, pal.

How do you know Starlight?

Uh, you know, we met, um,
like, a few weeks ago, actually.

531
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,375
- Really?
- Yeah.

532
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,682
- And she got you in here?
- Yeah, I guess she did.

533
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,637
Oh, this is a
pricey ticket, Hughie.

534
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,597
You must be a special guy.

535
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,769
I... no. No, I'm not...

536
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,438
I just feel lucky
to be here. Really.

537
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,896
EZEKIEL:
Um, ladies and gentlemen,

538
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,687
uh, I would like to welcome you
one and all.

539
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:51,442
And I would very much like to
welcome... Homelander,

540
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,485
our special guest.

541
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:56,868
(applause)

542
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:02,201
So, without further ado,

543
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,456
if you would follow me.

544
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,713
Gather round, everybody.

545
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,375
Now, as many of you
may already know,

546
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:18,264
Homelander is an ordained
minister in Samaritan's Embrace.

547
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:24,354
Together, we will be rebaptizing
you, my most loyal followers.

548
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,072
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

549
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,357
- and Jesus Christ his son?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

550
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,112
Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

551
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,315
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

552
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,704
- Oh!
- Your sins have been purged.

553
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,956
Christ be with you.

554
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:51,879
On this blessed day,
you will be reborn a Christian.

555
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:54,881
You will be washed clean
of all your sins.

556
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,432
Something wrong, Hughie?

557
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:08,154
No. No, I'm-I'm
totally comfortable.

558
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,647
Why-why would you ask that?

559
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,528
Well, your blood pressure's
150/90. It's a bit high.

560
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,067
Yeah, sorry. Just, um...

561
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,282
I'm afraid of water.

562
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,741
(chuckles)
Don't panic.

563
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,663
I got you.

564
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,791
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

565
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,331
and Jesus...

566
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,785
as his son?

567
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,712
Yes.

568
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:39,135
Hmm. Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

569
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,426
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

570
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,438
(coughing)

571
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,074
God bless.

572
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,576
Thank you all once again
for allowing me to be a part

573
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,328
of this beautiful occasion.

574
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,080
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good night.

575
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,503
See you, friend.

576
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,131
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

577
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,708
May the light of God
shine in your lives.

578
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,050
Excuse me, sir.

579
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,841
Uh, may I speak with you
just for a moment?

580
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,646
- Sorry, son, I got a packed schedule.
- All right, I understand, sir,

581
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,639
but it's just,
I need your guidance.

582
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,141
I need Christ's guidance.

583
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,734
What is it?

584
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,098
Just hold on... one second.

585
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,686
Let me just show you something.

586
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,987
(chuckles)
What's wrong?

587
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,033
Uh...

588
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,456
You fucked me.

589
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,577
What?

590
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,044
Yeah, in a private Supe club.

591
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,593
You know the one on East 29th?
Secret Lair,

592
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,272
- I think it's called?
- Don't know it. Nope.

593
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,940
- There were three of us?
- You've got nothing...

594
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,884
- Oiled up, and you...
- This...

595
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,069
...wrapped your stretchy arms
around me, and it was, it was

596
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:07,143
so fucking hot, and...
your dick was so... perfect.

597
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,271
And long and... stretchy.

598
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,479
And you... you played
my butt like jazz.

599
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:18,191
With poise and skill and...
willingness to improvise.

600
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,317
(choking)

601
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,332
You come in here.

602
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,963
You try to talk to me?

603
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,249
- (choking)
- Like this?

604
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,053
You are a filthy, filthy liar.

605
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,218
- You are unclean.
- I have a video.

606
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,837
- I have a video.
- What?

607
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,433
I have a video
of the three of us...

608
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,849
sucking and fucking.

609
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,757
And if you don't let me go,

610
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,516
my friend puts the video online.

611
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:51,888
Like that.

612
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,274
(grunting)

613
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,362
(gasps, coughs)

614
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,125
What do you want?
You want a little bit of money?

615
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,439
Are you here for money?

616
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,904
You ship boxes labeled
as polio vaccine

617
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,105
but they're not really
polio vaccine, are they?

618
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,025
(panting)
They're Compound V.

619
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,248
- Who the hell are you?
- I want to know everything about 'em.

620
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,668
Okay? You tell me, you tell me
where they're going.

621
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,877
And you tell me
how many boxes you ship.

622
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,667
No.

623
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,631
No, they will destroy me.

624
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,381
Who's "they"? Vought?

625
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,636
Here's how this is gonna go.

626
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,507
You're gonna tell me,

627
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,514
or that video...

628
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,176
trends, number one on Twitter.

629
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,684
Tonight.

630
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,146
And you're also gonna stop

631
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,726
the fucking
"pray the gay away" shit.

632
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,612
Anyway, it's your choice.

633
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,651
(phone ringing)

634
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,244
Hello?

635
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:53,414
Hey, um, so that wasn't
a piece of cake.

636
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:54,874
Hughie, that you?
You all right?

637
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,673
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, sorry.

638
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,997
I had to, had to borrow a phone.
Thanks again.

639
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,053
I got baptized.

640
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,546
Yeah. It's a long story.

641
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,129
Blackmailing somebody
is not cake, okay?

642
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,715
It is weird, it's scary,
you wind up

643
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,196
- just saying shit.
- Okay, but did you

644
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,406
get him to talk?
What'd he say?

645
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,640
Uh, yeah, yeah.

646
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,200
I mean, you-you know
that charity of his?

647
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,734
Samaritan's Embrace?

648
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,188
- Right.
- All right.

649
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,897
So what they do is they take
boxes full of that stuff

650
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,068
and they ship it to hospitals
all across the country.

651
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,477
And apparently the latest one

652
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,485
is going to the NICU
at Mercer Hospital.

653
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,987
It's, uh,
i-it's midtown, I think.

654
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,660
You are a natural, kid.
You're like the fucking...

655
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,199
Rain Man of fucking people over.

656
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,242
(chuckles) Not a compliment.

657
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,732
(grunting)

658
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,530
(grunts)

659
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,566
(panting)

660
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,655
- Hey!
- Cool your jets, guv.

661
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:14,539
- It's not a hate crime.
- (phone ringing)

662
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,869
M.M.? All right.

663
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,293
(laughs) Fucking brilliant.

664
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,915
I'll meet you at the hospital
in half an hour.

665
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,923
HOMELANDER:
Let's hear it for Jesus.

666
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,336
- (cheering)
- Yes!

667
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,755
One more for the guy upstairs!

668
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,515
(Homelander laughs)

669
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,557
Oh, I love you guys.
Let me tell you something.

670
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,270
I am so thrilled to be here.

671
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,940
Truthfully. Are you?

672
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,559
- (cheering)
- Yeah?

673
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:47,145
A terrible tragedy
befell our nation this week.

674
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,782
Terrible.

675
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,779
And let's not mince words
about this.

676
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:55,081
We... were... attacked.

677
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,447
(cheering)

678
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,753
America was attacked.

679
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,707
(cheering)

680
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,418
Some people...

681
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,459
...they want me
to come out here

682
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,012
and speak empty platitudes
to you all.

683
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,216
A little bit of corporate talk.

684
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,717
But I don't want to do that.

685
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,600
I can't do that.

686
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,006
You want to know why?

687
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,354
CROWD:
Why?

688
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,689
Because I believe
that what God wants me to do

689
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,097
is get on over there,
find the filthy bastards

690
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,606
that masterminded this...
whatever cave they're in...

691
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,988
and introduce them to a little
thing called God's judgment!

692
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,027
- (cheering)
- That's what I think!

693
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,744
Sounds like
the American thing to do!

694
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,624
Sounds like
the right thing to do.

695
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,581
But no. No, no, no, no, no.

696
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:46,923
Apparently, I got to wait
for Congress to say it's okay.

697
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,920
(crowd booing)

698
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,302
HOMELANDER:
Right?

699
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,469
I say I answer to a higher law.

700
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,969
- (cheering)
- Wasn't I chosen to save you?

701
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,523
- (cheering)
- Is it not my God-given purpose

702
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,188
to protect the United States
of America?

703
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,228
(cheering)

704
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,403
CROWD (chanting):
Homelander! Homelander!

705
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,153
- Homelander! Homelander!
- Psalm!

706
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,066
58:10!

707
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,584
"The righteous shall rejoice

708
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,367
"when he sees the vengeance

709
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,791
"and he will bathe his feet

710
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,540
in the blood of the wicked."

711
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,094
(cheering continues)

712
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,667
MAN:
Homelander!

713
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,093
CROWD (chanting):
Homelander! Homelander!

714
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,803
(chanting continues)

715
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,805
Motherfucker.

716
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,098
(exhales deeply)

717
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,403
(sighs)

718
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,057
(knock on door)

719
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,280
Hey.

720
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,411
Maeve, what, uh...

721
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,657
- Sorry, what are you...?
- I was, um, stopping a mugging

722
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,413
nearby and I...

723
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,173
It's good to see you.

724
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,883
Can I come in?

725
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,934
Uh... okay. (scoffs)

726
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,517
Where's Freckles?

727
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,441
Freckles died two years ago.

728
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,654
Look, uh, I'm kind of busy,

729
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,953
so, um, maybe give me a call,

730
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,487
call first, next time?

731
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,780
Elena, you don't
have to be like this.

732
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,454
Well, you show up out of nowhere

733
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,202
asking about
the goddamn cat, so...

734
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,749
You've been drinking.

735
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,710
- No.
- (Elena scoffs)

736
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,841
You're not going
to meetings anymore.

737
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,418
Uh, listen...
(chuckles, sniffles)

738
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,053
Water under the bridge.

739
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,050
I miss you.

740
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,845
You don't get to say that to me.

741
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,770
Leave, please.

742
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:10,018
Elena, I haven't seen you
in years.

743
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,482
I mean...

744
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,781
- wouldn't it be nice...
- I see you every day.

745
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,686
Every time I walk through
Times Square

746
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,235
or turn on the fucking TV.

747
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,199
I'm out of your life.

748
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,819
You never left mine.

749
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,581
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm really sorry.

750
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,634
- I didn't mean...
- I don't want your apology, okay?

751
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,879
I want you to get out.

752
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,721
Okay? I want you to go back
to your ivory penthouse

753
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:42,257
where you can drink
and fuck whoever you want.

754
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,262
Go back to Homelander.

755
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,975
(laughs softly)

756
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:55,482
I can't go back.

757
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,494
Oh... (sniffles)

758
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,369
- Oh...
- Maeve?

759
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,987
It's too hard.

760
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,664
- What happened?
- It's just too hard.

761
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,825
Tell me what happened.

762
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,883
(sniffles)
I keep thinking about all...

763
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,168
- all those people.
- It's okay. You'll figure it out.

764
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,212
Okay? You'll figure it out.

765
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,216
- You always know what to do.
- (sobbing)

766
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,298
You always know
what to do, okay?

767
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,763
- I don't know. They don't...
- So just tell me what happened.

768
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,215
(sniffles)

769
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,675
Tell me what happened.

770
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,309
Uh...

771
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,265
I don't know, Maeve,
if this is...

772
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,315
- Come on.
- No. No, this is...

773
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,199
You're obviously...
No, I said stop it.

774
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,988
(exhales)

775
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,169
All right, just...

776
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,127
- just talk to me.
- (sniffles)

777
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,589
Okay? Just tell me
what happened.

778
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,589
Yeah, this, um...

779
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,425
this was a mistake.

780
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,101
No, just talk to me.
Just tell me what...

781
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,310
If you... (groans)

782
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,031
(phone vibrating)

783
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,584
- Allo?
- CHERIE: They're coming.

784
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:29,657
They're on to you, babe.

785
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,751
Black Noir was outside
my apartment.

786
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,907
What location?

787
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,785
Which addresses do they have?

788
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,132
If they got to my place,

789
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,497
all of them.

790
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,386
So, you want to pay me

791
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,432
the professional courtesy
and tell me

792
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,146
where the hell
you disappeared to before?

793
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,017
I just had to pop down
to the shop.

794
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,154
I was running a bit low on
mind your own fucking business.

795
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,236
(phone ringing)

796
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,825
This better be good.

797
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,116
I'm burned.

798
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,869
What? Fucking hell,
Frenchie. How?

799
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,201
I don't know.

800
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,576
What about the rest of us?

801
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,622
Your concern for me
is very sweet.

802
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,246
Maybe, maybe not.

803
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,422
So far, they only seem to be

804
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,011
hitting my places.
I'm taking off.

805
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,257
- What about the girl?
- Fucking leave her.

806
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,394
God knows
what they'll do to her.

807
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,508
Supe-on-Supe violence
ain't our concern, mate.

808
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,056
Butcher.

809
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,019
I said fucking leave her.

810
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,939
Merde.

811
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,436
Burnt.

812
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:56,909
It was the Heartland Beauties
"Luck of the Irish" pageant.

813
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,955
The lights went out on stage

814
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,919
and this one lit up the room
with the glow from her hands.

815
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,880
The show must go on. Hmm?

816
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,461
That's so sweet.

817
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,926
- 15 minutes, Starlight.
- I'm sorry, could you, could you

818
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,587
just give us one minute, please?

819
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,845
MAN (over P.A.):
Starlight will begin shortly.

820
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,678
Please go to the main stage.

821
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,685
Mom, I can't do this.

822
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,268
A-Are you sick?
What's wrong?

823
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,153
No, it just doesn't feel right.

824
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,480
- What does that mean?
- Honestly...

825
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,065
I really thought that being here
would feel like it used to,

826
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,701
but it doesn't.

827
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,658
It's changed,
or maybe I've changed.

828
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,448
But...

829
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:38,872
Mom, these past few months...

830
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,670
Mm-mm.

831
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:48,171
No, tell them I'm not going on.

832
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:49,835
Honey.

833
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,223
I've waited 23 years for this.

834
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,973
This isn't...

835
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,635
this isn't about you.

836
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,393
Isn't it?

837
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,305
I mean, I-I kept your secret,

838
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,564
scrimped by selling houses,

839
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,776
took you to all the Supe events.

840
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,700
Please.

841
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,617
All my friends
are gonna be watching on TV.

842
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,447
Please?

843
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,079
They're coming for me,
mon coeur.

844
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,634
(zipper closes)

845
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,838
The Supes.

846
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,508
I've been ordered to leave you
here for them to find.

847
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,797
And Monsieur Charcuter,
you know,

848
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,011
he knows I'll comply,
that's how he sees me.

849
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,103
Like this mad bastard,

850
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,138
only good for hurting
or killing, you know?

851
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,892
Like a gun, he takes me,

852
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,814
points me in a direction
and fires.

853
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,153
It's not who I am.

854
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,939
(chains rattle)

855
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,483
It's not who you are, either.

856
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,816
We're the same, you and I.
Like eggs.

857
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,781
Hard outside, soft inside...
or pineapples, perhaps.

858
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,445
Whatever those bastards
got planned for you,

859
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,833
you don't deserve it, mon coeur.

860
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,912
(chuckles softly)

861
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,955
NEWSWOMAN:
The Deep finds himself

862
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,592
in hot water following
a harebrained attempt

863
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,509
to free a dolphin
from Oceanland.

864
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,799
Insiders say when police
tried to intercept

865
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,973
the hijacked van,
Deep lost control

866
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,182
of the vehicle and crashed,

867
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:04,062
catapulting the dolphin
through the front windshield

868
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,640
onto the road,
where it was run over

869
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,056
- by an 18...
- Hello there, Believe Expo!

870
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,645
(crowd cheering)

871
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:17,952
I am so honored
to be here tonight.

872
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,619
Did you know
that my first public appearance

873
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,158
was right here
on this very stage

874
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:26,374
with Ezekiel
and the rest of the family?

875
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,044
(cheering)

876
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,716
Today, I wanted
to share with you

877
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,427
how I accepted Christ...

878
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:41,138
as my personal savior.

879
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,179
(cheering)

880
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,940
How His way is the only way...

881
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,978
(applause, cheering)

882
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,778
Uh... (exhales)

883
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,284
Just...

884
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,365
just please stop the music.

885
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,212
- Please stop.
- (music stops)

886
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,710
(mouthing)

887
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:19,380
You want me to just suck it up
and do this for you?

888
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,262
Hmm?

889
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,433
You have no idea
what you're really asking.

890
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:30,648
You have no idea
what I've been through.

891
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,106
(groans softly)

892
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:41,782
Every single word that I say up
here, I'm reading from a script.

893
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,163
I didn't write
any of these words.

894
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,290
I don't even know
if I believe in them.

895
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:50,037
I mean, I believe in God,
I love God so much, but...

896
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,711
(chuckles)

897
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:57,339
Honestly, it's...
it's just how goddamn certain

898
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,380
everyone is around here.

899
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,925
I mean, tickets start at,
what, 170 bucks,

900
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:07,639
so that these people can tell
you how to get to heaven?

901
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,312
How do they know?
How does anybody know?

902
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:14,771
When the Bible was written, life
expectancy was 30 years old.

903
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:19,114
I mean, I'm not so sure you're
supposed to take it literally.

904
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:22,202
It also says
that it's a sin to eat shrimp.

905
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,658
What, if you're gay
or if you're Gandhi,

906
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,449
you're going to hell? I mean...

907
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,664
And if you have sex
before marriage,

908
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,464
that's, that's not immoral.

909
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,129
That's human.

910
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,745
What's immoral

911
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,925
is the guy who shoved
his dick in my face.

912
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,086
(crowd gasping)

913
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,595
- Shit.
- Shit.

914
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,813
(exhales)

915
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,362
Here's the truth.

916
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,030
Anyone who tells you they know
the answers is lying.

917
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:05,992
And I know, I know,
I'm supposed to be

918
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,122
this hero-idol-symbol-whatever,

919
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,540
but I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

920
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:18,421
I'm just as scared and confused
as the rest of you.

921
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:22,091
I'm done pretending,

922
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,801
and I'm done
taking any more shit.

923
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,888
Thank you.

924
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,614
Excuse me.

925
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,839
Jackpot.

926
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,717
Compound V?
Oh, yeah, and lots of it.

927
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,260
Oh, my God.

928
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,887
Jesus.

929
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,064
That's a fucking baby Supe.

930
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,072
Chosen by God, my ass.

931
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,741
These cunts are made
in a fucking lab.

932
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,913
Hey.

933
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,165
Hey, easy.

934
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,166
That-that was a great speech.

935
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,130
I mean, come on... I mean,

936
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,961
know your audience,
but that was, like,

937
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:48,256
that was Joel at the Garden.
That was...

938
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:52,061
I am so glad you enjoyed it.

939
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:56,556
I'm so glad. How was your
quality time with Ezekiel? Huh?

940
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,231
Any more VIP tickets
I can get for you?

941
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,650
Because I'm so here for you.

942
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,230
- It's not like that.
- You sure?

943
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,355
'Cause I can get you
a commemorative cup.

944
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,702
Or I can get you
an Ezekiel figurine,

945
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:11,948
- or a goodie bag.
- My girlfriend died.

946
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,789
What?

947
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,208
Happened not too long ago,

948
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,037
and I came here
looking for a way

949
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,343
to get out of the shit
that I'm in right now.

950
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:26,007
And that wasn't fair to you,
and I'm so sorry.

951
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:33,678
I really don't think
there's anything

952
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:37,681
that can help it anymore
or fix it...

953
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,135
or make it better.

954
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:46,233
And everything I heard here?

955
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,105
Well, that helped
a total of jack shit.

956
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,367
(chuckles, sniffles)

957
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,197
Except for what you said.

958
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:58,502
I mean, you're right,
there's... nobody knows.

959
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:00,516
And that's the only fucking
thing I've heard all day

960
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,500
that's made any sense at all,

961
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,383
and that is
the God's honest truth.

962
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,064
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

963
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,102
I'm sorry.

964
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,267
MOTHER'S MILK: Okay, easy with that.
You get some air in there,

965
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,751
you could kill the kid.

966
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,842
Well, wouldn't that
be a crying shame?

967
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,208
All right.

968
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,835
Let's bugger off.

969
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,882
All right.

970
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,177
Hey!

971
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,765
Hey, keep them busy.

972
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,908
Watch and learn, son.

973
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,007
BUTCHER:
Hey.

974
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,547
Hey.

975
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:38,179
(laughs)
Holy fuck.

976
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:41,181
That was diabolical.

977
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,354
(laughs)

978
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,692
You little fucking beauty.

979
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,769
(panting)

980
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,404
You done good, lad.

981
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,203
- Come on, Butcher, it's time to go.
- Yeah.

982
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,828
Now, you keep
your nose clean, sunshine,

983
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,370
or I'll come back and stomp you.

984
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:10,999
Holy smokes, Starlight shocking
the Christian community

985
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,415
during her address
at Believe Expo,

986
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,264
when she questioned
her faith in...

987
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,314
I see you.

988
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,397
I know you're watching me.

989
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,438
You've been out there
quite a lot lately.

990
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:36,403
Always watching.

991
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,195
So why don't you
just come on inside?

992
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,790
You afraid of me?

993
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,287
(scoffs)

994
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:49,708
(door opens)

995
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,375
Come in.

996
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,468
(door closes)

997
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,692
Have I not been paying
enough attention to you?

998
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,897
Are you lonely?

999
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:15,479
It must be hard,
feeling so alone.

1000
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:20,534
I'm sorry...

1001
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:27,542
...but you cannot
give a speech like that.

1002
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,000
You cannot be bad.

1003
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,042
(clears throat softly)

1004
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,371
Come here.

1005
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,226
You have to be good.

1006
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,230
And you have to listen to me.

1007
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,033
And then we both
can get what we want.

1008
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,785
(exhales)

1009
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,999
That's good.

1010
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,127
