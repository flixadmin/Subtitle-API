3
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,500
Bava, these bank guys…

4
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,666
If we come on time,
they say it's tea break,

5
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,000
and if we're late,
they say it's lunch break.

6
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:51,958
Let's hurry up.

7
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,666
Here’s the money you asked for, sir.

8
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,958
- Hey!
- Hey, who are you guys?

9
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,958
Bava!

10
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,625
{\an8}- Chalapathi!
- Four million, man. Hey, give me the bag!

11
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,583
Hand it over!

12
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,708
- Four million…
- Give it to me.

13
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,375
{\an8}Bava…

14
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,625
The money…

15
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,708
I knew about 24-carat gold,

16
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,791
but he is a 24-carat character, Bava.

17
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,583
What a good time!
You're getting a son-in-law who can fight.

18
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,291
For the first time,
I'm feeling sad about being born as a man.

19
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,916
Had I been born as a woman…

20
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,500
He has done what even our own people
wouldn’t dare to do.

21
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,791
- Yes.
- He is our son-in-law.

22
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,041
- You can fix it.
- What?

23
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,250
Trust me!

24
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,666
How about caste, family, and status?

25
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,208
Bava, you can adjust all that
if you get a guy with talent and timing.

26
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,208
The money is safe.

27
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,875
I can’t believe
someone like you exists these days.

28
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,666
You helped us just in time, sir.

29
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,791
- Many thanks, sir…
- Never mind. I hate praises.

30
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,083
It’s easy to earn money,

31
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,125
but very difficult to protect it.
Please take care of it.

32
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,250
All that is fine, but what is your caste?

33
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,083
I know pancakes and <i>dosas.</i>
Now what is this?

34
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,750
- Never heard of it.
- Your full name, by the way?

35
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,000
Parvataneni Papa Rao.
They gave me my grandfather’s name.

36
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,625
He is our Parvataneni…

37
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,083
- So, Kammas?
- No, Chowdarys.

38
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,208
It’s all the same. We are all one.

39
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,333
See? My parents raised me
without even knowing what my caste was!

40
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,125
It’s okay, son.

41
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,125
Innocent parents.

42
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,333
- What do you do, son?
- I cleared the group exams.

43
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,541
Awaiting the posting.

44
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,666
My family is looking for a bride for me.

45
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,375
- Ask them to stop.
- Why?

46
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,833
Bava, we should catch the young
by the net.

47
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,916
Hello, man, you're coming over
for a match meeting at our house tomorrow.

48
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,625
Tomorrow? What about my family?

49
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,583
You are coming with all of them
to our house to see our girl.

50
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,041
Okay, as you wish.

51
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,041
{\an8}Please come. Welcome.
Glad you're on time.

52
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,125
{\an8}Of course, we came.

53
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,833
But why is this match meeting
arranged in an outhouse?

54
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,416
- Sister…
- No, ma’am. It’s our house.

55
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,833
Looks like our outhouse.

56
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,208
Are you sure they will match our status?

57
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,916
- Go in now…
- Please come in.

58
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,208
This house was built 100 years ago.

59
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,500
Couldn’t you buy another house
in the last 100 years?

60
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,625
Sister…

61
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,125
Brother, I'm checking about their assets.
Shouldn’t I?

62
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:34,041
Sister, not sure. For me, the smile
that never fades is the best property.

63
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,208
Looks like our son-in-law
has modern thoughts.

64
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,166
It’s not enough to have modern thoughts.

65
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,083
We should also check out financially.
That’s why we came.

66
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,500
What business are you in?

67
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,458
We have been in the
tobacco business for ages.

68
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,791
We are good until people stop smoking.

69
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,250
- How about you?
- We are in the incense business.

70
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,875
We are also good
until people stop inhaling, Uncle.

71
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,541
Why delay then?
Let’s call the girl. What do you say?

72
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,250
- Sister…
- Brother…

73
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
The girl.

74
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:58,916
I can see.

75
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,458
Oh, God!

76
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,166
- Sister, are you okay?
- What is this?

77
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,333
Steel glasses. New ones.
We just bought these for you.

78
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,500
Does steel glass look like this?

79
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,375
We only use silver glasses at home.

80
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,291
We gave steel glasses
to our servants 25 years ago.

81
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,750
Don’t counter, Bava. Rich people…

82
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,666
- Elder daughter-in-law, Suhasini.
- 85 kg.

83
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,416
- Second daughter-in-law, Paddu.
- 76 kg.

84
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,208
What about the younger daughter-in-law?

85
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,916
A total of 110 kg.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,750
We are superior in this matter.

87
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,333
Don’t get confused, Mr. Chalapathi.

88
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,083
My sister wasn't just talking
about their weight,

89
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,958
but also the gold they brought as dowry.

90
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,750
- Sister, take over now.
- Brother, thanks.

91
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,041
Let me tell you all openly.

92
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,833
We are from Bezawada.

93
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,541
We are very particular
about customs and manners.

94
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,208
Of course, we know that!

95
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,875
Bezawada means the Goddess
on top of the hill. And below--

96
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,541
Bava! No controversies, Bava.

97
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,166
So, you were saying something.

98
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,708
Listen. As per our custom,

99
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,583
we weigh the girl
during the match meeting,

100
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,958
and she brings gold worth her weight.

101
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,416
God, save me.

102
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,208
She is already heavy.
On top of it, weighing her!

103
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,708
You have no choice, sir.

104
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,416
Anyway, you need to pay after the wedding.
Consider it an advance booking.

105
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,875
Trust me!
We are okay with your challenge!

106
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,083
Here’s a 22-carat gold coin.

107
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,041
Seven-week ornaments.

108
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,416
Gold biscuits from Bombay.

109
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,250
These all are from Bengal.

110
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,583
Forget about weighing her.
The needle isn’t even moving.

111
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,666
Hey, Mr. Gold?
Don’t you have more gold at home?

112
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,708
It’s okay.
We’ll make up the difference with cash.

113
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,458
Glad you said that.
Hey, bring the cash.

114
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,500
Here is the money my Bava earned
from the tobacco business.

115
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,750
Well done!

116
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,791
- Jhansi ma'am!
- Sir!

117
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,583
Seize everything and seal it.

118
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,666
- I will sign and stamp it.
- Okay, sir.

119
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,541
We’re from the Income Tax Department.

120
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,333
You said they were our people
and made them part of the family.

121
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,333
Now everything is ruined!

122
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,541
Bava!

123
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,041
Stop the car.

124
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,875
- Do you need a lift, my son?
- Yes, of course.

125
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,000
Please get in.

126
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,708
Politicians don’t give
anything even if we ask.

127
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,708
You’re giving a lift without even asking.

128
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,750
We’re not able to give anything
to the people after being in power,

129
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,083
so I thought I’d at least give a lift.

130
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,416
You drive.

131
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,875
What do you do, man?

132
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,333
Should we have tea somewhere?

133
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,541
{\an8}I was an IT officer until yesterday, sir.

134
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,166
{\an8}So, if you were
an income tax officer until yesterday,

135
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,958
{\an8}something happened yesterday.

136
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,375
What was it?

137
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,291
Morning…

138
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,791
Good morning, Jhansi ma’am.

139
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,375
What happened, Murthy sir?

140
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,666
He could have become a son-in-law,

141
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,291
but now he’s getting insulted.

142
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,875
Just because you have power in hand,
do you think you can go to anyone’s house?

143
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,666
Do you know who Mr. Jagga Rao is?

144
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,083
Officer, don’t tell him anything about me.

145
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,708
He’ll understand on his own soon.

146
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,791
Sure, sir.

147
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,541
Apologize to him if you want to
at least keep your job.

148
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,500
After doing a few raids
and achieving success in his career,

149
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,208
he started seeing stars,
his head held high.

150
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,750
I’ll bring him down.
I’ll bring everything down today.

151
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,708
Okay, your wish.

152
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,875
Stop!

153
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,083
What happened to your manhood?

154
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,875
Are you ashamed to touch my feet
in front of everyone?

155
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,125
Not acceptable.

156
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:19,291
Everyone in your department should know
what happens if someone targets me.

157
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,958
What is this, sir?

158
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,416
A tribute to honesty.

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,250
Watch and learn.

160
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,291
Take off my sandal with your hand
and lean your head against my leg.

161
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,833
Then I’ll think about your job.

162
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,125
Oh, God!

163
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,250
Oh, God!

164
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,166
How could you beat such a powerful man?

165
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:48,875
This is how.

166
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,666
Now you can wear them, sir. Wear them.

167
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,166
What? Powerful?

168
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,500
In what way?

169
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,916
No matter how many millions he has,

170
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,208
he got beaten with a sandal by a guy
earning four thousand rupees a month.

171
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,041
Is he powerful, or am I?

172
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,541
What did you say?

173
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,083
That I got an attitude
after a few successful raids?

174
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,291
Success and failures are visitors.

175
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,833
They come and go.

176
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,041
Attitude is like our surname.

177
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,375
It stays with us until we die.

178
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,458
Krishna Murthy sir, give me a cigarette.

179
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,625
Sir, in here?

180
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,666
Doesn’t matter where,
after getting suspended.

181
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,458
By the way,
my name isn’t Parvataneni Papa Rao.

182
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,250
Bachchan.

183
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,500
Mr. Bachchan.

184
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,208
You must have heard the name.

185
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,416
Now you’ll remember it.

186
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,875
It’s not poverty
that afflicts this country, sir.

187
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,666
It’s black money.

188
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,916
And if the poor man is suffering,
it’s because of black money.

189
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,250
Still, if the country is running fine,
it’s because of sincere officers like you.

190
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,333
Sincere officers aren’t enough, sir.

191
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,916
We need sincere politicians.

192
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,333
{\an8}Noted, sir.

193
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,625
By the way, why is your name Mr. Bachchan?

194
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,375
- Are you North Indian?
- Nothing like that, sir.

195
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,833
We’re pure Telugu, from Andhra Pradesh.

196
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,875
Do you know what happened on August 15th?

197
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,708
I’m a politician, and you’re asking me?

198
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,458
You are talking about August 15th, 1947.

199
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,125
I’m talking about August 15th, 1975.

200
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,083
That day, <i>Sholay</i> released
in 70mm stereophonic sound.

201
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,708
- So?
- Our lives changed from that day.

202
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,208
My father is a big fan of <i>Sholay.</i>

203
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,750
It's time for the show.

204
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,166
<i>He watched it at least 100 times.</i>

205
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,041
LAKSHMI TOURING TALKIES

206
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,250
<i>Sholay…</i> what a movie!

207
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,916
And my father came home in that madness…

208
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,708
My son, from today,
your name is Amitabh Bachchan.

209
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,250
Daddy, my name is Anand,
not Amitabh Bachchan.

210
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,416
Then you’re Anand Bachchan.

211
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,791
- And your friend’s name is Veeru.
- Me?

212
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,291
- And you?
- Thakur. Thakur of Ramgarh.

213
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,458
- What kind of name is that?
- You shut up, Basanti.

214
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,000
Now, who is she?

215
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,666
It’s you!

216
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,125
<i>He changed our surname to Ramgarh</i>

217
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,791
<i>and attached a sidecar to my scooter.</i>

218
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,375
I don’t pick up money
that’s thrown, even today.

219
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,791
<i>- Deewaar.</i>
- I have my mother with me.

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,291
I love you, my son.

221
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,458
Bachchan. Mr. Bachchan.

222
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,166
You must have heard the name.

223
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,666
Bachchan. My Bachchan.

224
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,166
<i>With that, my name got fixed.</i>

225
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,958
<i>Couldn’t you change it after growing up?</i>

226
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,541
He gave me birth.
Can’t I give him that much happiness?

227
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,458
From today,
not only am I a fan of that Bachchan,

228
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,000
{\an8}- but I’m also a fan of this Bachchan.
- Thank you, sir.

229
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,583
If everything goes well, we’ll meet again.

230
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,583
Sure, sir.

231
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,000
Hey, I’m not getting a good card.

232
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,291
You're so dead today!

233
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,458
Hey, look, after a long time,
the Joker is coming.

234
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, you gambler!

235
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,041
Hey, Bachchan! You kiddo!

236
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,291
I’m the rising hand in this place.

237
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
Be careful with your words.

238
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,416
Your hand might be rising
in playing cards.

239
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,416
My hand rises in any game.

240
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,541
I’m the care-of-address for sarcasm.

241
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,833
I’ll smack your head off
if you play with me.

242
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,583
If not for bad luck,

243
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,416
how could a guy singing
in an orchestra become an IT officer?

244
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,666
And a guy owning 500 acres of land
is playing cards with these five people?

245
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,625
- Time, man. Time.
- It’s 1 p.m., brother. It’s lunchtime.

246
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,791
I will kick you on your back. Play now.

247
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,416
Basanti, look who’s here!

248
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,291
Thakur Baldev Singh!

249
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,666
You're back!

250
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,291
My lovely son.

251
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,750
Fresh up and come. Have lunch.

252
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,875
Not sure when you last ate.

253
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,375
My Bhagyalaxmi!

254
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,041
- My Bachchan!
- Bachchan is back!

255
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,041
- Brother, it's been so long!
- How many days are you camping here?

256
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,458
Should we start the orchestra again?

257
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,583
If you say yes, we can accept
programs for all the villages around.

258
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,416
- Stay at least till Vinayaka Chavithi.
- I’ll sign up for all the Navaratris.

259
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,750
Why only Chavithi?

260
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,958
I’ll be here until Dasara,
Diwali, and Sankranti.

261
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,375
They suspended me.

262
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,250
Such good news, my son.

263
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,791
I expected something when
the phone got disconnected.

264
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,166
The government may be late
in giving us what we deserve.

265
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,000
But when they have to
throw us out, they do it fast.

266
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,416
You said it right, my son.

267
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,458
I’ll take advances
for all the festivals then.

268
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,291
Go ahead and take them.
This is Kotipalli's Kumar Sanu.

269
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,041
He’ll hold the mic again
and sing the songs.

270
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,333
- Come, Mr. Pankaj.
- Greetings.

271
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,708
No puja can start in this temple unless
you play a cassette.

272
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,291
Which song are you playing today?

273
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,916
<i>Seetha Kalyanam.</i>

274
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,875
Our daughter is on her way.

275
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,250
You’ll get what you need
for the puja soon.

276
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,791
Hail Lord Ram.

277
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,125
{\an8}- It’s time for a card game.
- Brother…

278
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,666
{\an8}- What?
- Sister-in-law, bro.

279
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,000
{\an8}Jikki!

280
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,625
Oh, no.

281
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,208
This Dorababu is there
to take you to the temple, right?

282
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,666
Why these adventures?
Now see what happened.

283
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,125
Go away.

284
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,250
One minute.

285
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,791
He will break the chain.

286
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,833
Hey, gambler! Get up!

287
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,958
Is he pulling her half-sari,
or my queen as well?

288
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:44,916
Both, bro.

289
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,541
Thank you.

290
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,833
You're welcome for a lifetime.

291
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,208
Has Bachchan become even more glamorous?

292
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,000
No! Men should be dark
and women should be fair.

293
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:08,958
That’s the rule.

294
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,416
Look at him. He looks fair and pale.

295
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,333
{\an8}HAIL LORD RAM

296
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,458
Why are you chasing
after the bicycle chain, dude?

297
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,916
{\an8}DONATION BOX

298
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,583
{\an8}Hail Lord Ram.

299
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,458
Look, he put in twenty rupees!

300
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,166
As if he did something great.

301
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,250
What’s the big deal
about donating twenty rupees?

302
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,791
I can put in a hundred rupees.

303
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,750
It’s a sin. God is watching.

304
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,166
Whether a note or a word,
once it slips, it belongs to Lord Krishna.

305
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,625
Why talk about Krishna
in the temple of Ram?

306
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,375
- I will take my ten thousand.
- Even then,

307
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,541
you can only put money
in the donation box.

308
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,541
You can’t take it away. It’s a sin.

309
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,125
- My ten thousand.
- It's a sin.

310
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,625
Ten thousand. This sin is yours.

311
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,500
As if you are a rising hand, right?

312
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,250
I've talked about the Ramayana.

313
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,541
What did you understand?
Summarize it in one word.

314
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,166
Wives should always
listen to their husbands.

315
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,041
Since she didn’t listen to her husband,
Goddess Sita faced many difficulties.

316
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,333
This is what women
should learn from the Ramayana.

317
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,416
You stop, man.

318
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,750
Just because the wife
asked for a golden deer

319
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,083
or a monkey on the mountain,
a husband shouldn’t venture out.

320
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,458
That’s why he kidnapped Goddess Sita.

321
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,875
Trust.

322
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,958
The Ramayana is about trust.

323
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,458
Sita trusted that Ram
would come to Ashoka Vanam.

324
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,000
It’s not good for you to run after me
after I thanked you for helping me.

325
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,333
When did I run after you?
I’m standing right in front of you.

326
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It’s amazing if a guy like this
runs after or stands in front.

327
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:57,958
Yeah, girl.

328
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,291
Tell me if you aren’t interested.
I will try for myself.

329
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,666
The guy is showing his intelligence.

330
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,625
Yes.

331
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,208
You can’t love with intelligence.

332
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,291
You fall in love without being aware.

333
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:11,625
And I fell!

334
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:12,916
Let’s go!

335
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,875
Hey girl, I’m talking to you. Stop…

336
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,875
Why are you walking in reverse,
unlike others?

337
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:20,833
It is said in the ancient scriptures

338
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,833
that someone born facing in reverse
should also walk in reverse.

339
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,958
Why don’t you tell me your name?

340
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,041
I won’t.

341
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,041
- I will make you reveal it.
- My tongue won’t slip.

342
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,125
You will slip.

343
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,125
- Jikki!
- What happened, Jikki?

344
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,250
Are you okay, Jikki?

345
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,791
Jikki… What is your name, Jikki?

346
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,083
Say it, Jikki!

347
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,916
Say it, Jikki!

348
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,416
Was it necessary? Jikki, Jikki, Jikki!

349
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,958
Jikki, you are very lucky!

350
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,375
<i>Naughtily, like a design</i>

351
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,625
<i>She knotted me with playful looks</i>

352
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,916
<i>Oh, my girl, because of you</i>

353
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,583
<i>Music is playing in my heart</i>

354
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:35,875
<i>My heart took an oath after seeing you</i>

355
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:40,083
<i>Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily</i>

356
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:43,541
<i>Held the girl’s hand with strong resolve</i>

357
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,250
<i>How to stop after getting ignited?</i>

358
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,666
<i>My heart caught by you</i>
<i>Refusing to get down from the cloud</i>

359
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,333
<i>Carved your idol</i>
<i>And worshiped you every day, Jikki</i>

360
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,458
<i>I’m emphasizing</i>

361
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:02,500
<i>If our acquaintance</i>
<i>Turns into love and makes us a couple</i>

362
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:06,166
<i>No one is luckier than you</i>

363
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:12,083
<i>My heart took an oath after seeing you</i>

364
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:16,083
<i>Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily</i>

365
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,791
<i>The waistline that breaks my bravery</i>
<i>Kills me totally</i>

366
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,708
<i>The lip-line that was filled with spirits</i>
<i>Makes me go crazy</i>

367
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:31,541
<i>The thoughts that are refusing to leave me</i>
<i>Fighting them with the help of the sleep</i>

368
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:35,083
<i>The body that knew the taste of pleasure</i>
<i>Embrace it with your kisses</i>

369
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,833
<i>Listening to your voice</i>
<i>Not sure why hurry</i>

370
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:42,458
<i>Watching everything</i>
<i>Is noise your way?</i>

371
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,500
<i>Will your tactic work?</i>
<i>Will your plan click?</i>

372
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,875
<i>Don’t say no to me anymore</i>

373
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,791
<i>My heart took an oath after seeing you</i>

374
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,666
<i>Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily</i>

375
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:03,416
<i>Held the girl’s hand with strong resolve</i>

376
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:07,250
<i>How to stop after getting ignited?</i>

377
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:33,750
<i>My lovely lady</i>
<i>Is it harmful to give a kiss?</i>

378
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:38,083
<i>Sulking great or what?</i>
<i>Not wrong giving intimacy</i>

379
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,958
<i>The flames that approach me</i>
<i>Are burning me alive</i>

380
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:45,583
<i>In the girl’s heart filled with memories</i>
<i>I hear many murmurs</i>

381
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:49,291
<i>Your heart is a poem</i>
<i>Your word is a melody</i>

382
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:52,916
<i>Your name is so novel</i>
<i>Looks good luckily</i>

383
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,875
<i>If you behave well</i>
<i>I will say yes happily</i>

384
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:00,458
<i>Don’t keep me at a distance</i>

385
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:08,458
<i>My heart took an oath after seeing you</i>

386
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:11,916
<i>Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily</i>

387
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:16,125
<i>Held the girl’s hand with strong resolve</i>

388
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:19,666
<i>How to stop after getting ignited?</i>

389
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,250
Hello, mic testing! One, two, three…

390
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,750
What is this, brother?
At the wedding, as well?

391
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:35,791
Dumbo.

392
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,958
A wedding can happen without festivities
but not without a card game.

393
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,250
It’s a rule.

394
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,041
Is it? Then give me a card as well.

395
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,000
- Brother?
- Yes.

396
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,916
You're playing a card game here.
What about after the wedding?

397
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,333
Chess, man.

398
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,333
Chess after the wedding.

399
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,583
They take one step, and we take one.

400
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,583
Welcome to all the people of Kotipalli.

401
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:07,625
For all the weddings
and celebrations, contact A1 Orchestra.

402
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,208
The first song in this music
program is "Bhale Manchi Roju."

403
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,458
And the singer is our local Balu.

404
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,083
A1 ORCHESTRA

405
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:35,583
What is this nuisance?

406
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,000
I've been hearing the same song play
since my wedding.

407
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,250
I cannot change my wife.
Ask him to change the song, at least.

408
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,291
Wish I get a queen in this game.

409
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,791
Take it.

410
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,333
Haven’t your parents come, Jikki?

411
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,416
- They are coming, behind me.
- He came.

412
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,416
He doesn’t have any other work.

413
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,375
Everyone in this village
is getting married.

414
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:06,625
Except for me and you.

415
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,000
What do you think?

416
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,250
There is a thin line
between hope and greed.

417
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,291
However, in life, it is different.

418
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:15,791
The abyss.

419
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,250
The what?

420
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,208
Let’s go.

421
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,375
He got it nicely.

422
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:20,833
What happened now, brother?

423
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,958
She said even if it’s greed,
I kept all my hopes on you.

424
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,083
I will not leave you despite all odds.

425
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:33,625
I can give it in writing.

426
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,083
Silly girl. She dies for me.

427
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,125
Why did this cycle chain fellow come here?

428
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,375
It’s Marwari’s wedding, right?
Maybe he came to sing some Hindi songs.

429
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,541
Come, let’s sit.

430
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:12,458
Hey, you!

431
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:29,416
He is Kumar Sanu of Kotipalli, bro.
Sings Hindi songs well.

432
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,041
He is singing intentionally.

433
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,416
He keeps singing <i>"pyaar" </i>all the time.
What is this <i>"pyaar,"</i> anyway?

434
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,458
<i>- "Pyaar"</i> means pigeon.
- Is it?

435
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,833
Yes, <i>Prema Pavuralu</i> movie.
Haven’t we watched it?

436
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,291
Hey, his singing is so bad.

437
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,750
People are shameless, dude.

438
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,583
They’re just clapping
despite not understanding anything.

439
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,708
Let’s go.

440
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,208
Mr. Bachchan. I’m sure you heard the song.

441
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,791
Why so much attitude, Mr. Bachchan?

442
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,500
Why don’t you give some to your friends?

443
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,416
Yes. Look at how dull they’re looking.

444
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,416
You're right.

445
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,166
By the way, Ms. Jikki,
why do you need so much beauty?

446
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,375
Can’t you share some with your friends?

447
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,083
Look at how pale and dull they’re looking.

448
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,750
If the caterer is a friend,
the food tastes good.

449
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,208
This proverb doesn’t
match with the original.

450
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,458
It’s a proverb, not the <i>Bhagavad Gita.</i>

451
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,791
It can be changed.

452
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:08,833
- What is this?
- Memories.

453
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,750
In fifty years, you'll be telling our
grandchildren about how I pursued you.

454
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,166
Such wonderful memories.

455
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,750
Please leave me. I’m not comfortable.

456
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,625
Please forgive me.

457
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,291
I will never come near you again.

458
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,375
If my love is truly genuine,

459
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,791
you will come searching for me.

460
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,375
Until then…

461
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:46,791
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

462
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,625
I’m Srinivas from the
Income Tax Department.

463
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:49,583
Please sit.

464
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,541
We’re going on a raid
and need police support.

465
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,458
Sure.

466
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:54,625
On whom?

467
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,875
Muthyam Jaghayya.

468
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,583
- Muthyam Jaghayya?!
- Yes, sir.

469
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,125
{\an8}Muthyam Jaghayya may be
new to you, but not to this area.

470
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:13,666
{\an8}Three months ago, an excise officer
named Rama Krishna raided his warehouse.

471
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:14,750
Come on!

472
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,500
Crush them!

473
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,083
Don't spare even a single bottle.

474
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,833
Sir, it seems that he's an excise officer.

475
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,875
He destroyed all our stock.

476
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,291
No, sir.

477
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,333
If any officers come to my home,

478
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:14,708
it should be either to beg
or to seek my blessing.

479
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,875
But I came to arrest you.

480
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,375
I like you!

481
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,916
That’s why I like you!

482
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,333
- Sambashiva…
- Brother.

483
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:27,083
Please felicitate him.

484
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,916
He came from very far.

485
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:33,708
- I’m not scared of your silly deeds.
- You should be scared!

486
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,125
If any fool dares to come
to my house from now on,

487
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,000
they should die of fear,

488
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,375
not of my strength.

489
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,583
I have the entire system behind me.
You can’t do anything to me.

490
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,791
System?

491
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,541
When you were born, you were alone.

492
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,625
When you die, you will be alone.

493
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,583
By the time you understand this,

494
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:06,666
it will be too late, Tayaramma.
Tayaramma…

495
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,000
You did your duty very well.

496
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,666
But what about my duty?

497
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:17,833
Let me go!

498
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,333
Where were you when the excise officer
raided the warehouse?

499
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,458
I went to the temple
to perform the ritual, sir.

500
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:32,791
Instead of treating your boss like a God,
if you went to the temple,

501
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,333
what does that mean?
Am I a god or a fool?

502
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:44,583
In my anger, I should have
sent you to meet that God as well.

503
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,041
But 30 years of companionship…

504
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,333
makes me forgive you.

505
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,000
Go and beg at that same temple. Go!

506
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,750
Even after hearing this,
if you still want to go--

507
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,875
SI sir, have you found
any information about my husband?

508
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:06,166
It’s not right to make me
come here so many times.

509
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,458
You filed a complaint, right? Be patient.

510
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,708
We’re working on it.

511
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,750
He’s a government officer like you.

512
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,666
Would you be so indifferent
if something happened to one of your own?

513
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,416
- Why aren’t you speaking?
- One minute.

514
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,125
Now tell me, why did you come?

515
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,916
Someone picked my pocket
at the bus stand, sir.

516
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,875
There’s nothing to worry about.
File a complaint,

517
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:28,833
and we’ll look into it.

518
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:29,833
- Thank you, sir.
- Tell me, ma'am.

519
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:33,291
How many times do I have to
come to the police station with this baby?

520
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,666
I don’t know what to tell her

521
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:39,000
when she keeps asking
for her father every day.

522
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:41,916
When will you find him?
Please, tell me, sir. Tell me.

523
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,750
- Please, Uncle.
- Please, sir.

524
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,291
- Aunty…
- Who is it?

525
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,375
It’s me, Aunty. Jikki.
Your daughter called

526
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,291
and said she’d call back in five minutes.

527
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,625
Oh, I’m busy, dear.

528
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,291
My son, it seems your sister called.
Go check.

529
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,708
The phone at our house got disconnected,

530
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:48,333
and you’re getting connected
in the form of a PP number!

531
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:50,666
It seems like it’s all written in fate.

532
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:56,083
Hello, what are you looking at?

533
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,375
Let's go.
My sister is waiting on the other side.

534
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,500
I don't even know
where your house is, right?

535
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,125
- This boy…
- Bhagyalaxmi Aunty’s son.

536
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,916
- A call came in.
- Greetings.

537
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,875
Please come in, son.

538
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,166
I liked what you said
about the Ramayana the other day.

539
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,333
Give that to me.

540
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:29,250
What else would a retiree
or a suspended officer do, Aunty,

541
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,333
other than pray to God?

542
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:33,958
- Phone.
- Thank you.

543
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,708
Hey, ACDC? What are you doing
in this house, idiot?

544
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,333
I’m the one who found this house
and arranged for them to buy it.

545
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,208
And I’m guarding it 24/7 like a watchdog.

546
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,125
Why? Doesn’t this house have any dogs?

547
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,666
Sis, hello. How are you?

548
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,208
I heard you’ve been free
for a while now. Mom told me.

549
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,375
So we looked for a girl for you.

550
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,625
No need. I’ve already found one.

551
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,375
The girl is right here looking at me.

552
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,416
This girl is gorgeous.

553
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,083
Even if she looks angry,
her eyes still shine.

554
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:08,833
Even if she pouts, she looks kissable.

555
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,125
No, listen.

556
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,083
Tell him they're filthy rich.
They’ll offer a large dowry.

557
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,166
Your brother-in-law says they're wealthy
and will provide a fat dowry.

558
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,500
Sister, what we don’t earn isn’t ours.

559
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:24,458
Marrying for dowry is like prostitution.

560
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,916
{\an8}DELUXE CASSETTE CENTER

561
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,958
Where did you find this birdie?

562
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,125
Not a normal birdie.
She is a beautiful bird.

563
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,875
Very famous in the neighborhood.

564
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,375
Take this. TDK 120 Minutes.

565
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,875
A-side Amitabh. B-side Rajesh Khanna.
Load the songs.

566
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,708
Though you’re from the Marwari family,

567
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:23,583
you’re living in Telugu land,
eating Telugu rice and Telugu lentils--

568
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:24,875
Don’t overreact, dude.

569
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,375
- My father is a Kishore Kumar fan.
- And you?

570
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,458
Gaddar.

571
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,291
I’m a Gaddar fan.

572
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,125
I keep singing his songs.

573
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:45,541
Her father loves music.
Hence, he named her Jikki.

574
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,583
She sings better than all of you.

575
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,666
- Load A-side. Leave the B-side to me.
- No, dude.

576
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,625
- A-side Amitabh Bachchan--
- B-side also Bachchan.

577
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,083
Okay.

578
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,916
My first love letter
to my last lover, Jikki.

579
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,208
<i>In cinema, they express love in songs.</i>

580
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,000
But this is my life, right?

581
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:23,625
So, I’m saying it in my own words.

582
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,875
That day, what got knotted
was not just your sari,

583
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,500
but also my heart.

584
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,375
One knot yours. One knot mine.

585
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,375
And if the third knot is tied by God,

586
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,000
what more do I need?

587
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,083
From the moment I saw you there,

588
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,208
wherever I look, it’s you.

589
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,666
ROMANCE

590
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,166
{\an8}I will keep you in my heart
like a Yandamuri novel.

591
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,750
I will preserve you in my heart
like Ilaiyaraaja songs.

592
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,458
Boiled peanuts.

593
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:58,958
It will come, see.

594
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,000
Here it is.

595
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,125
Thank you.

596
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,500
Green chilies! She will bring.

597
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,083
Onion fritters!

598
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,041
Oh, God! What is this?

599
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,833
You drink once in a lifetime,

600
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,166
but you're making too much out of it.

601
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,458
Just because it’s a street fight,
you can’t go unprepared, right, Aunty?

602
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,791
You shut up, man.

603
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,625
What is that comparison?

604
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,333
Enough…

605
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,583
Take it, Uncle.

606
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,458
- You have a soft drink, right?
- Yes, Uncle.

607
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,916
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

608
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,875
I’ve got a soft drink,
but where’s your drinking manners?

609
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,416
You’re having a drink
and a soft drink for me?

610
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,708
Your rule of

611
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:38,208
not drinking in the presence of elders
is amazing, Dorababu.

612
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,458
We have something
called culture. Right, Uncle?

613
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,708
Well said!

614
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,166
- What happened?
- Chemicals.

615
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,625
They are adding chemicals
to soft drinks as well.

616
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:50,666
My favorite, Kishore Kumar…

617
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,875
My family is searching for a girl for me.

618
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:41,125
- You are also anyway for Jikki--
- Shouldn’t there be some sense?

619
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,375
Uncle!

620
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,666
Who is he?

621
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,875
Bachchan from next door, Uncle.

622
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,833
He got suspended for taking bribes.

623
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,291
And he started the orchestra as always.

624
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,083
He is shameless, Uncle.

625
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,500
How dare he?

626
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:13,125
Can there be a competition between
Kishore Kumar and Kumar Sanu?

627
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,500
- Should I go and kill him?
- Jikki, ask him to stop his nuisance.

628
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,666
What’s this, buddy?
Why always Hindi songs?

629
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,208
Uncle, C major!

630
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,583
Let’s show how
a Telugu mass song sounds.

631
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:25,541
Okay, show me.

632
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,125
Master, hello?

633
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,666
I’m talking to you.

634
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,458
What's with all this nuisance?

635
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:58,458
From 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.,
we sing songs requested by listeners.

636
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,708
Any requests from you?

637
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:03,000
My father downstairs is
enjoying Kishore Kumar's songs.

638
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,208
Wow, Jikki, see how lucky you are!

639
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,333
Songs at your parents' place,
orchestra at your in-laws' place.

640
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,208
Jikki, you're really lucky.

641
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,833
My father doesn't appreciate all of this.

642
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,250
Normally, one might have a caste problem,

643
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,500
but it seems her father
has a taste problem instead.

644
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:15,458
That's true.

645
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,750
Our friend is called
Kotipalli's Kumar Sanu.

646
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,208
He won’t sing Kishore Kumar's songs.

647
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,750
Pack everything in two minutes and leave.

648
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:24,791
Forget me.

649
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:28,208
If you don’t leave in a minute,
you will land in trouble.

650
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:30,416
What happened?

651
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,916
If your father turns to the B-side
after completing the A-side,

652
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,750
he will realize that you are on my side.

653
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,625
- What happened?
- Enough for the day, Father.

654
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:00,958
Okay.

655
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,375
- Good night, Uncle.
- Good night.

656
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,375
My god. I see a cassette in your blouse.

657
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:11,875
And there’s something in the cassette.

658
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,416
Jikki!

659
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,291
Jikki, there's something in your blouse

660
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,416
that I want to see right now, right here.

661
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:22,875
It’s okay for her to hit me…

662
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,500
At least Jikki has finally touched me.

663
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:31,000
Jikki, let’s come up with an excuse
at home and go to the movies this evening.

664
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,208
{\an8}Okay, dear.

665
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,583
{\an8}What happened, dude?

666
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,041
{\an8}You walked in so suddenly.

667
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,833
{\an8}I wanted to see you.

668
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:43,291
A-side Rama Rao Garu, B-side
Nageshwara Rao Garu, load the songs.

669
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:44,750
Ghantasala sang for both.

670
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,333
So, why differentiate
between A-side and B-side?

671
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:50,916
I know, but he sings differently
for Rama Rao and Nageshwara Rao.

672
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,875
That’s what I call knowledge.

673
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,791
Not spoiling the business
while sitting next to me.

674
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,208
- So, completely on A-side and B-side--
- Move!

675
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:00,625
Are you only concerned
about the A-side and B-side,

676
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:02,833
or do you have any
intention of joining my side?

677
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,583
Tell me.

678
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:13,958
Once you reach Delhi, I expect a call
that my brother got the ticket.

679
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,541
You should make that call.

680
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,583
You're an MP,

681
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,500
your younger brother
is the Youth President,

682
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:23,791
and now you're seeking an
MLA ticket for your elder brother.

683
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,958
How can one family get so many positions?

684
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:28,666
Can members of one family
become Prime Ministers?

685
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,500
I cannot tolerate it
if you criticize the high command.

686
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,000
What will you do besides staying silent?

687
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:37,083
First, you need to get past this place
before taking any action.

688
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:44,083
You must have seen
leaders who manipulate votes.

689
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,791
This is Muthyam Jaghayya's area.

690
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,208
People disappear here.

691
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,250
I won’t be at this meeting.
Speak highly of my brother.

692
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:04,166
Mom, what's up?
The house is in darkness.

693
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:05,791
It’s okay.

694
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,125
Can you get me some water?

695
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,041
The fuse has blown.
Your father is handling it.

696
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,541
But the neighborhood has power,
and our house--

697
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:15,583
What's wrong, Mom?

698
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:18,041
Nothing, my son.
I slipped in the bathroom and fell.

699
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,416
You come. I'll serve you dinner.

700
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,916
What's with these injuries?

701
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,000
Son, please fix this fuse.

702
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,500
Dad, what happened to you?

703
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,333
Jikki, what are you doing here?
How did you get hurt?

704
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:31,083
Yeah, your mom said it right.
Slipped in the bathroom…

705
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,041
Did all of you slip in the bathroom
at the same time?

706
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,416
Jikki, what happened?

707
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,666
Earlier, Muthyam Jaghayya’s men came.

708
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,666
What’s the matter?

709
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,708
What do you guys want?

710
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:44,666
Muthyam Jaghayya's
meeting is happening outside.

711
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,333
We are drawing power from your house.

712
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,500
In that case, it won't handle the load,
and the fuse will blow.

713
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,375
Hey, if you utter another word,

714
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,125
forget the fuse,
your life might just blow away.

715
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:54,541
Bro, I found it.

716
00:48:54,625 --> 00:49:01,583
I congratulate the National Party workers
on my behalf and on behalf of our party.

717
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:08,000
Speaking of our young leader
Muthyam Sambashiva Rao,

718
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:12,333
he holds a lot of respect
for elders and the aged.

719
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:17,625
He has great affection for women.

720
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,041
He is not a man of words but of action.

721
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,708
Forget about fuses blowing.

722
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:37,041
Soon, all of their fuses will be blown.

723
00:49:37,416 --> 00:49:39,708
- Where are you doing, my son?
- Don't stop him, Bhagyalaxmi.

724
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,416
They need to understand that they'll face
consequences if they mess with Bachchan.

725
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:46,875
In a nutshell, he is strict.

726
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:53,500
The future MLA, our youth leader
Sambashiva Rao, will speak now.

727
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:01,291
My greetings to the people of Kotipalli.

728
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,083
I was born here!

729
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,541
I was raised here!

730
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:11,458
I will represent this
place in the assembly.

731
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:17,583
- We will give our lives!
- We will give our lives for our brother!

732
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:21,208
- We will give our lives!
- We will give our lives for our brother!

733
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,875
They were saying something.
Did you take it seriously?

734
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,291
We will see during the elections, okay?

735
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:44,291
- Hey! Sit down!
- Sit down!

736
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,166
- Hey…
- Hey!

737
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,875
- Hey…
- Hey!

738
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,708
I like you guys.

739
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:53,541
I thought you were joking when
you said you'd give your lives.

740
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:54,916
Come on, then.

741
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:58,291
Give it.
Come, come, come…

742
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:04,041
Instead of asking for power,
you forcefully took it…

743
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,833
And you assaulted my
parents when they resisted.

744
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,041
You should apologize in front of everyone.

745
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,000
Or else…

746
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:18,291
So they've made their decision…
What's yours?

747
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,375
Apology? Or a cigarette?

748
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,916
- Sorry.
- What?

749
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:23,291
Sorry.

750
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,708
The entire street witnessed
my parents being assaulted.

751
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:30,291
Now, the entire town should
hear your apology to them.

752
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,083
Each and every one of them.

753
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,041
Indukuri Suryanarayana aka Thakur.

754
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:40,833
My apologies to Indukuri
Suryanarayana aka Thakur.

755
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,500
Indukuri Bhagyalaxmi aka Basanti.

756
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:52,208
My apologies to Indukuri
Bhagyalaxmi aka Basanti.

757
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,000
Jik…

758
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,166
Indukuri Jikki.

759
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:07,333
My apologies to Indukuri Jikki.

760
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:13,541
Thank you so much.

761
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,375
You know, right?

762
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,458
Since I didn't like his methods,

763
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,083
I resigned as a clerk to Muthyam Jaghayya

764
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:32,541
and started serving at the temple.

765
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:34,333
Why deal with such a person?

766
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,583
And you guys? At least you
should have intervened.

767
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:39,166
They announced her name on the microphone.

768
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,041
Once she steps out of her house,

769
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,333
the public will scrutinize her
and comment on her.

770
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,958
It's Bachchan who is at fault, Uncle.

771
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,750
He tried to impress the girl
and messed with them.

772
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,291
If I had known about the issue,

773
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,250
I could have easily
handled Muthyam Jaghayya.

774
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:57,791
A true man stands not just
by his parents but also by a girl.

775
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,208
Bachchan didn't do anything wrong, Dad.

776
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:02,833
He corrected the mistake.

777
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:12,916
- You are singing well. Don't feel bad.
- It's my training. What do you think?

778
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,791
These guys always stick around here.

779
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,125
Hey, all the ladies come to one side.

780
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:20,500
Our friend isn't able to breathe.

781
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:24,250
The entire women's group has
come for one cassette recording.

782
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,750
We should limit one person to
one cassette, just like a movie ticket.

783
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,041
- Correct.
- Why?

784
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,791
So that each one of you
can flirt with one girl?

785
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,416
We shouldn't allow girls like you,
who can't tell the difference

786
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:35,250
between a chocolate and a cassette.

787
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,916
- On the A-side, Chiranjeevi songs.
- Do you want Balakrishna on the B-side?

788
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:40,625
B-side… Leave that to him.

789
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,875
Aunty, there's a phone call for you!

790
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,875
Bava is always negative. Listen to me.

791
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:27,458
- It's just some sound.
- What happened, Jikki?

792
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,125
It slipped out of my hand.

793
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,666
It's okay if it slipped
out of your hand, ma'am.

794
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,458
You will be in trouble if your leg slips.

795
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:33,458
A phone call has come.

796
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:35,166
Aunty, a phone call for you.

797
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:37,416
I can't hear you, dear. Come in.

798
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:38,958
Where are you, Aunty?

799
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:40,958
Here…

800
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,250
A phone call for you.

801
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,958
- Turn this side.
- Who are you talking to, my son?

802
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,208
My sister.

803
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,458
Well, the phone has been
dead for the last three days.

804
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:01,500
Who are you talking to?

805
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:04,708
That's why, I'm not able to hear anything.

806
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:07,666
Sister, I will call you later,
the phone is dead.

807
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,041
Thank you.

808
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,333
My parents are looking
for potential matches for me.

809
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:20,416
- Let them.
- Tomorrow they are coming home to see me.

810
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,500
- Let them.
- Aren't you scared, man?

811
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,166
Not at all.
Unless they see a few matches,

812
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,791
how will your father know my specialty?

813
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,750
Yeah, big specialty.

814
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,666
You are a Kumar Sanu fan.
He is a Kishore Kumar fan.

815
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:37,208
I'm getting killed for playing
the orchestra between both of you.

816
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,291
Really?

817
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,250
Then, let's do something.

818
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:42,083
This time, I will play the
chorus to your orchestra, okay?

819
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:43,583
- What?
- It means…

820
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,166
Mr. Pankaj, your…

821
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:50,000
Everyone is saying that
the girl is good.

822
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:52,166
- If this match works out…
- Greetings.

823
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,541
He is Mr. Chandi Das, and his
son is in the diamond business.

824
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,125
Your daughter is like gold…

825
00:55:56,333 --> 00:56:00,291
They make a perfect match. That's
why I approached them for an alliance.

826
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,333
Thanks for that.

827
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,958
After the priest has said okay,
what questions will I have?

828
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:07,125
We will come to see
the girl on an auspicious day.

829
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:09,375
- Okay.
- The priest manages every

830
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:11,208
celebration in our family.

831
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,875
His word is as trustworthy as an ISI mark.

832
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:17,000
While he performs the puja in the temple,
I hear the song belongs to you.

833
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,250
Nothing like that.

834
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:26,916
<i>Jikki, you said that you would persuade</i>
<i>your father to arrange our marriage.</i>

835
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:28,750
<i>What happened?</i>

836
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:32,000
<i>This won't work out.</i>
<i>Let's get married first,</i>

837
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,125
<i>and then we can convince him.</i>

838
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:38,000
<i>Once we're married,</i>
<i>he'll have no choice but to accept it.</i>

839
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:40,791
This cassette
doesn't belong to him, madam.

840
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:43,583
Yeah, from now on, the girl also
doesn't belong to him. Let's go, Son.

841
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:45,291
What kind of match
did your father arrange?

842
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:46,750
Such trouble for this match?

843
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,666
I went to hear <i>Bhagavatam</i> at the temple…

844
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:01,083
and her story was exposed. It's shameful!

845
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:04,791
While everyone respects me,
she dragged me down.

846
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:06,833
Why is Jikki being
blamed for this, Uncle?

847
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,333
She is as innocent
as a queen in a deck of cards.

848
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,666
It's him who messed everything up.

849
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,666
This is a matter between two families.

850
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:16,541
I will not tolerate any
outsider intervening.

851
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,041
Look how your son is behaving!

852
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:20,125
Forget their words.

853
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:23,500
I will look after Jikki
like my own daughter.

854
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,416
Please allow them to get married, brother.

855
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,791
How can we agree?
He doesn't even have a job.

856
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:34,750
- It's all because of this stupid phone.
- Correct, Uncle.

857
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,125
Hello…

858
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,875
Excuse me. I'm calling from
the Income Tax Department.

859
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,583
- Can I speak to Mr. Bachchan, please?
- Dorababu!

860
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,500
It's cards playing in the…

861
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:45,625
Hey, stop.

862
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,333
Uncle, this guy is talking in English.

863
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:48,833
Yes?

864
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:50,916
This is the Deputy Commissioner
of the Income Tax Department.

865
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:54,500
Mr. Bachchan's suspension
has been lifted. Please inform him.

866
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,125
Okay.

867
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:58,041
Bachchan, it's your call.

868
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,583
You said the phone was stupid, right?
Tell them that I'm not here.

869
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:01,916
You need to take this call.

870
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,083
- Yes, Bachchan speaking.
- Your suspension has been lifted.

871
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,041
Please return
and resume your duties urgently.

872
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:10,583
- Sure, sir. Thank you.
- Welcome.

873
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:12,458
You tell them yourself.

874
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,708
It's from the Income Tax Department.

875
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,416
My suspension has been lifted, Dad.

876
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,125
They asked me to join back immediately.

877
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,791
What great news, Son!

878
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,500
What do you say now?

879
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,916
Mr. Bachchan.
You must've heard the name.

880
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:28,458
You raised your daughter
with so much love.

881
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,875
I will cherish
and care for her as my life.

882
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,083
Please allow us to get married.

883
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:39,750
Alright.

884
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:40,958
Let's set the date.

885
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:43,333
Congratulations, dear!

886
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,291
- Uncle, have you gone mad?
- Keep the phone aside.

887
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,166
Brother…

888
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:53,958
What's happening, dude?

889
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,875
He has ruined your chances, bro.

890
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:43,750
<i>A big fair in the girl's beauty</i>

891
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,458
<i>And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice</i>

892
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,625
<i>Just at a gesture</i>
<i>Disco starts playing</i>

893
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,416
<i>And the concert won't stop till dawn</i>

894
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:55,500
<i>A love duet</i>
<i>In Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi</i>

895
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:59,041
<i>The drop of sweat will play to the music</i>

896
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:10,083
<i>Eyelids should beat like the drums</i>

897
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:12,916
<i>My bangles will sing a ghazal</i>

898
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,875
<i>The noise of the cot should play a chorus</i>

899
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,250
<i>The audience will throw Jasmine flowers</i>

900
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,125
<i>Once more, more, more…</i>

901
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,166
<i>Close the door, door, door…</i>

902
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,583
<i>When kissing, the surrounding villages</i>
<i>Play on the mic</i>

903
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,250
<i>Till the sun rises</i>

904
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:33,375
<i>A big fair in the girl's beauty</i>

905
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:36,291
<i>And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice</i>

906
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:10,750
<i>Why the shyness on your pink cheeks?</i>

907
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,458
<i>Since you hid sharpness</i>
<i>In your sharp looks</i>

908
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:22,833
<i>When I pinch your waistline</i>
<i>Fingers learn music</i>

909
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:26,041
<i>And we get into…</i>
<i>Pillow business under full moon</i>

910
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:30,083
<i>Jhanak! Jhanak! Jhanak!</i>
<i>And we play Nattuvangam</i>

911
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:40,666
<i>Eyelids should beat like the drums</i>

912
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:43,625
<i>My bangles will sing a ghazal</i>

913
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:46,583
<i>The noise of the cot should play a chorus</i>

914
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:49,000
<i>The audience will throw Jasmine flowers</i>

915
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,958
<i>Once more, more, more…</i>

916
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,875
<i>Close the door, door, door…</i>

917
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,166
<i>When kissing, the surrounding villages</i>
<i>Play on the mic</i>

918
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,791
<i>Till the sun rises</i>

919
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,208
<i>A big fair in the girl's beauty</i>

920
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:07,375
<i>And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice</i>

921
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:50,458
<i>How you hold my life</i>
<i>At ransom at the edge of your sari</i>

922
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:56,416
<i>While I hold with my fingers</i>
<i>You are the world for me</i>

923
01:02:57,041 --> 01:03:02,708
<i>I smelt like an ice cream</i>
<i>Filled with youth in mid-summer</i>

924
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,500
<i>Let the heat be cold</i>
<i>And Varanda hold it</i>

925
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,458
<i>Hug me and sing an Asha Bhosle tune</i>

926
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:20,208
<i>Eyelids should beat like the drums</i>

927
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:23,083
<i>My bangles will sing a ghazal</i>

928
01:03:23,291 --> 01:03:26,083
<i>The noise of the cot should play a chorus</i>

929
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,333
<i>The audience will throw Jasmine flowers</i>

930
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,500
<i>Once more, more, more…</i>

931
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,333
<i>Close the door, door, door…</i>

932
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:37,708
<i>When kissing, the surrounding villages</i>
<i>Play on the mic</i>

933
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:40,375
<i>Till the sun rises</i>

934
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,708
<i>A big fair in the girl's beauty</i>

935
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:46,625
<i>And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice</i>

936
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:53,875
Congratulations.

937
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:58,000
You are the first officer to join
on promotion after a suspension.

938
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,166
Thank you, sir.

939
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,833
You must conduct
an income tax raid on a big shot.

940
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:03,583
My wedding is in four days, sir.

941
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,541
The raid can be completed in a day.
You can return by the evening.

942
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,041
- Please try to understand, sir.
- Bachchan!

943
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,416
You've been taken back
into the department for this raid only.

944
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:12,833
I will assign the team. Get ready.

945
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,666
- By the way, sir, who should I raid?
- It's highly confidential.

946
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,666
They said they would inform me
an hour before informing you.

947
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:20,500
No problem, sir. For me,
the work is important. Not the name.

948
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:29,916
<i>The king has been checkmated, Tayaramma!</i>

949
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,208
- Hello?
- Delhi Party Office.

950
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:35,166
So, what's the news from Delhi?

951
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,791
Bad news. They are not
giving the MLA ticket to your brother.

952
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,458
- Are you in your senses?
<i>- Yes.</i>

953
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,666
I'm an MP overseeing seven MLAs.

954
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:46,083
Party offices could be burnt down
if anyone messes with me.

955
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,666
You're overestimating
yourself, Mr. Jaghayya.

956
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
An anonymous person came
to your brother's public meeting…

957
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:54,291
and tried to burn
everything down with petrol.

958
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,416
<i>And you couldn't do anything about it.</i>

959
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,666
How can you threaten us in Delhi?
Goodbye.

960
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,125
What happened at your meeting?

961
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,666
Brother…

962
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:11,750
What happened at your meeting that night?

963
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:12,958
Brother…

964
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,916
I want him in front of me within
the next hour, no matter where he is.

965
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:25,750
Why are you just standing there? Go now!

966
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:37,958
We have our wedding
in the next four days--

967
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,208
I will come back in two days.

968
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:41,416
I'm scared.

969
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:42,833
Come on, silly girl.

970
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:46,291
Every girl gets butterflies
before their wedding.

971
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:47,958
At times like this, you should…

972
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,958
- Did it come down?
- You will come, right?

973
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:53,291
You will soon find out.

974
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:58,125
<i>We searched everywhere, sir.</i>
<i>We couldn't find him.</i>

975
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,500
I don't know. I need him.

976
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,208
<i>We looked for him in the market</i>
<i>as well, brother. He is not there…</i>

977
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,541
I don't want to hear anything. I need him!

978
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,291
<i>We scanned the entire town,</i>
<i>brother. He is not to be seen.</i>

979
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,875
I need him!

980
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:14,333
Brother, it seems
his name is Bachchan.

981
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,083
He is an income tax officer.

982
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,916
He has been singing in
an orchestra since he was suspended.

983
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:23,708
Coward.

984
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:26,291
How did you let him go
after what happened?

985
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,791
Had he been in front of me…

986
01:06:56,875 --> 01:06:57,958
He is the guy.

987
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,958
While we are searching
for him all around…

988
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:08,958
why did he walk in himself
along with his battalion?

989
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,000
Sambashiva…

990
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:12,541
isn't it a miracle?

991
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,625
While we're searching for him all around…

992
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,333
why did he walk in
along with his battalion?

993
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:23,416
We're from the
Income Tax Department.

994
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:26,291
And a raid is scheduled to begin
at your house in a few minutes.

995
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:31,791
Furthermore, all our names are
registered at Ayakar Bhavan, New Delhi.

996
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:35,958
Any harm to us will come
at a steep cost to you.

997
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:39,833
Officers, please announce
the rules before we start the raid.

998
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:42,083
Until the raid is completed,
no one should leave the house.

999
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:43,541
And those outside cannot enter.

1000
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:47,541
The searches will occur
daily from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

1001
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,583
You won't be disturbed after that.

1002
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,291
Only female staff
will question the women.

1003
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:55,333
All your phones will be disconnected.
We will only use them when necessary.

1004
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:57,416
- Sujata Garu and team…
- Yes, sir!

1005
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,833
Please go in and speak to the ladies.

1006
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,875
Once they indicate they are comfortable,
let us know, and then we will enter.

1007
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:01,833
Okay, sir.

1008
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:02,958
- Subhash and team…
- Yes, sir!

1009
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,500
Close all the doors around us.
No one should enter the house.

1010
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:06,833
- Okay? Right.
- Okay, sir.

1011
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,916
What are you watching, brother?

1012
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,625
Are they really going
to come in and raid us?

1013
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:12,125
Hey, officer. Enough of this circus.

1014
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,916
A three-time MP.

1015
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:18,875
A two-time MLA.

1016
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:21,583
And former minister.

1017
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,041
That's my history and track record.

1018
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:29,541
Do you know
who you're messing around with?

1019
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:33,375
With five years of service…

1020
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,583
I've conducted 72 raids…

1021
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:40,291
and seized over three billion
in black money.

1022
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:45,750
I've put an end to
72 "histories" like you.

1023
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:49,958
Maybe you haven't encountered
an officer like me in your career,

1024
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:54,500
but I've dealt with
many politicians like you in mine.

1025
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,625
This raid might be new for you,
but not for me.

1026
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:01,208
Sir, the women in the house are
comfortable. We can proceed now.

1027
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:04,000
Come on, let's start the search.

1028
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:16,166
Hope the lady officers
have informed you about us.

1029
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,333
We need to know who you all are.

1030
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:18,708
Please introduce
yourselves with your names.

1031
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,583
My name is Prabhavathi,
wife of Muthyam Jaghayya.

1032
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,375
My name is Chennakesava.
I'm Muthyam Jaghayya's second brother.

1033
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,083
She is my wife, name…

1034
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,958
Sparsha, the touch.

1035
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:30,416
Touch me, and you'll get a shock.

1036
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,666
He is my elder brother.
Name…

1037
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:35,041
I know him very well.
How are you, sir?

1038
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:39,666
I'm Srilatha.
Muthyam Sambashiva's better half.

1039
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,583
She is our elder sister…

1040
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:43,958
Are these all the family members,
or is there anyone else?

1041
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,125
There is, and he is coming.

1042
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:51,958
Who are you?

1043
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:54,708
Presenting, cine hero
Sisindri Chittibabu Garu.

1044
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:55,916
I haven't seen him in any movie.

1045
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:57,541
I haven't acted in any movie, yet.

1046
01:09:57,916 --> 01:09:59,250
- Officers!
- Yes, sir.

1047
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,250
- You can begin the search.
- Okay, sir.

1048
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:04,666
It's all a waste of time.
What will we get?

1049
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,750
Searching in sir's house is like
putting our hand in God's treasures.

1050
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,750
That's true.

1051
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:10,291
My God!

1052
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,166
This bedroom is so huge.

1053
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,000
This is the first time I've come
for a raid to such a big house.

1054
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:16,958
Me too.

1055
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:42,041
Muthyam Jaghayya is like a pure gem, sir.

1056
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:44,125
You are unnecessarily
suspecting and insulting him.

1057
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,958
You are young.
And you have a bright future.

1058
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,541
Why do you want to
mess with these big people?

1059
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,708
I want people who work.
Not the ones who give bits of advice.

1060
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:56,083
Please keep your advice
and opinions under Muthyam Jaghayya's…

1061
01:10:57,541 --> 01:11:00,500
Raja… Maharaja…

1062
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,625
You can't find anything here, Raja.

1063
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,583
Please, go back, Raja.

1064
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,875
We've searched everywhere, sir.
Couldn't find anything.

1065
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,375
We've searched everything, sir.
Couldn't find anything.

1066
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,375
Neither could we, sir.

1067
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,958
Looks like there is
a lot of heat in your body.

1068
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:24,583
You won't find anything, Raja.

1069
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,000
Have some buttermilk and then leave.

1070
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,458
We've checked the racks and shelves
in all the rooms, sir.

1071
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:39,791
We couldn't find anything.

1072
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:43,458
Search again,

1073
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:44,666
but this time, look meticulously

1074
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,625
- in all the unusual places.
- Okay.

1075
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:49,041
Sir, we searched the backyard,
haystack, and everywhere.

1076
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:50,375
- Yes, sir.
- Everything is clean.

1077
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:51,500
We didn't find anything.

1078
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:55,208
Check the well, unused vessels,
and old cars if there are any.

1079
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,708
- We need to find something, okay?
- Yes, sir.

1080
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:58,666
Okay.

1081
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:06,000
It seems like your fire
has died down, officer.

1082
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:07,625
Should I give you some?

1083
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,166
Thanks.

1084
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:19,041
I have a habit of repaying
a hundred times over.

1085
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:21,208
The government pays me a salary
in the thousands,

1086
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:23,458
and I pay it back
by finding black money worth millions.

1087
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,000
If you give me the fire…

1088
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,583
I will set it ablaze.

1089
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:32,708
You can say as many dialogues as you want,

1090
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,250
but you won’t find anything here.

1091
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:39,083
Listen to me and go back,

1092
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:40,791
my cute little boy.

1093
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,750
We searched the entire house, sir.
We couldn't find anything.

1094
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:47,000
Yes, sir. They have receipts
for whatever we've found.

1095
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:48,291
We can't seize them--

1096
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,583
Govinda! Govinda!

1097
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,750
Bachchan is now deflated,

1098
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,833
and the people who came with him
turned out to be useless.

1099
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,041
Tayaramma, thank you for your blessings.

1100
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:07,166
Why don't you all do something?

1101
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:10,541
Stand in line behind me

1102
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:12,166
and lick my armpits!

1103
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:18,375
What else can you do,
other than be the lost goat in a carnival?

1104
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:20,500
There's nothing you can do.

1105
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:23,541
You forgive the goat that lost its way,

1106
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:28,083
and you sacrifice the goat
that made a mistake.

1107
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,375
We have enough time for that.

1108
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,833
They call it something in Delhi, right?

1109
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,208
- Ayyagaru Bhavan.
- It's Ayakar Bhavan, Brother.

1110
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:36,708
Whatever it is.

1111
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:39,583
Call them…

1112
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:44,791
and tell them that you have come to
the wrong address, and made a mistake.

1113
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:50,333
You'll apologize by falling
at Muthyam Jaghayya's feet and then leave.

1114
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:52,333
Call them at once!

1115
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,125
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

1116
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,208
- Bachchan speaking, sir.
- Yes?

1117
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,583
We discovered a large amount

1118
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:09,541
of cash and gold
at Mr. Muthyam Jaghayya's house, sir.

1119
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:10,583
Hey!

1120
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:12,666
We'll need more time
to recover everything.

1121
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:13,833
Hey, what are you saying?

1122
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:16,708
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is under control, sir.

1123
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:19,166
- Is Mr. Jaghayya giving you trouble?
- Not really, sir.

1124
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,875
He and his family are cooperating well.

1125
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,208
We are expecting big numbers.
Continue the search.

1126
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:25,833
- Thank you, sir.
- Take your own time.

1127
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,958
Sure, sir.

1128
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:30,750
What is this new drama?

1129
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:33,166
Have you given up on your life?

1130
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:37,083
Mr. Jaghayya, do you know
why a tongue slips often?

1131
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:39,125
Because the tongue is wet.

1132
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:44,041
If you were truly honest,
you would never tell us to leave.

1133
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,500
You should say,
"Come in if you have the courage."

1134
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,875
Similarly, you wouldn’t say,
"You won’t find anything."

1135
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:53,958
You should say,
"There is nothing in this house."

1136
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:58,916
You can hide the treasures,
but you can’t hide your words.

1137
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:03,166
This guy wants to mess with us.

1138
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:07,500
Show him what happens when
we start messing around, just once.

1139
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,666
Throw him out!

1140
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,125
Hey!

1141
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:32,791
Sambashiva, take care of this guy.
We'll handle the consequences!

1142
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:29,833
Sambashiva, as your brother mentioned,
fate has a great sense of humor.

1143
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:33,791
You can't escape me,
no matter what you do.

1144
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:37,291
I'll break every bone in the
body and extract everything.

1145
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:40,041
The one who protects
the borders is not the only soldier.

1146
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:42,416
The one who safeguards
wealth is also a soldier.

1147
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:48,708
I'll show that the Income Tax Department
is as formidable as the Indian Army.

1148
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,250
Everyone in the house can breathe
freely for the next five minutes.

1149
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,791
After that, every breath
you take will be accounted for.

1150
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,500
It seems the clothes have become tight.
You may want to loosen your buttons.

1151
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,375
You'll be able to breathe.

1152
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,458
- Officers…
- Yes, sir.

1153
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:12,791
We will leave after we break
his track record and seal his history.

1154
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:15,041
The true raid is going to start now.

1155
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,250
And it's going to be a historic one.

1156
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:18,791
- Officers…
- Sir.

1157
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:21,333
Get ready to create history.

1158
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:52,750
Please tell me, Mr. Jaghayya.
Why did you call me?

1159
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:55,708
I will pay you half a million.
Stop the raid and leave.

1160
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,708
I won't stop even if you
pay fifty million rupees.

1161
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,375
You madman!

1162
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:02,041
Do you know how many zeros
there are in half a million?

1163
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:04,625
You can't buy me
by increasing the zeros in the bribe.

1164
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,291
You need to bribe to get
your pension after retirement.

1165
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,500
Happiness is only in zeros.

1166
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:13,208
Your honesty won't earn you anything.

1167
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,625
No matter the zeros in your bank account.

1168
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,416
You can only eat off a golden plate,

1169
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,541
not the golden plate itself.

1170
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:23,333
A selfish person may enjoy a good meal,

1171
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:25,750
but an honest one will
enjoy a good night's sleep.

1172
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:29,125
Do you know what will
happen if I break free?

1173
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,500
Break free, Mr. Jaghayya.
I want to see it happen once.

1174
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:33,916
Please.

1175
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:39,666
Listen, officers. Your boss
isn't agreeing to the truce.

1176
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:41,791
So I'm talking to the soldiers now.

1177
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,708
You can keep
whatever gold you find inside.

1178
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,333
End the raid and go home.

1179
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:52,208
Go on and live your life.

1180
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:57,250
- What do we do now?
- What now?

1181
01:19:57,416 --> 01:20:00,083
No, everyone is hesitating.
However, my vote is for Mr. Jaghayya.

1182
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,875
Yes, sir.

1183
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,541
My father needs heart surgery
that costs 100,000 rupees.

1184
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:07,291
My salary is only 3,500.

1185
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:11,125
I'm afraid his heart might give out
before I can earn enough, sir.

1186
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,791
I need to arrange my sister's marriage.

1187
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:14,208
They are asking for a dowry of 200,000.

1188
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:17,208
If dowry isn't a crime,
how can bribery be a crime, sir?

1189
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,375
This is my first raid,
and already they're offering a bribe.

1190
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,375
This is my first raid as well,

1191
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:21,583
and life will be sorted
after just one raid.

1192
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,583
Such opportunities won't come again.

1193
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:25,958
I'm fine with it as well.

1194
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:29,416
This could be my last raid.

1195
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,125
I'm retiring next month.

1196
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:34,125
I have never taken a bribe
and won't take one now.

1197
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:36,833
Thank God, one less
person to share the loot.

1198
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:37,958
What about you?

1199
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,125
I don’t want to break my back over this.
I'm okay with this.

1200
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:41,083
Okay.

1201
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:43,625
Why should you get rich alone?
I feel the same.

1202
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:44,625
Double okay.

1203
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:48,000
I feel the same way as well.

1204
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:51,583
Everyone has needs.

1205
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,333
But only a few get opportunities.

1206
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:57,791
One raid won't change the country.

1207
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,625
But it can change our lives.

1208
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,083
That's why we should prosper,
even if we're in the wrong.

1209
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:07,416
Once we decide to become robbers,
we shouldn't settle for small change,

1210
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,791
we should aim for the treasure chest.

1211
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,166
We are prepared,
even if it's two billion.

1212
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:13,500
If the ED offers the same,
and if they seize everything?

1213
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,666
I didn't expect this twist.
My goodness! Mr. Bachchan.

1214
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:20,166
Let's seize a substantial
amount and then make our offer.

1215
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,708
- What do you guys say?
- Yes, sir.

1216
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:24,041
- Don't leave a single corner untouched.
- Okay, sir.

1217
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:25,500
Whatever one digs up belongs to them.

1218
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:27,791
- Whatever one obtains is theirs.
- Yes, sir.

1219
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,291
Break down the walls.
Break open the lockers.

1220
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,125
If anyone interferes, break their bones.

1221
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:33,166
Yes, sir!

1222
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:38,875
I spoke to all the officers.

1223
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,875
Don't worry. Don't be afraid.

1224
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:42,875
You cannot buy us
with money, Mr. Jaghayya.

1225
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,791
The raid will continue as it was planned.

1226
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:50,791
What we wear isn't just pants
and shirts, but morality and honesty.

1227
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,750
What is this nonsense, Dad?

1228
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:55,083
What is happening, sir?

1229
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,166
- Officers, attack!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

1230
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,666
Move away!

1231
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,208
Mr. Ram Murthy and Mr. Subba Rayudu…

1232
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:12,291
The village headmaster
and the postmaster…

1233
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,166
They will be our witnesses.

1234
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,958
Sir, we have nothing against you.

1235
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,000
You are like a God to us.

1236
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,750
- Please forgive us.
- Greetings, brother.

1237
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:25,708
Get up.

1238
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,333
Grandma, how are you
related to Muthyam Jaghayya?

1239
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,500
Grandma, I'm talking to you.

1240
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:20,166
Hey, man. Who are you?

1241
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:23,083
- We are from the Income Tax Department.
- Oh, really?

1242
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:24,291
I thought so.

1243
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,791
I knew something like this would
happen to our Jaghayya one day.

1244
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:37,916
Ruined, right?

1245
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:39,708
You've destroyed everything.

1246
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,750
Why did you come into
my room in the first place?

1247
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:44,875
I was happily listening to songs…

1248
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:49,583
and reminiscing about my Sekhar.

1249
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,666
And now this has been ruined.

1250
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:54,541
And that wall has grown taller.

1251
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:56,708
- Is Sekhar your husband?
- No.

1252
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:58,500
My boyfriend.

1253
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,041
He used to look like Nageshwara Rao.

1254
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:02,333
In those days--

1255
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:03,916
You mentioned that
the wall has gotten taller.

1256
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,875
Which wall is that?

1257
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:07,458
You ruined my songs, and now
you're asking me questions? I won't say!

1258
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,208
Grandma, please tell me.

1259
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:11,333
I will tell you only
if I listen to my song.

1260
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,458
- No, please understand.
- What do you mean?

1261
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,833
I haven't had any experiences with him.

1262
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:18,250
Won't you allow me
to live in his memories?

1263
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,875
I must listen to that song now.

1264
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:44,666
That's a good one.

1265
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,250
You did it exactly like Akkineni.

1266
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,041
Can you dance like him as well?

1267
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:51,708
- Dance?
- Don't you want to see the wall?

1268
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:52,666
I do.

1269
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:55,000
And I want to see Akkineni's dance moves.

1270
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,458
Come on, dance!

1271
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:33,166
- You want to see the wall, right?
- Yes.

1272
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:34,500
- Come with me.
- Please.

1273
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,708
The wall that covered
my mansion of dreams.

1274
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:46,666
Should we destroy it?

1275
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,375
- Naresh…
- Sir!

1276
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:07,083
Brother, they should
stop the raid after 6:00 p.m.

1277
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,041
- Little brother…
- Yes?

1278
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,291
You can't continue
the raid after 6:00 p.m.

1279
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:15,583
Those were your rules.

1280
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:21,125
After 6:00 p.m. means dusk.

1281
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,375
It's the time when demons come out.

1282
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:27,916
And here, monsters roam freely.

1283
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:31,666
And I'm that monster!

1284
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:35,416
Hiranyakasupundaa!

1285
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:39,708
- Action!
- Son, Prahlada…

1286
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:41,708
Where is your Hari?

1287
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,458
Hey, Guruji, I'm asking you,
where is he?

1288
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,416
- Hey, Guruji, is your Hari in this?
- Yes.

1289
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:50,958
- Is he there in that pillar?
- Yes.

1290
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:53,583
- Then, show me.
- Don't wait. Kill him!

1291
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:55,541
Hari!

1292
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,833
- Is Hari in this as well?
- Yes.

1293
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,000
Come out, man.

1294
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:04,625
Why isn't he present here?

1295
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:06,083
Where is your Hari?

1296
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:07,791
Where does he exist?

1297
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:09,333
He may be in this, my lord.

1298
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,250
- Are you sure?
- Hundred percent.

1299
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:15,208
Hey, Hari. Come out.

1300
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:18,750
So much money?

1301
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:30,333
Hey, Srimannarayana.
You are truly miraculous.

1302
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,166
- Please include this in the account.
- Okay, sir.

1303
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:41,250
All that's here is waste paper.
Where is your Sri Hari?

1304
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:43,208
He might be in that, my Lord.

1305
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,125
- Where?
- In the corner, near that wall.

1306
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:46,833
- Then, let's go.
- Please, come.

1307
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:49,583
I will not spare Sri Hari today.

1308
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:56,750
Why did you bring me here?

1309
01:27:57,083 --> 01:28:00,333
- Is your Sri Hari present in this?
- Confirmed, my Lord. He is in this.

1310
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:01,625
Really?

1311
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:10,208
Do it again.

1312
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,541
Come out, man!

1313
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,500
You have such strength, my Lord.
Once more.

1314
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,958
Hey, Hari, what are you doing inside?

1315
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,416
Why is the "Goddess of Wealth" appearing
when I call for Hari?

1316
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,083
Thanks, my Lord.

1317
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,208
Take everything out
and add it to the account.

1318
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,333
Yes, sir.

1319
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:45,750
Open your mouth.

1320
01:29:00,625 --> 01:29:03,875
These big officers, who used to fear us,

1321
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:05,375
have entered our house.

1322
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:08,166
If they're left alone,
they might enter our bedrooms next.

1323
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:10,208
Hey, why are you bothered?
Just eat and be quiet.

1324
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:13,291
Father, how will you produce a film

1325
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:14,833
with me as the hero
if they take all your money?

1326
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:18,041
Of course, the sky is the limit for
our movie, and the budget is unlimited.

1327
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,708
- Well said…
- Have your food.

1328
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:20,666
Okay.

1329
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:23,916
Why did you tell the
officer about the wall, Mom?

1330
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:26,875
Why did you build that
wall so tall, my son?

1331
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:28,958
You oldie, shut up and eat!

1332
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:30,291
We should deal with this Guruji first.

1333
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:31,833
He and his nonsensical guidance.

1334
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:34,750
Brother, you can say anything to me.

1335
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:39,291
But I won't tolerate it if you say
even a word against my Guruji.

1336
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,208
Look at him, he hasn't even taken off
the crown after all that happened.

1337
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:49,958
Apparently, Rama Rao Garu used to remove
the crown only at the end of the day.

1338
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,625
I'm the same.
I'll remove it before sleeping.

1339
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,041
Guruji…

1340
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,625
Rama Rao Garu might accept
if you remove the crown, but I won't.

1341
01:29:57,208 --> 01:29:59,291
How can you blame us
when you have all the money?

1342
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,916
If you don't like it, you can play
the role of a beggar or a dumb man.

1343
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:03,791
Don't act funny during my training.

1344
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:04,833
- Hey, Guruji…
- What?

1345
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:06,833
- If you utter another word--
- Hey!

1346
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,416
Stop now!

1347
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:14,000
I want <i>jalebi.</i>

1348
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:16,208
No, Mom. It has sugar.

1349
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:19,583
If you don't give me <i>jalebi </i>now,
I will have a meeting with him tomorrow.

1350
01:30:19,791 --> 01:30:21,000
Mom!

1351
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,583
What a funny family!

1352
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:25,625
How can she eat after all this?

1353
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:28,125
Because nothing is going to happen
from here on out!

1354
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:35,916
Also, no one should step out
of their rooms tonight, no matter what.

1355
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,250
Close the doors tightly and sleep well.

1356
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:47,083
You eat, Mom.
Just a little bit, okay?

1357
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:18,708
Raja… Maharaja!

1358
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:20,916
Wake up, Raja.

1359
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:25,958
You are sleeping peacefully
after keeping us sleepless.

1360
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:27,333
Very true.

1361
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,916
You sleep so well after
taking away all our money.

1362
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:33,958
The seized money.
Tell us where you hid our money.

1363
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,750
Why are you talking to him, Brother?

1364
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:38,000
Let's complain to the
department and get him arrested.

1365
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,541
Hey, the door is unlocked.

1366
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,541
- Oh, no! Where's the money?
- Where is it?

1367
01:31:43,625 --> 01:31:45,000
Did Jaghayya steal it?

1368
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,958
Sir, there's nothing left
in the place we stored it.

1369
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:50,875
This is unjust, sir.

1370
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,416
Why are you not talking?

1371
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,625
What can he say after
hiding away all that money?

1372
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,291
He made so many exaggerated claims.

1373
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:59,333
What else? Work is worship.
A true form of honesty.

1374
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:00,541
- And this is his real form.
- Yeah.

1375
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:03,916
I've been saying this from the beginning.

1376
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:07,416
But you all came here in the name of
a raid. Look at what's happened now.

1377
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,791
Moreover, he kept saying,

1378
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:10,958
"You must have heard my name"
once every ten minutes.

1379
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:13,125
Now, he'll get a bad reputation.

1380
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:15,791
Oh, God! Did you take
away my share as well?

1381
01:32:15,916 --> 01:32:18,333
What about all my dreams?
All the hopes that I had?

1382
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:21,500
- I thought all those gold coins were mine.
- How could you think they were all yours?

1383
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,083
I believed those gold coins were mine.

1384
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:26,375
I had so many dreams. Now the coins
are gone and only the dreams remain.

1385
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:31,250
You didn't listen when he
offered a share in the gold coins…

1386
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,833
Instead, you fell into his trap. Look now!

1387
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:36,083
- Well said.
- Thank you, sir.

1388
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:40,166
Speaking about magic,
do you know any magic?

1389
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:42,666
You made all the money
disappear overnight.

1390
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:45,291
Looks like you're a magician.

1391
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:49,458
Speak up.
They are asking, right? Speak.

1392
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:55,250
Hey, where are you going
without giving an answer?

1393
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:58,166
Will he get imprisoned for life
because of this?

1394
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,833
He could receive a death sentence for
the robbery committed here.

1395
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,958
Come.

1396
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,291
Where are you going without answering?

1397
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:06,041
Where are you going, man?

1398
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:08,041
We will file a case against
you and put you on the streets.

1399
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,458
You will go to Tihar Jail
directly from there.

1400
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:14,125
We are asking you something.
Answer.

1401
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:23,083
As you all said,
I will perform a magic trick.

1402
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:25,750
I'll demonstrate it right now.

1403
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:28,416
- It seems he will show something.
- Magic?

1404
01:33:32,416 --> 01:33:34,750
So, let's begin the magic show.

1405
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:38,208
One of the enthusiastic men
should come ahead with a crowbar.

1406
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,333
This will have only two bullets.

1407
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:08,708
There are so many people here.

1408
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:21,125
The first bullet will hit only one
person, but everyone will be afraid.

1409
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:24,458
The second bullet can hit anyone.

1410
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:36,625
What is this? Who are they?

1411
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:40,416
Hey, who are all of you?
How did they get here?

1412
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:43,250
Your reaction is not needed now.

1413
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:44,958
We need my action.

1414
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:49,125
Next item, from our department…

1415
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:51,208
Me, me, me.
That enthusiastic young man is me.

1416
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:54,583
Now go there, say the mantra
I told you, and move your hand.

1417
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:00,875
Abracadabra magic.

1418
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:02,916
Abracadabra magic.

1419
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:06,000
Abracadabra magic.

1420
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:13,000
Sir, all of our money is here.

1421
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,250
The money, sir.

1422
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:25,583
I thought of thrashing them immediately.

1423
01:35:26,666 --> 01:35:31,708
However, an audience should witness
and understand my capabilities, right?

1424
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:36,583
It's best to watch a cricket match live

1425
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:39,333
instead of reading about it
in the newspaper the next day.

1426
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:43,041
As I mentioned before,
I'm making you an offer.

1427
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:47,416
Neither the officers who came with me
nor the police will oppose you.

1428
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:49,916
I alone will stand against you.

1429
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:54,458
If they dare, tell your men to
cross me and take your money away.

1430
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,250
If they dare touch even a penny…

1431
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:04,041
I swear, I'll abandon everything.

1432
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,208
- What is he saying?
- Oh, my…

1433
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:08,750
I won't fight your men in the shadows.

1434
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,750
I'll take them down right
in the heart of your home.

1435
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:12,250
Send them.

1436
01:36:13,375 --> 01:36:14,458
Sir…

1437
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,375
Clarity!

1438
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:03,791
I hope you are getting clarity about me.

1439
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:06,541
Have you got it?
I hope you are getting it.

1440
01:37:07,666 --> 01:37:10,000
Cricket match… live!

1441
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:05,750
As you said, I'm a magician.

1442
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:08,791
But not a magician who
plays tricks or just talks.

1443
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,791
I'm a real magician.

1444
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:21,791
My character is not to
do my duty for the shares.

1445
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:25,250
I can't sacrifice
my life on the field.

1446
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:27,833
But I won't leave a single rupee behind.

1447
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:29,625
If you want to work with me,

1448
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:31,000
you must be like me.

1449
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:41,041
What, dear?
You asked me to come so urgently.

1450
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:43,541
I left <i>Chitralahari</i> on the TV
for this and came.

1451
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:45,583
Light it.

1452
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:49,375
Me, smoking? Are you mad?

1453
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,125
Have it once for me, please.

1454
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:55,041
- I will be caught by its smell.
- You won't be caught.

1455
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:57,416
Chew a few guava leaves while going home.

1456
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:58,458
Light it.

1457
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:01,958
This is not an incense stick.

1458
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,333
It’s a cigarette. Keep it in your mouth.

1459
01:40:09,458 --> 01:40:11,916
Nothing will happen.
Inhale in…

1460
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:20,750
I feel his presence next to me
when I inhale this.

1461
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:23,500
I feel like this cigarette
will become a habit, dear.

1462
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:27,166
I'm unable to live without him.

1463
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:30,583
Stupid girl.

1464
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:34,416
Why are you sad when your wedding
is just two days away?

1465
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,166
Everything will be alright.
Please don't cry.

1466
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:43,875
- How are the wedding preparations going?
- Everything is going well.

1467
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:47,916
Are you okay with having
the wedding in Marwari style?

1468
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:51,375
How does it matter which style we choose,
as long as they like each other?

1469
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:54,375
If the wedding happens
at an auspicious time, it is good.

1470
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:58,083
Not the wedding.
You should rather prepare for his funeral.

1471
01:40:58,166 --> 01:40:59,083
Shut up!

1472
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:02,000
Why talk nonsense
when we are preparing for the wedding?

1473
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:05,166
Set your emotions aside and listen.

1474
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:08,750
I've heard that your Bachchan
led a raid on Muthyam Jaghayya,

1475
01:41:08,958 --> 01:41:12,083
taking our headmaster
and postmaster as witnesses.

1476
01:41:12,208 --> 01:41:15,291
That's how the news got out.
He is Muthyam Jaghayya.

1477
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:17,791
You must have heard his name.

1478
01:41:18,166 --> 01:41:19,750
I don't know how he will handle your son.

1479
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:26,083
Dad, you worked for him for 30 years.

1480
01:41:26,166 --> 01:41:28,041
Speak to him once.

1481
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:30,583
I'm sure he will listen to you.

1482
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:32,333
He may listen to your father,

1483
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,541
but my son will not listen to anyone.

1484
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:37,791
You may be sad today but
will be proud of him tomorrow.

1485
01:41:37,916 --> 01:41:41,041
Oh, no! What a build-up!

1486
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,708
It’s difficult to deal with them.
Culture-less family.

1487
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,458
YANDAMURI VEERENDRANATH
LADY IN THE MOONLIGHT

1488
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:20,125
Jikki…

1489
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:21,708
<i>How are you, Jikki?</i>

1490
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:27,416
Master, how did you recognize me?

1491
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:31,208
Not just your word…
I can hear your breath as well.

1492
01:42:33,416 --> 01:42:34,291
How are you?

1493
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:38,291
I’m drowned in work all day
and floating in your memories at night.

1494
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:40,916
I'm feeling very scared.

1495
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,333
I’m not sure
what they are talking about here.

1496
01:42:43,875 --> 01:42:45,541
Oh, my darling,

1497
01:42:45,916 --> 01:42:48,166
most people are not afraid of problems

1498
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:49,708
but of rumors and gossip.

1499
01:42:50,041 --> 01:42:54,166
Most of the jobless
would be busy with this work.

1500
01:42:54,958 --> 01:42:57,708
These guys may be paid to spread rumors
in the future.

1501
01:42:57,833 --> 01:42:59,375
It makes me want to laugh.

1502
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:01,791
You don't know about Muthyam Jaghayya.

1503
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:04,500
They don't know about this Bachchan.

1504
01:43:05,708 --> 01:43:08,083
By the way, Jikki,
what is the Ramayana about?

1505
01:43:08,208 --> 01:43:09,166
Trust.

1506
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:11,416
The trust Sita had that Ram would come.

1507
01:43:11,583 --> 01:43:12,708
Then why are you scared?

1508
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:15,750
It is not Sita
who is in Lanka right now. It is Ram.

1509
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:17,625
That's why I'm scared.

1510
01:43:19,916 --> 01:43:21,750
Your logic always amazes me.

1511
01:43:22,166 --> 01:43:24,208
Isn't this why
I'm head over heels in love with you?

1512
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:26,708
Why don't you shut me up
with your kisses…

1513
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:31,083
instead of logic?

1514
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:34,458
<i>Jikki, please.</i>

1515
01:44:05,791 --> 01:44:10,208
<i>Hey, cutie pie, who looks like a dove</i>
<i>Wear a bindi and wrap a silk sari</i>

1516
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:14,583
<i>Team up and wrap me like my own</i>
<i>Tell me where your secret mole is</i>

1517
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:19,083
<i>Hey, cutie pie, who looks like a dove</i>
<i>Wear a bindi and wrap a silk sari</i>

1518
01:44:19,166 --> 01:44:23,458
<i>Team up and wrap me like my own</i>
<i>Tell me where your secret mole is</i>

1519
01:44:23,541 --> 01:44:28,250
<i>Like all your naughty acts</i>

1520
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:36,541
<i>But told you that you have to wait</i>

1521
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:40,291
<i>But I came even before you said</i>

1522
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:28,000
<i>Should I wet your shining lips</i>
<i>With all the love?</i>

1523
01:45:28,583 --> 01:45:32,458
<i>Should I spend all my time</i>
<i>In your enchanting beauty?</i>

1524
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:37,000
<i>Should I dive into the depths</i>
<i>Of the ocean of your beauty?</i>

1525
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:41,208
<i>Should I touch the clouds of the music?</i>

1526
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:44,041
<i>Should I signal you…</i>

1527
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:48,375
<i>And raise hopes in you?</i>

1528
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:54,458
<i>When the wind makes the noise</i>

1529
01:45:54,666 --> 01:45:58,250
<i>Should I be the reason for you</i>
<i>To change the clothes?</i>

1530
01:46:46,291 --> 01:46:50,291
<i>Should I sneak in like</i>
<i>A thief in the evening?</i>

1531
01:46:50,833 --> 01:46:54,625
<i>Should I play pillow fights</i>
<i>With your youth?</i>

1532
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:59,208
<i>Should I hug the beauty</i>
<i>With the speed of love?</i>

1533
01:46:59,708 --> 01:47:03,458
<i>Should I quench the thirst</i>
<i>In your thoughts?</i>

1534
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:06,208
<i>Should I shed inhibitions…</i>

1535
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:10,875
<i>Under the blue sky?</i>

1536
01:47:12,416 --> 01:47:16,416
<i>Should I sing a tune in our union</i>

1537
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:20,125
<i>And give you a new thrill?</i>

1538
01:48:03,333 --> 01:48:05,291
What happened, Aunty?
You didn't ask for coffee today.

1539
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:07,083
Are you not feeling well?

1540
01:48:08,625 --> 01:48:09,583
Aunty?

1541
01:48:10,166 --> 01:48:11,208
Aunty?

1542
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:14,000
Aunty?

1543
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,250
Sambashiva!

1544
01:48:17,666 --> 01:48:19,916
Why did you do this, Mom?

1545
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:22,166
I wanted to see you one more time,

1546
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,833
and now you've made it so
that I'll never see you again!

1547
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:28,750
- You should cry as well.
- I can't produce any tears.

1548
01:48:28,875 --> 01:48:30,375
You inherit property only if you cry.

1549
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:36,416
I can’t bear this, Aunty!

1550
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:41,250
You wanted to see the necklace
you wear around my neck. Meanwhile…

1551
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:46,500
You said your "seven-week ornaments"
belong to me.

1552
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:49,208
You gave me your mother's name

1553
01:48:49,333 --> 01:48:52,875
and promised to transfer
the rice mill to me.

1554
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:54,750
And then you left abruptly, Mom!

1555
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:58,291
They aren't mourning her demise

1556
01:48:58,541 --> 01:48:59,666
but the loss of the properties.

1557
01:48:59,833 --> 01:49:01,333
- Guruji!
- Sishya.

1558
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:05,166
It’s time to showcase my training
and your timing.

1559
01:49:05,416 --> 01:49:07,666
The more you cry,
the more properties you get.

1560
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,458
Just say "action," Guruji,

1561
01:49:09,541 --> 01:49:10,708
and I’ll deliver
an Oscar-worthy performance.

1562
01:49:10,791 --> 01:49:11,666
Action.

1563
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:13,208
Grandma!

1564
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:15,083
Grandma!

1565
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:17,166
Oh, my grandma…

1566
01:49:18,083 --> 01:49:21,333
Oh, my grandma…

1567
01:49:21,625 --> 01:49:25,583
You always said you’d
give me millions to make a movie.

1568
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:30,166
And now we have to face
your sudden death, Grandma!

1569
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:35,916
You joined the stars before
seeing my stardom, Grandma.

1570
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:40,791
You called "pack up"
before I could put on my makeup, Grandma!

1571
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:49,041
- Get up, Sishya…
- Your mother--

1572
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,875
Mothers give birth to their children.

1573
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:54,375
My mother gave me life through her death.

1574
01:49:54,541 --> 01:49:56,541
It's time for you to stop this raid.

1575
01:49:56,666 --> 01:49:57,541
Bad luck.

1576
01:49:57,666 --> 01:50:02,625
Once the doctor confirms it,
pack your bags.

1577
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:09,416
Leave the sealed bags behind
and go from here.

1578
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:15,458
Moreover, the party workers, leaders…

1579
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:19,750
ministers, VIPs…

1580
01:50:24,541 --> 01:50:27,000
and even the CM will be arriving soon.

1581
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,791
Grandma!

1582
01:50:35,041 --> 01:50:40,916
You wanted to see me on the silver
screen even if it meant selling your gold.

1583
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:44,750
Wake up, Grandma!

1584
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:48,458
Please look at your grandson once,
Grandma.

1585
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,958
Wake up, Grandma!

1586
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:54,333
Wake up, Grandma!
Wake up!

1587
01:50:54,416 --> 01:50:57,500
Wake up, Grandma!
Wake up!

1588
01:50:57,625 --> 01:51:01,333
Wake up!
Wake up, Grandma!

1589
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:06,250
Grandma woke up!

1590
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,416
Doctor, it's a medical miracle.

1591
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:11,875
Grandma woke up!
Doctor, it's a medical miracle.

1592
01:51:11,958 --> 01:51:14,125
Daddy, Grandma is alive.

1593
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:18,750
It was a cardiac arrest,

1594
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:21,291
but CPR was done at the right time.
Who did this?

1595
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:24,583
My disciple struck her heart
at just the right moment and revived her.

1596
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,958
Truly, your mother is extraordinary.

1597
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:41,208
Not just for you, but for many others,

1598
01:51:41,416 --> 01:51:45,000
as she allowed this raid
to continue and potentially saved lives.

1599
01:51:46,166 --> 01:51:47,125
She's a great woman.

1600
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:54,166
My heartfelt condolences to you
on your mother's recovery.

1601
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:55,958
- Officers…
- Yes, sir!

1602
01:51:56,041 --> 01:51:57,708
- Get back to work!
- Okay, sir!

1603
01:52:00,416 --> 01:52:03,333
I told him to bring a character to life,
but he brought the dead back to life.

1604
01:52:03,666 --> 01:52:06,166
If your mother is alive today,
it's solely due to my training.

1605
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:07,625
Yes, sir.

1606
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
At least increase my
salary from this month, sir.

1607
01:52:10,583 --> 01:52:12,166
Expenses are at an all-time high--

1608
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:15,375
- Grandma…
- What happened, Aunty?

1609
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:19,208
How did I sleep as if I
had taken sleeping pills?

1610
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:28,666
What, Guruji? What’s the news?

1611
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:31,000
Officer Srinivas reporting, sir.

1612
01:52:31,208 --> 01:52:32,625
Why did you take so long to report?

1613
01:52:32,708 --> 01:52:34,458
Yes, sir. I arrived here three months ago.

1614
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:35,875
Actually, what happened is…

1615
01:52:59,583 --> 01:53:00,541
{\an8}What's wrong, dear?

1616
01:53:00,625 --> 01:53:04,000
{\an8}While everyone else is celebrating
Karwa Chauth, you're sitting alone.

1617
01:53:04,333 --> 01:53:07,500
{\an8}If everything had been fine, you would
have been with our son-in-law today.

1618
01:53:08,125 --> 01:53:09,041
{\an8}It's okay.

1619
01:53:09,416 --> 01:53:11,541
{\an8}They say that when the man is not around,
you can look at his picture.

1620
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:14,333
But we perform Karwa Chauth for
the husband's well-being.

1621
01:53:14,541 --> 01:53:16,750
{\an8}- How can she--
- He said a picture is enough, right?

1622
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:19,333
{\an8}We have a picture of our son
at home where he looks like a hero.

1623
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:20,583
{\an8}Come, I'll show you.

1624
01:53:20,666 --> 01:53:22,583
{\an8}- Come… Come!
- Come, dear.

1625
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,833
Jikki, what are you doing here?

1626
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:32,375
Are you thinking of jumping just because
Bachchan didn't come to the wedding?

1627
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:33,958
Life is precious, Jikki.

1628
01:53:34,458 --> 01:53:37,041
They say when God closes a door,
a window opens.

1629
01:53:37,583 --> 01:53:39,291
You should look at the windows.

1630
01:53:42,291 --> 01:53:43,375
Would you come with me?

1631
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:48,125
Where?

1632
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:49,875
Wherever I go!

1633
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:56,791
Shouldn't we inform your dad before
making such a significant decision?

1634
01:53:56,875 --> 01:53:57,791
No need!

1635
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,500
My life, my decision.

1636
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:02,583
Will you come or not?

1637
01:54:07,625 --> 01:54:10,208
I will come anywhere, and do anything.

1638
01:54:10,291 --> 01:54:11,541
Forget about this house.

1639
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:13,000
I have nothing to do with this world!

1640
01:54:13,083 --> 01:54:15,125
Nothing…

1641
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:17,166
You for me

1642
01:54:18,708 --> 01:54:20,416
and me for you. Let's go.

1643
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:23,958
Let's go.

1644
01:54:34,125 --> 01:54:35,250
What the hell!

1645
01:54:36,208 --> 01:54:39,083
You guys have turned my house
into a choultry.

1646
01:54:39,541 --> 01:54:41,625
Go ahead…

1647
01:54:44,416 --> 01:54:45,500
How many days, sir?

1648
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:46,750
No matter how much we search,
we can't find anything.

1649
01:54:46,833 --> 01:54:47,708
Yes, sir.

1650
01:54:47,791 --> 01:54:49,083
- Hello!
- I need to meet Mr. Bachchan.

1651
01:54:49,166 --> 01:54:50,375
How are you coming in without permission?

1652
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:51,875
Inform him that Jikki is here.

1653
01:54:52,083 --> 01:54:53,041
What brings you here?

1654
01:54:53,125 --> 01:54:55,250
I'm Mr. Bachchan's fiancée.

1655
01:54:55,375 --> 01:54:57,166
Sir is inside, ma'am. One minute.

1656
01:55:04,416 --> 01:55:06,541
Jikki. What happened?

1657
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:07,958
Why did you come here?

1658
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:12,250
Jikki!

1659
01:55:13,791 --> 01:55:16,041
What happened, dear?
Tell me what happened.

1660
01:55:29,625 --> 01:55:31,250
This is the last kiss to Bachchan.

1661
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:33,833
Tomorrow Dorababu
will get his first kiss.

1662
01:55:34,125 --> 01:55:35,666
First kiss…

1663
01:55:35,791 --> 01:55:36,916
What happened, dear?

1664
01:55:37,375 --> 01:55:38,625
You can't come.

1665
01:55:39,291 --> 01:55:40,958
I can't stop myself from coming.

1666
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:44,541
Today is our first Karva Chauth.

1667
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:46,958
Everyone sees the moon.

1668
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,833
I came to see you.

1669
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:56,416
What should I do now?

1670
01:55:56,541 --> 01:56:00,125
<i>My heart goes mad without your company…</i>

1671
01:56:00,291 --> 01:56:01,250
Dorababu.

1672
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:02,583
Yes, darling.

1673
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:03,958
Take it.

1674
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:05,208
Silly girl!

1675
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:07,333
Where's the strainer?
The son-in-law is here.

1676
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:19,541
My wedding is the day after tomorrow.
You should come.

1677
01:56:19,625 --> 01:56:20,500
Not possible.

1678
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:25,208
My wedding is on the same day
and at the same time.

1679
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,458
Should I leave?

1680
01:56:31,708 --> 01:56:34,083
You can leave without worry.
I'll come as well.

1681
01:56:43,041 --> 01:56:45,291
Who are you, dear?

1682
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:48,291
It's me, Uncle.

1683
01:56:48,458 --> 01:56:50,916
I'm Mr. Pandey's daughter,
who used to work with you.

1684
01:56:52,083 --> 01:56:54,208
I'm getting married
to Bachchan the day after tomorrow.

1685
01:56:55,666 --> 01:56:57,041
I came here because
today is Karva Chauth--

1686
01:56:57,208 --> 01:56:58,291
It's okay, dear.

1687
01:56:58,791 --> 01:56:59,833
This is your home.

1688
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:02,541
You can come and go anytime you want.

1689
01:57:03,041 --> 01:57:04,833
But your husband might not agree.

1690
01:57:05,166 --> 01:57:06,458
He might talk about rules.

1691
01:57:06,583 --> 01:57:08,750
No one really follows rules here anyway.

1692
01:57:09,083 --> 01:57:10,875
Jikki, please leave now.

1693
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:15,958
You once sent me a nose pin as a
gift in my childhood, with my father.

1694
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:19,583
Can you please send my husband
to my wedding, the day after tomorrow?

1695
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:21,000
Please.

1696
01:57:21,291 --> 01:57:22,500
You silly girl.

1697
01:57:22,791 --> 01:57:26,291
This time, I'll send him along
with a marriage necklace.

1698
01:57:30,166 --> 01:57:32,291
May you have a blessed
and long married life.

1699
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:44,541
<i>I'm so fortunate, Tayaramma…</i>
<i>Tayaramma…</i>

1700
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:49,791
<i>I'm very happy, Tayaramma…</i>
<i>Tayaramma…</i>

1701
01:57:49,916 --> 01:57:54,333
<i>I found him easily, Tayaramma…</i>
<i>Tayaramma…</i>

1702
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:56,375
Well, Mr. Jaghayya, you sing very well.

1703
01:57:56,458 --> 01:57:58,833
Anyway, from tomorrow you'll
have to make a living by singing.

1704
01:57:59,541 --> 01:58:01,375
Meet me after the raid is over.

1705
01:58:01,458 --> 01:58:03,541
I'll give you a chance in our band, okay?

1706
01:58:04,791 --> 01:58:08,458
And don't forget to bring your Tayaramma
with you. You can sing a duet with her.

1707
01:58:08,625 --> 01:58:10,500
A duet. Is that okay?

1708
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:17,875
Why are you talking
to a stranger in the middle of the night?

1709
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,750
I won't like this after our wedding.

1710
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:20,916
Let's go!

1711
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:21,875
Where?

1712
01:58:21,958 --> 01:58:24,458
- Home. Where else?
- Why home? I thought we both…

1713
01:58:24,541 --> 01:58:26,416
Yes, we both are going to my house.

1714
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:28,833
Are you compromising in life, Jikki?

1715
01:58:29,083 --> 01:58:30,500
You are confused.

1716
01:58:30,958 --> 01:58:34,083
If you hurry, you can come on the bike.
Otherwise, you'll have to walk.

1717
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:36,916
We have a long way to go. I'm leaving.

1718
01:58:37,958 --> 01:58:39,375
How can I go that far by walking?

1719
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:42,208
Keep the cash account
and gold account separately.

1720
01:58:42,416 --> 01:58:44,041
- Check.
- After that, I'll tell you what to do.

1721
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:45,000
Okay, sir.

1722
01:58:49,791 --> 01:58:53,083
Is that phone call for you or me?

1723
01:58:53,166 --> 01:58:55,458
Even if it's for you,
please give it to me.

1724
01:58:55,625 --> 01:58:57,541
I'll talk in your presence.

1725
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:02,708
What? Jikki, is it?

1726
01:59:03,875 --> 01:59:04,875
Oh, Jikki!

1727
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:09,833
Why did you guys go there?

1728
01:59:11,708 --> 01:59:12,583
Hey!

1729
01:59:14,166 --> 01:59:17,416
Not right. He's just doing his duty.

1730
01:59:17,875 --> 01:59:18,916
What did you say?

1731
01:59:19,208 --> 01:59:21,416
You’re also doing your duty, are you?

1732
01:59:21,625 --> 01:59:24,083
Why should I get involved?
Sort it out yourselves.

1733
01:59:24,166 --> 01:59:25,041
Here.

1734
01:59:26,875 --> 01:59:30,166
Bachchan, if you stay there,
we'll stay here.

1735
01:59:30,375 --> 01:59:32,458
If you leave that house within the
next 24 hours, we'll leave this house.

1736
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:35,458
You don't have much time. Think about it!

1737
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:41,458
Party workers.

1738
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:44,208
In English, they also call them fans.

1739
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:47,250
It's madness.

1740
01:59:48,208 --> 01:59:50,291
They're obsessed with me.

1741
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:52,125
Crazy enough…

1742
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:55,500
to kill for me.

1743
01:59:57,833 --> 01:59:59,500
Twenty-four hours.

1744
02:00:04,625 --> 02:00:09,916
Tayaramma, you're miraculous.

1745
02:00:45,375 --> 02:00:46,333
Who is that?

1746
02:00:46,625 --> 02:00:48,541
You’ll get to know when I come inside.

1747
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:50,083
Say what you want from there.

1748
02:00:55,125 --> 02:00:57,125
- Matchbox.
- Go.

1749
02:01:24,583 --> 02:01:25,583
Who are you, man?

1750
02:01:25,833 --> 02:01:29,500
If we keep introductions, it will take
seven and a half hours, you dumbo.

1751
02:01:29,666 --> 02:01:31,875
I was very busy. I came
because my brother asked me to come.

1752
02:01:32,083 --> 02:01:36,166
Simply speaking, I’m the Youth Yuvaraj
sent by Mass Maharaaj.

1753
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:40,833
Presenting today’s entertainment
by Siddhu Jonnalagadda,

1754
02:01:40,916 --> 02:01:45,750
Junior Income Tax Officer,
Ayakar Bhavan, Hyderabad, 500032.

1755
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:02,625
Brother breaks the bones
and I break the nerves.

1756
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:18,250
What are you guys eating?
You guys look like double-decker buses.

1757
02:02:18,583 --> 02:02:20,291
My shoulder was going
to dislocate, sister.

1758
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:25,083
Double-decker buses
should be parked on the road.

1759
02:02:25,375 --> 02:02:28,833
If they enter the house
and park here, we won't spare them.

1760
02:02:59,291 --> 02:03:01,583
Hey, according to the
constitution of this country,

1761
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:03,625
indulging in black money
is a punishable offense.

1762
02:03:03,708 --> 02:03:06,333
If I do not eradicate this
kind of cancer from society,

1763
02:03:06,416 --> 02:03:07,791
the nation will go into depression,

1764
02:03:07,875 --> 02:03:10,250
and I will have to resign
from my bloody designation.

1765
02:03:10,458 --> 02:03:11,541
How did I say, dude?

1766
02:03:11,791 --> 02:03:12,750
You didn't understand?

1767
02:03:12,916 --> 02:03:15,041
Try to understand.
Meanwhile, I have to make a call.

1768
02:03:27,958 --> 02:03:31,250
Even if that call is for you,
give it to me. Please.

1769
02:03:35,458 --> 02:03:36,500
Hey, bro.

1770
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:39,833
What? You broke their arms and legs?

1771
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:41,916
I hope you haven't killed them yet.

1772
02:03:42,333 --> 02:03:44,708
What's that?
You're planning to kill them now?

1773
02:03:45,041 --> 02:03:48,458
Well, I'm staying out of it.
Sort it out among yourselves.

1774
02:03:50,833 --> 02:03:52,250
Hey, Jaggu Kaka!

1775
02:03:52,416 --> 02:03:54,000
Your BP will rise
once you hear what I'm saying.

1776
02:03:54,083 --> 02:03:55,708
So keep the tablets next to you.

1777
02:03:55,916 --> 02:03:59,125
I have thrashed the men
sent by you in ten minutes flat.

1778
02:03:59,416 --> 02:04:01,875
If you have more, send them.

1779
02:04:01,958 --> 02:04:03,416
I will stay here,
and Bachchan will stay there.

1780
02:04:03,708 --> 02:04:06,291
If it itches down under,
you should scratch your top.

1781
02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:08,625
We’ll both be on duty,
keeping a close eye on you going forward!

1782
02:04:09,708 --> 02:04:10,958
The wedding is planned here.

1783
02:04:11,041 --> 02:04:13,708
All the stuff should be set
in its own place. Do it quickly!

1784
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:27,250
Excuse me, Jikki madam.
If you don't mind, please.

1785
02:04:27,541 --> 02:04:31,041
- Do you have any sisters?
- No, why?

1786
02:04:31,125 --> 02:04:32,333
Just fitting the map into the gap.

1787
02:04:32,416 --> 02:04:34,916
The younger brother's procession
at the elder brother's wedding.

1788
02:04:35,791 --> 02:04:38,916
Check and search. Find someone for me.

1789
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,250
I don’t have many requirements.
If she is shorter than me, that's enough.

1790
02:04:42,625 --> 02:04:45,583
Please, if you don't mind.
Thank you. Take care.

1791
02:04:52,916 --> 02:04:55,250
It seems Uncle is upset because he doesn't
have a younger daughter.

1792
02:04:57,125 --> 02:04:58,083
Buddies.

1793
02:04:58,750 --> 02:05:00,041
They also call them friends in English.

1794
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:03,666
If you have fans, I have friends

1795
02:05:04,208 --> 02:05:06,541
who are willing to give their lives

1796
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:10,416
or take a life for me if needed.

1797
02:05:22,291 --> 02:05:25,291
You're playing with fire
by locking the lion in its den.

1798
02:05:26,208 --> 02:05:29,500
The moment I step out of this
house, you'll have to deal with it.

1799
02:05:29,583 --> 02:05:31,416
Why wait for one day?
You can step out now.

1800
02:05:32,416 --> 02:05:36,583
Use your position,
power, might, and people

1801
02:05:36,666 --> 02:05:38,625
to stop me if you dare.

1802
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:40,333
I will.

1803
02:05:41,416 --> 02:05:43,958
I will give you hell.

1804
02:05:44,375 --> 02:05:47,416
If you do that,
I will resign and sit at home.

1805
02:05:47,541 --> 02:05:50,250
Or else, I will ensure that
you sit in Tihar Jail.

1806
02:06:06,916 --> 02:06:10,083
I don't think it is correct
to send him out currently, sir.

1807
02:06:10,333 --> 02:06:13,250
You can’t break into the snake’s den
unless it comes out.

1808
02:06:13,333 --> 02:06:17,125
We can’t get the people in the household
to talk unless he steps out.

1809
02:06:40,375 --> 02:06:41,791
Sir, the CM is calling you inside.

1810
02:06:41,958 --> 02:06:44,916
Hey, tell him to come out.
Today, I want to make or break things.

1811
02:06:45,916 --> 02:06:47,000
Bloody hell…

1812
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,875
What's up, Jaghayya?

1813
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,083
Everything alright?

1814
02:06:53,166 --> 02:06:55,041
Why would I come here
if everything were alright?

1815
02:06:55,625 --> 02:06:58,708
The Income Tax Department
is governed by the central government.

1816
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,416
You would know the rules
if you were educated.

1817
02:07:00,916 --> 02:07:03,333
The guy in the ruling party
doesn't follow the rules.

1818
02:07:03,541 --> 02:07:05,375
Call him immediately
and stop all the raids!

1819
02:07:21,083 --> 02:07:23,250
- Hello.
- Am I speaking to Mr. Bachchan?

1820
02:07:23,375 --> 02:07:25,125
Yes, Mr. Bachchan speaking.

1821
02:07:25,208 --> 02:07:27,000
This call is from the CM's office.

1822
02:07:27,166 --> 02:07:29,250
The Chief Minister would
like to speak with you.

1823
02:07:29,458 --> 02:07:30,666
The Chief Minister?

1824
02:07:31,166 --> 02:07:32,541
<i>Yes. One second.</i>

1825
02:07:33,458 --> 02:07:34,333
<i>Sir.</i>

1826
02:07:35,583 --> 02:07:39,083
Is it true that raids are being conducted
at Muthyam Jaghayya's house?

1827
02:07:39,166 --> 02:07:40,041
You…

1828
02:07:40,125 --> 02:07:41,000
Yes, sir.

1829
02:07:41,083 --> 02:07:43,083
Stop them immediately and leave at once.

1830
02:07:43,833 --> 02:07:46,333
Sorry, sir. Our department operates under
the authority of the central government.

1831
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,458
You are challenging the Chief Minister.

1832
02:07:48,875 --> 02:07:50,708
No, sir. I'm reminding you.

1833
02:07:50,791 --> 02:07:53,541
I’m reminding a Chief Minister
of his limitations.

1834
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:56,166
The state officials, ministers,

1835
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:58,666
and even the Chief Minister
cannot stop us.

1836
02:07:58,791 --> 02:08:00,708
What do you hope to achieve
by challenging influential people?

1837
02:08:00,875 --> 02:08:02,333
Want to demonstrate
the power of the system

1838
02:08:02,416 --> 02:08:04,708
when there's an officer
capable of cleaning it up.

1839
02:08:04,875 --> 02:08:08,125
- If I decide now, immediately--
- Please do.

1840
02:08:10,916 --> 02:08:12,625
- Shall we make the PM office call once?
- Hey!

1841
02:08:14,625 --> 02:08:15,500
Shame on you!

1842
02:08:16,958 --> 02:08:19,791
He calls himself a CM? How sad!

1843
02:08:37,958 --> 02:08:39,333
He's like a pure gem, right?

1844
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:02,125
Hello!

1845
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:04,583
Hello? Hello…

1846
02:09:14,458 --> 02:09:17,416
We won't face any trouble because
of this witness's signature, right?

1847
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:18,875
Your sir is like a God to you, right?

1848
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,375
Why would you have trouble with God?

1849
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
- Raju Garu,
- Sir.

1850
02:09:25,083 --> 02:09:26,958
please make three copies of this,
prepare an order, and send them to me.

1851
02:09:27,041 --> 02:09:27,916
Okay, sir.

1852
02:09:49,125 --> 02:09:51,375
{\an8}- Hello.
- This is the Prime Minister speaking.

1853
02:09:51,458 --> 02:09:53,125
Good morning, Mr. Prime Minister.

1854
02:09:53,666 --> 02:09:56,375
Even God cannot save him this time.

1855
02:09:56,583 --> 02:09:58,291
Is there any possibility
to stop the raids?

1856
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,541
Yes, sir.
We can stop with your order, sir.

1857
02:10:00,625 --> 02:10:02,625
- Please stop the raids right now.
- Sure, sir.

1858
02:10:02,833 --> 02:10:04,041
When can I expect the orders?

1859
02:10:06,083 --> 02:10:06,958
{\an8}What do you mean?

1860
02:10:07,041 --> 02:10:07,916
{\an8}PRIME MINISTER

1861
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,750
I need written orders from you, sir,

1862
02:10:10,125 --> 02:10:11,250
and I mean it.

1863
02:10:12,666 --> 02:10:14,291
This is my personal order.

1864
02:10:15,291 --> 02:10:18,000
If you’re calling it a personal order,
it suggests there’s something wrong here

1865
02:10:18,291 --> 02:10:20,375
or that you have
a personal connection with me.

1866
02:10:20,541 --> 02:10:23,541
I neither engage in wrongdoing
nor allow anyone to get close to me.

1867
02:10:24,833 --> 02:10:26,541
My office will get in touch
with you later.

1868
02:10:26,791 --> 02:10:29,916
This raid will not cease
until I receive a written order.

1869
02:10:33,791 --> 02:10:35,750
We’ve heard everything you’ve said so far.

1870
02:10:36,458 --> 02:10:38,541
Everyone has cooperated with you.

1871
02:10:39,166 --> 02:10:42,791
Please ensure
that no disaster occurs in the house.

1872
02:10:45,625 --> 02:10:47,875
He’s requesting a written order
that we cannot provide.

1873
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,125
{\an8}- Why is that not possible?!
- Excuse me!

1874
02:10:50,958 --> 02:10:52,958
I also belong to your party.

1875
02:10:53,375 --> 02:10:55,958
It's your responsibility to protect me.

1876
02:10:57,541 --> 02:11:01,875
Without me, neither you
nor your party will survive in our area.

1877
02:11:02,458 --> 02:11:04,166
Is there any other appointment today?

1878
02:11:04,458 --> 02:11:06,958
Delegates have arrived
from Italy to discuss the defense deal.

1879
02:11:07,208 --> 02:11:08,083
Call them.

1880
02:11:08,166 --> 02:11:09,041
Okay, sir.

1881
02:11:39,666 --> 02:11:42,000
Recheck everything
and arrange for the vehicle.

1882
02:11:42,083 --> 02:11:42,958
- Okay, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1883
02:11:54,208 --> 02:11:55,083
Hello?

1884
02:11:55,375 --> 02:11:57,416
Bachchan's duty here
is a resounding success.

1885
02:11:57,625 --> 02:11:59,375
Now, only the husband’s role remains.

1886
02:11:59,625 --> 02:12:00,708
Are you okay?

1887
02:12:00,833 --> 02:12:03,541
Hello, this is Mr. Bachchan.

1888
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:08,541
Master, in a few hours,
I will become Mrs. Bachchan.

1889
02:12:13,291 --> 02:12:16,125
<i>Suvvaala Suvvi!</i>

1890
02:12:16,208 --> 02:12:18,916
<i>Suvvi!</i>

1891
02:12:20,791 --> 02:12:26,958
<i>You gave a piercing look</i>

1892
02:12:28,416 --> 02:12:34,708
<i>And created a stir with your smile</i>

1893
02:12:34,958 --> 02:12:39,583
<i>Hey, oh, my boy…</i>
<i>Can I trust your word?</i>

1894
02:12:39,666 --> 02:12:44,166
<i>Can praise be given like this?</i>
<i>Can the cheek be pinched?</i>

1895
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:48,500
<i>Oh my…</i>
<i>You can cause confusion</i>

1896
02:12:48,583 --> 02:12:53,041
<i>And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness</i>

1897
02:13:02,291 --> 02:13:06,916
<i>The white sari with the black border</i>
<i>Has caused chaos</i>

1898
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,416
<i>The white sari with the black border</i>
<i>Has caused chaos</i>

1899
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,791
<i>In the smoother waistline</i>
<i>Affairs become turbulent</i>

1900
02:13:19,875 --> 02:13:22,708
<i>Your makeup has ignited a fire</i>

1901
02:13:23,041 --> 02:13:27,541
<i>Hey, oh, my boy…</i>
<i>Can I trust your word?</i>

1902
02:13:27,625 --> 02:13:32,375
<i>Can praise be given like this?</i>
<i>Can the cheek be pinched?</i>

1903
02:13:32,458 --> 02:13:36,625
<i>Oh my…</i>
<i>You can cause confusion</i>

1904
02:13:36,708 --> 02:13:40,416
<i>And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness</i>

1905
02:13:41,708 --> 02:13:46,083
<i>The white sari with the black border</i>
<i>Has caused chaos</i>

1906
02:13:46,166 --> 02:13:50,208
<i>In the smoother waistline</i>
<i>Affairs become turbulent</i>

1907
02:13:50,291 --> 02:13:53,416
<i>Your makeup has ignited a fire</i>

1908
02:13:53,583 --> 02:13:58,083
<i>Hey, oh, my boy…</i>
<i>Can I trust your word?</i>

1909
02:13:58,166 --> 02:14:02,916
<i>Can praise be given like this?</i>
<i>Can the cheek be pinched?</i>

1910
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,166
<i>Oh my…</i>
<i>You can cause confusion</i>

1911
02:14:07,250 --> 02:14:11,000
<i>And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness</i>

1912
02:14:11,916 --> 02:14:15,958
<i>The mole that you hid…</i>
<i>Can I see it?</i>

1913
02:14:16,041 --> 02:14:20,500
<i>Hey, oh, my boy…</i>
<i>You shouldn't ask me everything</i>

1914
02:14:20,583 --> 02:14:24,666
<i>There is heat in the body</i>
<i>So I pinched you with my nail</i>

1915
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:29,291
<i>Can you stir up a quarrel</i>
<i>Between youth and beauty?</i>

1916
02:14:29,375 --> 02:14:33,958
<i>Fuss in the hearts</i>
<i>Your passion has gotten to me</i>

1917
02:14:34,041 --> 02:14:37,208
<i>Can there be any limits to beauty?</i>

1918
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
<i>You came like a bee…</i>
<i>Trying to steal honey from my lips</i>

1919
02:15:08,125 --> 02:15:12,875
<i>Hey, oh, my boy…</i>
<i>You shouldn't ask me everything</i>

1920
02:15:12,958 --> 02:15:17,125
<i>Your nose pin is green…</i>
<i>And you wore something very lovely</i>

1921
02:15:17,416 --> 02:15:21,583
<i>Is it fair to hang</i>
<i>With hair like electric wires?</i>

1922
02:15:21,666 --> 02:15:26,291
<i>I’ve seen all the weights</i>
<i>Can I weigh some</i>

1923
02:15:26,416 --> 02:15:29,583
<i>Sensitive and solo heart</i>
<i>Here I come</i>

1924
02:15:29,666 --> 02:15:34,125
<i>Hey, oh, my boy…</i>
<i>Can I trust your word?</i>

1925
02:15:34,208 --> 02:15:38,916
<i>Can praise be given like this?</i>
<i>Can the cheek be pinched?</i>

1926
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,208
<i>Oh my…</i>
<i>You can cause confusion</i>

1927
02:15:43,291 --> 02:15:47,000
<i>And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness</i>

1928
02:16:24,291 --> 02:16:26,041
We’ve sealed everything
that was confiscated.

1929
02:16:26,333 --> 02:16:27,333
Please sign here.

1930
02:16:43,375 --> 02:16:45,125
If I’m taking so much from you,

1931
02:16:45,291 --> 02:16:46,583
I should give something back, right?

1932
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,875
That’s why,
here’s a small piece of advice.

1933
02:16:50,083 --> 02:16:52,791
Wealth isn’t just about
accumulating money.

1934
02:16:53,125 --> 02:16:55,125
It also means gaining people
who genuinely care for us.

1935
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:59,041
None of those you trusted stood by you,

1936
02:16:59,791 --> 02:17:03,083
but these officers,
who are unrelated to me, did.

1937
02:17:04,208 --> 02:17:06,708
In this way, I’ve gained more than you.

1938
02:17:07,041 --> 02:17:08,208
Goodbye.

1939
02:17:30,333 --> 02:17:32,708
How long until my son-in-law arrives?

1940
02:17:32,791 --> 02:17:35,333
He must be tied up with some work.
He will come. Let me go check.

1941
02:17:35,416 --> 02:17:36,666
Okay.

1942
02:17:42,791 --> 02:17:44,208
- This is the best raid of our careers.
- I haven't seen a raid

1943
02:17:44,291 --> 02:17:45,583
like this in my long career.

1944
02:17:45,708 --> 02:17:46,833
Drive faster.

1945
02:17:47,083 --> 02:17:49,333
I need to get married.
My wife is waiting.

1946
02:17:58,833 --> 02:18:00,166
Brother, why did you let him go?

1947
02:18:00,291 --> 02:18:04,291
Sambashiva, fate is very ironic.

1948
02:18:10,916 --> 02:18:14,375
For me, this house
is just like this place.

1949
02:18:17,166 --> 02:18:21,583
He can leave the house,
but not this place.

1950
02:18:31,083 --> 02:18:33,750
The entire country knows
what happened in our house.

1951
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,666
We can’t take any action against him here.

1952
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:44,833
Drive faster! Faster…

1953
02:18:44,916 --> 02:18:47,375
It’s a hassle. Only the name
of the victim gets mentioned,

1954
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:50,041
not the name of the killer.

1955
02:18:53,375 --> 02:18:56,041
That's India's history…

1956
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:58,625
and future.

1957
02:20:53,833 --> 02:20:55,791
Please continue chanting the mantras.
Meanwhile, he will arrive.

1958
02:20:55,916 --> 02:20:57,166
He'll be here.

1959
02:21:45,208 --> 02:21:46,458
Mr. Suryan,

1960
02:21:46,625 --> 02:21:47,708
the auspicious time is approaching.

1961
02:21:47,791 --> 02:21:48,916
- Time is running out.
- Where is the groom?

1962
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,916
- He hasn't arrived yet.
- Sister-in-law, he will come.

1963
02:21:51,250 --> 02:21:52,291
- Dear…
- Come here.

1964
02:21:52,458 --> 02:21:53,375
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1965
02:21:53,458 --> 02:21:54,750
Isn’t he here yet? What happened?

1966
02:21:54,833 --> 02:21:57,000
Don't worry. He must've gone
to the office. He'll be here soon.

1967
02:21:57,083 --> 02:21:59,375
- Find out where he is. Go!
- Okay.

1968
02:21:59,458 --> 02:22:00,416
He is coming.

1969
02:22:37,583 --> 02:22:38,458
Sir!

1970
02:22:45,583 --> 02:22:46,500
Sir.

1971
02:23:12,583 --> 02:23:14,000
Where is the money?

1972
02:24:33,166 --> 02:24:34,541
Confiscate all the money!

1973
02:24:34,666 --> 02:24:36,500
{\an8}- Go.
- Take all the money out.

1974
02:24:36,583 --> 02:24:37,458
{\an8}Yes, sir.

1975
02:24:41,625 --> 02:24:42,666
Jikki…

1976
02:24:45,375 --> 02:24:46,541
I'm here!

1977
02:25:45,458 --> 02:25:46,375
Shall we get married?

1978
02:25:57,375 --> 02:25:59,000
Jaghayya threatened to kill me

1979
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:01,541
if I didn't secure an MLA ticket
for his brother.

1980
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:03,750
What makes him think
that he's so powerful?

1981
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,750
Simple. Financial and muscle power, sir.

1982
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:10,875
Alright. Let’s hit him with the same.

1983
02:26:11,208 --> 02:26:13,166
- What do you mean?
- An income tax raid.

1984
02:26:14,541 --> 02:26:16,708
He can bribe and buy out anyone, sir.

1985
02:26:18,083 --> 02:26:19,833
There's one officer
who can't be bought.

1986
02:26:20,166 --> 02:26:22,291
He is Mr. Bachchan.

1987
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:35,500
You started from the interval,
and now we’re at the climax.

1988
02:26:35,833 --> 02:26:38,083
Have you ever wondered
what gives me such courage?

1989
02:26:39,708 --> 02:26:42,583
It's honesty. Courage comes from honesty.

1990
02:26:46,166 --> 02:26:47,416
Otherwise, think about it and let me know,

1991
02:26:47,625 --> 02:26:48,750
now that you have plenty of time.

1992
02:26:58,250 --> 02:27:03,250
I’ve heard that a cart
can become a ship and vice versa.

1993
02:27:03,666 --> 02:27:05,875
But I never thought
it could happen in life.

1994
02:27:06,041 --> 02:27:09,291
Give me a cigarette, please.
I’m craving one.

1995
02:27:11,916 --> 02:27:14,666
<i>Wealth isn’t just about</i>
<i>accumulating money.</i>

1996
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,166
<i>It also means gaining people</i>
<i>who genuinely care for us.</i>

1997
02:27:22,541 --> 02:27:27,416
<i>The wealth accumulated has slipped away</i>

1998
02:27:27,833 --> 02:27:32,583
<i>I’ve ended up in a place</i>
<i>I never imagined I’d reach</i>

1999
02:27:32,875 --> 02:27:35,375
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

2000
02:27:35,875 --> 02:27:40,875
<i>I’ve lost everything</i>
<i>By the time I realized this</i>

2001
02:27:41,458 --> 02:27:44,375
<i>By the time I realized this, Tayaramma…</i>

2002
02:27:44,625 --> 02:27:46,333
<i>Tayaramma…</i>

2003
02:27:55,291 --> 02:27:57,166
Why are Amitabh Bachchan’s pictures
here too, Dad?

2004
02:27:57,708 --> 02:27:59,166
If it happens in his presence,

2005
02:27:59,250 --> 02:28:01,416
maybe I’ll get a grandson
like Amitabh Bachchan.

2006
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:02,541
I’m Bachchan myself.

2007
02:28:02,625 --> 02:28:03,958
If one is born,
it could be Abhishek Bachchan.

2008
02:28:04,041 --> 02:28:07,625
- Even better. Goodbye. Bye.
- Now go. Shut the door.

2009
02:28:07,791 --> 02:28:08,833
Don't come back.

2010
02:28:09,708 --> 02:28:12,625
It's already too late. Come here…
