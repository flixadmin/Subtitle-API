1
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,791
Let me go!

2
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,583
Let me go!

3
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,000
Let me go!

4
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,125
Leave me…

5
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,375
Release me!

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,208
Let go of me!

7
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,958
It's confirmed, boss. He's our target.

8
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,791
No…

9
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,416
Don't kill me.

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,916
Hey! Ask him to text me
after transferring the money.

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,916
Okay.

12
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,250
Where is that guy? What's he doing inside?

13
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,958
He may land us in trouble.

14
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,041
What, boss?

15
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,000
-Boss, my foot!
-Okay, boss.

16
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,916
Breaking news for our viewers!

17
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,125
The news I'm about to share
has never happened earlier in this area.

18
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,208
It's a rampage all around.

19
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:47,208
A hyena has been spotted here.

20
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,750
Saffron TV will give you
live updates by the minute.

21
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,458
People from nearby villages
have gathered here.

22
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,500
We have no idea
what the hyena is going to do.

23
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,500
Tell me, Joshy.

24
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,083
Sathya, I'm trying to reach Parthiban.

25
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,791
His phone is not reachable. Where is he?

26
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,083
He must have gone
to drop Siddhu at school.

27
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,166
Try calling Siddhu.
His phone will be in the car.

28
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,833
If he gets in touch,
please ask him to call me.

29
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,250
Handle this properly!

30
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,208
Place a barricade there. Hurry up!

31
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,333
-Kumar.
-Sir?

32
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,708
-What's happening?
-Sir, nothing's right here. Everything…

33
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,625
Sir, nothing is right here.

34
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,083
-If it continues, many will be injured.
-Whom have they sent?

35
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,458
Two experts have come
from Wild Life SOS team.

36
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,333
They've handled only cheetahs,
but this is a hyena.

37
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,583
Nobody knows how to handle this, sir.

38
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,083
Parthiban, we have a situation.
It's an emergency.

39
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,666
Can you come here?

40
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,750
All right, first, see the photo
that I've sent you.

41
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,583
Footprints are large.

42
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:08,166
Maybe it's a spotted hyena.
If so, it will be extremely ferocious.

43
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,458
Okay. How soon can you get here?

44
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,333
Promise me, you won't tell your mom
that you were late for school today.

45
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,125
You promise me that you won't tell mom

46
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,875
that I took my phone to school
just for today.

47
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,500
Please, Dad!

48
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,750
The situation
is not under control, Parthiban.

49
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,750
Hyenas are social animals, Joshy.

50
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,458
They live in packs.

51
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,041
If a hyena is alone here,
either it has lost its way

52
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,375
or the rest of its clan is dead.
People will fear it and try to kill it.

53
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,833
But we have to think
how we can capture it alive.

54
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,833
If you think like your men,
it will feast on us happily.

55
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,291
What to do now? What are you suggesting?

56
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,166
Walkie-Talkie.

57
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,458
-Hey, Channel 3. We are on Channel 3.
-Got it.

58
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,375
Dad, I'll come along. I'll be helpful.

59
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,750
Stay in the car, my dear son.

60
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,916
That will be the biggest help.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,291
I don't want to get chided by your mom.

62
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,416
Okay?

63
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,750
Put it! Put up the barricades.

64
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,166
Push it here, quickly. Hurry up. Come on.

65
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,166
-Why did you place the barricades?
-DFO's orders, sir.

66
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,458
Watch out.

67
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,625
What are you looking at? Do it now.

68
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,041
Sir, why did you place
the barricades here?

69
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,166
The animal will barge into the school.
It's very risky. Please remove it.

70
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,000
Ranger, listen to me.

71
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,625
I'll give you my uniform.
Do my job as well.

72
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,000
Hey! What are you all looking at?

73
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,791
-Place the barricade properly.
-Come in, Parthiban.

74
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,541
-Yeah, Joshy.
-They think it's a joke. Such a mess!

75
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,375
I don't know what to do.
The situation is out of control.

76
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,708
Get a tranquilizer from the sanctuary.

77
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,125
I'll tell you when to fire
and from where.

78
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,333
Yes, okay.

79
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,958
Catch it…

80
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,375
It's scared and is looking
for a place to hide.

81
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,333
They are trying to kill it
without understanding that.

82
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,208
If this continues,
the hyena will enter the school.

83
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,875
Bring the tranquilizer
to the west end of the school.

84
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,000
Help!

85
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,500
Help…

86
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,458
All the kids should go in!

87
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,458
All the kids should go in!

88
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,666
Kids, get inside!

89
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,666
Students,
go to your classrooms immediately.

90
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,375
It's an emergency! Teachers and staff!

91
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,250
Please take all the children
safely into the classroom.

92
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,041
There is no time. Hurry up!

93
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,791
Get in…

94
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,958
Go. Get in!

95
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,958
I got permission for a tranquilizer gun.
I'm taking it, okay?

96
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,208
Okay, sir.

97
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,541
Parthiban.

98
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,375
I'm in position.

99
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,875
Joshy, wait!

100
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,583
Don't aim at its neck
like our usual procedure.

101
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,583
Its striking force will be as heavy
as its pitch of laughter.

102
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,041
Aim for the lungs!

103
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,291
Shoot.

104
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,250
Darn.

105
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,416
-Hang on.
-This is the perfect time. Shoot, Joshy.

106
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,666
The gun is jammed, Parthiban.

107
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,541
A gun can't adapt
to the situation and operate.

108
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,291
It's a machine.
You need to service it every month.

109
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,250
-Siddhu?
-Dad.

110
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,458
Get your spear.

111
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,250
-Give your shoe lace to Joshy.
-Okay, Dad.

112
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,625
-Don't go…
-Run away.

113
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,958
You heard your dad, right?

114
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
Give me your shoe laces.

115
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,375
-Uncle, give the javelin to me.
-What?

116
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,625
Get inside!

117
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,166
Let's go!

118
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,500
Parthiban, the spear you asked for
is on its way.

119
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,125
-Tell my dad that I'm throwing it.
-Parthiban, here it comes!

120
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,375
Hey, come on, move.

121
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,708
Who is that man?

122
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,250
His name is Parthiban.

123
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,041
He's from Tamil Nadu.

124
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,750
Animal rescuer.

125
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,083
He runs a coffee shop nearby.

126
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,125
Hey!

127
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,000
-Get inside.
-Please, sir.

128
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,375
Come on, start.

129
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,833
Wait a minute.

130
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,875
Ask the questions in an order.
The DFO will answer you.

131
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,750
Look. This issue is not something
out of the ordinary.

132
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,375
It is our daily job.

133
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,083
Animals migrate
in search of food and water…

134
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,666
We've got exclusive news.
Why are you here instead of covering it?

135
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,416
There's nothing to cover here.
These forest officers didn't do anything.

136
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,958
A middle-aged man in a white shirt
that was tucked in.

137
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,000
Find him and get
the real information from him.

138
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,458
That is exclusive.

139
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,083
-White shirt. Middle-aged man?
-Yes.

140
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,166
Where do I find him in this crowd?

141
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,375
Thalapathy

142
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,666
His entry spells power

143
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,625
Who is our brother? Thalapathy!

144
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,291
You wanted a shirt urgently.

145
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,541
-What happened, sir?
-Stitch it and bring it.

146
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,208
-What's this? It's blood-stained.
-Stitch it.

147
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,750
My life is in this town

148
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,208
And I ain't going down

149
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,625
You think that I'm crazy

150
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,000
But I don't want the crown

151
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,458
My life is in this town

152
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,958
And I ain't going down

153
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,208
You think that I'm crazy

154
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,291
But I don't want the crown

155
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,458
I'm just an ordinary person

156
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:32,875
Yeah!

157
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,791
I'm just a peace-loving soul

158
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm just an ordinary person

159
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,583
Yeah!

160
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,666
I'm just a peace-loving soul

161
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,375
-Hi, chief.
-Hi.

162
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,958
-Morning.
-Morning, sir.

163
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,416
In this town…

164
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,750
Hi, Thalapathy!

165
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,083
My life is in this town

166
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,083
And I ain't going down…

167
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,041
Why isn't the temperature increasing?

168
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:18,375
Some problem with the thermostat, sir.
I've called them the service team.

169
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,666
They will visit today.

170
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,541
-The cakes are ready for delivery.
-Okay.

171
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,125
Can we dispatch them, sir?

172
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,541
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

173
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,333
Just an ordinary person

174
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,750
Yeah

175
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,625
I'm just a peace-loving soul

176
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,708
I'm just an ordinary person

177
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,708
Yeah, I'm just a…

178
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,875
Sir, this shirt is ripped badly.
It can't be stitched.

179
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,333
Do you know which shop
my wife bought this from?

180
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,833
-I don't know.
-I'm in trouble.

181
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,500
Hey, what's going on?
How did the police get our photos?

182
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,666
They are checking
at the borders and checkpoints.

183
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,041
The men who told us to kill the collector
betrayed us and double-crossed us.

184
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,916
Not only that, they leaked our photos.

185
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,250
Don't go out for a week. Hide yourself.

186
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,750
Please don't get caught.

187
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,541
Meanwhile, I'll do something.
Stay hidden.

188
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,291
What do you mean?
Where can we go right away?

189
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,708
The four of us have no clue where we are
and what is happening.

190
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,958
We trusted you and came here,
you got us into trouble.

191
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,083
Do you think I'm mad?

192
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,000
We can't go anywhere
with our pockets empty.

193
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,333
We can't hide anywhere.
Arrange for us to come there.

194
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,833
Please understand the situation.

195
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,041
All those against the collector
are being targeted.

196
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,458
It will take more than a week
to get support from the center.

197
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,833
Don't call up till I call you.

198
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,541
-Bye!
-Hey…

199
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,708
Hey! Why are you looking at me?
Eyes on the road!

200
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,875
What, boss?

201
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,958
In the early hours of yesterday morning,

202
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,166
some unknown men broke
into the collector's guesthouse

203
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,791
have throat-slit and brutally murdered…

204
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,166
You didn't get ready yet?

205
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,375
Oh, my shirt?

206
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:06,625
I spilt chocolate on it,
so I put it to wash and changed…

207
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,666
I bought you that shirt
for our anniversary with so much love.

208
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,291
You've ruined it in every way possible.

209
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,541
I have nothing to say now, let it be.

210
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,083
My mood won't change today
no matter what excuse you give.

211
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,458
Do whatever you want.

212
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,458
There's no change in my plan.

213
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,333
I'm leaving in an angry mood.

214
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,666
Half of my soul is yours for infinity

215
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,416
Half of yours is mine for eternity

216
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:10,000
Only love as weapon is the counterpart

217
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,458
In a brave warrior's heart

218
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,833
Though my hair has streaks of gray…

219
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,166
Shall we pick up the kids from school?

220
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,583
You are the love of my life…

221
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,833
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

222
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:26,958
-Yes.
-Hi.

223
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,125
Yes, tell me.

224
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,916
Chintu…

225
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,000
M-Mathi's mother is unwell.

226
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,041
Siddharth's father isn't well.

227
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,708
I want to take her home.

228
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,791
-Who are you?
-His mom.

229
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,041
Her dad.

230
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:44,000
If pure dew unites with a storm volatile

231
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,666
Love's warmth will protect all the while

232
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,458
Only love…

233
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,041
-A small peg?
-No, I don't drink.

234
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,916
-It's healthy and good for the weather.
-Really?

235
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,416
-How do you drink this, sir?
-True that!

236
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,541
Dad.

237
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,500
We will be adopting this hyena.

238
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,083
What name would you suggest for it?

239
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,791
Elsa.

240
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,708
Ghost.

241
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,458
Hachiku.

242
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,541
I'll suggest a name,
but you guys shouldn't laugh.

243
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,000
Actually, Subramani sounds good, right?

244
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,791
Wrinkles, as we grow old together…

245
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,208
Look ahead!

246
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,583
I want you with me forever

247
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,666
Only love as weapon

248
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,333
Your heartbeats year after year…

249
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,250
-Chintu, come here.
-No, no.

250
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,208
-Come on, it's okay.
-Okay, go.

251
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,625
Slowly.

252
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:17,916
Come.

253
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,916
You'll hug me, with your chest
as my divine headrest…

254
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,500
Do you like him?

255
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,750
Weapon of love is yours to favor

256
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,708
Always the brave warrior forever and ever

257
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,125
Open it.

258
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,041
Chintu.

259
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
Sir.. No, you're not supposed to help.

260
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,541
Please wait.

261
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,125
Go! Hurry!

262
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,791
Sir, no.

263
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,666
-Is the shop on the left or right?
-Over there, sir.

264
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,250
Give me the bill.

265
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,208
Sir, your shop seems empty.
When do you have regular consumers?

266
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,375
They will come after 6:00 p.m.

267
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,833
-Good day, sir.
-Bye.

268
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,250
Staying here is risky.

269
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,958
There's nobody to loot.
Shall we go elsewhere?

270
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,583
We'll wait till nightfall.

271
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,708
Six o'clock.

272
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,833
He and his useless thugs
will be the death of me.

273
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,041
Everyone on the road is panic-stricken
and running around.

274
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,291
At that time, the serial killer
stands in the middle of the road

275
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,875
and shoots blindly.

276
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,250
There's already a pile of corpses
on the road.

277
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,875
He is notorious.
He shoots whomever he sees.

278
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,875
At that time, a brave and bold
police officer arrives

279
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,125
and fires at the serial killer.

280
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,833
The serial killer runs and hides.

281
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,375
The police officer reloads the gun

282
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,125
and in that gap, the serial killer fires.

283
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,125
Hey…

284
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:43,041
So the wounded police officer
falls at your feet.

285
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:47,291
He falls at the place where
you were safely hiding behind the car.

286
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:52,000
Now the police officer's gun
is in your hand

287
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,333
and you have a clean shot.

288
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,416
The serial killer doesn't know
that you are there

289
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,083
but you can easily shoot him
from your position.

290
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,500
We got only Rs. 300.

291
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,458
And just this phone.

292
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,416
Hey! Get rid of this
and look for a bigger car.

293
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,500
And you have an easy way out.

294
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,416
You can even escape
without being seen by anyone.

295
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,083
What will you do? Picture yourself.

296
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,166
I'll just sleep.

297
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,500
Oh! Will you just sleep?

298
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,791
-Yes.
-Siddhu, it's getting late. Go to bed.

299
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,166
Wait, Mom. Just a couple of minutes.

300
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll take the easy way out
and bring in more police officers.

301
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,125
No, by then, the serial killer
will kill more innocent people.

302
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,666
When the moon sails by
In the night blue sky

303
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:47,541
She showers love and makes me yearn…

304
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,458
I'll give the gun to the police officer.

305
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,000
And say,
'Look, here's a clear shot, fire.'

306
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,791
He's bleeding, dude. How can he shoot?

307
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,666
Picture yourself.

308
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,666
P-Please help…

309
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,250
-What is the number?
-Please!

310
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,583
She's a nuisance…

311
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,708
-Hello? Wait.
-Where are you, dear?

312
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,000
Here.

313
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,250
Ask him for the ATM PIN.
Tell him I'll kill him otherwise.

314
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,458
-We can't move due to the police.
-Tell me.

315
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,416
-Please do--
-Hey! Don't raise your voice at me!

316
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,041
I would've been better off
marrying a tree instead.

317
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,291
Help me!

318
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,958
-PIN?
-Please don't hurt me.

319
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,833
-What's the PIN?
-Don't hurt me.

320
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,791
-What's the PIN?
-Please.

321
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,041
-No.
-What's the PIN?

322
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,541
Please don't.

323
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,250
Then I'll shoot him myself.

324
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,541
If you shoot him,
you'll also become a murderer.

325
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:11,416
It is against the law.
Think of something else.

326
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,583
Picture yourself.

327
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,250
Hey! Why did you shoot him?

328
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,708
How did you get this gun?

329
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,500
-PIN?
-What?

330
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:21,833
PIN?

331
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,708
I don't know what else to say, Dad.

332
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,625
Whichever way you see it,
my hands will be blood stained.

333
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:33,166
How does it matter if it's the blood
of a saint or a sinner?

334
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,500
Siddhu, go.
Go upstairs and sleep, It's getting late.

335
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,125
Chintu, come.

336
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,458
Dad!

337
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,791
Dad!

338
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,333
The only option is to shoot him.

339
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,916
Whom do you intend to shoot?

340
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,875
The killer in the picture-yourself story.

341
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,458
Picture yourself?

342
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,708
I already told you.
Then you'll also be a murderer.

343
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,166
You'll end up in jail.
You can't even sleep peacefully.

344
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,083
Is that okay?

345
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,458
I won't be sent to jail.
I'll be sent to a juvenile home.

346
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,500
And if I'm lucky,
I'll get a sewing machine.

347
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,458
I Googled it.

348
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:51,791
Go!

349
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,166
-What were you busy chatting?
-Nothing.

350
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,583
What time is the wedding?

351
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,625
We'll drop her at the school
and reach on time.

352
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:02,125
He knows everything, right
up to getting a sewing machine!

353
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,125
Both of you, please sign.

354
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,000
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

355
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,708
Are you guys witnesses?
Please come and sign.

356
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,375
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

357
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,250
I'll see you guys.

358
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,833
-Bye.
-Yeah, see you, sir.

359
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,291
You can touch her only after I say so.

360
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,875
Take good care of her.

361
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,083
-Bye.
-Bye.

362
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,458
What about you, madam?

363
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:32,541
I've some work in the record room.
I'll go home by myself after that.

364
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,375
Do you wish to say anything?

365
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:39,541
Stop telling Siddhu
such nonsense picture-yourself stories.

366
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,958
-Why? What happened?
-Show me your phone.

367
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,583
Browser history.

368
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,458
Browser history? Mine or his?

369
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,250
-His, of course.
-Oh!

370
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,916
"How to hunt? How to kill a deer?"

371
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,833
"How to kill a hyena?"

372
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,291
"How to get successful in life--"
-Is it a joke?

373
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,000
No, I'm just reading it.

374
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,250
Who taught him all this?
How does he know?

375
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,458
Okay, I'll ensure
this doesn't happen again.

376
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,625
-I'll keep an eye too!
-Okay.

377
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,583
Great horned owl, Joshy.

378
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,791
It's already
in the protected species' list.

379
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,250
Where did you get this?

380
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:30,416
Sir, this owl is from Australia.
We caught it. We know about it.

381
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,666
-He's lying, sir.
-I'll slap you!

382
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,083
Is it necessary to do this at this age?
How many more owls did you catch?

383
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,583
Just this one, sir.
I hit it with my slingshot.

384
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,833
It fell down unconscious with a thud.

385
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,166
Joshy, inform Blue Cross.
It needs immediate treatment.

386
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,708
Send for our veterinary doctor too.

387
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,958
He's no more.

388
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,666
-What do you mean?
-Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

389
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,208
He died on the spot
in a car accident last night.

390
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:57,625
I think he lost control
and fell headlong into the valley.

391
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:00,708
Yeah.

392
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,000
What?

393
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,916
Okay, I'll come. Yeah.

394
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,500
It's not a car accident.

395
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,291
It was a planned murder
of the veterinary doctor.

396
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,916
Murder? How come?

397
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,583
He was shot dead.
I just got the information.

398
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,416
Did they use a gun in our town?

399
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,791
Last week, when the collector died

400
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,083
I thought it's a hit and run case,
but now the veterinary doctor…

401
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,625
Looks like a killing spree.

402
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,750
I don't get it, Joshy.

403
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,375
I've lived in this town
for the past 20 years.

404
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,583
I've never heard of anything like this.

405
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,750
How did anyone get a gun
in this town, Joshy?

406
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,958
Parthiban, why are you anxious?
We'll take care of it.

407
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,166
I'll go now and check.

408
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,583
Shall I come along?

409
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,666
Last week, when the collector died,
I thought it's a hit and run case

410
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,291
but now the veterinary doctor
has been killed.

411
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,750
Looks like a killing spree.

412
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,625
Dad, it is your turn.

413
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:32,125
Dad!

414
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,750
-Your turn.
-Okay.

415
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:42,083
My sweet honey, dark as ebony

416
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:47,333
Why did you become my fair lady?

417
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,583
I won't touch you, my princess

418
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,916
But if I do, I can't stop my caress

419
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:03,250
My sweet honey, dark as ebony

420
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,291
Why did you become my fair lady?

421
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,041
I won't touch you, my princess

422
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,583
But if I do, I can't stop my caress

423
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,708
My king is so handsome
With a smile so winsome

424
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,791
Love-goosebumps you give me

425
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:27,208
I won't let you go scot-free
Without you caressing me

426
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:31,000
Shall we share our desire
Like the warmth of blazing fire?

427
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:35,000
Soft as cotton am I and ready
Shall we ignite in rhapsody?

428
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,708
Shall we share our desire
Like the warmth of blazing fire?

429
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:42,166
Soft as cotton am I and ready
Shall we ignite in rhapsody?

430
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,750
My sweet honey, dark as ebony…

431
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,416
Sir, I've finished work. May I leave now?

432
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,375
Sir, don't tease me.
I'm going back to the hostel.

433
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,875
Go.

434
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,541
My song is much better than yours.

435
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,875
Wait for the next special item.

436
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,125
Shall I play it?

437
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,333
First look there.

438
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,833
The shop is closed, sir.

439
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:26,458
Thirupaachi…

440
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,125
I want chocolate coffee.

441
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,666
It's closed, sir.
Didn't you see the sign outside?

442
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,375
Chocolate coffee.

443
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,958
-The shop is closed, brother.
-Chocolate coffee.

444
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:38,208
Sir!

445
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,708
I've cleared up everything inside, sir.

446
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:44,666
Can I come an hour late tomorrow?
I'm going to visit the temple.

447
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,875
The shop is closed, sir.

448
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:49,166
Shruthi, leave now. Hurry up.

449
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,208
I'm talking to you.
Can you hear me or not?

450
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,583
-The shop is closed--
-Shruthi. Go, I'll talk to him.

451
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,375
Hey! Let go of my hand!

452
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:58,958
Sir!

453
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:01,875
Sir!

454
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,458
Brother.

455
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,000
Shall we share our desire
Like the warmth of blazing fire?

456
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,541
Soft as cotton am I and ready
Shall we ignite in rhapsody?

457
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,166
Shall we…

458
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,708
Hey! The gun is missing.
Check if he has taken it.

459
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,041
Let me go!

460
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,208
-Brother.
-Yes?

461
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:31,791
I've brought all the cash I've got here.

462
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,750
Let me know if you want more.
I'll withdraw it and give you.

463
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,708
Let her go, please.

464
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,250
This is wrong, brother.

465
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,291
Let her go. Please, I'm begging you.

466
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,166
Chocolate coffee.

467
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,541
Let me go.

468
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,791
Stay right here.

469
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,833
Don't come out till I tell you, okay?

470
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:57,833
Sir!

471
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,708
-I went crazy…
-Let me go!

472
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,541
On a spell so dizzy…

473
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,125
Boss, he is inside.

474
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:07,500
This is my job daily,
to think of you gaily

475
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,458
My job is to think of you
Night and day all through…

476
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:14,041
-Hey! Shut the gate!
-Let us think this happened, indeed

477
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,958
Let us transform our thoughts to deed

478
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,166
-Sir!
-When…

479
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,250
-Spread a mat and then…
-Sir!

480
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,958
-Sir, do something.
-Hey!

481
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,083
What did I tell you
and what are you doing?

482
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,291
Like the warmth of blazing fire

483
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,875
Soft as cotton…

484
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,291
Sir!

485
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,666
Sir!

486
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,375
Hey, our job is done. Let's go.

487
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,625
Hey!

488
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,416
Come with me or just die!

489
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,500
The guy, this girl, the child
and the CCTV here

490
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,458
are all aware of our identities.

491
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,583
If we leave like this,
we will be nabbed by tomorrow.

492
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:56,958
What do we do?

493
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,041
Do you want chocolate coffee?

494
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,333
Like the warmth of blazing fire

495
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,083
Shall we share our desire…

496
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,041
-Sir.
-Bring it.

497
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,291
Sir!

498
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,791
Hey! Clear the CCTV footage.

499
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,041
Sir, help!

500
00:35:56,125 --> 00:36:00,833
The lotus and its water
Never fight with each other

501
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,958
No one is around,
Hug me in a tight embrace

502
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:13,541
Like salt in pearl millet adds to treat
My porridge of life turns into a feast

503
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,500
Hey! I won't spare you!

504
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:19,375
Your face is embedded in my heart

505
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:24,708
With my tongue, I can touch my nose

506
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:30,416
You touched my soul with your glance

507
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,375
You're trying to kill me! Kill him!

508
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:42,250
No one is around, embrace me

509
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,083
Hey!

510
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:18,041
The way IR8 rice boils well and blends
You bonded well with me

511
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:24,208
You irrigated so well
My drought-ridden heart swell

512
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:30,166
Like a mother cat with her kittens
You swirled at my feet smitten

513
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:35,833
Feeling sorry, I petted you softly
You snarled to bite at me

514
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,666
-Dad!
-I own your soul, heart and body

515
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,041
Dad!

516
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,541
Shruthi! Chintu!

517
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:45,333
Your hands caressing my cheeks gently

518
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,041
Chocolate coffee?

519
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,291
Dad!

520
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,458
Dad!

521
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,500
Will a bud blooming into a flower now
Without feeling shy, express love?

522
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,708
Is it fight or honey-duet
To the flower and bee in pursuit?

523
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:11,041
The lotus and its water
Never fight with each other

524
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:16,791
I want to hug my dearest beloved
Even though he isn't yet my husband

525
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:37,416
Let's go to the riverside with a tree
It is a solitary love-spot

526
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,541
When the tide ebbs aside
Let us return gratified

527
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:49,583
I can teach you to swim happily
Come with me, my one and only

528
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:55,666
Let me tell you right now, hush!
Here and there my hands brush!

529
00:38:55,958 --> 00:39:01,875
Even spots on the Moon can be wiped clear
But you can never be reformed, dear

530
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:07,791
Even if overturned and hit
A turtle's shell won't break a bit

531
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,416
Hey!

532
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,291
Sir…

533
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,125
Hey! Let him go!

534
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,583
Or I'll stab her!

535
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:19,916
Sir!

536
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,041
Sir!

537
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,875
Kill him now.

538
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,458
Where are you off to? Hey!

539
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:12,166
Dad!

540
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,166
Dad!

541
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,416
Chintu!

542
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,666
Dad!

543
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,791
Dad!

544
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,125
Parthiban!

545
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,000
Parthiban.

546
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,458
Lal, drive to the hospital first.

547
00:41:56,708 --> 00:42:00,416
It doesn't look like a clot.
No physical injuries.

548
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,625
But she is showing signs of PTSD.

549
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,958
This child is in shock.
She is bound to feel anxious.

550
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,958
But there's nothing to worry.
I'll give her some medicine.

551
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,416
Take good care of her, okay?

552
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,416
Parthiban.

553
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:21,250
Parthiban, stop thinking about it
and getting upset.

554
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,625
Anyone in your place
would've done the same.

555
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,208
We will face the consequences.

556
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,750
I'll be there for you.

557
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:34,166
I'll take care of the children
till you get released.

558
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:38,625
-But don't regret--
-Sathya, I don't know what happened.

559
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,083
He went towards Chintu.

560
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,041
I saw him.

561
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,458
I was…

562
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,875
After that…

563
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,958
-Sir, I can't wait any longer.
-May I go in?

564
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,541
Parthiban, the police officers
are waiting outside.

565
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:04,416
They say they can't wait any longer
to start the remand procedures.

566
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,041
-Joshy, without this remand--
-Sathya, are you kidding?

567
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,875
Do you know the seriousness of this?

568
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,875
Five of them have been killed.

569
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,875
What do you want me to do?
He's a murderer now.

570
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:19,666
He has to be remanded for 15 days.
We have to follow procedures.

571
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,416
We can handle everything
after he's produced in the court.

572
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,958
Don't panic, okay?

573
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,750
Parthiban, let's go.

574
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,083
-Come on…
-Thanks.

575
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:45,458
According to the ballistic reports,
five bullets fired from the gun

576
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,791
penetrated the victims' foreheads
at point-blank range.

577
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,750
Not a single bullet misfired.

578
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,958
A person who has never
handled a gun before

579
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,791
was able to fire five bullets
in a split second. How?

580
00:43:55,875 --> 00:44:00,041
Sometimes, even trained police officers
struggle to shoot below the knee.

581
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,958
But without being least perturbed

582
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,916
how could he shoot five times
at point blank range?

583
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,083
Inspector Bhawar Jetha.

584
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,666
Compare Mr. Parthiban's shooting skill

585
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,708
with that of a few ordinary men.

586
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:17,541
This court orders proper proof
backed with adequate explanation.

587
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,041
Nazrat!

588
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,916
Go and stand over there.

589
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,041
-Hey! Stop!
-Shahid.

590
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,458
Note down everything.

591
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,958
Sashikanth.

592
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,041
-What are you doing?
-First lower the gun.

593
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,708
Parthiban!

594
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,250
Parthiban!

595
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,583
Step forward.

596
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:24,833
-Kumar.
-Sir?

597
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,458
Give him the 9 mm.

598
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,916
The man who killed my husband

599
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:13,083
and my younger brother…

600
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,750
Only after I send him
with his family to their graves

601
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:20,958
will I allow the funeral rites
of my husband to be performed.

602
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:23,958
I take this vow! I promise!

603
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,625
I swear by both of them!

604
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,291
It's okay.

605
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,000
Parthiban, here…

606
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,875
Your action was only a general exception.
Don't worry.

607
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:48,208
Parthiban! The ones you killed
weren't good people.

608
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:51,250
They are all gangsters.
It will come under self-defense.

609
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,250
Okay? Nothing to worry.

610
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,291
We'll take care. Okay?

611
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:59,791
Your Honor, a few days ago,
when a spotted hyena

612
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:04,208
strayed into our town,
everyone wanted to kill it

613
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,583
but my client risked his life

614
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:09,000
and saved the hyena
from the people's cruel assault.

615
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,666
This is my question, Your Honor.

616
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,250
How can a man who loves
even a beast to this extent

617
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,083
kill those five men?

618
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,000
He killed those ruthless men
in an act of self-defense

619
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:20,958
with the sole intention of saving his
employee, his daughter and himself.

620
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,750
Your Honor,
the mighty penal code may insulate

621
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,125
this gentleman's act of self-defense.

622
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,166
Bearing in mind the interrogation,

623
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,916
arguments and statements debated here,

624
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,833
having scrutinized this case thoroughly,

625
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,875
Mr. Parthiban, the accused,
remanded for the crime

626
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:46,416
as per IPC Section 103 and 106,

627
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,750
has been proven innocent.

628
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:52,791
The court pronounces its verdict.

629
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:57,750
Also, I recommend
to our government to award

630
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,750
Mr. Parthiban with
the National Bravery Award for this year.

631
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,916
Parthiban,
walk free with your head held high.

632
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,000
Move!

633
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,541
-Move them out of the way.
-Move aside.

634
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,708
Move out of the way.
Ask them to move out of the way.

635
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:30,333
-Is the decision to acquit you right?
-Move.

636
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,375
What's the reason
you had to shoot five people?

637
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,291
Come.

638
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,208
Give me that.

639
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:41,916
Get in.

640
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,375
Sir…

641
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,875
Move!

642
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:46,708
Move. Move out of the way.

643
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,833
-Sir…
-Sir!

644
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,625
You okay?

645
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,333
Dad.

646
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,333
-Yes?
-You were right, Dad.

647
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,958
Even if we're holding a gun,
we shouldn't shoot.

648
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,958
That isn't easy.

649
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,916
I can picture myself.

650
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,583
I feel sorry for you, Dad.
I can't bear to see you like this.

651
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:32,791
The dead men have many cases against them.
They aren't ordinary criminals.

652
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:36,333
This is a loss to their acquaintances.
Do you think they will keep quiet?

653
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:38,958
To be on the safer side,
be careful, Sathya.

654
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:17,416
D'Souza, here you go!

655
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,166
I can't forget everything

656
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,500
and go back to normal
at the coffee shop, Sathya.

657
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,166
I'm unable to focus.

658
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,375
I'm scared of the voices

659
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,500
Of the click, of the beat

660
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,750
Of the music I've been hearing all night

661
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,583
Pause, play, repeat!

662
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:52,458
I'm scared of the mountain

663
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,458
Of the river, of the fire

664
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:58,875
Of the sound of lightening in the sky
Those sounds make me wanna cry

665
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,916
-This light above me
-I'm shit scared of that

666
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,041
-Those colors -I'm shit scared of that

667
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,958
-These speakers -I'm shit scared of that

668
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,083
-Those woofers -I'm shit scared of that

669
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:09,166
-Bad trip -I'm shit scared of that

670
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,416
-Those chills -I'm shit scared of that

671
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,541
Shit scared of A, shit scared of B

672
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,625
Okay, I'm gonna pee!

673
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:33,708
I'm scared of the night
I'm scared of the day

674
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,791
I'm scared of my shadow
Get it out of my way

675
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,791
I'm scared of my past
I'm scared of my future

676
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,833
I'm scared of the present
Can't take this torture…

677
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:42,375
-Dad!
-I'm feeling cold, I'm feeling hot

678
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,416
Just living in fear of getting caught

679
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,333
I'm scared of the creepy
I'm scared of the crawly

680
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:49,458
And I swear, I'm not on molly
This light above me

681
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,458
-I'm shit scared of that -Those colors

682
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,541
-I'm shit scared of that -These speakers

683
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,416
-I'm shit scared of that -Those woofers

684
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
-I'm shit scared of that -Bad trip

685
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,625
-I'm shit scared of that -Those chills

686
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:01,125
I'm shit scared of that

687
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:03,333
Shit scared of A, Shit scared of B…

688
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,083
I kept it somewhere here.

689
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,416
Where is it?

690
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,458
What are you looking for?
You won't find anything there.

691
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:18,583
You need to buy something
to claim that it's missing.

692
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,708
How much longer will you hide
at home, Parthiban?

693
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,208
The cafe has been closed since ten days.

694
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:28,458
You aren't even sending
your daughter to school.

695
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,291
Just look at their faces.

696
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:33,291
Not only have you confined yourself
to the home

697
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,750
you've kept your family locked up
within these four walls.

698
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:41,583
How long will you shut your ears
when you hear a slight noise?

699
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:44,625
Go get some fresh air.

700
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:48,500
I'll take care of the house.
Take your family out first.

701
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,708
Go!

702
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,208
I feel like drinking coffee.

703
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:13,125
I'm stepping out to buy a packet of milk.

704
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,833
Do any of you want anything?

705
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:37,208
-Greetings, sir.
-Hello, sir.

706
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,833
-Hi, sir.
-Greetings.

707
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,125
He is a brave man.

708
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,583
Parthiban, I need to buy
something in that shop.

709
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,000
You guys come with me.

710
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:53,666
Buy whatever you wanted. Come, Siddhu.

711
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,041
-Take care.
-Okay, Dad.

712
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,916
Mom, I want bread omelet.

713
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,583
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

714
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,041
-One bread omelet, please.
-Okay, ma'am.

715
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,333
-You give it, I'll be back.
-Okay, Mom.

716
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,375
-Hello?
-We've got an SOS alert from CR, sir.

717
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,333
-It's a pitch deck information.
-Yeah.

718
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,041
There's some suspicious activity in town.
Parthiban's family is in danger.

719
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,666
We got this information
from an undercover agent two weeks ago.

720
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,291
But the inspector hid it.

721
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:23,416
So inform his family not to go out
without protection, sir.

722
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,541
Yeah, okay, I'll call you back.

723
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,041
Parthiban, where are you?

724
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:34,875
-I'm at the market.
-Does anyone seem suspicious around?

725
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,458
Parthiban?

726
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:44,875
-No. Why?
-The department got information

727
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,458
that some unwanted elements are here.

728
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:49,458
Do me a favor, just drop whatever
you're doing and get back into the car.

729
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,125
Right now, please…

730
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,958
Hey! Only after I kill you and your family

731
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:12,083
and take your head with me,
will I bury my brother-in-law.

732
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,541
Behead him!

733
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,000
Parthiban!

734
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,291
Hey!

735
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:18,458
Sathya, move back!

736
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,666
Why do you lay your dirty hands
on my family?

737
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,166
Parthiban, don't! Listen to me.

738
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:15,791
Parthiban!

739
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,333
Parthiban! Parthiban, don't! Listen to me!

740
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:29,083
-Let me go!
-No! Parthiban!

741
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,583
Parthiban! What are you doing?
Leave them alone.

742
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:48,375
If I let them go, they will kill us!

743
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:19,708
Parthi, I'm scared to see you
sitting here like this.

744
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,541
We could've come
when the inspector called, right?

745
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,875
Let's go home now.

746
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:26,541
I'm not going anywhere.

747
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:28,625
-Kumar!
-Sir!

748
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:31,000
Why is it so crowded outside?
Is it a fish market?

749
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,416
-Parthi, let's go.
-Go and see.

750
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,166
What are our men doing outside?

751
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,041
What is it? I'd asked you to register
a complaint and leave, right?

752
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,833
Why do you insist
on waiting for the inspector?

753
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:42,875
Don't we have any other damn work?

754
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,625
Go to the writer's table
and he'll write what you say.

755
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,958
Either sign or stamp your thumbprint
and leave, understand?

756
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:49,125
I'll see to it.

757
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,083
Hey! Send my tea inside.

758
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:57,291
Where are you going?

759
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,833
What will you see? Will you see us die?

760
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:05,333
Do we have to live in fear and wonder
who will attack us every time we step out?

761
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:07,416
Why are you getting worked up?

762
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,250
Two weeks ago, one of the corpses
from the shoot-out

763
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,166
went missing from the mortuary.

764
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,375
The department asked you to alert us.

765
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,083
Why didn't you caution us, sir?

766
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:23,166
Who told you all this? The ranger?

767
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:24,458
Look here.

768
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,166
Do we have to think of you
24×7 and serve only you?

769
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,083
In all fairness--

770
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,416
-Wait, dear. Wait.
-Please, let's go, Parthi.

771
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,833
In all fairness,
I did what you should've done.

772
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:34,166
I had no choice but to shoot
those who tried to kill my daughter.

773
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,541
They died! That's all.

774
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,958
Please. No need. Let's go home, please.

775
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:42,041
-Please.
-I want an armed guard

776
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:44,125
posted at my house 24×7.

777
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,125
I won't leave until then.

778
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:48,541
Hey! Get up, man!

779
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,208
I'm telling you to get up!

780
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:52,166
Get up! Get up from here!

781
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,250
Please. Let's go.

782
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,291
Do you think
you are a politician with clout?

783
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,666
Get out!

784
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,958
Out!

785
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,500
He wants an armed policeman, it seems.

786
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:08,500
You can't just order
and get an armed cop at your disposal.

787
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,416
The law and the government
must pass the order.

788
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:14,500
-Let's go, please--
-You are neither the law…

789
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,375
-Please. Let's go.
-…nor the government.

790
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:19,458
You are a common man
who sells bun and butter, Parthiban.

791
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:22,750
-Let's go, Parthi!
-Come in. We were waiting for you.

792
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:27,458
-He can't tolerate noise.
-Let's go, Parthi.

793
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:32,291
We should stand outside his house
holding a gun for his safety, it seems.

794
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,625
And he'll sit inside the house,
hugging his wife--

795
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,000
Hey! You're a police officer!
Mind your words!

796
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,166
What did you say!

797
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,958
-Hey!
-Parthiban!

798
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,166
-Let go!
-Parthiban, let him go!

799
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,208
Parthiban, don't!
He's a police officer, leave him.

800
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,125
Let go!

801
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:56,125
Parthiban! Listen. Let go of him.

802
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,166
Hold him back, guys. Come on.

803
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,250
Parthiban, you've already
been arrested once.

804
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:03,000
-This will become a huge issue.
-Parthiban, let go!

805
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:04,541
-Parthiban!
-Parthiban, don't!

806
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,166
He's choking, Parthiban!

807
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,583
Parthiban, he'll die!

808
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,833
Parthiban, let him go!

809
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:23,250
Sir, are you alright? Is your neck okay?

810
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:29,833
Parthiban.

811
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:33,208
Why did you do it, Parthiban?
I told you to let him go.

812
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:36,416
They won't give you police protection
at your behest as you think, Parthiban.

813
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,916
There's no proof of assault against you.
You haven't sustained any injuries.

814
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,708
Who said that I'm not injured?

815
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:10,875
Parthiban, are you really sure?

816
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:13,875
Joshy, I may go overboard
if I do it myself.

817
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,291
You do the needful.

818
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,125
You asked for it!

819
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,125
-SP.
-Yes, sir?

820
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,000
-Can you come to my residence?
-Okay, sir.

821
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,916
-Now. Yes, it's urgent.
-I'm coming, sir.

822
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,541
Sir, one small request.

823
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:49,083
Please give me a police officer
from Tamil Nadu.

824
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:03,250
Napoleon reporting to duty, sir!

825
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,458
Where is my position, sir!

826
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,208
Hush!

827
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,541
Who is this man?

828
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:40,458
Parthiban, you requested
for a high-ranking Tamil police officer.

829
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,625
He is that high-ranking police officer.

830
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:45,500
You must've heard
of a drug bust in Trichy.

831
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,916
I heard he was responsible
for finishing off 50-60 of those men.

832
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,958
-Move these tables over there at once.
-Okay, sir.

833
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:45,875
Go.

834
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:50,958
Hey!

835
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:52,500
Put your phone down.

836
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,166
Listen!

837
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:57,583
What do you want?

838
01:06:58,041 --> 01:06:59,041
Wait!

839
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,291
Are you a Tamilian? Hey, don't run!

840
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,291
Load the stuff fast!

841
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,416
What is it?

842
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:21,750
What?

843
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:46,708
Are you transferring our own stuff
without our knowledge?

844
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:47,625
Come here!

845
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,333
-Come.
-Sir.

846
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,875
Don't, sir!

847
01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:58,750
Sir!

848
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,666
Move aside!

849
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,666
Boss!

850
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,416
Out of my way! Move aside!

851
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,208
Boss?

852
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:25,541
You better pray to God
that it's important news.

853
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,291
Or you'll die here.

854
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:28,916
Look at this picture.

855
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,083
Hey!

856
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,083
Hey!

857
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,041
He is a freaking badass, man

858
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:08,208
He's a badass, run for your life quickly

859
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:13,208
He's a badass, stay in your limits

860
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,833
Badass, man

861
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:18,541
Leo Das, man

862
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:23,000
He's a badass, run for your life quickly

863
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,416
Got you, rascal!

864
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,583
Hey!

865
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:29,541
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

866
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,000
Hey!

867
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,625
He is a freaking badass, man

868
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:37,000
If the lion is on the prowl fearsome
Feast is for the forest wholesome

869
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:39,625
Fearing his hunt, scatter
Hither and thither, helter-skelter

870
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:44,833
Putting an end to gangsters countless,
He'll punish them ruthless

871
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,583
Till now, he was a good soul

872
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:50,125
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

873
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,041
In this story, he has a demon's face

874
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:55,041
Badass, man!

875
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,750
Not a matchstick, he's a volcano

876
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,666
Don't you come near me

877
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:03,083
Pray to your family deity

878
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:05,125
Don't you dare glare at me!

879
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,291
Hey!

880
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,625
He is a badass!

881
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,416
Stay in your limits

882
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,791
Badass, man

883
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,500
Leo Das, man

884
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:25,416
Badass bona fide, dude, take to your heels

885
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,666
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

886
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,000
How many people should we send from here?

887
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,541
If he's really Parthiban,

888
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:43,208
four people will suffice.

889
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,875
But if it is Leo…

890
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,125
-We'll chop him!
-We'll chop him!

891
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:00,833
-We will chop him
-We will chop him into pieces!

892
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,208
…our entire town won't do!

893
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:11,916
Don't act too smart, man

894
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,458
He will give you grief and strife
Beat you to a pulp and end your life

895
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:23,041
Not a matchstick, he's a volcano

896
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,541
Don't you come near me

897
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:28,166
Pray to your family deity

898
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,041
Don't you dare glare at me!

899
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,916
He is a badass, deadly!

900
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,458
Run for your life blindly

901
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:42,875
Badass is he, definitely

902
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,666
Stay within your limits

903
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,916
Hey!

904
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,083
Hey!

905
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:05,041
Thank you.

906
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:08,708
-Is it sweet?
-Bloody sweet.

907
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,083
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

908
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:13,750
Leo

909
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:16,000
He's a freaking badass, man

910
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:18,708
Leo!

911
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:21,291
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

912
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,791
Leo!

913
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:25,833
Rest in peace!

914
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,291
This one is…

915
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:32,958
Almost the same.

916
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:36,041
-I'll make it better.
-Yes.

917
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:39,625
There's a girl who has been
looking at you for a long time.

918
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:41,500
Don't turn around immediately.

919
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,541
Could she be from the press?

920
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,750
-She left.
-Similarly,

921
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:07,666
a man at the back
has been here for a long time.

922
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,416
He isn't saying anything.
Go and have a word with him.

923
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,041
-Where? Behind?
-In the backyard.

924
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:14,166
-Okay. Go, I'll handle him.
-Okay.

925
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:28,041
"Pleasure is mine."

926
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:40,250
Hi, sir. What would you like to eat?

927
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,125
Coffee.

928
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,083
-Sugar?
-You know very well

929
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:56,083
whether I take sugar or not.

930
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,333
How would I know
whether you prefer sugar or not?

931
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,375
-With sugar.
-Okay.

932
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,041
I'm sorry, sir.

933
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:22,583
-One sugar cube or two--
-You know that too.

934
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:27,583
Sir, I don't know that.
You've mistaken me for someone else.

935
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:31,500
I was thrilled to hear you speak Tamil.
I'm just humoring you, that's all.

936
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,583
Your coffee, your sugar.

937
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,750
Leo?

938
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:40,083
Leo!

939
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,083
Parthiban.

940
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,916
I don't know anyone named Leo, sir.
There's already a lot of confusion here.

941
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,958
Please don't add to it.
Please drink your coffee and leave.

942
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:52,208
Do you mind?

943
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,166
Can you make it a little stronger?

944
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,250
Sure, sir.

945
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,875
Do you know this brand, Leo?

946
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,458
No, sir.
I don't have the habit of smoking.

947
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:13,708
-I can't even stand the smell.
-D Slash.

948
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:17,625
You used to call it Honey Badger,
but it is Black Devil.

949
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,416
Twenty-five puffs.

950
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,833
The flavor that you created.

951
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,791
You really like nocturnal animals, right?

952
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:29,958
Once a Honey Badger
entered our tobacco field.

953
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,333
Do you remember?

954
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,500
It didn't get caught in your trap.

955
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,291
It didn't get killed
by Harold's spear either.

956
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:39,916
In the end, it died
by the bullet that I fired.

957
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,375
I think you've forgotten it.

958
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:45,666
Do you want anything
other than coffee or shall I get the bill?

959
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,208
Have you convinced yourself
that your old identity doesn't exist, Leo?

960
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,750
Wait, what?

961
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:55,916
Listen.

962
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,916
I've many problems on my mind.
I've a splitting headache.

963
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,125
I'll tell you in a way
you'll understand, one last time.

964
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:04,750
You've mistaken me for someone else.

965
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:09,875
I have very less patience, dear.

966
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:12,833
So don't waste my time.

967
01:16:13,291 --> 01:16:14,625
Mount View Lodge.

968
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,625
Come of your own accord
and admit that you're Leo.

969
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,916
Sir, alcohol is not allowed.

970
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:35,916
No alcohol!

971
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,333
No alcohol.

972
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,000
A friend of my friend is in Kadapa.

973
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:37,083
I sent him a photo of the D Slash
cigarette box and got some details.

974
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:40,708
Going by what he says,
the chap who came here

975
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,541
is Antony Das.

976
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:47,916
Once upon a time in Andhra Pradesh,
he ran a huge tobacco company.

977
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,541
-After a big fire accident--
-Hold on.

978
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,083
Why should I know
the life history of the guy

979
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:57,416
who barged into my cafe
and blew cigarette smoke in my face?

980
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,666
No, but this is important.

981
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:01,166
-No, I--
-Let him complete.

982
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,666
Go on, Joshy.

983
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:06,583
Antony Das has a son named Leo.

984
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,291
Okay.

985
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,000
Leo Das.

986
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:13,375
I couldn't find any details
other than his name.

987
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:16,000
One group says that he did
something big and died.

988
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:19,708
Another group believes he is still alive.

989
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:22,125
He can fool this town.

990
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:25,875
He can fool the world.

991
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,833
But he can never fool me.

992
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,875
In some odd way,
you have a striking resemblance to him.

993
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,208
I saw his eyes.

994
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:39,000
I know his eyes.

995
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:41,583
It is him.

996
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:44,291
Parthiban, you grew up
in an orphanage, right?

997
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:48,333
-Do you remember anything from before?
-What is this? This is bullshit!

998
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:49,791
We are the victims here.

999
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:52,375
Do you understand you are treating
the victim like an accused?

1000
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,083
-Let's leave, Parthi.
-Wait, dear.

1001
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:55,500
Sathya, one moment.

1002
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,541
Joshy.

1003
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:02,083
I get that you are asking this
out of concern.

1004
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,333
But since my childhood

1005
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:07,500
until I was 20, I grew up
in Sathyamangalam Orphanage.

1006
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:09,875
And I met her there…

1007
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,625
What was that, dear? That…

1008
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:13,708
Munnar trekking.

1009
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,125
There's where we met.

1010
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:18,125
I saw her. I got to know her.

1011
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,625
Within two days,
I asked her if she'd marry me.

1012
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:21,625
That's all.

1013
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:25,375
After marrying her,
we settled here because of her job.

1014
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:28,541
This has been my town since then.
This is my story.

1015
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,666
They have also come
from the south, Parthiban.

1016
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,333
If they've crossed so many miles
and come by road to our place

1017
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:38,000
in search of you, something is amiss.

1018
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,791
Whatever came to a grinding halt
because of him

1019
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,083
needs to be completed using him.

1020
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:47,625
I know how to bring him back
into our fold.

1021
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:49,916
My world is very small, Joshy.

1022
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,083
It's like a snow globe
that fits in the palm of my hand.

1023
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:57,416
A small independent house,
surrounded by trees, snow, cool breeze.

1024
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,333
Why is this happening to me?

1025
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:02,916
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1026
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,166
I'm sorry.

1027
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,083
It's alright. I understand.

1028
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,958
If they come back
to cause further trouble,

1029
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:12,791
we'll inform the police.

1030
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,500
Keep an eye on his family and friends.

1031
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:16,875
I'll take care of it.

1032
01:20:25,166 --> 01:20:28,208
I feel like someone
is watching our home, Sathya.

1033
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,791
I don't know, Sathya. The eerie silence

1034
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:35,666
makes me restless. I feel very disturbed.

1035
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,791
Look here. Understand this.

1036
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:46,166
You should feel this way
only if I suspect you.

1037
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:49,625
Have I ever questioned you?

1038
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:53,583
Stop thinking about these things
and sleep peacefully, come.

1039
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:57,541
Won't you come?

1040
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,416
Okay, shall we stand like this and sleep?

1041
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,250
Don't touch the engine,
just fix the heater.

1042
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,208
I want my vehicle.

1043
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:14,791
Get it ready by evening, okay?

1044
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,583
What do you want?

1045
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:47,500
I saw you, right?

1046
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,500
That's enough for me.

1047
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:54,458
I'm so mad at you, if I slap you now

1048
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:56,333
your mouth will be injured badly

1049
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,166
and it will seem like
a weird smile is plastered.

1050
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,291
I'm sorry.

1051
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,375
-Get out!
-I'll leave!

1052
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,333
I'll leave.

1053
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:13,291
-Tell me, dear.
-I bought the tablet you wanted, Parthi.

1054
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,791
Do you want anything else?

1055
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,458
I've given the jeep for service.

1056
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:18,333
Didn't I tell you that we can go later
to the pharmacy?

1057
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:22,208
-Why did you leave the kid alone at home?
-I brought Mathi with me.

1058
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:23,583
Priya is also with me.

1059
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:25,666
Okay. We could've waited for a day.
What was the hurry?

1060
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,416
Some things can't be delayed, right?

1061
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,666
It's not a problem.
I'll take an auto home.

1062
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,333
-You take care.
-Okay. Go home and call me.

1063
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:33,625
Let's go. Come, dear.

1064
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:02,583
No!

1065
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:01,500
There's nothing to panic about.

1066
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:05,166
It is the same blood.

1067
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,500
Do you know who she is?

1068
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,166
My granddaughter.

1069
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,583
My blood.

1070
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,250
Yesterday you were the one who…

1071
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:20,166
You better leave
or I may have to call the police.

1072
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:22,666
Police?

1073
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:26,541
I haven't come to trouble you, dear.

1074
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:31,291
You've been living with a guy who you
believe is Parthiban for the past 20 years

1075
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,416
when you realise he was a ruthless killer

1076
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:39,458
who committed many murders,

1077
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,375
come and meet me.

1078
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:46,166
I'll show you the true colors
of your husband.

1079
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,250
-Hello?
-Why didn't you answer the call, Parthi?

1080
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:56,875
-He was here.
-What happened, Sathya?

1081
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,083
Who? Who was there?

1082
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:00,541
The same guy!
You said he visited the cafe yesterday!

1083
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:02,250
He came to the medical shop
looking for me.

1084
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,583
Okay. Where are you now?

1085
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:04,750
I am at home.

1086
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,541
They followed me in their car.
It is parked outside our home.

1087
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:10,250
Sathya, close the doors.
Give the phone to the police officer.

1088
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,333
He is missing. No one is here.

1089
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:13,666
I'm scared, Parthi.

1090
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,875
Lock yourself in our bedroom safely.

1091
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,125
Siddhu is coming. I'm also on my way!

1092
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,250
Answer the call!

1093
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,875
-Dad, what is it?
-Siddharth! Go home immediately

1094
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:36,791
-and pick your spear and go in.
-What are you saying, Dad?

1095
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:40,250
If anyone tries to enter the house,
throw your spear without hesitation.

1096
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:41,583
Okay, Dad.

1097
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:07,416
Will our lives be like this now, Parthi?

1098
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:09,625
We have to be on the run.
Then we have to hide.

1099
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:10,958
We should live in fear

1100
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:14,333
wondering what might happen
to our kids. Right?

1101
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,083
Tell me. Who is he?

1102
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,541
He claims that our daughter
is his granddaughter.

1103
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:21,833
I feel terrified when I look at him.

1104
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:25,333
We don't usually pay attention
to how our heart beats

1105
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:28,916
but today, I could feel every beat
as I made my way home.

1106
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:30,791
Chintu, come here.

1107
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:33,458
Don't call her! She's already terrified.

1108
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,333
-Listen…
-I forced the police department,

1109
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,375
I fought with the law,

1110
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,958
and went to great lengths

1111
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,000
to bring you to my doorstep.

1112
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,625
I asked you to protect my family.

1113
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:02,958
Do you possess
any integrity or job ethics?

1114
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:06,500
Don't say that.

1115
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:08,458
There's no use
talking about compassion or concern

1116
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:10,708
to those who work for money.

1117
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,500
Instead of doing your duty like this

1118
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:16,083
by just eating and sleeping uselessly,
pick up your belongings and go away!

1119
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,375
-Don't say that, sir.
-What?

1120
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:20,666
-Don't act on impulse.
-Under the pretext of making excuses

1121
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:22,791
don't provoke me to swear at you.

1122
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,375
-I went to recharge--
-Don't talk.

1123
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:25,625
Don't talk!

1124
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,250
-I went to recharge--
-Don't talk!

1125
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,583
I'm letting you go out of respect
for your age, or…

1126
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:31,583
You've misunderstood me.

1127
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:35,000
-Dear…
-Go. Just go.

1128
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,250
I'm sorry, Dad.

1129
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:43,125
-I didn't know that it was you…
-It's okay, Son.

1130
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,291
Good throw.

1131
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:47,541
-You knew it was me and threw it, right?
-No, Dad.

1132
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,291
When you realize
that the man sharing your bed

1133
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:02,708
is a ruthless killer with no mercy,

1134
01:29:03,416 --> 01:29:04,750
come and meet me.

1135
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:18,083
Was it a dream?

1136
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:21,458
It must have been a nightmare.

1137
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:39,833
I think some major conflict occurred
between the family members.

1138
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:45,458
It seems this is also a reason for
their tobacco industry to get destroyed.

1139
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:47,666
I have sent the certificates
and photos to you.

1140
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,458
I want to know if they are forged or not.
Okay? Okay, bye.

1141
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:52,166
It's a myth that stands still, Joshy.

1142
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:55,625
But I believe a man who knows
the full story is alive in Shimla prison.

1143
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:58,416
His name is Hridayaraj D'Souza
in the records.

1144
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,250
If the intel is right,
he must be very close to Leo Das.

1145
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:04,333
So if you want to see him,
you have only two days.

1146
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,666
Practically, I don't know
when you can reach.

1147
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,416
-Can I try to connect him in a call?
-No…

1148
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,791
I-I'm on my way,
make the arrangements, please.

1149
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:12,041
I'll reach by tonight, okay?

1150
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:13,000
-Sure, Joshy.
-Thank you.

1151
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,375
Who is the villain here?

1152
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:22,375
It's late. Your mom isn't back yet.

1153
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:25,625
Recently, she has been
returning late everyday.

1154
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,583
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

1155
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,125
That's her.

1156
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:36,958
-Tell me.
-Parthi, I'm not coming home tonight.

1157
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:39,083
Don't wait for me.
Have your dinner and sleep.

1158
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:43,000
-Why? What happened?
-I've taken many days off, right?

1159
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,708
So there's a lot of pending work.

1160
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:47,458
I thought I'll finish it
and come home in the morning.

1161
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,416
I yelled at Siddhu this morning,
so he isn't answering my call.

1162
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,250
Is he back home? Where is he?

1163
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,666
Poor boy, I was quite harsh.
Check on him, Parthi.

1164
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your kind attention, please?

1165
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,833
Okay, where are you now?

1166
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:01,791
-At the head office.
-Is that so?

1167
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,416
-Chintu.
-Yes?

1168
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:12,583
You don't suspect your dad, right?

1169
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,541
-No.
-Why?

1170
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:16,625
Because you are my dearest dad.

1171
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,541
Your dearest dad.

1172
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,333
Hey! It's your dad.

1173
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:32,875
Siddharth, get into the car!

1174
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:39,375
-I'm calling you, get into--
-Let go of my hand!

1175
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:45,541
Sir, leave him alone
if he doesn't want to come.

1176
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:46,666
Don't force him.

1177
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,083
What? Will you kill him too?

1178
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,166
Okay, don't come.

1179
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:10,208
Who is the villain here?

1180
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:12,500
Who is the friend, dear and near?

1181
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:14,916
Who is the villain in the end?

1182
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,916
Who is the friend and godsend?

1183
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,166
If I see any of you
following my family hereafter…

1184
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,833
Hey! Go with your dad.

1185
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:24,083
Who is the villain here?

1186
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:30,458
-Sir.
-Why are you sitting here

1187
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:33,208
in the cold at this hour?
No intruder will barge in now.

1188
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:36,041
I don't care anymore who shoots
and who dies, go to sleep.

1189
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:37,625
It's okay. It's okay, sir.

1190
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:40,958
A courier was delivered in the noon
in your wife's name.

1191
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:44,375
Sir, one moment.
I wanted to tell you something.

1192
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:47,958
I understand all your worries and fears.

1193
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:52,916
I see how well you take care
of the people who depend on you.

1194
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,583
You are anxious and upset
that something might happen to them.

1195
01:32:55,666 --> 01:32:57,333
I'll retire in 60 days.

1196
01:32:57,541 --> 01:33:01,916
If anyone troubles your family
in any way during this time,

1197
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:04,291
I'll take him down with me!

1198
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:08,166
Even if there is any emergency
needing my attention back home

1199
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,083
I won't leave this place.

1200
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:14,666
I swear this Napoleon doesn't work
just to eat like a glutton, sir.

1201
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:18,458
I don't work just to fill my stomach.
Trust me, sir.

1202
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:28,625
Did you really lift such a big gun
at the commissioner's office

1203
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:30,166
and shoot all of them?

1204
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:34,625
All I did was read the manual
and instruct as to which button to press.

1205
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:36,000
Dilli took care of the rest.

1206
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:38,625
Don't tell anyone.
This is my means of livelihood.

1207
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:39,875
Okay.

1208
01:33:41,041 --> 01:33:43,125
-Chintu.
-Dad.

1209
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,583
Why don't you sit?

1210
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:55,541
-How is he doing?
-He is fine.

1211
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,666
It's been nearly three weeks
since he called me up.

1212
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,958
All okay, right?

1213
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:03,166
Why take the trouble
to visit me at this hour?

1214
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,541
Had you told me, I'd have couriered it.

1215
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:09,833
The government registration is pending
without proper certificates.

1216
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,875
We came here on some other job.

1217
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,708
-So we decided to collect it.
-Oh.

1218
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:15,875
It's in the attic. Let me get it.

1219
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:20,625
Sir, this is Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1220
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:22,375
Counting of heads
will take place in 20 minutes.

1221
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:25,458
I'll wait over there.
Finish your conversation soon.

1222
01:34:29,541 --> 01:34:32,166
You asked for this brand, right?

1223
01:34:35,833 --> 01:34:37,750
Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1224
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:41,291
I'll come straight to the point
because of time constraint.

1225
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,500
Das & Co Tobacco Factory.

1226
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:46,916
The duo associated with it,
Antony and Harold.

1227
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,166
We have identity records on both of them,
but we have no details about Leo.

1228
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,125
You are the only one who is alive

1229
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:58,000
among Leo's associates
who were present during his death.

1230
01:34:58,166 --> 01:35:00,041
I have only one request for you.

1231
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:04,833
If you can tell me
whether this is Leo or not,

1232
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:06,458
four lives will be saved.

1233
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,625
I understand.
I can see the fear of death in your eyes.

1234
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:15,250
I heard you are due
for a death sentence in three days.

1235
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:18,916
If you can narrate what actually happened,
I can send a petition now

1236
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,375
and appeal for a review
of your death sentence.

1237
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,750
If you could tell me
the actual sequence of events…

1238
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:38,000
Hridayaraj, don't test my patience.

1239
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:48,583
If you're here for a fair and just cause,

1240
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
why this back door entry
and sitting near the toilet?

1241
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:55,833
I've said what I had to, in the court.

1242
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:59,375
No one can stop my death sentence.

1243
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:00,291
What else?

1244
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:02,666
What happened at Das & Co Tobacco Factory?

1245
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:05,541
Is Leo alive or dead? Or how did Leo die?

1246
01:36:05,666 --> 01:36:08,583
I'm not saying this for you
or your damn bribe of a booze.

1247
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:10,708
Anyway I'll die in three days.

1248
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:14,708
After that, I can't talk about him.
That's why I'll tell you now.

1249
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:21,208
In the year 1999, Das & Co
was the most flourishing tobacco factory

1250
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:23,833
in Andhra Pradesh.

1251
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:27,041
The one who built
and ruled that empire was Antony.

1252
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:29,041
Antony Das.

1253
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:35,833
Das & Co Tobacco Factory was just a front

1254
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:39,583
to conduct many illegal businesses.

1255
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:41,333
He developed the business

1256
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:45,291
to local, national
and international levels.

1257
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:50,166
Antony was never the kind to forget
or forgive those who opposed him.

1258
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,750
He would kill them mercilessly.

1259
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:56,541
Gradually that became
a habit in their family.

1260
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:04,541
Before starting any business,
he'd always sacrifice an animal.

1261
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:07,958
He believed the growth of his empire

1262
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:10,166
was only due to this sacrificial ritual.

1263
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,458
It started with goats and cows

1264
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:16,458
and he went to the extent
of performing human sacrifices too.

1265
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:24,125
He was very superstitious.

1266
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:27,083
Harold Das was his younger brother.

1267
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:32,083
Harold was the only man
whom Antony trusted.

1268
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:33,208
Harold.

1269
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,458
Harold!

1270
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,958
He went to Canada to study

1271
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:43,666
but got acquainted with international
drug cartels over there

1272
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:46,333
and he expanded their business
on foreign soil.

1273
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:50,041
His dream was to make Das & Co
the number one drug cartel in the world.

1274
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:53,333
So he created a drug called Datura.

1275
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:58,166
It was a drug unseen,
unheard of and untried in the market.

1276
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:00,625
They grew Datura
amidst their tobacco plants.

1277
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,375
They began to manufacture it
within their factory.

1278
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:07,208
Datura was more lethal than cocaine.

1279
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:11,208
Gradually its demand increased
in the market.

1280
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:13,750
At the same time, this news was leaked

1281
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,666
to the Narcotics Control Bureau
by some of his men.

1282
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:19,708
He threw Datura on the faces
of those whom he suspected

1283
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:21,666
without even questioning them

1284
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:26,458
and killed in wild fury ruthlessly
and piled them in heaps remorselessly.

1285
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:31,041
Even if Antony and Harold took care
of managing the business at the top level

1286
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:36,458
they still needed someone trustworthy
working at grass-root level, right?

1287
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:38,958
Antony's son…

1288
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:42,500
I raised him from the time
he was a toddler.

1289
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:47,083
Das. Leo Das.

1290
01:38:49,458 --> 01:38:52,708
All this hassle is because one of your men
leaked the information to NCB.

1291
01:38:52,791 --> 01:38:55,291
Have you faced any issue
of this magnitude all these years?

1292
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:57,916
Think about my position.
Can I dismiss your action as trivial?

1293
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,208
I can't show a wrong count
for namesake the way you think.

1294
01:39:00,291 --> 01:39:02,125
If you want me
to release the seized Datura,

1295
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:04,041
one among the three of you
needs to surrender.

1296
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:07,041
That's why I want Leo to surrender.
Only if he is behind bars for a week

1297
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:09,333
I can remove the stash safely
by silencing my higher-ups.

1298
01:39:09,416 --> 01:39:12,041
If it gets out of hand,
I can't help you, remember that.

1299
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:15,041
How do we trust
that you'll release him in a week?

1300
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:17,875
If you want your stash,
you've to trust me, Das.

1301
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,166
-Antony?
-Is Leo there?

1302
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:24,333
Leo isn't here.

1303
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,958
He said he'd cross the border
with the drugs.

1304
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:30,416
He must be at the check-post.
I think he's outwitting them.

1305
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:32,833
Hey, who is smoking over there?

1306
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,500
Give him two tight slaps
and bring him here!

1307
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:37,041
Tell me, sir.

1308
01:39:37,541 --> 01:39:38,875
Yes, sir. I'm at the spot.

1309
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:41,125
Who is he? Move.

1310
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:44,500
Rest in peace!

1311
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:19,000
-Gabby! Start the vehicle!
-Hey! Go!

1312
01:40:19,916 --> 01:40:21,125
Load it! Hurry up.

1313
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:24,666
L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass

1314
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:29,083
L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass

1315
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:33,375
L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass

1316
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:39,458
Rest in peace!

1317
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:42,083
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1318
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:46,666
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1319
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,083
Go…

1320
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:50,833
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1321
01:40:55,791 --> 01:40:59,000
L-E-O Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass

1322
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:03,208
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass

1323
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:07,125
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass
He's gonna kick your sad ass

1324
01:41:07,208 --> 01:41:09,333
Hey! I worked for you risking my job

1325
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:11,625
but you're outwitting me
and getting me in trouble?

1326
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:13,666
I'll see how you take the stash out
without my help.

1327
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:17,333
Leo!

1328
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:21,541
Hey! Don't!

1329
01:41:22,541 --> 01:41:26,666
Leo!

1330
01:41:30,166 --> 01:41:31,750
Rest in peace!

1331
01:41:34,958 --> 01:41:37,333
Leo found out

1332
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:41,416
who gave information to the NCB
from within our camp.

1333
01:41:43,583 --> 01:41:45,375
-Gabby!
-Tell me.

1334
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:48,541
I don't care what bloody issue it was.
Why halt and discuss en-route?

1335
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:52,666
You're gathering allies and mediating
with so many tons of drugs at stake!

1336
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,958
Who is mediating? Go ask Daniel.

1337
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:56,916
Every time I instructed him,
he said, "Call Leo.

1338
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,250
This load won't move an inch
till he comes here and settles my share."

1339
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:01,833
That smart-ass threatened me.

1340
01:42:01,916 --> 01:42:04,000
You place him on a pedestal
claiming he's your friend!

1341
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:05,208
Where is he?

1342
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,166
What is your problem?

1343
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:15,000
What issue do you have to work with him?

1344
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:16,416
He is my problem!

1345
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:24,791
He has taken my place.

1346
01:42:24,875 --> 01:42:26,916
I can't work under this mongrel.

1347
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,583
If that's what you'll do,
I will hold back the drugs.

1348
01:42:29,666 --> 01:42:31,541
I'll show you I'm important too.

1349
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,083
What do you want me to do?

1350
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:37,083
I don't want him butting in, that's all.

1351
01:42:37,166 --> 01:42:39,458
If he does, we can't dispose the drugs.

1352
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:52,583
He asked for it.

1353
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,541
Right?

1354
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:18,125
I care two hoots for friendship
or whatever crap other than this stash.

1355
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:19,666
I'll do as you say.

1356
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:24,958
Hey!

1357
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:27,250
-Remove the damn knife.
-Hey!

1358
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:29,291
I know in which direction
you'll point that gun.

1359
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:31,208
Put the gun down and step back.

1360
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,541
Have you watched the movie, Jeans?

1361
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:45,875
Hero Prashanth plays dual roles, right?

1362
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,333
A small change.

1363
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:51,041
Both are two men in that movie.
Here, it's a man and a woman.

1364
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,708
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1365
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:58,791
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1366
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:00,583
Rest in peace

1367
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,541
Leo.

1368
01:44:02,708 --> 01:44:06,708
It isn't easy to cross all the check-posts
with 2,000 kilos of Datura overnight.

1369
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:09,041
Like shooting mongrels,
they target our men with vengeance.

1370
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:12,541
It's too risky to transfer it overnight.
Tell me what to do.

1371
01:44:12,625 --> 01:44:14,833
Even though it was
an almost impossible task

1372
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:17,875
Leo dismissed the risk
of transfer overnight.

1373
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:21,041
Leo took it as a challenge
to transfer 2,000 kilos of Datura

1374
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:24,083
by crossing two inter-state borders.

1375
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:26,291
Imagine! 2,000 kilos of Datura.

1376
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:28,750
It was worth millions at that time.

1377
01:44:28,833 --> 01:44:31,708
He kept his word
and finished it without any hitch.

1378
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:34,541
He took matters in his own hands

1379
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:36,750
for his dad's sake
without a second thought.

1380
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:40,625
Amidst all this, Antony's quest
for human sacrifices didn't stop.

1381
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,541
For two years, he was searching
for a unique horoscope.

1382
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:46,583
He believed that if such a person
was found and sacrificed,

1383
01:44:46,666 --> 01:44:48,750
his tobacco factory

1384
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:52,208
and business would flourish.

1385
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:58,625
We were least bothered about this.

1386
01:44:58,708 --> 01:45:00,875
We were happy
that the drugs reached safely

1387
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,083
and celebrated with booze and dance.

1388
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:08,333
Bro, come here.

1389
01:45:08,958 --> 01:45:10,791
Bro! Come on!

1390
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,166
Please. For the sake of these boys.

1391
01:45:14,458 --> 01:45:17,125
Come on!

1392
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,875
I'm ready. Shall I make an entry?

1393
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:27,416
I'm your dear bro. Shall I come now?

1394
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,333
Don't taunt this lion
With the sting of a scorpion

1395
01:45:30,416 --> 01:45:33,125
No matter who tries to obstruct my route
It will be the same forever

1396
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:35,625
I'm ready. Shall I make an entry?

1397
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:38,291
Your favorite bro, shall I come solo?

1398
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:41,250
Till the Earth quakes, beat the drum
I will dance in tune to your rhythm

1399
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:45,000
I'll light the torch in a flick
Between my fingers double quick

1400
01:45:49,625 --> 01:45:54,041
Pick the best goat and slaughter
So I can appease my hunger

1401
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:25,916
If God is granting total bliss in one go,

1402
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,416
caution is advisable.

1403
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:31,125
Because no one can predict
what will happen next.

1404
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:35,708
I have good news and bad news for you.

1405
01:46:35,833 --> 01:46:38,583
Only these two horoscopes
will suit our purpose

1406
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:42,125
out of all the horoscopes
I searched for, till date.

1407
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:44,083
Please take a look and decide.

1408
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:48,833
I'm ready to harvest
And weed out my opponent

1409
01:46:48,916 --> 01:46:51,375
It is our fate at stake
To get rid of this headache.

1410
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:53,708
If he acts like Smart Alec,
We will tie him in a sack

1411
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:56,583
Dump him in a lorry
To get dissected in the factory!

1412
01:46:56,666 --> 01:46:59,625
Hey! We know all the blueprints
Our mission will be a success

1413
01:46:59,708 --> 01:47:02,208
If you interfere, you'll also be akin
To a lamb offered to our family deity

1414
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:05,166
Lamb for offering booze, cigarette, beedi
Every buddy in our gang is trustworthy

1415
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,916
As a team we work and think
Sharing a worldwide link

1416
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,583
Our rules hold good in every city
Don't flick our tools to play dirty

1417
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:13,250
We move and groove in unity
Our sync is our identity

1418
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:16,083
I fight world wars not just a battle
Tired of winning every match I wrestle

1419
01:47:16,166 --> 01:47:19,000
Just one drum beat quick
Sure-shot power kick

1420
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:29,958
Power kick!

1421
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:43,250
I shouldn't have shown Elisa's
and Leo's horoscopes to you

1422
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:44,666
but I had no option.

1423
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,750
I'm not sure
if we can find a similar horoscope

1424
01:47:47,916 --> 01:47:50,416
with the same star and date of birth, Das.

1425
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:05,291
Hey! Is there no other way?

1426
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:07,958
Can't you come up with any other option?

1427
01:48:23,125 --> 01:48:24,916
I feel really sad to say this.

1428
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:27,958
If you ask for my opinion,

1429
01:48:29,625 --> 01:48:31,041
I'll choose Leo.

1430
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:34,458
No.

1431
01:48:35,791 --> 01:48:38,125
The decision… the decision is all yours.

1432
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:41,916
Garnished with spice and pepper
Oh, look! It boils with a special flavor

1433
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,916
Those limbs so amazing and super

1434
01:48:44,041 --> 01:48:47,416
Fist fight that strikes like lightning
Flashes into our kitchen and dining

1435
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,166
Inviting and awakening

1436
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:52,791
Many a knife waiting to stab me

1437
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:54,750
That's their account to tally

1438
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:58,083
This knife is different altogether
Don't you dare plan to close my chapter

1439
01:48:58,166 --> 01:49:00,541
-Do you get it, mister?
-Oh! Yes, master.

1440
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:13,500
I'm known by another name too

1441
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:16,333
You'll tremble in fear
Upon hearing it, dude

1442
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:19,083
Print out the poster
All-ready is your brother

1443
01:49:19,208 --> 01:49:21,416
Celebrate and how! Set it ablaze now

1444
01:49:21,875 --> 01:49:23,208
Here I am…

1445
01:49:23,291 --> 01:49:24,791
Hey! Make way for our bro!

1446
01:49:31,166 --> 01:49:33,916
Here I am, your dear bro.
Shall I come now?

1447
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:36,750
Don't taunt this lion
With the sting of a scorpion

1448
01:49:36,833 --> 01:49:39,541
No matter who tries to obstruct my route
It will be the same forever

1449
01:49:39,625 --> 01:49:42,041
I'm ready. Shall I make an entry?

1450
01:49:42,125 --> 01:49:44,625
Your favorite bro, shall I come solo?

1451
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:47,625
Till the Earth quakes, beat the drum
I will dance in tune to your rhythm

1452
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:50,833
I'll light the torch in a flick
Between my fingers double quick

1453
01:49:55,791 --> 01:50:00,541
Pick the best goat and slaughter
So I can appease my hunger

1454
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:55,291
I had to do this, Leo.

1455
01:50:56,541 --> 01:50:58,750
Even now, between you and your sister

1456
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:02,750
many chose you,
they opted to sacrifice you.

1457
01:51:02,833 --> 01:51:04,708
My brother also chose you.

1458
01:51:05,791 --> 01:51:08,833
I was the one who saved you!

1459
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:12,208
You need not thank me for that.

1460
01:51:14,541 --> 01:51:16,000
Just pardon me.

1461
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:19,750
From my childhood till date,

1462
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:22,916
I've killed countless people
for your sake.

1463
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,416
I took your word as gospel
and killed my friend too.

1464
01:51:29,041 --> 01:51:31,125
That was for our business.

1465
01:51:32,583 --> 01:51:35,958
But this is mere superstition!

1466
01:51:36,083 --> 01:51:38,166
Let go of Elisa!

1467
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:40,125
Leo!

1468
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:42,583
This is also for our business.

1469
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:46,500
-Understand that!
-Hey!

1470
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:51,750
She isn't just my sister.

1471
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:56,791
She is my twin.
A part of me, my other half!

1472
01:51:57,291 --> 01:51:59,625
If anything untoward happens to her,

1473
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:01,958
no matter how many births you take

1474
01:52:02,666 --> 01:52:07,000
the day I see you will be your last day!

1475
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:09,291
The day I meet you

1476
01:52:09,375 --> 01:52:12,666
will be your last day on Earth!

1477
01:52:13,583 --> 01:52:15,083
Are you begging him?

1478
01:52:17,583 --> 01:52:19,708
Didn't I tell you the day
our mother passed away?

1479
01:52:19,791 --> 01:52:22,666
That he has something
to do with her death.

1480
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:25,666
If he has decided
to sacrifice his children,

1481
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:27,750
I don't consider him my dad anymore,

1482
01:52:27,833 --> 01:52:30,083
none of them here are my kith and kin!

1483
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:32,875
Will you do me a favor, Leo?

1484
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:37,541
Don't spare any of them alive.

1485
01:52:52,375 --> 01:52:53,625
Hey!

1486
01:52:54,541 --> 01:52:56,166
Don't even think about it.

1487
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:00,708
Hey!

1488
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:03,125
Hey!

1489
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:04,916
Don't you dare!

1490
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:06,625
Let her go!

1491
01:53:06,708 --> 01:53:08,333
Dad!

1492
01:53:08,583 --> 01:53:10,333
Dad!

1493
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:12,833
Hey!

1494
01:53:12,916 --> 01:53:15,458
Release her! Let her go!

1495
01:53:33,708 --> 01:53:35,875
Elisa, try to understand!

1496
01:53:36,625 --> 01:53:37,875
Understand my plight!

1497
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:43,750
Leo!

1498
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:49,375
Hey!

1499
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:54,291
Leo, burn down the entire factory.

1500
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:56,125
Harold, don't let them escape.

1501
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:01,708
Harold! Don't let them escape!

1502
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:12,708
Leo!

1503
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:25,125
-Come on.
-Come!

1504
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,291
-Come on.
-Catch…

1505
01:54:37,666 --> 01:54:39,791
Hey! Don't spare anyone.

1506
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:06,541
Don't leave anything out!
Burn everything down!

1507
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:07,791
Everything!

1508
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,416
Hey!

1509
01:55:46,666 --> 01:55:47,708
Hey!

1510
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:52,041
You wanted to sacrifice
your children for this, right?

1511
01:55:53,416 --> 01:55:54,458
Hey, Leo!

1512
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:56,041
This shouldn't exist anymore!

1513
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,541
Hereafter this…

1514
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,208
Hey!

1515
01:55:59,333 --> 01:56:00,791
…shouldn't exist!

1516
01:56:00,875 --> 01:56:02,583
Leo, stop it!

1517
01:56:05,958 --> 01:56:07,875
Hey! Throw me a knife.

1518
01:56:13,541 --> 01:56:17,000
Elisa!

1519
01:56:25,916 --> 01:56:28,875
Elisa…

1520
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,541
-Elisa…
-Leo.

1521
01:56:34,458 --> 01:56:36,416
Don't be with them, Leo.

1522
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,583
Elisa!

1523
01:56:37,833 --> 01:56:39,750
Go somewhere far away.

1524
01:57:38,083 --> 01:57:39,375
My dearest Elisa!

1525
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,333
Elisa!

1526
01:57:45,166 --> 01:57:47,041
Elisa!

1527
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,750
I raised him.

1528
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:18,500
The day he collapsed and burned
to his death in front of my eyes

1529
01:58:18,583 --> 01:58:21,000
is embedded in my heart.

1530
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:28,500
Tell me if it's Leo in this photo.

1531
01:58:30,166 --> 01:58:31,041
No need.

1532
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:34,458
If you just identify him,
all the problems will be solved.

1533
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:40,958
Even if he stands amidst 1,000 people,

1534
01:58:41,041 --> 01:58:43,500
I can identify Leo from his eyes.

1535
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:45,083
This isn't him.

1536
01:58:45,291 --> 01:58:48,125
Don't play unnecessarily
with an innocent man's life.

1537
01:58:48,208 --> 01:58:50,791
Warden! Take me away.

1538
01:58:50,916 --> 01:58:53,416
He is shell-shocked
upon hearing one day's happenings.

1539
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:56,916
If he hears the entire story,
he's likely to lose his life!

1540
01:59:02,208 --> 01:59:03,125
Give it.

1541
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:09,000
We clicked this during third grade.
This is in fourth grade.

1542
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:10,958
And this is in fifth grade.

1543
01:59:11,625 --> 01:59:14,250
This is the letter he wrote to me
during his college days.

1544
01:59:20,666 --> 01:59:22,250
May I ask you something?

1545
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:24,666
I consider you my brother
and I'm asking you this.

1546
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:28,958
I know what's on your mind.
I won't tell him about your visit.

1547
01:59:29,041 --> 01:59:30,791
Make sure that he doesn't find out.

1548
01:59:30,875 --> 01:59:33,041
If he finds out, he'll be devastated.

1549
01:59:37,583 --> 01:59:39,791
-Hello?
-Sir, is this Parthiban?

1550
01:59:39,958 --> 01:59:42,250
-Yes.
-Sir, come to the coffee shop at once.

1551
01:59:42,333 --> 01:59:43,375
It's an emergency.

1552
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:48,500
He was drinking with us, sir.

1553
01:59:48,708 --> 01:59:51,416
I don't know why he kept saying
that he saw his friend.

1554
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,166
He was happily drinking.

1555
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,208
He even bought booze
for all the passers-by, sir.

1556
01:59:55,291 --> 01:59:57,750
Then he left in an inebriated state.

1557
01:59:57,833 --> 02:00:00,041
He stood on the road and spoke to someone
over the phone for a long time.

1558
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:02,333
Then some people arrived in a car
and took him away.

1559
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,333
-Was it a black car?
-Yes, sir.

1560
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:12,833
Hey!

1561
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:18,250
He claimed to be your friend
and came to your cafe.

1562
02:00:18,333 --> 02:00:21,458
He sat there and chatted with you.
He has even taken your photo.

1563
02:00:21,541 --> 02:00:24,541
How do you know him? Can't you hear me?

1564
02:00:27,416 --> 02:00:31,541
Sir! If he was a regular customer
at my cafe,

1565
02:00:31,625 --> 02:00:34,375
I should've at least been
slightly upset, right?

1566
02:00:35,625 --> 02:00:37,750
Look into my eyes. Are there tears?

1567
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:40,875
I don't know him, sir.

1568
02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:44,666
How can I be responsible
for him dying in front of my cafe?

1569
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:48,750
I'll come to the station when you call me.
You can interrogate me there.

1570
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:52,166
I've left my little girl alone at home.
I'm scared for her. I need to go.

1571
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:54,500
-Okay, go.
-Thank you, sir.

1572
02:01:23,666 --> 02:01:27,333
I don't know whether to feel sorry
or be suspicious of Parthiban.

1573
02:01:27,416 --> 02:01:28,583
Listen.

1574
02:01:28,708 --> 02:01:33,083
Every human being
has a limit to lie and pretend.

1575
02:01:33,375 --> 02:01:35,125
He can do it only up to a breaking point.

1576
02:01:35,208 --> 02:01:39,416
He can't continue to put on an act
beyond that point.

1577
02:01:40,083 --> 02:01:42,625
Because no one is mentally strong
to that extent.

1578
02:01:42,708 --> 02:01:45,875
I feel Parthiban isn't acting.

1579
02:01:45,958 --> 02:01:47,541
He is Parthiban indeed.

1580
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:50,541
Beyond this, if truth has to be told,

1581
02:01:51,041 --> 02:01:54,500
Leo, who is allegedly dead
has to come in person and say it.

1582
02:01:55,958 --> 02:01:57,208
Parthi, are you back?

1583
02:01:57,291 --> 02:01:59,541
I heard you left in a hurry
because you got a call.

1584
02:01:59,625 --> 02:02:00,666
Where did you go?

1585
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:02,791
Do you know how hectic the past two days
have been at work for me?

1586
02:02:02,875 --> 02:02:05,083
Why is your dinner untouched?

1587
02:02:05,375 --> 02:02:09,416
Parthi, what happened?
Why are you sitting here quietly?

1588
02:02:25,291 --> 02:02:29,333
Beyond this,
I have nothing left to lose, dear.

1589
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:34,250
I'm a loser.

1590
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:40,416
From my fingerprints
to the black pupils of my eyes,

1591
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:42,208
you are suspecting every part of me.

1592
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:44,333
-It's not like that, please--
-Don't touch me!

1593
02:02:44,416 --> 02:02:46,000
Don't touch me.

1594
02:02:49,458 --> 02:02:52,458
This whole world can suspect me.

1595
02:02:52,541 --> 02:02:56,708
But how could you doubt me?
How did you see me as a stranger?

1596
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:57,916
Sathya?

1597
02:03:03,916 --> 02:03:07,833
Oh, no! No matter what
explanation you give to appease me,

1598
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:12,083
the fact that you suspected me

1599
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:14,708
will haunt me forever.

1600
02:03:15,208 --> 02:03:16,541
Is our bond so fragile?

1601
02:03:16,625 --> 02:03:19,791
The life that we led so far
has lost its meaning.

1602
02:03:19,875 --> 02:03:20,916
That's it, right?

1603
02:03:25,458 --> 02:03:27,583
I am not him!

1604
02:03:27,916 --> 02:03:30,250
Parthiban isn't that kind of a person.

1605
02:03:30,333 --> 02:03:33,125
Despite repeating myself
over and over again,

1606
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:36,416
just because some
random chap resembles me…

1607
02:03:39,666 --> 02:03:41,083
-What happened, Dad?
-It's nothing, sweetie.

1608
02:03:41,166 --> 02:03:44,416
I wasn't feeling well. Go to sleep.

1609
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:47,583
Dance for me. Oh…

1610
02:03:47,666 --> 02:03:51,291
I've never seen anybody do the things
you do before

1611
02:03:51,375 --> 02:03:54,458
They say, move for me

1612
02:03:54,583 --> 02:03:59,416
And when you're done,
I'll make you do it all again

1613
02:04:01,166 --> 02:04:03,333
Hey, you.

1614
02:04:04,541 --> 02:04:06,375
Some random fellow…

1615
02:04:07,583 --> 02:04:11,250
If they torture me claiming
I resemble some random riff-raff,

1616
02:04:11,333 --> 02:04:13,083
what can I do?

1617
02:04:13,416 --> 02:04:16,291
You've forsaken your trust in me.

1618
02:04:16,375 --> 02:04:18,541
My son asked me if I'm his dad.

1619
02:04:18,625 --> 02:04:22,125
You ask me if I'm your husband!
Who am I? Tell me.

1620
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:26,666
That's correct.

1621
02:04:27,208 --> 02:04:30,750
I don't know who my parents are
or what my place of birth is.

1622
02:04:30,875 --> 02:04:32,291
I'm an orphan.

1623
02:04:32,833 --> 02:04:35,916
Maybe if they were alive,
they wouldn't have suspected me.

1624
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,125
I'm an orphan, after all.

1625
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:38,666
-Don't say that.
-Just an orphan.

1626
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:42,000
Parthi, you're not an orphan. Look at me.

1627
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:44,416
I'm telling you to look into my eyes.

1628
02:04:44,833 --> 02:04:47,750
I didn't do this
due to lack of trust in you.

1629
02:04:47,833 --> 02:04:51,791
When other people ask me,
I need to tell them with certainty, right?

1630
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:53,708
"He is not that man."

1631
02:04:53,833 --> 02:04:56,666
I should be able to confidently assert
this is my husband, Parthiban, right?

1632
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:58,833
Why can't you understand?

1633
02:05:00,583 --> 02:05:01,708
My dear.

1634
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:05,541
I need to ask just one question.

1635
02:05:06,291 --> 02:05:09,750
After you suspected
that I was someone else,

1636
02:05:10,458 --> 02:05:13,208
how could you touch me with familiarity?

1637
02:05:13,833 --> 02:05:15,333
Wouldn't you feel disgusted?

1638
02:05:15,416 --> 02:05:17,166
The way actress Revathi
says in Mouna Ragam,

1639
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:20,166
"I feel a hairy caterpillar
is crawling all over--"

1640
02:05:27,291 --> 02:05:28,708
Trust me.

1641
02:05:30,541 --> 02:05:31,833
Sathya.

1642
02:05:35,083 --> 02:05:36,666
Please trust me.

1643
02:05:37,791 --> 02:05:40,791
I'm your Parthi, dear.

1644
02:05:53,541 --> 02:05:56,541
Leo, the time I gave you is over.

1645
02:05:56,708 --> 02:05:59,666
You didn't come. So I am here to see you.

1646
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:00,833
Look outside.

1647
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:07,291
Hey! Who the hell are you all?

1648
02:06:07,666 --> 02:06:09,166
What are you doing here?

1649
02:06:09,375 --> 02:06:10,958
You better leave!

1650
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:12,708
I'll shoot you all down!

1651
02:06:12,791 --> 02:06:14,791
You won't leave this place alive!

1652
02:06:18,083 --> 02:06:20,375
This need not have gone so far.

1653
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:24,625
If you had come of your own accord
and admitted to me that you are Leo

1654
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:27,875
I wouldn't have come here now.

1655
02:06:28,041 --> 02:06:30,375
Sir! Don't come downstairs
for any reason whatsoever.

1656
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:31,750
I'll deal with them!

1657
02:06:32,166 --> 02:06:34,166
I came to meet you

1658
02:06:34,333 --> 02:06:37,416
but a mongrel is barking over here!

1659
02:06:39,458 --> 02:06:40,458
Okay.

1660
02:06:40,583 --> 02:06:44,333
Amidst all this, give some thought
to where your son is.

1661
02:06:45,666 --> 02:06:46,875
Sathya?

1662
02:06:46,958 --> 02:06:48,041
Where is Siddharth?

1663
02:06:48,125 --> 02:06:49,916
-What happened?
-Where is Siddhu?

1664
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,875
-Check on Siddhu.
-You won't be able to find him.

1665
02:06:51,958 --> 02:06:54,750
-He would've reached his destination.
-He isn't here!

1666
02:06:54,833 --> 02:06:55,875
Siddharth!

1667
02:06:56,416 --> 02:06:58,541
Bring our daughter.

1668
02:06:58,833 --> 02:07:02,083
But your son is so damn cute.

1669
02:07:02,291 --> 02:07:05,625
He came out to smoke, got trapped
and made it easy for us.

1670
02:07:06,041 --> 02:07:07,541
Can you hear me?

1671
02:07:07,958 --> 02:07:10,833
Parthiban, what is happening here?
Where is Siddhu?

1672
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:13,250
Whom are you talking to?

1673
02:07:13,333 --> 02:07:15,750
If anyone except me enters the house,
you must stab them.

1674
02:07:15,833 --> 02:07:16,750
Why?

1675
02:07:16,833 --> 02:07:19,166
You will do it. Hold it! Come on!

1676
02:07:20,916 --> 02:07:22,708
Go in.

1677
02:07:22,791 --> 02:07:24,791
Lock the door from inside, Sathya.

1678
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:27,291
You don't have to be Leo.

1679
02:07:27,375 --> 02:07:30,166
But think about it.

1680
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:32,166
Why should I kidnap your son?

1681
02:07:32,708 --> 02:07:36,666
Twenty-two years ago, your sister died

1682
02:07:37,708 --> 02:07:39,458
on this very day.

1683
02:07:39,708 --> 02:07:42,333
I'm taking your son today

1684
02:07:42,791 --> 02:07:45,166
and you know the reason behind it.

1685
02:07:45,958 --> 02:07:49,833
Don't you understand?
I don't have a sister or any damn sibling.

1686
02:07:50,125 --> 02:07:52,166
Let go of my son, rascal!

1687
02:07:55,083 --> 02:07:58,375
-Sir?
-You'll come on your own, Leo!

1688
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:02,541
-What is it?
-Sir, open the door!

1689
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,625
-Sir, they have kidnapped Siddhu.
-I didn't know they took him.

1690
02:08:18,166 --> 02:08:19,625
Hey!

1691
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:41,666
Load your gun, sir.

1692
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:19,208
Sir, hold tight!

1693
02:09:21,541 --> 02:09:23,333
Watch out!

1694
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:03,833
Where is my son!

1695
02:11:03,916 --> 02:11:06,125
Answer me! Where is my son!

1696
02:11:23,208 --> 02:11:24,833
Hey!

1697
02:11:31,833 --> 02:11:32,833
Siddhu?

1698
02:11:33,125 --> 02:11:34,166
Siddhu?

1699
02:11:35,875 --> 02:11:37,041
Siddhu!

1700
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,333
My son!

1701
02:12:26,625 --> 02:12:28,541
I failed to kill you, Leo.

1702
02:12:29,458 --> 02:12:32,125
But I won't fail to kill your son!

1703
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:47,333
I'm not the man you're looking for!

1704
02:12:47,416 --> 02:12:50,375
You're presuming I'm your son
and ruining my life!

1705
02:12:53,375 --> 02:12:55,708
Where is my son? Come on, tell me.

1706
02:12:55,875 --> 02:12:58,958
Speak up! Where is my son? Tell me!

1707
02:13:00,833 --> 02:13:03,208
Accept that you're my son.

1708
02:13:05,375 --> 02:13:07,666
And I'll let your son go.

1709
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:11,958
Oh, God! I'm not your son! No.

1710
02:13:12,041 --> 02:13:13,625
I'm not your son!

1711
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,208
Tell me.

1712
02:14:00,416 --> 02:14:01,958
You're my son, right?

1713
02:14:08,458 --> 02:14:12,833
Harold, Antony is no more.

1714
02:14:14,083 --> 02:14:15,958
I'm bringing the boy.

1715
02:14:18,041 --> 02:14:21,291
Napoleon needs bed-rest.
I'm there, I'll take care of him.

1716
02:14:21,375 --> 02:14:24,875
But they won't stop at this.
They will come looking for you.

1717
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,791
Your son will be safe for now.

1718
02:14:27,083 --> 02:14:29,375
We will send a task force and find him.

1719
02:14:30,125 --> 02:14:32,166
But you shouldn't stay here.

1720
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:34,875
If you stay here,
your life will be in grave danger.

1721
02:14:34,958 --> 02:14:36,250
Please listen to me.

1722
02:14:36,833 --> 02:14:39,833
I've arranged a car.
It's parked at your doorstep.

1723
02:14:39,916 --> 02:14:42,958
Collect your essentials and leave. Now!

1724
02:14:47,416 --> 02:14:48,458
Who is this?

1725
02:14:55,208 --> 02:14:58,125
Leo, no matter where you go and hide

1726
02:14:58,333 --> 02:15:00,750
you know very well
that I'll come and get you.

1727
02:15:00,833 --> 02:15:02,333
All I want is your life.

1728
02:15:02,416 --> 02:15:04,666
Don't step on my ego and lose your family.

1729
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:06,666
If you want your son back

1730
02:15:07,666 --> 02:15:09,666
hand over my elder brother to me.

1731
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:13,375
Bring him here and take your son.

1732
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:28,083
Parthiban, take it.
Go soon and bring back your son.

1733
02:15:50,666 --> 02:15:52,833
Das, I've sent boss' body.

1734
02:15:52,958 --> 02:15:56,500
We have boarded him on the train.
We will reach in an hour.

1735
02:16:54,208 --> 02:16:58,000
Sir, as per your request,
I've given your brother's body.

1736
02:16:58,458 --> 02:17:01,333
Please give my son back, I'll leave.

1737
02:17:03,958 --> 02:17:07,291
I know, you won't believe me
no matter what I say.

1738
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:09,916
-That's why I--
-Hey!

1739
02:17:13,208 --> 02:17:16,083
Don't be scared.
This is just my son's school bag.

1740
02:17:16,416 --> 02:17:17,541
Sir, this is my birth certificate

1741
02:17:17,625 --> 02:17:19,083
and these are my 10th
and 12th mark sheets.

1742
02:17:19,166 --> 02:17:20,916
This is my ration card, Aadhar card
and wedding photos.

1743
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,583
This was clicked during
my daughter's ear piercing ceremony.

1744
02:17:22,666 --> 02:17:24,416
This was clicked on my son's
first birthday, sir.

1745
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:25,333
Look at this, sir.

1746
02:17:25,416 --> 02:17:27,541
When I was in 10th grade,
I took part in an oratorical contest

1747
02:17:27,625 --> 02:17:29,000
and bagged the first prize with my speech
on Kappalottiya Thamizhan.

1748
02:17:29,083 --> 02:17:30,500
This was taken there.

1749
02:17:30,583 --> 02:17:33,416
My name is in bold letters
in the certificate.

1750
02:17:40,875 --> 02:17:44,791
Look here. This is you and your sister
on your 10th birthday.

1751
02:17:44,875 --> 02:17:47,958
A Honey Badger
had entered our tobacco field.

1752
02:17:48,041 --> 02:17:49,916
This photo was taken after it was killed.

1753
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,375
Look how smart you look
with that blood-stained face.

1754
02:17:52,458 --> 02:17:53,500
I understand, sir.

1755
02:17:54,666 --> 02:17:58,208
It's not wrong
that you mistook me for Leo, sir.

1756
02:17:58,291 --> 02:18:00,541
He bears a striking resemblance to me.

1757
02:18:03,333 --> 02:18:05,958
Hey! Do I look like a fool?

1758
02:18:07,625 --> 02:18:10,833
-Sir…
-Do I seem like an imbecile?

1759
02:18:12,708 --> 02:18:14,208
Leo.

1760
02:18:14,416 --> 02:18:17,750
You know what I did to your twin sister.

1761
02:18:17,916 --> 02:18:19,958
I think you haven't forgotten that.

1762
02:18:20,541 --> 02:18:23,000
You better accept that you are Leo.

1763
02:18:23,083 --> 02:18:25,791
Or your son will share
the same fate as your twin.

1764
02:18:25,875 --> 02:18:29,541
Sir, I don't have a sister.
How do I make you understand?

1765
02:18:29,625 --> 02:18:30,791
Siddhu?

1766
02:18:39,208 --> 02:18:40,541
Sir.

1767
02:18:43,291 --> 02:18:45,958
In all these years,
he is scrutinizing someone

1768
02:18:46,208 --> 02:18:48,041
for the first time.

1769
02:18:48,208 --> 02:18:52,083
Human beings can lie.
Certificates can be fake.

1770
02:18:52,708 --> 02:18:55,125
But birds and beasts never lie.

1771
02:18:55,208 --> 02:18:59,083
I've never seen an eagle
at such close quarters in my life, sir.

1772
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:01,708
Ask it to step back. I'm scared, sir.

1773
02:19:08,875 --> 02:19:09,750
Hey.

1774
02:19:09,833 --> 02:19:13,041
This performance
is just to protect your family, right?

1775
02:19:13,125 --> 02:19:15,291
You committed a blunder even there.

1776
02:19:15,708 --> 02:19:17,958
You came here to save your son

1777
02:19:18,041 --> 02:19:20,166
but left your wife and your daughter

1778
02:19:20,333 --> 02:19:22,583
all alone at home, my dear boy.

1779
02:19:23,333 --> 02:19:24,625
Shall I ask my men

1780
02:19:24,916 --> 02:19:29,541
to slit their throats?

1781
02:19:30,416 --> 02:19:31,375
Hey!

1782
02:19:32,458 --> 02:19:33,916
Okay, sir.

1783
02:19:43,791 --> 02:19:45,625
Sir, don't harm them.

1784
02:19:45,708 --> 02:19:47,166
Sir, please.

1785
02:19:58,750 --> 02:20:00,666
Hey!

1786
02:20:00,750 --> 02:20:04,125
Instruct your guys not to harm them, sir.
Poor souls, sir.

1787
02:20:12,458 --> 02:20:15,125
-Shut up!
-Hush!

1788
02:20:18,458 --> 02:20:20,166
Let's run for our lives!

1789
02:20:24,291 --> 02:20:26,708
What's this?
They have planted bombs here!

1790
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:30,250
-What is it, Mom?
-Nothing, dear, go back to sleep.

1791
02:20:30,333 --> 02:20:33,000
Sir, tell them not to go in.

1792
02:20:33,083 --> 02:20:34,083
-Hey, what happened--
-Sir.

1793
02:20:34,166 --> 02:20:36,416
-Will you walk in the front?
-Shut up!

1794
02:20:39,250 --> 02:20:41,333
No, don't!

1795
02:20:42,666 --> 02:20:44,708
Hey! He's gone.

1796
02:20:48,125 --> 02:20:50,833
My eyes are burning!

1797
02:20:50,916 --> 02:20:52,750
It's burning!

1798
02:20:52,875 --> 02:20:53,958
Come with me.

1799
02:20:56,291 --> 02:20:58,083
Hey! You climb up.

1800
02:20:58,208 --> 02:21:00,375
What? Can you open it or not?

1801
02:21:00,583 --> 02:21:01,666
Hey!

1802
02:21:01,875 --> 02:21:03,041
-Sir…
-Hey!

1803
02:21:03,125 --> 02:21:05,333
Sir, at least you tell him, please.

1804
02:21:05,416 --> 02:21:07,208
Tell them not to do anything, sir.
Please, sir.

1805
02:21:07,291 --> 02:21:10,125
Instruct them not to enter
my house, please, sir.

1806
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:21,291
You're leaving me alone to face this!

1807
02:21:31,333 --> 02:21:33,666
-You climb up.
-Let's come back in the morning.

1808
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:34,958
Hey! Just climb!

1809
02:21:46,208 --> 02:21:47,458
My side is all clear.

1810
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:50,291
Check those who are entering
through the main door.

1811
02:21:50,375 --> 02:21:53,125
Watch it, there could be more booby traps.

1812
02:22:10,875 --> 02:22:13,125
Who is this? Looks like Chhota Bheem.

1813
02:22:20,625 --> 02:22:22,750
Hey! Stupid guy, come!

1814
02:22:23,875 --> 02:22:24,958
Hey!

1815
02:23:07,166 --> 02:23:08,125
Sir.

1816
02:23:08,375 --> 02:23:11,916
I killed all those who barged in
except for one guy.

1817
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,041
He climbed in from the side
and entered upstairs, sir.

1818
02:23:14,125 --> 02:23:15,708
He will go to hell soon.

1819
02:23:15,791 --> 02:23:17,041
You be safe.

1820
02:23:24,083 --> 02:23:25,208
Hey!

1821
02:23:29,916 --> 02:23:31,041
Hey!

1822
02:23:31,333 --> 02:23:34,875
Are you playing the fool with me?
I'll chop you into pieces!

1823
02:23:37,416 --> 02:23:39,458
-Sir, please…
-Hey!

1824
02:23:39,541 --> 02:23:41,750
-Sir.
-Why are you hanging up on me?

1825
02:23:41,833 --> 02:23:43,500
-Sir.
-What is going on there?

1826
02:23:43,583 --> 02:23:46,625
He's no ordinary fellow, sir.
He has set traps all around the house.

1827
02:23:46,708 --> 02:23:48,208
All our men are dead.

1828
02:23:48,791 --> 02:23:50,625
I know him like the back of my hand.

1829
02:23:50,708 --> 02:23:52,041
I confirm, he is Leo.

1830
02:23:52,125 --> 02:23:53,458
Who is in front of you?

1831
02:23:53,541 --> 02:23:56,416
His wife and daughter.
Shall I slit their throats open?

1832
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:58,750
No need. Put the phone on speaker.

1833
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,583
Give the phone to his wife.

1834
02:24:03,666 --> 02:24:04,916
You better listen to me.

1835
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,708
-Accept that you are Leo.
-Sir.

1836
02:24:06,791 --> 02:24:08,208
I'll let them go.

1837
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,750
Parthi!

1838
02:24:14,041 --> 02:24:15,791
Sathya, don't panic.

1839
02:24:19,208 --> 02:24:20,416
Accept it.

1840
02:24:25,958 --> 02:24:27,666
Subramani.

1841
02:24:52,083 --> 02:24:53,250
Hey!

1842
02:24:53,333 --> 02:24:55,041
I'm talking seriously here
and you're laughing!

1843
02:24:55,125 --> 02:24:56,125
Me?

1844
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,791
I think it's some rabid dog.

1845
02:25:01,666 --> 02:25:02,750
Go away!

1846
02:25:20,833 --> 02:25:24,041
I told you to instruct your men
to not go in, sir.

1847
02:25:24,125 --> 02:25:25,666
Poor fellows. Right, sir?

1848
02:25:55,125 --> 02:25:57,000
Now the Leo we know will emerge.

1849
02:26:30,083 --> 02:26:33,041
Chittu, he has to accept that he's Leo.

1850
02:27:02,916 --> 02:27:06,083
-Don't let go of him!
-Hold him tight!

1851
02:27:06,166 --> 02:27:08,291
-Chop him!
-Don't let go of him.

1852
02:28:08,166 --> 02:28:09,541
Chop him into pieces!

1853
02:28:42,875 --> 02:28:44,708
Chop him!

1854
02:29:10,833 --> 02:29:12,500
Hey! Stay with his son.

1855
02:31:15,333 --> 02:31:16,458
Hey!

1856
02:31:16,708 --> 02:31:19,166
I used this to kill your sister…

1857
02:32:01,875 --> 02:32:03,583
Now I realise

1858
02:32:04,625 --> 02:32:06,166
you are not Leo.

1859
02:32:06,458 --> 02:32:08,000
You are Parthiban.

1860
02:32:08,916 --> 02:32:10,541
Now I believe you.

1861
02:32:10,833 --> 02:32:12,583
You are not the one

1862
02:32:14,916 --> 02:32:16,416
whom I was looking for.

1863
02:32:16,791 --> 02:32:18,166
Let's call it quits.

1864
02:32:18,541 --> 02:32:19,625
What do you say?

1865
02:32:20,791 --> 02:32:22,000
Drop your gun.

1866
02:32:22,791 --> 02:32:24,208
Hey!

1867
02:32:24,750 --> 02:32:26,416
Lower your gun.

1868
02:32:26,666 --> 02:32:27,875
Lower it.

1869
02:32:28,291 --> 02:32:30,833
Hey! Either shoot it
or drop it, scoundrel!

1870
02:32:30,958 --> 02:32:32,041
Let go!

1871
02:32:55,875 --> 02:32:58,791
Leo…

1872
02:32:58,916 --> 02:33:01,041
Leo!

1873
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:05,583
Leo!

1874
02:33:09,791 --> 02:33:14,208
-If I'm sweet, you're bloody sweet, Uncle.
-Hey!

1875
02:33:16,708 --> 02:33:19,583
I should've killed you
on that fateful day, right?

1876
02:33:20,625 --> 02:33:21,875
The mistake was mine.

1877
02:33:23,666 --> 02:33:24,666
Now go to hell!

1878
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:29,791
Leo…

1879
02:33:30,416 --> 02:33:32,250
Was this necessary for you?

1880
02:33:32,333 --> 02:33:35,083
"I want to see Leo. I want to find Leo."

1881
02:33:36,416 --> 02:33:37,916
Didn't you ask?

1882
02:33:38,583 --> 02:33:39,708
See me now.

1883
02:33:39,791 --> 02:33:44,875
Leo…

1884
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,625
Drop your gun.

1885
02:34:09,458 --> 02:34:11,875
Check if there are any vehicles outside.

1886
02:34:16,875 --> 02:34:20,416
If a person's past has to be quoted often

1887
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:22,458
he should've done something good.

1888
02:34:22,541 --> 02:34:24,541
I have done no good deed.

1889
02:34:25,083 --> 02:34:29,125
In my past, knowingly or unknowingly,
I have committed many crimes.

1890
02:34:29,583 --> 02:34:33,291
The last chance I got to reform myself
is this family of mine.

1891
02:34:33,958 --> 02:34:38,708
I will go to any extent
to protect this family.

1892
02:34:39,458 --> 02:34:42,291
The man called Leo is dead.

1893
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:46,458
If I have to convince this town
and the people around of his demise

1894
02:34:46,916 --> 02:34:49,916
first I have to believe it myself.

1895
02:34:50,416 --> 02:34:53,750
Leo is dead. I believe it.

1896
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:05,166
How are you?

1897
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:13,583
No matter how many people
come and ask me if I'm Leo,

1898
02:35:14,333 --> 02:35:16,625
I'll convince them too.

1899
02:35:18,750 --> 02:35:22,541
Despite that, if someone
insists on knowing my story,

1900
02:35:22,916 --> 02:35:26,208
he should either die the next minute

1901
02:35:26,875 --> 02:35:29,458
or already be dead.

1902
02:35:32,625 --> 02:35:34,708
Of course I'm Leo.

1903
02:35:35,416 --> 02:35:37,750
Leo Das!

1904
02:35:38,416 --> 02:35:40,708
My life is in this town

1905
02:35:40,791 --> 02:35:43,208
And I ain't going down

1906
02:35:43,291 --> 02:35:47,875
You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown

1907
02:35:48,041 --> 02:35:50,416
My life is in this town

1908
02:35:50,541 --> 02:35:52,916
And I ain't going down

1909
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:57,416
You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown

1910
02:35:57,500 --> 02:36:00,708
Just an ordinary person

1911
02:36:01,083 --> 02:36:01,916
Yeah

1912
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,041
I'm just a peace-loving soul

1913
02:36:06,416 --> 02:36:11,625
I'm just an ordinary person, yeah!

1914
02:36:11,708 --> 02:36:14,875
I'm just a peace-loving soul

1915
02:36:15,708 --> 02:36:16,791
Peace loving soul

1916
02:36:16,875 --> 02:36:19,875
My life is in this town

1917
02:36:52,875 --> 02:36:55,958
I came here and said that I'm not Leo.

1918
02:36:56,166 --> 02:36:58,666
No one believed me. They hit me.

1919
02:36:58,916 --> 02:37:03,208
Finally they accepted that I'm not Leo.
Other than this, nothing happened.

1920
02:37:03,291 --> 02:37:05,291
Promise me that you won't tell your mom
what happened here.

1921
02:37:05,375 --> 02:37:08,500
You promise me
you won't tell mom that I smoke.

1922
02:37:08,583 --> 02:37:12,125
I'm just an ordinary person!

1923
02:37:12,291 --> 02:37:13,458
Yeah

1924
02:37:13,541 --> 02:37:16,541
I'm just a peace-loving soul

1925
02:37:18,125 --> 02:37:21,458
I'm just an ordinary person!

1926
02:37:22,125 --> 02:37:25,958
Yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul

1927
02:37:26,916 --> 02:37:28,625
Peace loving soul

1928
02:37:29,541 --> 02:37:33,041
-Who scratched your face, Dad?
-Keep quiet.

1929
02:37:33,416 --> 02:37:35,208
Siddhu, switch on the TV.

1930
02:37:44,291 --> 02:37:48,458
I'm a wicked man, so ruthless

1931
02:37:50,375 --> 02:37:54,000
I never lie, I confess

1932
02:37:56,083 --> 02:37:59,416
I'm a wicked man

1933
02:38:00,416 --> 02:38:02,833
I think the main door isn't locked.

1934
02:38:03,375 --> 02:38:05,208
I'll go and lock it.

1935
02:38:05,333 --> 02:38:09,333
I never harbor any grudge in my heart

1936
02:38:25,541 --> 02:38:26,750
Hello?

1937
02:38:27,166 --> 02:38:30,583
Just because you destroyed
a single Datura factory

1938
02:38:30,666 --> 02:38:33,958
do you think all your problems
got solved, Parthiban?

1939
02:38:34,083 --> 02:38:36,041
Oh! I'm sorry.

1940
02:38:36,583 --> 02:38:38,000
Leo.

1941
02:38:40,416 --> 02:38:44,583
If you want to make
this society drug-free,

1942
02:38:44,666 --> 02:38:48,458
there are lots more left throughout India
to be burnt down, Leo.

1943
02:38:49,291 --> 02:38:51,500
Do you recognize my voice?

1944
02:38:53,458 --> 02:38:55,916
He is a badass, deadly!

1945
02:38:56,375 --> 02:39:01,375
