00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,865
It's Friday night, you know.

168
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,466
Is it?

169
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,202
Mm-hmm.

170
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,940
If this was before,
what would you be doing?

171
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,810
I'd probably be at the 19th
hole with my father-in-law.

172
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,744
(Katie chuckling)

173
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,647
I'm sorry, I never pictured you
as the country club type, Will.

174
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,249
- (both laughing)
- I wasn't.

175
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,919
But Tara's family loved it.

176
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,454
I hated it.

177
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,925
And now I miss it.

178
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,133
(gunshot)

179
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,602
Goddamn it.

180
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,973
(Katie chuckles softly)

181
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,513
(machine whirring and beeping)

182
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,782
(Hunter gasping)

183
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,286
We're out of filters, so
I'm-a have to give you a shot.

184
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,263
(insects chirping)

185
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,901
(knocking)

186
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,070
(door opens)

187
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,478
Hello, Nina.

188
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,147
How are you?

189
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,985
How's the drinking?

190
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,154
Keeps me from killing myself.

191
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,992
How's yours?

192
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,261
Keeps me from killing you.

193
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,167
I'm leaving tomorrow.

194
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,636
For Boulder.

195
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,740
Well, that's probably the last
thing I expected you to say.

196
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,676
I don't have a choice.

197
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,215
You'll die.

198
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,951
They can't be killed.

199
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,685
You believed that,
you wouldn't still have

200
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,722
this pirate flag on your wall.

201
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,992
I found a safe way there.

202
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,732
There is no safe way.

203
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,002
I know every map.

204
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,104
Every route. Two days' walk.

205
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,407
Impossible to stay
above The Line the whole time.

206
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,844
Hunter's machine.

207
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,048
The last filter burnt out.

208
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,516
The hospital in Boulder
will have a crate of 'em.

209
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,553
But if I don't go, Hunter dies.

210
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,961
The place was probably looted.

211
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,362
No one had time to loot.

212
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,464
You're gonna have to go
below The Line

213
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,565
at least a dozen times.

214
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,832
You can't survive a dozen

215
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,833
encounters with those things.

216
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,103
You survived.

217
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,304
That was luck.

218
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,839
Luck is not a strategy.

219
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,475
Luck won't help you.

220
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,210
You're the only person
who fought them and lived.

221
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,844
You've studied them for years.

222
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,680
- That'll help me.
- So what? "Do me a favor, Nina.

223
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,415
Let's go. Let's die together."

224
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,917
But last year, you thought
you found a way to kill them

225
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,353
if you could get back
to your old lab.

226
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,888
That's why Tara went with you.

227
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,556
I have a way to Boulder.

228
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,259
It's mapped out. We only go
below The Line twice.

229
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,228
Twice?

230
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,529
That's not possible.

231
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,863
It is.

232
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,065
Calway Mine.

233
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,267
It goes through the mountain.

234
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,602
A mine?

235
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,936
A fucking mine, Will?

236
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,339
That's your plan?

237
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,840
That's a death trap
by definition.

238
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,409
My company did a big job there.

239
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,377
I walked every inch.

240
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,447
I know those tunnels.

241
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,251
You don't know anything.

242
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,087
You're desperate.

243
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,056
Desperate people get killed.

244
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,224
8:00 a.m.

245
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,426
Cathedral Point Overlook.

246
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,094
Who says I'm going?

247
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,363
Everything you've done up here
since day one says that.

248
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,200
Shooting at that goddamn
Reaper scale every night.

249
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,469
All you think about
is killing one of these things,

250
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,272
and you need something
from down there to do it.

251
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,107
You owe me this much.

252
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,476
For Tara.

253
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,911
Will.

254
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,950
Boulder is 2,000 feet
below The Line.

255
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,385
Even if you make it there,

256
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,920
they'll be there waiting
for you.

257
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,191
It only takes one of them.

258
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,627
I know.

259
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,898

He's got four days,
five at the most.

HANNAH:
I'll stay here with him.

TIM:
Changed the zero to 200 yards,

286
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,258
so you'll be able to engage 'em
from further out.

Oh.

288
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,362
AP rounds.

289
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,364
These are from
my own personal stash.

290
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,700
Slow 'em down a bit more
than a regular 556.

Good luck out there.

Were you planning
on telling me?

00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,543
Huh?

296
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,179
You just gonna run off
and get yourself killed

297
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,215
without saying a word,
like Tara?

298
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,717
(Will scoffs softly)

299
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,719
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

300
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,787
Yeah, it was.

301
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,888
- Hey, Tim?
- TIM: Yeah.

302

My gear?

303
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,757
WILL:
Katie, what are you doing?

304
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,593
- KATIE: Going with you.
- WILL: No, you're not.

305
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,295
Not asking permission, Will.
You can't go out there alone.

306
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,062
You need a partner
to watch your back.

307
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,631
Right. Nina's going with me.

308
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,566
Oh, I'm definitely going now.

309
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,101
(sighs)
The town needs you up here.

310
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,703
And I need to see
what's down there.

311
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,038
Why? What's the point?

312
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,642
We're rats on a sinking ship,
and we need to find a way off.

313
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,077
No, we don't.
We can survive up here forever.

314
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,546
- Everyone except Hunter.
- (scoffs)

315
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,781
I don't want to live
like this forever, Will.

316
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,483
And we both know
Hunter doesn't, either.

317
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,984
Well, it's not his decision
to make.

318
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,187
Not at eight years old.

319
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,157
We're gonna have to fight them
eventually, Will.

320
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,828
It might as well be today.

321

322
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,136
- (sighs softly)
- (door closes)

323
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,073
We don't need your help.

324
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,775
You don't need anyone's help,
do you, Nina?

325
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,279
You ever seen one
coming for you?

326
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,048
Up close.

327
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,118
Not just a flickering light
in the distance.

328
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,822
The way they tear people apart.

329
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,024
Bullets bounce off them

00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,430
(all breathing heavily)

497
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,566
(screeching fades in distance)

498
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,373
Y'all okay?

499
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,443
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

500
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,046
(Will sighs)

501
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,816
(insects chirping,
animal howling)

502
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,720
(glasses clinking)

503
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,395
18-year-old, single malt.

504
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,075
Those grenades did nothing.

505
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,750
To one more night alive.

506
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:11,990
(exhales)

507
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,530
It is different.

508
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,601
Seeing them up close.
(sniffles)

509
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:27,306
We're not meant to share
the planet with those things.

510
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,611
Maybe the Jesus freaks
were right.

511
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,515
Maybe the Reapers are
judgment for mankind's sins.

512
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,617
For eating God's apple,
then clear-cutting

513
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,752
the Garden of Eden
with the knowledge it gave us.

514
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,921
I don't buy that.

515
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,857
So what do you buy?

516
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,229
KATIE: They're Earth's
new apex predators.

517
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,964
And we're prey.

518
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,972
So how do we
take our place back?

519
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,180
They came out of nowhere,
all at once.

520
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,449
No one's had a chance
to study them.

521
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,850
You study something
long enough,

522
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,285
you can figure out
how to kill it.

523
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,222
If it doesn't kill you first.

524
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,395
A lot more of us are gonna die.

525
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,732
But one day,
we're gonna beat them.

526
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:35,241
Three years, day and night,
researching them.

527
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,743
Something had to stand out.

528
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,513
What they did when they
first came out of the ground.

529
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,082
Which was?

530
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,586
Wipe out 95% of the world's
population in a month.

531
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,589
They didn't stop
to eat or sleep.

532
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,924
They just didn't stop.

533
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,228
I don't follow.

534
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:00,064
Predators kill to eat.

535
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,866
The Reapers kill to kill.

536
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,068
And they only killed us.

537
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,837
It's like it's all they wanted,
was just to get rid of us.

538
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,141
I don't think there's
some master plan, Nina.

539
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,742
Simply what you said.

540
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,711
They're predators
and we're prey.

541
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:16,047
I didn't say that. Katie did.

542
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,884
So what are you saying?

543
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,990
Nothing. It's just a question.

544
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,793

What if Nina's right?

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,436
What if she has found
a way to kill those things?

549
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,103
WILL (voice-over):
I don't believe her.

550
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,406
- Why not?
- She wants it too badly.

551
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,642
- What does that mean?
- You know what I mean.

552
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,644
If anyone could
figure it out, it's her.

553
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,078
She's a physicist.

554
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,647
Yeah, with a Messiah complex.

555
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,649
Baby, that's all physicists.
They make a living

556
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,451
unlocking God's secrets.

557
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:29,254
I get it. You trust her.

558
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,155
But this is a suicide mission.

559
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,923
It's not your job
to save the world.

560
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,394
- What is my job?
- To stay alive.

561
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,196
You would have said something
different when we first met.

562
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,367
That's before you almost died
in childbirth

563
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,871
and we had a one-pound infant
clinging to life in the NICU.

564
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,339
This is for Hunter.

565
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,874
No, it's not.

566
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,643
Not for Nina.

567
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,312
This is about her wanting to be

568
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,846
the first person
to kill a Reaper.

569
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,114
And she'll die to do it.

570
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,783
She's not suicidal, Will.

571
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:02,320
She's after immortality.

572
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,455
Why can't you see that?

573
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,156
She doesn't have a family.

574
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,860
She's never had a family.
She ca--

575
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,569
It's just a matter of time
before he runs out of filters.

576
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,738
That's a year from now,
at least.

577
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,841
And the Reapers will
still be down there.

578
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,744
So what's the difference?

579
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,915
Another year together.

580
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,352
(voice-over):
That's the difference.

581
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,057
(sighs)

582
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,084
NINA: When we come out,
it'll be close to dark.

583
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,854
Can't hit the city at night.

584
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,722
WILL: There's a ranger station
on the other side.

585
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,692
We can stay there
until daybreak.

586
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,394
What's the plan in there?

587
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,928
This is level nine.

588
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,597
The ladder will take us down
to level eight.

589
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,533
We take eight
across the mountain, 2.2 miles.

590
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:26,236
We exit at 8,023 feet,
on the other side,

591
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,073
12 miles west of Boulder.

592
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:32,109
Anything below level eight
is under The Line.

593
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,578
We exit at 8,023 feet?

594
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,846
That's right.

595
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,115
How exact is that?

596
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,386
Very.

597
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,488
How do you know these tunnels
are perfectly straight?

598
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,989
That they don't bow
somewhere in the middle?

599
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,424
That would take us
below The Line.

600
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,259
Or did you not think
about that?

601
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,465
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- Easy.

602
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,602
We're going below The Line,
aren't we?

603
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,208
- Will?
- For how long?

604
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,077
231 yards.

605
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,313
(laughs) What?

606
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,249
Both ends of the tunnel are
above 8,000 feet, so...

607
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,786
So, nothing! These tunnels
are not hermetically sealed.

608
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,287
How do you know
there aren't any fissures

609
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,023
that lead to the lower levels
of the mine?

610
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,091
You should have told us this
before we left the refuge.

611
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,693
It's 231 yards.

612
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,829
And besides,
your tracker will tell us

613
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,330
if one of them is
within a half a mile.

614
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,599
- No, it won't.
- It just did.

615
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,100
Above ground.

616
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,536
It's not gonna work
under a mile of rock.

617
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,171
It's 45 seconds.
Why are you so worried?

618
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,506
They come from
underground, Will.

619
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,542
They're built for it.
We're not.

620
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,343
They can see in the dark.

621
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,546
They detect the smallest amount
of CO2, which we exhale

622
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,347
and will build up
pretty fucking fast

623
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,583
inside a fucking mine.

624
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,252

It's welded shut?

00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,995
What now?

647
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,201
Climb down to level seven.

648
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,969
That's below The Line, Will.

649
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,339
- Yeah.
- For how long?

650
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,042
About a thousand yards.

651
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,277
A thousand yards?

652
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,179
That's ten football fields.

653
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,881
I mean,
how-how steep are these cliffs

654
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,116
that we're trying to avoid?

655
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:34,018
They're impassable.

656
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:36,486
So either we climb down
or we go back.

it hits them,

844

But there's nothing
you could have done.

992
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,053
I could have held him
in my arms one last time.

993
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,667
I'm sure you've had
the same thought about Tara.

994
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,140
I never should have
encouraged her to come with me.

995
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,709
I was overconfident.

996
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,778
I thought I'd figured out a way
to hold them off,

997
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,780
and I was wrong.

998
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,448
If it's any consolation,
I hate myself more

999
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:22,085
than you could possibly
hate me.

1000
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:28,157
I only blame you because it's
easier than blaming myself.

1001
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:32,528
I knew she was going to go,

1002

even after I tried to stop her.

1003
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,200
And I let it happen.

1004
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:39,635
You can't blame yourself.

1005
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:41,671
Neither of us can.

1006
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,908

1007
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:53,417

- I'm gonna stay.

There are other things
I can try.

Look, I'm not leaving you here.
We're in this together.

And you got me here.
