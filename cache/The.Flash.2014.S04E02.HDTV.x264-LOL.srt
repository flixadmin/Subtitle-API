1
00:00:01,575 --> 00:00:03,241
Previously, on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:05,715
- It's a samurai.
- Bring me the Flash.

3
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:07,885
Or else, your city falls.

4
00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:09,521
Barry's still stuck in the Speed Force?

5
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,555
I'm gonna get him out.
But I need your help.

6
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:16,027
Barry? It's me, Iris.

7
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,263
Please come back to me.

8
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:21,584
Barry, Iris is in trouble.

9
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,402
Flash is back!

10
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:27,338
Flash... welcome home.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,607
The Flash is back in Central City.

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:30,823
You came back to me.

13
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:33,193
I'm never going anywhere ever again.

14
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,316
Not only is this the most modern,

15
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:41,752
lavish penthouse on
the market, it also has

16
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,600
one of the best views
in all of Central City.

17
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:45,336
Join me on the balcony.
See for yourself.

18
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,391
I couldn't care less about the view.

19
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,727
Ah, is it your most expensive listing?

20
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,395
Yes, but the price is negotiable.

21
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:52,363
I'll take it.

22
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,998
Yes.

23
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:57,401
Just, uh, let me lock up
and I'll ride down with you.

24
00:00:57,403 --> 00:01:00,404
Sorry, not sure which button does what.

25
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:02,339
Shmuck.

26
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:14,819
Damn it.

27
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,155
Dana? Yeah, listen.

28
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,324
I think I'm in some
busted elevator or some...

29
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,862
I don't know... whoa!

30
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,533
No!

31
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,999
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

32
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:55,619
What? Whoa.

33
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,484
No! Huh?

34
00:02:58,487 --> 00:02:59,919
- Barry.
- Hey.

35
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,593
- Hi, you're up early.
- Yeah.

36
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:03,976
Doing what, exactly?

37
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,197
Uh, I'm just catching
up on all the TV I missed

38
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,698
while I was stuck in the Speed Force.

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,059
When you've been gone six months,

40
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:10,634
the world is a minefield of spoilers.

41
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:11,731
But Cisco hooked me up

42
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,481
with the 1,000-times sped up version

43
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,708
of my favorite shows.

44
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,773
Aw, Jon Snow died. Oh, he's alive!

45
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:17,919
Huh.

46
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,710
And here I was thinking
you'd need a jump start

47
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:21,036
- for your loopy brain.
- Nope.

48
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,812
Brain good. All of me is good.

49
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,748
Mmm.

50
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,550
Joe needs me. Crime scene.

51
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,752
Oh, that's okay. I should
probably get started

52
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,554
on our neglected wedding plans.

53
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:31,833
It's gonna take me forever

54
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,324
to get through this binder, so...

55
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:34,692
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.

56
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:35,859
I'm done with it.

57
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,605
- You're done?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:40,409
I locked in a caterer, I got
you your favorite flowers,

59
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,465
I put a deposit on a
venue with an amazing view,

60
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:44,743
I got that seven tier
raspberry chocolate cake.

61
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:47,004
Well, I guess you've
got everything covered.

62
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,908
So, my lovely fiancée
can remain stress-free.

63
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,276
Save me a bear claw?

64
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:53,777
Ooh, no promises, speedster.

65
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:55,346
You whoosh, you lose.

66
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:02,052
What do we got, Joe?

67
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:03,787
Not much to go off.

68
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:06,690
The only witness was an
elderly resident, and...

69
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:09,927
- she's still pretty rattled.
- Hey.

70
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:11,428
- Mr. Allen.
- Hi.

71
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,883
Six months and five minutes late.

72
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,532
Sorry, Captain Singh.

73
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,002
Thank you again for granting
me that extended sabbatical.

74
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,637
But I'm back, I'm ready to work,

75
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,477
and what can I say...
It's a beautiful day.

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,440
Sorry. What are we dealing with?

77
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,109
Well, I hope you had a light breakfast.

78
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,577
No, I had a good spread actually.

79
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,679
Pancakes, sausage, fruity cereal...

80
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:33,017
Whoa.

81
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:36,720
He's... everywhere.

82
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,122
As far as we can tell,

83
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,457
it dropped him a hundred stories.

84
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,992
Were you able to ID the vic?

85
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:43,527
Yeah. Kurt Weaver.

86
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,329
Worth billions. Capital B.

87
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:47,097
What do you think, Mr. Allen?

88
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,633
You see the impacts on the ceiling?

89
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:52,636
And the repeated lateral
stress fissures on the frame?

90
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:54,838
This guy didn't just drop. He was...

91
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,341
shaken to death.

92
00:04:57,343 --> 00:04:59,076
Excuse me. Coming through.

93
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:01,412
CCPD Tech Consultant. That's right.

94
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:03,380
Look at the badge. That
means it's official.

95
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:05,516
He's aware that badge is plastic, right?

96
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:08,185
Fellas, so sorry I'm late.

97
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,220
The curls were not
cooperating this morning.

98
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:13,357
Oh, good Lord. Why
would you show me that?

99
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,659
We think this is because of
some weird technical glitch,

100
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:17,594
and you're our weird tech expert.

101
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:20,564
This completely ruins Sriracha for me.

102
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,903
Yoink.

103
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,771
That shouldn't be there.

104
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,006
What is it?

105
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:32,710
It's encrypted code.

106
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:35,401
This wasn't a glitch. This was a hacker.

107
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,124
The Cortex's quantum algorithm

108
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:48,692
should decrypt this code in no time.

109
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:51,395
That should help us ID our new hacker.

110
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,563
But while we wait,

111
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:54,664
I got a little welcome
back gift for you.

112
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,767
Come, come. Walk with ya boy.

113
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:59,269
Gather round, class.

114
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,001
Ka-blam!

115
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,142
I mean, that was cool...
Reveal and everything,

116
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:06,227
but I've seen that suit.

117
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,412
- I've actually already worn it.
- Yeah.

118
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:09,880
We all know you gave Barry's suit

119
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,949
a nice little fancy makeover.

120
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:14,485
Yeah, but you don't
know what you don't know.

121
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,149
And underneath all thisthed beautiful,

122
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:18,589
I've built in self-repairing armor,

123
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,558
nano-liquid circuitry,
full-spectrum scanning,

124
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,860
and a whole bunch of other big words.

125
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,094
Chief among them....

126
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,067
Your very own custom-made HUD.

127
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,203
This thing is loaded with maps,
schematics, delivery menus.

128
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,705
You know that Thai
place you like so much?

129
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:36,106
Yeah, love the Pad See Ew.

130
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,708
You know how we Pad See do.

131
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,370
Dude, this is awesome.
What else does it do?

132
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:41,839
Well, lucky for you,

133
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:44,214
I even wrote you an instruction manual.

134
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:45,516
Yay.

135
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:48,285
Come on. We're not cavemen.

136
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:49,920
Really good work.

137
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:51,655
I know!

138
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:52,923
I'll look at this later.

139
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,852
Um, I gotta get back to CCPD.

140
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:57,221
And you can blame this on Cisco,

141
00:06:57,224 --> 00:06:58,662
but I'm thinking Thai tonight?

142
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:00,931
Ooh... honestly, babe,
I'll probably be too tired

143
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,933
to eat out after our evening
training session, so...

144
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:05,636
I cancelled that. Yeah,
don't worry about that.

145
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:06,978
You cancelled it?

146
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,070
Yeah, I mean, I don't
think we need it, right?

147
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,240
Besides, I'm back. I'll
make a reservation, okay?

148
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:12,409
Muah.

149
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:17,147
Must be so nice having Barry back.

150
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,783
Yeah. Yes, it is.

151
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,485
But...

152
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:23,620
Well, I mean, it's just
gonna take some time for him

153
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,941
to get used to the new dynamics
around here, that's all.

154
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,925
Yeah.

155
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:30,828
You know, when Ronnie and I
went from just working together

156
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,796
to working together and dating,

157
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:34,965
we had some trouble communicating.

158
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:37,468
Oh, I mean, Barry and
I communicate just fine.

159
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,070
Yeah, I'm just saying, we actually went

160
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:43,040
to couples therapy and
it really helped a lot.

161
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,909
I appreciate the advice,
Caitlin... really, I do.

162
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,444
But, you know, Barry and I

163
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:49,847
have known each other since childhood.

164
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,182
You know? We don't need therapy.

165
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:53,650
I mean...

166
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:55,285
we're Barry and Iris, right?

167
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:56,462
Right.

168
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,188
Thanks, though, I mean,
you know, I don't have

169
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,556
anything against it, it's just...

170
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:00,924
You're Barry and Iris. Gotcha.

171
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:09,600
Unauthorized breach
incoming. We gotta move.

172
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:13,704
Don't change, don't change,
don't change, don't change...

173
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,639
Caitlin, let's go.

174
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:24,848
You ready?

175
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,626
For anything.

176
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,387
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

177
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:31,488
Hold your fire!

178
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,895
Hey.

179
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,308
Hey, you wanna give me a
little more notice next time?

180
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,808
You know, people who wanna kill
us come through here, right?

181
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:44,568
Oh. My bad, guys.

182
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,171
Cisco, that was very heroic
of you to just jump in

183
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,207
and protecting Gypsy like
that. It's pretty impressive.

184
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,942
Dude, I'm protecting you from her.

185
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:53,407
She would've vaporized you guys.

186
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,012
He's not lying.

187
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,113
As you were.

188
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:02,252
Okay.

189
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,388
So, you almost ready for our date?

190
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,790
Uh, yeah, almost. Um...

191
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,526
I hit a snag in trying to
decrypt this hacker code

192
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,262
for the CCPD... I mean, you
know how we do, and just,

193
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:14,932
kind of, like, the matrix...
You care about none of this.

194
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,134
Just give me, like, one hour. Two tops.

195
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,569
And then...

196
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,737
It's you and me. Promise.

197
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:23,607
You're lucky you are so cute.

198
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,342
And you are amazing.

199
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:26,405
Yeah.

200
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,979
And you're so right
about that cute thing too.

201
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,013
Huh.

202
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,815
B-R-B.

203
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,650
Okay.

204
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,866
Guys? There's a car going
120 swerving between lanes.

205
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,267
Somebody's gonna get killed.

206
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:25,469
You both need to get out there.

207
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,837
That's one car. I got it.

208
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,873
Yeah, but I...

209
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,616
Help! Help!

210
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,690
Okay, guys, it's a runaway.
Driver's trapped inside.

211
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:48,091
I'm gonna change his trajectory.

212
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:49,396
Okay, then turn him left.

213
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,628
There's a turn-off for
runaway trucks coming up.

214
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,164
Just clear a path and the car
will come to a safe stop there.

215
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,966
No, no, no. I'm gonna push him right.

216
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:57,734
That street's empty.
I can help him there.

217
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:03,340
Barry, you can't go down that road.

218
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:05,469
- What? Why?
- Because they started construction

219
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:07,610
on that street three months ago.

220
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,649
No, no, no, no, no, no.

221
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:50,190
I know a guy almost died,

222
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,609
but what happened to
this sexy beast here today

223
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,944
- is the real tragedy.
- Mmhmm.

224
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,687
That could've been a lot worse.

225
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,922
I'm sorry, guys. This one is all on me.

226
00:11:57,924 --> 00:11:59,858
Okay, so my dad talked
to the driver, Tim Kwon.

227
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,526
He's fine. He's gonna question him

228
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:03,298
and see if they can
figure out who did this.

229
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:04,896
Cisco? What do we got?

230
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:07,356
Beginning auto-topsy. Now.

231
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,848
That is the same weird code
from the elevator murder scene.

232
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,034
- Wait, doesn't that mean...
- Our hacker's got a hit list.

233
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,169
Wa... can you crack it?

234
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,678
Man, I've been trying to
crack this code all day.

235
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,814
It looks like a virus.

236
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:25,364
Well, yeah, because
it's a computer virus.

237
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,018
No, no, no. Scooch.

238
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,287
Oh. I feel violated.

239
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:33,244
It looks like an organic virus.

240
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,950
But with a digital sub-base.

241
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:36,761
Our killer isn't just hacking machines.

242
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:37,668
He's controlling them.

243
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,904
Our hacker's not a hacker.

244
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:40,465
He's a meta.

245
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,633
Is there any connection
between the two victims?

246
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,082
There's nothing online.

247
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:48,192
But their names... Weaver, Kwon...
They sound very familiar to me.

248
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:50,762
I started collecting these
tech magazines in high school.

249
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,399
- They were like...
- Those are the magazines

250
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:54,145
you collected in high school?

251
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:56,214
Okay. That's... that's hurtful.

252
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:58,249
That's really hurtful. Anyway.

253
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:00,919
I'm 90% sure that's
where I read those names.

254
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:02,787
Okay, great. Start digging.

255
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,650
Barry, can I talk to you for a second?

256
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,020
Mm-hmm.

257
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:15,367
Hey, about what happened... I am sorry.

258
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,015
I should've listened to you, it's just,

259
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:18,937
sometimes when I'm out
there, things move so fast

260
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,723
and I'm really excited
to be the Flash again.

261
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,774
Anyway, I hope you're not mad.

262
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,637
And you are. You're mad, aren't you?

263
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,140
No, no. I'm not mad.

264
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,512
I just think with...
With us being engaged

265
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:29,916
and now we're working together,

266
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,103
that it's more important
than ever that we communicate.

267
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:34,733
I completely agree.

268
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:36,635
Good, because Caitlin
mentioned something earlier

269
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:38,137
and I sort of dismissed
it, but now I'm...

270
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:39,838
I'm really thinking
that it could help us.

271
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,607
What is it?

272
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:43,308
Couples therapy.

273
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,476
Couples therapy?

274
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:45,911
- Mm-hmm.
- You...

275
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:47,513
We're not, like, in trouble, are we?

276
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,414
No, no. No, of course not.

277
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,251
I just think that any couple

278
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:55,787
that's doing everything
we're doing could

279
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:57,187
use some advice.

280
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,790
Mm-hmm.

281
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,326
We're just talking about a
tune up, I mean, there's...

282
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,495
There's nothing wrong with that, right?

283
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:05,430
A tune up? Right, yeah, no, I mean,

284
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:07,032
if it's... sure, if
it's what you wanna do,

285
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:08,634
- then sure, yeah, let's try it.
- Great.

286
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,298
'Cause we've got an
appointment in 30 minutes.

287
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,471
I'll get my purse.

288
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:13,910
What?

289
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:26,318
Later.

290
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,023
- Hi. Iris?
- Hi.

291
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:32,391
- Barry?
- Hello.

292
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,767
Hi, I'm Doctor Sharon Finkel.

293
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,229
I am so sorry I kept you waiting.

294
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:38,497
Oh, no, no. It's fine.

295
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,074
Thank you for squeezing us in.

296
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,868
Oh, well, you made it sound
so urgent on the phone.

297
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,070
No.

298
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,505
No, not urgent.

299
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:49,408
I'm excited to dive in.

300
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,809
Right?

301
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:52,744
Oh, absolutely. I love therapy.

302
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:54,413
Oh. Have you been before?

303
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,248
Just once, when I was a kid,

304
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,068
after my mom died.

305
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,185
Oh, your mom. Oh.

306
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,921
But I'm okay with that.

307
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:05,757
I mean, I'm not okay with it, obviously.

308
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,440
I mean, I'd prefer that she was alive.

309
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:09,127
I just meant that I've
already dealt with it is...

310
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,697
I don't think it's worth writing down.

311
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,632
These notes are just for me.

312
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:16,167
No one is judging you guys.

313
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,803
Yes, we know.

314
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,771
Oh, my dad died too.

315
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,840
Just for your notes.

316
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:24,899
So, Barry, Iris filled
me in a little bit

317
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:27,303
about the two of you
on the phone before.

318
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,072
- Getting married?
- Yeah.

319
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:31,450
Yeah, it's been a
long road getting here.

320
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,685
- Mm-hmm.
- First, um...

321
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:37,322
us growing up together, and then, um,

322
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:38,957
I was engaged to someone else.

323
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,192
Oh, okay.

324
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:42,361
That's worth a write-down?

325
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:44,196
He's actually dead too.

326
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:46,732
Oh, you two have had to
deal with a lot of trauma.

327
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,367
- Well...
- No, not a...

328
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:50,961
- Eddie... and Ronnie.
- I mean, a little.

329
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:53,071
- My mom. H.R.
- Not too much.

330
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:54,573
- Laurel.
- Some.

331
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:55,941
- Snart.
- We've been

332
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,909
- to a few funerals.
- Yeah.

333
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:59,461
So, Barry,

334
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:02,281
why do you think Iris wanted
you two to see me tmeay?

335
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:03,782
Well, Iris and I...

336
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,638
We recently started working together.

337
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:09,488
You see, I went away
for a while on a, uh...

338
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,156
- A business trip.
- Business trip.

339
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:14,187
For six months and y...
Um, I guess now... yeah.

340
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,130
We're just learning to get back in sync,

341
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:19,931
to sync up again.

342
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,633
- Is that right?
- Mmhmm.

343
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:23,669
Well, there's no right or wrong, Barry.

344
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,404
Right.

345
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,500
I think we could work on
listening a little bit more.

346
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:29,667
- Right?
- Uhhuh, yeah.

347
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,370
Um, or else, someone
could get really hurt.

348
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:34,279
You know, like, if
they crashed their car

349
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,615
into a brick wall going
100 miles per hour.

350
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:39,618
She means that emotionally.

351
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,253
Do I?

352
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:43,288
Hello, mamacita.

353
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,990
They don't make them like you anymore.

354
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:46,725
What the hell?

355
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,294
Easy, it's just the
Motherboard of the Month,

356
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:51,930
July of '07, okay? Look at her.

357
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:53,231
Kinda wish it was a girl.

358
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,733
Baby, it's been hours.

359
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,301
You guys haven't made any progress yet?

360
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,136
No mention of Kurt Weaver or Tim Kwon

361
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,829
or any connection
between the two of them.

362
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,773
Until now. Got him.

363
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:04,943
Take note, people, it's only
hoarding if it doesn't pay off.

364
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:06,511
Okay, so that's Tim Kwon.

365
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:10,816
That's Kurt Weaver.
That's Sheila Agnani.

366
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:12,386
Who's that guy?

367
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:15,673
Ooh, sorry about that.

368
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:18,590
No, it's definitely my fault.

369
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,745
You don't have any idea
who would wanna do you harm?

370
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:41,780
Not even a gut feeling?

371
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:45,384
No, I mean, everyone
loves a billionaire, right?

372
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:46,585
No, I have no idea.

373
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:50,455
Grenade! Everybody move!

374
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:10,742
So, what would you say your
goals are for this session?

375
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:16,359
Uh, well, I just want to know
that Barry hears my concerns

376
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,116
about our issues with miscommunication.

377
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,552
Uh, I gotta go.

378
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,053
You gotta go?

379
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:23,321
He's gotta go.

380
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:25,090
- Yeah... sorry, um...
- Mm.

381
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:28,393
This was... sorry.

382
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,996
You're gonna write down that
he ran out of here, aren't you?

383
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:32,364
Yes.

384
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,539
Get down!

385
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:19,344
Everybody okay?

386
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:21,492
I don't know. Must've been a dud.

387
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,907
Same corrupted code. Same guy.

388
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,442
Someone very creatively

389
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:35,244
tried to kill Tim Kwon and Kurt Weaver.

390
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:36,846
Where's Kwon now?

391
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:38,547
He ran out of here
scared out of his mind.

392
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,556
He wouldn't even wait
for a protected escort.

393
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,684
But the good news is,

394
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:43,712
I found a connection
between our victims.

395
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,856
Four years ago, Kurt Weaver
and Tim Kwon created an app

396
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:48,858
in their garage with
two other programmers.

397
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,493
Some kind of malware called Kilgore.

398
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:52,428
And then they sold it
off to a big tech company.

399
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,063
So that's how they made their money.

400
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:55,765
I saw this guy. He was here.

401
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,203
Ramsey Deacon. Looks
like we found our meta.

402
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:00,307
And for some reason he's
going after his old partners.

403
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,304
It's like "Silicon
Valley" if Richard went nuts

404
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:04,240
and started killing
everyone at Pied Piper.

405
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:07,946
I feel like he's got more
of a anarchist Gilfoyle vibe.

406
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:08,885
Erlich, maybe.

407
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:10,614
Look, guys, I love
that we are so confident

408
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,217
in our ability to apprehend villains

409
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,149
that we can have this debate, but, hi.

410
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:15,985
- What about her?
- That's Sheila Agnani.

411
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:17,553
She's, like, a big deal tech guru now.

412
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:19,006
She could be next on Deacon's list.

413
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,382
We'll definitely have to protect her.

414
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,191
Yeah, well, my dad and
Wally can do that, right?

415
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:23,559
- I'm on it.
- Great.

416
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:24,994
I'll keep working on the code.

417
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:27,763
- Sure.
- Sorry about therapy.

418
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,298
Oh, it's okay. I told Dr. Finkel

419
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,933
that you had a work emergency.

420
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:32,292
True. Kind of.

421
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:35,026
Yeah, and she had a
cancellation this afternoon,

422
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,695
so we should get over there.

423
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,800
- Don't wanna be late.
- No... yeah.

424
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:41,365
Let's get back in there...

425
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:45,706
This guy is a living computer virus.

426
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,683
- That's a new one.
- Look at this code.

427
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:49,018
From the elevator, to the car,

428
00:20:49,021 --> 00:20:51,687
to the bomb robot, this
code keeps changing...

429
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,622
But I can't figure out why.

430
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:55,491
Okay, we have to remember
that it's not just digital.

431
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:56,776
It's bio-digital.

432
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,162
Most organic viruses mutate
to avoid being killed.

433
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:02,932
So, if we managed to
create digital antibodies,

434
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,367
then we can shut this guy down.

435
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,435
- Oh, nice one!
- Mmm.

436
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,537
- Hi.
- Hi.

437
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,614
I'm so glad you're here,

438
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:14,934
'cause I truly, deeply, from
the bottom of my heart...

439
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:20,349
I am sorry, but I'm gonna
have to cancel our date.

440
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:23,986
If you're gonna vibe blast me,
can I at least pick the spot?

441
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:26,088
It's fine, Cisco.

442
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,923
- I get it.
- You get it?

443
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:30,659
Yeah, what's not to get?
You have to work, so...

444
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,428
we will cancel our date.

445
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,898
Well, good luck, you
guys. I hope it works out.

446
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:42,071
What a cool chick.

447
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:44,000
She took that so well.

448
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,183
No. No, she didn't.

449
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:47,985
When a girl says she gets it,

450
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:50,980
what she really means is
she doesn't get it at all.

451
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:52,481
I'm confused.

452
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:55,050
Don't be. Very simple.

453
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:58,484
You, my friend, are in so much trouble.

454
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:02,825
You just had to fall for the girl

455
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:04,827
in head-to-toe black
leather, didn't you?

456
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,328
We're back.

457
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,216
That was quick, even for me.

458
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:12,735
Inside joke... so, yes.

459
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:14,703
Work emergency aside,

460
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:17,006
I have a sneaking suspicion

461
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:18,974
that you'd rather be
somewhere else, Barry.

462
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,709
No, no. I... um...

463
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,678
I mean, we do have a...

464
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,286
big work thing that we're dealing with.

465
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:26,549
It's important.

466
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:28,651
Yeah, but so is this.

467
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:30,719
You know, if we're not
on the same page, Barry,

468
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:32,258
people could die.

469
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,914
- Uh...
- Metaphorically.

470
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:39,295
No. No, no.

471
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:40,996
Don't hold back.

472
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:42,998
Turn to Iris, look her in the eyes,

473
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,767
and tell her what you wanted to say.

474
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,135
I don't know... Uh, well...

475
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:47,266
I...

476
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:50,272
I said I was sorry about this morning.

477
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,276
Iris.

478
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:56,312
Turn to Barry. Talk to him.

479
00:22:58,015 --> 00:23:00,916
It's not just this morning, Barry.

480
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,151
You cancelled training

481
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:03,719
the other day without asking me.

482
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:05,020
Training?

483
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:06,388
- Swimming.
- For a marathon.

484
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,557
- It's a... triathlon.
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,693
Anyway, I didn't think
cancelling training

486
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:11,987
was that big of a deal.

487
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,929
Yeah, but you made all
those wedding plans too

488
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:15,364
and you didn't consult me.

489
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,033
I was trying to be a good fiancé.

490
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:20,302
Yeah, but I'd think most
brides would be happy

491
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:22,538
that their future spouse cared
about helping with the wedding.

492
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,041
That is a good thing, right?

493
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:27,078
Look, I don't know. I mean, I guess

494
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:30,446
our wires have gotten crossed
a few times the last few days,

495
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:34,116
but I think that hardly rises
to the level of a crisis.

496
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:36,423
After everything we've
been through together,

497
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,120
you and me, we're Barry and Iris.

498
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:39,755
We're the gold standard.

499
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:42,591
- I am so in love...
- Then how could you leave me?

500
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:48,163
You left me, Barry. You just left me.

501
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:49,861
Standing there, alone.

502
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,366
How could you do that?

503
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:26,802
All the listening devices are in place.

504
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:28,304
Keep your ears open.

505
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:30,290
Gotta make sure she's safe.

506
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:33,909
Yeah.

507
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:35,540
What? I like punk music.

508
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:42,117
Tim? What the hell, man?

509
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,585
You can't just come into my house.

510
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:45,355
'Cause you wouldn't return
my calls. I really need...

511
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:47,455
Is this about your weird
crush? Let it go, Tim.

512
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,191
- We are not happening.
- Sheila, listen.

513
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:50,592
Deacon's coming for us.

514
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:52,050
He wants payback for what we did to him.

515
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:53,497
What did we do to him?

516
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,497
Kurt scrubbed any connection
between us from the net,

517
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,967
so as far as the world's
concerned, we're innocent.

518
00:24:57,969 --> 00:24:59,268
But we're not.

519
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,669
I should've never let you talk me

520
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:01,814
into going along with this.

521
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:03,238
And now Kurt's dead.

522
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,373
Deacon killed him.

523
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,507
He did not.

524
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:09,812
Oh, yes. He did.

525
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:20,222
Oh, this is a nice house.

526
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:22,691
How much do you pay for it? 10 mil?

527
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,971
Let's talk about this.
We can make it right.

528
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:27,296
Shut up, Tim.

529
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:29,698
You could've had all this too.

530
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,166
This is could've been yours.

531
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:33,649
Kilgore was my idea.

532
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:35,766
And you three stole it away from me.

533
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,293
Somebody had to.

534
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:39,640
Otherwise, it would've just
been a halfway clever idea

535
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:41,176
that died in someone's garage.

536
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:42,082
Sheila.

537
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,579
No, I'm not going to apologize

538
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,913
because after four years,

539
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:47,082
you finally found some balls.

540
00:25:47,084 --> 00:25:48,201
I found something else.

541
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:50,019
Something I never had with my family,

542
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:52,654
or at MIT, or with any of you.

543
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:54,656
Really? And what was that?

544
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:55,991
Power.

545
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,630
Oh, you're not still diabetic, are you?

546
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:08,190
Those new computer-controlled
insulin pumps

547
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,487
are a real life saver.

548
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,125
Way too much insulin...
Well, that can be lethal.

549
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:18,565
How should we kill you?

550
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,127
He put her in insulin shock.

551
00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:37,099
Glucose.

552
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:45,240
Deacon took him.

553
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:46,728
He took Tim.

554
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:58,656
No sign of Deacon or Kwon
on facial recognition,

555
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,157
traffic cameras... nothing.

556
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,126
We don't even know
if Kwon's still alive.

557
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:03,772
We gotta move fast.

558
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:07,965
Where were you two?

559
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,034
- Dry cleaners.
- Wedding... cleaners.

560
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:12,136
Dry cleaners.

561
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:13,514
Um, Cisco?

562
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:16,842
Uh, where are you with
those bio-digital antibodies?

563
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,177
I'm nowhere.

564
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,537
Actually, no... You know what?

565
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,578
I am somewhere. I'm in the doghouse.

566
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:24,282
Apparently the
pan-dimensional doghouse.

567
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:25,359
I don't know if this doghouse

568
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:27,011
has a door or window, but if it did,

569
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:28,230
I'd be jumping out of it!

570
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,033
It's okay. I'll go talk to him.

571
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:42,089
Has everybody lost their minds?

572
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,271
She must think I'm blowing her off.

573
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:47,159
But I'm just trying to do my job.

574
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:50,019
I guess the word "reschedule"
doesn't exist on Earth 19.

575
00:27:50,023 --> 00:27:52,309
Okay, I'm gonna go out on
a limb here and guess that

576
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:54,707
the reason you can't focus
on the science is because

577
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,884
you're so worried about
what's going on with Gypsy.

578
00:27:57,887 --> 00:27:59,817
I'm sorry, I didn't
hear anything you said.

579
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:01,819
But I-I think I figured it out.

580
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:04,789
I think I can't focus on anything

581
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,490
'cause of this whole Gypsy situation.

582
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:09,026
I'm... I think I'm just
gonna have to talk to her.

583
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:10,406
What a great idea.

584
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,534
Hey.

585
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:17,768
What's up, Cisco?

586
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,070
You're mad at me.

587
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,605
I said it was fine.

588
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:21,599
No, no, no.

589
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:25,042
Rule number one, when a girl
says it's fine, it's not fine.

590
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:26,644
Amen!

591
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:30,816
I'm gonna go.

592
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:35,453
Rule number two, you
don't blow off a date

593
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:37,421
with your favorite person.

594
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:41,993
The day got away from me. Let
me make it up to you, okay?

595
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:43,427
Date night tomorrow?

596
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,030
No, Cisco. It... it had to be today.

597
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:47,050
Why today?

598
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,566
Because today is One-One-One Day.

599
00:28:48,568 --> 00:28:49,667
One-what-what-what?

600
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:50,701
It's One-One-One Day.

601
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:51,737
What is that?

602
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,139
One-One-One Day on my Earth is...

603
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,109
is the day that you
celebrate with the one...

604
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,077
with the one you love, all right?

605
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,362
It's when one soul,
plus one soul, equals...

606
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:04,798
one soul.

607
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,651
That is... so sappy.

608
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,185
Yes, it is sappy.

609
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:09,720
And it is stupid and schmoopy.

610
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:11,956
But there is something about you that...

611
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,526
It makes me wanna do
stupid, schmoopy things.

612
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:18,462
And I hate the word "schmoop"
and people who use it.

613
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,132
Well, that is the
sweetest and angriest thing

614
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,433
you've ever said to me.

615
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:23,691
Why didn't you just tell me that?

616
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:26,370
Because I was embarrassed, Cisco.

617
00:29:26,372 --> 00:29:28,906
So, you know what? Let's
just forget about it.

618
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:31,275
Because the day is already
over and I would really like

619
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:32,376
to forget that I ever brought this up...

620
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,511
No, no, no.

621
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:34,845
I will not forget it, okay?

622
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:36,447
You are important to me.

623
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:39,596
And if One-One-One Day
is important to you...

624
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,820
One-One-One.

625
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,390
That's it.

626
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:47,806
I gotta go.

627
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:50,895
It's like he doesn't know

628
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:52,396
that he's a dead man.

629
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:54,632
Hey.

630
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:58,502
I don't know why I
thought that we didn't have

631
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:00,337
to talk about what happened.

632
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,573
You were so happy I was back.

633
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:04,603
I am happy.

634
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:06,564
You're everything to me.

635
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:10,815
Look...

636
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:13,584
I had to explain to
our friends and family

637
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,453
why they had a
save-the-date for our wedding

638
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:17,321
but no invitation.

639
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:20,991
I had to constantly lie
about why you were gone.

640
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:25,262
You don't know the looks people gave me

641
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,998
because they knew that wasn't the truth.

642
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,867
You know, what they
must've thought about us.

643
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,629
What it made me think about us.

644
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:33,104
Iris...

645
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:40,377
It's not like I wanted to leave you.

646
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,947
I had to put on a
brave face for everyone,

647
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:44,554
but it was killing me inside.

648
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:46,917
And I think part of why
I didn't talk it through

649
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,854
with you is... I was afraid.

650
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,724
I was afraid that you
would tell me to stay.

651
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,893
And I wouldn't have been
strong enough not to.

652
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,129
Barry, how do you
know what I'm gonna say

653
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:59,130
if you don't ask me?

654
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,132
I am here to help you.

655
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:03,000
Especially when everything seems lost.

656
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:04,702
But you have to let me.

657
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:08,105
But sometimes it's not
about us, or the team.

658
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:09,940
Sometimes the weight of the whole city

659
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,643
falls on my shoulders, and
it's up to me to carry it.

660
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:14,879
I'm the Flash.

661
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:16,213
See, that's what you don't get.

662
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:17,915
When I put this ring on my finger,

663
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,184
it wasn't just about you or me anymore.

664
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:22,019
It was about us.

665
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,155
You are not the Flash, Barry.

666
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:26,123
We are.

667
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,658
Guys.

668
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,161
We need you. It's about Deacon.

669
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:33,964
I have something to confess.

670
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:36,634
Kurt Weaver, Sheila Agnani, and I...

671
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:39,937
We stole the Kilgore malware
program from Ramsey Deacon.

672
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,305
We sold it for billions.

673
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:42,807
But it was all his idea.

674
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,176
We got rich. And he got nothing.

675
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,745
I guess that explains why
Deacon's got such a vendetta.

676
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:50,181
Cisco, if he's livestreaming,
can you track the signal?

677
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:51,442
In, like, two seconds.

678
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,640
Papa loves having his own satellite.

679
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:55,386
What are you gonna do when you find him?

680
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:56,854
- Hit him with this.
- What is that?

681
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,348
Deacon's powers are derived

682
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,191
from the binary code in his DNA.

683
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:02,193
So, we created a compound encoded

684
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:04,461
with a numerical string
pattern of ones and zeros

685
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:06,473
to invert the order of the code.

686
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:08,566
Ones become zeros, and vice versa.

687
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,000
One plus one plus one.

688
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:11,109
All right, we're on it.

689
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,669
Send us the location once you have it.

690
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:14,705
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

691
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,541
And now you know the truth.

692
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:21,178
We stole Kilgore from Ramsey Deacon.

693
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,114
He is the real victim.

694
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,050
Good.

695
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:27,616
You forgot one thing.

696
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,119
What?

697
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:32,556
You didn't say good-bye to
anyone who's gonna miss you.

698
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,735
You ever play wishbone, Tim?

699
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,177
He and the others destroyed my life!

700
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,079
Listen, I know you feel wronged, Deacon,

701
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:57,748
but that doesn't give you
a right to take his life.

702
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:01,887
I smell technology in your suit.

703
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:05,189
What have you got in there?

704
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,191
Oh, crap.

705
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,865
I can't move.

706
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,734
Weapon system online.

707
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:20,337
Targeting.

708
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:22,606
Run.

709
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:31,216
Call me Kilgore.

710
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:39,953
Barry? What's happening?

711
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,789
It's Deacon, he's done
something with my suit.

712
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,472
Remote access complete.

713
00:33:43,475 --> 00:33:45,045
You put your voice in Barry's suit?

714
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:46,281
Well, it had to be somebody

715
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:47,883
and my voice is soothing.

716
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:49,918
How much tech did you put in this suit?

717
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,553
So much.

718
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:54,589
I've actually always
been a huge Flash fan

719
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,124
these past couple of years.

720
00:33:56,126 --> 00:34:00,295
But this is like having
a giant action figure.

721
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:05,599
Frack me, he's locked me
out of my own programming.

722
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:06,735
Do something.

723
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:08,904
Uh... Barry, get away from him.

724
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:12,007
It might lessen his
technopathic hold over you.

725
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,241
I can't!

726
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:14,844
Who are you talking to?

727
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:16,578
Someone listening in?

728
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,896
Can't have that.

729
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:20,582
Barry? Barry.

730
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,417
His comms are offline.

731
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:24,453
You have a defibrillator.

732
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:26,661
How about I stop your heart?

733
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,049
Hello?

734
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:50,765
You have a collect call from...

735
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,147
Guys, help me!

736
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:53,548
We accept the charges.

737
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,499
The suit's still freaking out.

738
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,052
Well, get it off!

739
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:00,856
Nope... Yeah, I can't get it off.

740
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:03,079
That would be the deadlock function.

741
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:04,815
I built it in case he
ever got knocked out

742
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:06,419
so a bad guy wouldn't
reveal his identity.

743
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:08,016
It seemed like a smart idea at the time.

744
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,007
Flotation mode activated.

745
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,212
What?

746
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,181
What the hell does he
need a raft for, Cisco?

747
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:17,372
He runs on water.

748
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:18,940
He might lose his speed out there.

749
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,404
What's he gonna do then? He might drown.

750
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:22,478
You couldn't just put an
oxygen tank in the suit?

751
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:24,579
That's a good idea.

752
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:28,617
How is this thing still intact?

753
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:29,851
Cisco!

754
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:31,630
Babel Protocol activated.

755
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:32,617
What?

756
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,923
What's Babel Protocol?

757
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,525
Why am I ticking?

758
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:38,593
It's the self-destruct sequence.

759
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,028
- What?
- Self-destruct?

760
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,463
I-I'm sorry, have we not faced

761
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:43,049
an evil version of Barry before?

762
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:44,185
My mistake!

763
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:46,001
Well, how do I stop it?

764
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:48,570
Hell no.

765
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:56,211
Oh, God.

766
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:57,879
Cisco, there must be
something we can do.

767
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:01,016
Not as long as this thing's powered up.

768
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,557
Come on, come on!

769
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,354
Barry? Can you hear me?

770
00:36:06,356 --> 00:36:07,822
Iris!

771
00:36:07,824 --> 00:36:10,325
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

772
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,294
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

773
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,990
You need to throw a lightning bolt.

774
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:15,192
At what?

775
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:16,731
Yourself.

776
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,500
You want him to do what?

777
00:36:19,503 --> 00:36:21,578
It might short the suit
out, give him back control.

778
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:23,848
Or it might set off
the self-destruct early.

779
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,084
Or it might stop his heart.

780
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,552
Barry?

781
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:29,921
Barry, you need to listen to me, okay?

782
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:31,155
We can do this.

783
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:33,291
Okay.

784
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,160
No, I trust you, Iris.

785
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:37,862
Then run, Barry.

786
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:40,498
Run.

787
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:11,896
Barry?

788
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:19,370
Oh, Tim.

789
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:23,141
I know I have the coolest
superpower ever, but...

790
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:24,675
I'm kinda tired.

791
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,015
Hello, gorgeous.

792
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,852
Here on Earth 1, we celebrate
One-One-One Day today,

793
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,722
even though I have zero
idea what that means,

794
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:16,025
or what any of your
Earth's holidays mean.

795
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,628
I mean, I literally cannot
believe you celebrate

796
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,421
a day called Saint
Shaquille O'Neal's Day.

797
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,325
You guys have a magical
elfling in a red suit

798
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:26,434
that breaks into your
house and eats your cookies.

799
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,765
Mm, actually, he's
the boss of the elves,

800
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:30,520
so, like, maybe do your research before.

801
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:32,041
Ah.

802
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,544
What I do know is how
special you are to me.

803
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,179
And how sorry I am

804
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,625
that I didn't get to
spend yesterday with you.

805
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:41,918
Well, I guess you were busy
catching a deranged killer.

806
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,984
Baby, we are always catching
a deranged killer around here.

807
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:46,054
True.

808
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,000
I will always make it up to you.

809
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:52,492
I mean that.

810
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:56,331
You just gotta let me know
when it's this important.

811
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,336
I will.

812
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,838
All right, then.

813
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,608
- Ready to get your schmoopy on?
- Mmhmm.

814
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:03,506
'Cause, you know, my
schmoopy game is real strong.

815
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,208
Oh.

816
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,048
This is cruel and unusual.

817
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:18,619
How will I survive in
here without my Kindle?

818
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:24,585
You ain't touching anything
electronic ever again.

819
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:26,963
There's three layers of
signal-dampening walls

820
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,364
between you and the world.

821
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,428
No wiring. Not even a lightbulb.

822
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:32,468
There's technology
everywhere these days.

823
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,804
That's fine, we just
have one question for you.

824
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,807
That particle accelerator
explosion four years ago...

825
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,951
You were living in Silicon Valley.

826
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:41,678
So, if you weren't here that night,

827
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,145
how did you get your powers?

828
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,313
Oh, wow.

829
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:45,705
Oh, you're not gonna believe it.

830
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,216
It really was something, though.

831
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,610
A real life changer.

832
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:50,980
And do you two wanna know the best part?

833
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,025
I wasn't the only one.

834
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:59,067
So, good luck, gentlemen.

835
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,798
Think Central City's about
to have its hands full.

836
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,840
Thank you for letting us see
the prisoner, Warden Wolfe.

837
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,775
Oh, my pleasure. Did
you get what you needed?

838
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,635
- We think so.
- Well, not to worry.

839
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:16,768
This so-called Kilgore
isn't going anywhere.

840
00:40:16,771 --> 00:40:19,181
We'll take good care of him.

841
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,674
How is it possible that Deacon's a meta

842
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,017
if he didn't get his powers

843
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,830
from Wells' particle
accelerator blowing up?

844
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,569
However it happened,
we will figure it out,

845
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:30,673
and we will be ready.

846
00:40:30,676 --> 00:40:33,262
After Cisco gets all that
tech out of your suit.

847
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,564
You don't need fancy
gadgets to be the Flash.

848
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,266
- You are the Flash.
- No.

849
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,435
- We are.
- Hm.

850
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,605
Did I miss something?

851
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:06,195
Ah, one of my childhood favorites.

852
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,812
Schubert's "Unfinished
Eighth Symphony."

853
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:10,415
Unfinished until now.

854
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:11,804
You didn't.

855
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:14,082
It was surprisingly
simple to extrapolate

856
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:16,768
the remaining movements
once I familiarized myself

857
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:17,904
with the body of his work.

858
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:20,207
All 600 of his works?

859
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,278
I woke up early this morning.

860
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:31,365
Do you have an update?

861
00:41:31,368 --> 00:41:34,523
Subject One has been located.

862
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,099
He's safe.

863
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:37,793
Locked up in the meta-human wing

864
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,576
at Iron Heights as we speak.

865
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:42,146
He's right where you wanted him.

866
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:43,899
What do we do now?

867
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,403
Now we find the others.

868
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:04,397
