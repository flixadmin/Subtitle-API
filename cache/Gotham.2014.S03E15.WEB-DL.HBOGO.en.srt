1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,360
- Bruce Wayne?
- No.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,560
But you could be.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,480
I've done a wonderful job erasing
the scars.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,960
- Are you prepared?
- Yes.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
But I still don't understand
how I can help save Gotham.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,040
You're only part of the plan.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,360
You know, what must happen
if he refuses.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,240
No, one refuses the Court.

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,480
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,160
- It's the same thing!
- Perhaps.

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,760
But telling you your mother
was a con artist

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,600
who'd only sought you out for
the purposes of getting money

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,760
from me didn't seem like
a very attractive alternative.

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,040
I don't love you.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,200
You need me, Edward Nygma.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,800
Just as I need you.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
You killed Isabella.

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,560
I loved her, Oswald.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
- Greetings, Professor.
- Help!

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,440
Somebody help!

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,240
The building's empty.
No, one's coming to help.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Have a seat.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,280
Who are you?

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,000
That is an excellent question.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,600
But, I get to ask the first one.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,600
I can fill a room or just one heart.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Others may have me,
but I cannot be shared.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,800
What am I?

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,920
What?

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,800
It's a riddle. Answer the riddle!

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,240
I... Knowledge?

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,560
Knowledge can't be shared, Professor?

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,080
- Really?
- You are the chair

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
of a chemistry department.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,720
You've spent a career
sharing knowledge!

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,200
No!

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,920
I apologize.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,520
I'm not myself these days.

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,400
Hands, please.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,360
I can be a member of a group,

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,840
but I can never blend in.

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,000
What am I?

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,120
I...

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,040
A shadow?

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
The answer is an individual.

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,000
I expected more. But then,

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,280
none of the others
did very well either.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,320
- The others?
- Oh, you'd know them.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,240
One was an artist, one was a writer,

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,600
one was a philosopher.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,200
The stars of Gotham's intellectual
and artistic constellation.

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,800
Fallen stars, now.

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,840
Why are you doing this?

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:16,040
My best friend recently said
there was no me without him.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,560
I shot him and dumped him
in the river.

57
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,080
He was a sort of guide
to me on my journey.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,840
You see, I know who I am, Professor.

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,320
It's how to be him
that is eluding me.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
I seek guidance.

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,520
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

62
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm with you from birth
and I'll see you when you rot.

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,920
- What am I?
- I don't know!

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
Well, that's just too bad.

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
No. No!

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,840
We'd gone to the movies.

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,720
My father wanted to cut through
the alley to get an uptown cab.

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,600
The man came out of nowhere.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,800
His face was covered.

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
{\an5}He had a gun.

71
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
{\an5}I remember how cold it was.

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,360
I heard a cat.

73
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,160
{\an5}He shot them both, and I did...

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,440
{\an5}I did nothing.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,320
{\an5}Excellent, my dear.

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,920
You truly are Bruce Wayne.

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,160
{\an5}- Yes.
- <i>We're ready.</i>

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
{\an5}Then proceed. I'll see you tomorrow.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,320
{\an5}And on your end?

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,920
{\an5}I hope your nephew is amenable.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
{\an5}<i>Should he refuse,
you know what must happen.</i>

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
{\an5}I know the rules, Kathryn.

83
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,680
We are to proceed.

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,800
{\an5}Do the rest.

85
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
{\an5}Alfred Pennyworth is my guardian.

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
{\an5}He has been with me
since I can remember.

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
What did I tell you about dripping
on the couch?

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,000
{\an5}You are the only person I know

89
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,720
{\an5}who frets about his drug-induced

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,080
{\an5}hallucination making a mess. But...

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,320
{\an5}- If it makes you happy.
- Thank you.

92
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,240
{\an5}I wonder how long you will be
the public face of grief

93
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,080
when people hear
that you killed your best friend.

94
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,320
{\an5}And then there are your
extracurricular activities.

95
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,400
How many are we up to now?

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,280
{\an5}Five? Six?

97
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,400
There was the curator.

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,360
The writer, pretentious ass.

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
It's so frustrating.

100
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,200
They all fit the profile,
high l.Q., driven, creative.

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,680
Yet, each one failed.

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,400
You must be the first person
in history to go on a killing spree

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,040
in order to find a life coach.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,200
Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.

105
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,640
No.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,480
A good riddle reveals the asker.

107
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,960
To solve it is to solve the mystery
of the person posing it.

108
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,240
If I can find someone
to solve my riddles,

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,600
I can find someone to help me.

110
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you really think
you're going to find someone

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,520
who can teach you
how to be a villain?

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,720
Yes!

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,040
Of course I am.

114
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,120
You said yourself, there is no
Edward Nygma without the Penguin.

115
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,120
But knowing who I am...

116
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,640
and knowing how to be him,
those are separate things.

117
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,920
Ed, villains do not have teachers!

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,520
I made myself into the Penguin

119
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,040
when I threw Fish Mooney
off a building.

120
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,880
I didn't have anyone's help.

121
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,320
Oh, how interesting.

122
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,720
Perhaps I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
Obviously.

124
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,280
I don't need a teacher.

125
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
I need an enemy.

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,400
No, that is not...

127
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,320
The greatest villains
have always been defined by the men

128
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,920
that try to stop them!

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,320
And I know the perfect man.

130
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,760
Please, do not say...

131
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,000
Jim Gordon.

132
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
A serial killer of smart people?

133
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
In the last few weeks,
six members of Gotham's intellectual

134
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,000
and artistic elite
have killed themselves

135
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,840
or died in strange accidents.

136
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,120
Last night, an old professor of mine
died in a lab fire.

137
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,560
At a certain point,
coincidence becomes pattern.

138
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
You getting bored down
in the lab, Lucius?

139
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,920
Yes, but that is not why you
should look at this.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,920
Listen, we are still finding bodies

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,080
from Jerome's night
of murder of mayhem.

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,840
Not to mention, out looking
for our dear missing mayor.

143
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,360
I do not have the resources
to allocate to your hunch.

144
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Did you hear how I used
that word "allocate".

145
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,200
- Let me call Gordon.
- No. No.

146
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
The man's due R and R.

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,800
Besides, he's reconnecting with
some long-lost uncle or something.

148
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,160
Jim Gordon?
Detective Jim Gordon?

149
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,560
Gordon ain't here.

150
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,400
So, give me the message, fruit guy.

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,280
<i>Six masters have passed
there's about to be more a king,</i>

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,960
<i>a queen and their corps.</i>

153
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
<i>The key to saving them,
is on this card.</i>

154
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,040
<i>So, won't you please
help them by making...</i>

155
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
One more time!

157
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,080
What the hell is this?

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,960
"Six masters passed."

159
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,080
That could be the six murders.

160
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
I told you...

161
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,080
Harvey, the killer's
sending Gordon a clue.

162
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,360
He's gonna kill again.

163
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,800
Okay, say you're right.

164
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,240
- Now, which way is up on this thing?
- Let me see that.

165
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,880
"A king, a queen and her corp."

166
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,720
It's a drawing of the Knight's Tour.

167
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Right.

168
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,800
So, the target is...

169
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Come on.

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,680
- Thanks for coming.
- Like I had a choice?

171
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, you'll thank me.

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,960
This is gonna be electrifying.

173
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
Knight to Queen three.
Mate in two.

174
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
- Quiet, please.
- Oh, honestly.

175
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
They call anyone
a Grandmaster these days.

176
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,920
Can we discuss why you're doing this?

177
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
- I've told you why.
- The real reason.

178
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,240
See, Ed, the trouble with talking
to projections of your psyche

179
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
and you of all people
should know this,

180
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,320
is that they know
everything you know.

181
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,760
Including the things
you're trying not to know.

182
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
Gordon can't help you.

183
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,320
No one can.

184
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,240
Face the truth.

185
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,160
Excuse me, sir.

186
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,800
Only players are allowed
on the floor.

187
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,680
No, Jim Gordon.

188
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,400
But then, who solved...

189
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,160
Of course. How can I help you?

190
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes, ma'am, we need
to evacuate the building immediately.

191
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,920
We're in the middle
of an important tournament.

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,080
Are you sure?

193
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe this isn't the place.

194
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,720
Oh, how interesting.

195
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,160
Checkmate!

196
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,080
G.C.P.D! Everybody out!

197
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,840
Don't move, freeze!

198
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,360
Forget what I just said. Freeze.

199
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Do not move...

200
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,520
Why am I here, Uncle Frank?

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
Maybe you wanna
tell me where the hell

202
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,360
you've been since I was a kid.

203
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Or what happened between
you and my dad.

204
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,080
Yes. Yes, I do.

205
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,600
But I need to know that you trust me.

206
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,040
You're family.

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,280
Of course I trust you.

208
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,280
Did you ever do something
you thought was right at the time,

209
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,360
but would now give your life
to do over?

210
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes.

211
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,040
Looking back, I've done too many
terrible things like that.

212
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,120
But the worst was break
from your father.

213
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,000
Keep talking.

214
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,040
I loved my brother Peter dearly

215
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
and you're my brother's son.

216
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,000
I came back to Gotham
because of you, Jim.

217
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,520
I want to make things
right between us.

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,360
So, you shift your weight
to your front foot

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,640
as you swing your arm forward,

220
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,120
just like chopping down a branch.

221
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,040
Like... easy as pie.

222
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
Right, so, weight on the back foot.

223
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,840
Blade comes back evenly and well...

224
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,800
Precision under pressure
is everything, Master Bruce.

225
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,040
And a clear conscience.

226
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
Were you aiming for
the window, Master Bruce?

227
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,960
You keep distracting me.

228
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,400
Well, you should be able to hit
the target regardless, shouldn't you?

229
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,920
I mean, we had rules about training.

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,920
Rules which will be impossible to
stand by if you remain unfocused.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,880
Now, I sense there's
something weighing...

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,040
on your mind.

233
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,600
Miss Kyle, perhaps?

234
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm not unfocused because of Selina.

235
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,920
Oh! Right, I see. Right.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
So, it wouldn't trouble you to know
that she dropped

237
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,520
a note off for you in
the mailbox, then.

238
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,640
She asked to see you

239
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,360
tomorrow.

240
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
No.

241
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,520
Selina's been avoiding me for weeks.

242
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
It's gonna take more than a note
to have me running.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,920
I got Alvarez and Campos looking
into the other egghead deaths.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,240
Hopefully, something will kick up.

245
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,880
Or else we could sit around
and wait for him

246
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,520
to send us more singing fruit.

247
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,760
Maybe he has sent us a clue.

248
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,440
You're late.

249
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,920
<i>I expected this call
seven minutes ago.</i>

250
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,080
- This is Lucius Fox of the GCPD.
- I know who you are, Mr. Fox.

251
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,800
<i>And by the way, it's bad manners
to intercept other people's mail.</i>

252
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
You mean the telegram
you sent Gordon.

253
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
He's not here. Who is this?

254
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,000
<i>You don't actually expect me
to answer that, do you?</i>

255
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,120
Then tell me why you killed
Professor Dyson and the others.

256
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,440
<i>- I know it was you.</i>
- I had no choice.

257
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,800
They failed my test.

258
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
<i>Now, it's your turn to try.</i>

259
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,680
And if I don't accept the invitation?

260
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,360
There are lives at stake, Mr. Fox.

261
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,000
And not just your own.
Now, listen closely.

262
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,240
<i>Tomorrow, when the pawn's on queen,</i>

263
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,560
<i>you'll find my next target
in the belly of the beast.</i>

264
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:05,240
Solve my clue, Mr. Fox and you'll be
one step closer to passing my test.

265
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,880
- "When the pawn's on queen"?
- "Belly of the beast."

266
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,480
And I'll be one step closer
to introducing myself to Gotham

267
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,200
once and for all.

268
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,160
Close. Better luck next time.

269
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,080
I missed on purpose.

270
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
Wanted to make sure my gun works.

271
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
Oh, come on, Jim.

272
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,040
- What do you take me for?
- I have no idea.

273
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,680
You say you've done terrible things,
you bring me out here,

274
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,880
you promise me the truth
and I'm still waiting.

275
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,680
If this is a trust-building exercise,
it's not working.

276
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,240
What happened between you
and my father?

277
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,280
Have you ever heard the old Gotham
tales about the Court of Owls?

278
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,560
Pretend I haven't.

279
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,840
The Court is a secret society

280
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,040
that's controlled Gotham
for centuries.

281
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,160
Started by its oldest, wealthiest,
most influential families.

282
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,160
The Court was once
a mechanism devoted

283
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,040
to maintaining balance in Gotham.

284
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,960
But time and power
have corrupted them.

285
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,240
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

286
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Your father and I were both members.

287
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,440
I still am a member.

288
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
Is that so?

289
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,600
The Court doesn't mean you any harm.

290
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,400
They have the highest regard for you.

291
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
In fact, they want you
to become a member.

292
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,040
Peters, we got a tip from a guy

293
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,880
who electrocuted a bunch of players

294
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,520
at a fancy chess tournament pointing
us to a pawn on queens.

295
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,640
Now, here, you work at a pawnshop
on Queens Avenue.

296
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,600
- Coincidence? No.
- So?

297
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,400
I don't know nothing about that.

298
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,200
Why you so close to me?

299
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,680
Many interrogators employ
the tactic of invading

300
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,360
someone's personal space
to destabilize them.

301
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,760
Do you feel destabilized, Mr. Peters?

302
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,320
- Is this guy even a cop?
- Hey!

303
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,160
We can do this the hard way
or the easy way.

304
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,040
And I'm wearing my nicest suit,
so, I'd prefer the easy way.

305
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,040
- Hey, screw you.
- All right, Lucius, hit him.

306
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,160
- What?
- What?

307
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm wearing my nice suit.

308
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,800
We're disregarding the latter
half of the clue.

309
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,840
It said we'd find the target
in the belly of the beast.

310
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,080
Oh, if you wanna do a cavity search
on this slob, go ahead, be my guest.

311
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
- Hey, you could just hit me.
- No one's hitting anyone.

312
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,520
I wasn't even supposed to work today.

313
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,440
I was covering for Teddy Thirio,
the owner's cousin.

314
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,960
Thirio.

315
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,160
That's the Greek word for "beast."

316
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,400
You know, sometimes,
I think you just

317
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,600
make that stuff up. Come on.

318
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
What are you making?

319
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,000
- Shepherd's pie.
- Again?

320
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,600
Well, you're more than welcome
to take over the menu, Master Bruce.

321
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,760
Did I ever tell you

322
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,440
how I copped this recipe from
an old lady friend of mine?

323
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,880
Sylvia.

324
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,000
A memorable fling.

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
Ended badly, though.

326
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,600
Can't remember what we rowed about.
Something idiotic.

327
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,840
It left me reeling, Master Bruce.

328
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,960
I couldn't concentrate on my studies.

329
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,440
Really? You think telling
me a transparent anecdote

330
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,000
- will make me run to Selina?
- No, I don't.

331
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,360
You see, Sylvia and I,
we got closure.

332
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,880
Now, it seems that Miss Kyle has
offered you the same opportunity

333
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,040
and I suggest that you...
You take it.

334
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Fine.

335
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,000
If it'll get you to stop, I'll go.

336
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
I'll keep the pie warm for you,
Master Bruce.

337
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,440
Thirio's not in his apartment.

338
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,200
Have Campos put out a city-wide BOLO.

339
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm going to the Academy graduation.

340
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,680
I have to, impart my wisdom
on the new cadets.

341
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,040
How do I look?

342
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,800
Is this what Gordon deals with?

343
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,040
Thank you.

344
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,240
Have you seen my badge?

345
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,320
"The Chess Killer." How terrifying.

346
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,120
How will anyone sleep knowing
the Chess Killer is on the loose?

347
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,960
It's just a name dreamed up
by some hack.

348
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,360
Today will change everything.

349
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,600
This is a mistake, what you're doing.

350
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,880
I don't recall asking you.

351
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,920
I showed you how to be Ed Nygma,

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,560
a man who could run the underworld
and operate in plain sight.

353
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,440
- What you are planning is madness.
- No.

354
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,960
It's a way forward.

355
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,440
And the fact that it scares you gives
me all the confirmation I need.

356
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,040
Ed, you are not sleeping.

357
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,200
You are taking drugs.

358
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,560
You are having a conversation
with your dead friend.

359
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,720
Just admit that
you are lost without me

360
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,640
or you will destroy everything!

361
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,960
I have to go.

362
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,920
What are you doing?

363
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,520
<i>He's fierce in my dreams,
seizing my guts</i>

364
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,120
<i>He floats me with dread</i>

365
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,760
<i>Soaked in his soul</i>

366
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,720
<i>He swims in my eyes by the bed</i>

367
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,840
<i>Pour myself over him</i>

368
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,240
<i>Moon spilling in</i>

369
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,720
<i>And I wake up alone</i>

370
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,520
Enough!

371
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,320
I admit that killing you killed
a part of me.

372
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,680
But I will find a way forward,
no matter the cost.

373
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,240
I will be born anew!

374
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,280
And I will leave you behind.

375
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,560
Penguin saw you, Ed.

376
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,320
He was the only one!
He made you!

377
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,400
There is no Ed Nygma
without the Penguin!

378
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,160
Meet Ted Thirio.
Came in about an hour ago.

379
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,560
Cause of death seems to be blunt
force trauma to the head.

380
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,080
However, Mr. Thirio
also has a long incision

381
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
along the right side of his abdomen

382
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
that's been crudely stapled shut.

383
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,760
The Chess Killer promised a clue
inside the belly of the beast.

384
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,080
Think there might be
something in his stomach.

385
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,720
- Okay.
- You worked at Arkham Asylum.

386
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,280
Why would a killer engage
in this kind of cat and mouse?

387
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,080
Crazy or sane, at the core,

388
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,760
most people just want answers
to life's big questions.

389
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,280
"Will I ever be loved?" "Who am I?"

390
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,520
Although, most people try to answer

391
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,480
the question in a logical
fashion, while others...

392
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Stuff Harvey Bullock's badge
inside a dead body.

393
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,560
What does that mean?

394
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,040
It means I know
who the next target is.

395
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,600
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.

396
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,360
Sorry. I know. Thank you.

397
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,480
"As you take the badge today,"

398
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,720
"approach Gotham as
you would a cut of prime rib."

399
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,280
"Have a plan, don't be afraid,"

400
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,480
"and have plenty of antacids
on hand in case of indigestion."

401
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
What the hell are you doing here?

402
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,280
Well, seeing as how your department

403
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,400
is unable to locate
our missing mayor,

404
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,240
I'm here to give the graduating class
a few remarks in his stead.

405
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,400
There's no way I'm letting
a cop killer address those cadets.

406
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I see.

407
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,120
How is the view from
the moral high ground, Harvey?

408
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,800
View's perfect. Now, get lost.

409
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,840
Oh, Lucius Fox.

410
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,600
Must be about me.

411
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,040
Wanna play? You guys wanna play?
You wanna play?

412
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,160
Come on.

413
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,840
I'm looking for Selina Kyle.

414
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
- Oh, I remember you.
- Bruce Wayne.

415
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,720
- Listen, I don't want any trouble.
- Sure.

416
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,440
- How much cash you got?
- Get him, Sonny.

417
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,840
- Stop!
- Yeah, do it.

418
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
- Go on, do it.
- Sonny, I said back off!

419
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,040
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

420
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
- Can we go somewhere?
- No.

421
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,720
I gotta talk to Sonny.

422
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,760
We got business.

423
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,440
Does that shock
your tender sensibilities?

424
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,960
- He's a thief.
- I'm a thief.

425
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,960
- You can't trust him.
- But I can trust you?

426
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,520
Look, I'm sorry.

427
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,920
I should've told you I suspected
your mother of lying.

428
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I was trying to protect you,

429
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,840
- Selina.
- I can protect myself.

430
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,840
Just go home, Bruce.

431
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,800
You don't belong here.

432
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,480
Why'd you ask me here if you were
going to be this way?

433
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,440
What are you talking about?

434
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
The note you left in my mailbox.

435
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,360
I didn't leave any note.

436
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,480
Don't come looking for me again.

437
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,680
We'll talk later, Sonny.

438
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,040
Too bad your girlfriend split.

439
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,680
I don't think she's my girlfriend.

440
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Me neither.

441
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,520
So, about that money.

442
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,240
It's my turn.

443
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,520
Poor Brucey.

444
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,800
Staying down there, big boy?

445
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,640
Oh, oh, he's up. Big boy.

446
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
Hello, cadets.

447
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,240
My name is Edward Nygma.

448
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,800
Captain Bullock's tied up.

449
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,840
What a day.

450
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,720
You all look just dandy
in your uniforms.

451
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,280
How do I look?

452
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,720
I have one question for all of you.

453
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,560
Light as a feather,
yet no man can hold it long.

454
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,800
What am I?

455
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,160
Well, no future commissioners here.

456
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,360
The answer is...

457
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,120
Your breath.

458
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,600
- I think that's for me.
- You Foxy?

459
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,040
Nygma..

460
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,360
Hello.

461
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
Only one person refers
to me as "Foxy."

462
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,680
I have gassed a room full of folks
with a deadly toxin.

463
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,360
<i>I cordially invite you
to come upstairs</i>

464
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,560
and play a game with me
for the antidote.

465
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,760
<i>This is a game between me and you.</i>

466
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,480
Come upstairs alone
or the cadets

467
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,840
- and Bullock die.
- I'm on my way.

468
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,840
Well, look who it is.

469
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm so glad you decided to play.

470
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,040
Are you okay, Harvey?

471
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,080
Look at him! He's fine.

472
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,280
I want to hear Harvey say he's okay.

473
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,560
Don't try and outsmart
this lunatic, Lucius!

474
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,240
Cadet's lives are at stake.

475
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,040
Let's begin.

476
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,720
Wonderful.

477
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,280
I will give you three riddles.

478
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,960
For every riddle you get wrong,
I cut a rope.

479
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,040
You get three wrong and this excuse
for a higher primate

480
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,960
and the antidote around his neck...

481
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,120
Fall over the ledge.

482
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,080
Am I clear?

483
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,880
And if I get them right?

484
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,400
Everyone lives.

485
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,360
Even if you get just one.

486
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,040
Can't say fairer than that?

487
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Okay.

488
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,400
Wonderful.

489
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,880
First riddle, I can fill a room
or just one heart.

490
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,840
Others can have me,
but I can't be shared.

491
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
What am I?

492
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,400
The answer's love.

493
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,800
What? No.

494
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,240
No!

495
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,080
The...

496
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,120
The answer is loneliness!

497
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,080
How do you not know that?

498
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,400
No, no. No.

499
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,240
No, Nygma, no! Oh, god!

500
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,040
Ask me another.

501
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,440
- Okay.
- Second riddle,

502
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,720
I can be a member of a group,
but can never blend in.

503
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,920
What am I?

504
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,480
A snowflake.

505
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,840
A sin... No!

506
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,760
No! No!

507
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,240
The answer is an individual.

508
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,760
Wait.
Snowflake is also a suitable answer.

509
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,880
No, two are alike,

510
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,400
making them by definition,
individuals.

511
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,200
Therefore, an answer befitting
your riddle.

512
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,240
Okay, I don't think you grasp
how this works.

513
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,200
You have to give my answer.

514
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Oh, mama, I'm sorry! Oh, god!

515
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
Oswald was right.

516
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,920
He's the only one...

517
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,560
No! It's just you.

518
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,240
You aren't a good enough enemy!

519
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
No. No.

520
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,080
No.
Three riddles, three answers.

521
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,680
Those are the rules, Ed. Okay.

522
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,880
Final riddle, I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

523
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm with you from birth
and I'll see you rot.

524
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,440
- What am I?
- What did you do, Ed?

525
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,040
What did you...

526
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
What happened to Penguin?

527
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,400
Something happened, didn't it?

528
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,240
Did you kill him?

529
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,400
This is not gonna be good.
Please don't let me go this...

530
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,600
You did, didn't you?

531
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,560
I feel your every thought,
I feel your every move,

532
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,000
I know your every thought,

533
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,240
I'm with you from birth
and I'll see you rot.

534
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,200
What am I?

535
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
A reflection.

536
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,440
Why does it always have
to be three answers?

537
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,880
Why can't he get four? Come on!

538
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,520
Correct.

539
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,960
Thanks, buddy.
I never doubted you.

540
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
You.

541
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,480
What are you doing here?

542
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,240
It's good to see you, too.

543
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,920
How would things go with Selina?

544
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
How did you...

545
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,000
You sent that note.

546
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,320
And you're dressed like me.

547
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
- Even your hair.
- Yes.

548
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,880
Like looking into a mirror.

549
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,360
A powerful knock-out drug.

550
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,120
Why?

551
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,520
This is what I was made for.

552
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,440
To be Bruce Wayne.

553
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,080
How could you, how could my father
have been a part of this?

554
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,280
We were proud to join.

555
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,000
We thought we were gonna do good.

556
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,440
The Court lied to us.

557
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,800
Or we lied to ourselves,
I don't know.

558
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,120
And now?

559
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,040
- You're still a loyal member?
- They think so.

560
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,360
I was a true believer, god help me.

561
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,960
I despise them with every bone
in my body.

562
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,560
What changed your mind?

563
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,240
Your father saw through their lies.

564
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,600
I didn't listen to him
until it was too late.

565
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,280
When was too late?

566
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,320
- When they killed him.
- No.

567
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,920
No. I was there.

568
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,320
It was an accident, a drunk driver.

569
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,920
Just looked that way.

570
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,880
I was there. I was in the wreck!

571
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,280
I watched him die.

572
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,760
Car wrecks like that are simple
business for the Court.

573
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,800
My brother was making trouble
and they killed him.

574
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,400
Sure, as I'm standing here now.

575
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,560
Now?

576
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,760
Some 20-odd years later and you come
and you tell me this crazy story?

577
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,160
Where the hell have you been?

578
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,320
Where were you when my mom
and I needed you?

579
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm truly sorry I wasn't
there for you, Jim.

580
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,480
I had no choice.

581
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,960
The Court sent me overseas.
I had to prove my loyalty.

582
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,120
How could you prove your loyalty to a
group that murdered your own brother?

583
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,320
I knew they'd kill me
if I didn't obey.

584
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,600
I chose to live.

585
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,480
Until now. Why now?

586
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,880
Because now, you've been asked
to join the Court.

587
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,240
Now, I'm not alone.

588
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Now...

589
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,080
You can help me destroy
them from within.

590
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,120
Others have tried and failed.

591
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,120
But with you and I working
together inside the Court,

592
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
we can bring the rule of democracy
and law back to Gotham.

593
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,600
Why should I trust you?
Why should I believe you?

594
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,200
Because we're family?

595
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,760
You have to believe in something.

596
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,760
<i>And while all the cadets
survived the attack,</i>

597
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,040
<i>police say the culprit,</i>

598
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,520
<i>former mayoral chief of staff,
Edward Nygma, remains at large.</i>

599
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,000
<i>Be on the lookout for a green suit.
That's right, a green...</i>

600
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,480
Good evening, Alfred.

601
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,360
And to you, Master Bruce.

602
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,800
Well, you seem remarkably chipper.

603
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,200
Things went well with
Ms. Kyle, I take it?

604
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,680
- Selina's Selina.
- Well, say no more.

605
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,920
You spoke, that's all that matters,
isn't it?

606
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,640
You up for some shepherd's pie, then?

607
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,320
Sounds delicious.

608
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,520
Right, jolly good.
Won't be a moment.

609
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,120
B-team, spread out.

610
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,800
Lock down egress.

611
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
- All clear.
- Clear!

612
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,920
Upstairs.

613
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Clear!

614
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,960
Captain, all clear.

615
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,960
I know.

616
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,680
He's not here.

617
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,640
Hello, Foxy.

618
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,480
So, the antidote
around Bullock's neck,

619
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,320
that turned out to be grape juice.

620
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,680
And the deadly toxin?

621
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,640
Plain old knock-out gas.

622
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,080
Why the charade?

623
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,240
Well, the point wasn't to kill
a bunch of cops.

624
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,560
The point was to have
you play my game.

625
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,040
But you killed Penguin.

626
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,520
And you killed Professor Dyson
and the others.

627
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,080
Why?

628
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,040
Have you always been Foxy, Foxy?

629
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,520
I'm not sure what you mean.

630
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,600
All my life,

631
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,040
I've felt like there
was someone inside of me.

632
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,200
Someone stronger and...

633
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,520
And smarter.

634
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
Someone that people would fear.

635
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,240
No one else saw that.

636
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,520
Except Penguin.

637
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,520
- Except Oswald.
- So, why did you kill him?

638
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,760
Because Oswald killed
the woman I loved.

639
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,640
And with Oswald gone,
is that the role I'm meant to fill?

640
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,280
- To be your reflection?
- No, because I know who I am.

641
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,160
I know how to be him.

642
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,680
And you helped that.

643
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,120
So, thank you.

644
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,680
Ed.

645
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,800
You killed six people.

646
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,760
Seven, including Penguin.

647
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,520
You just announced to the entire city

648
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,800
that you are a villain
and a murderer.

649
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,960
Ed, if there is any part of your mind
that is not insane, listen to me.

650
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,800
You need help. Turn yourself in.

651
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,440
My actions seem...

652
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,280
...mad to you.

653
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,680
To anyone.

654
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
I...

655
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I just...

656
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,360
killed the best friend
that I have ever had.

657
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,440
My search for a teacher or an enemy,

658
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,080
that was just me trying to hold on
to him for a little bit longer.

659
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,080
But now I know who I am...

660
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,440
without him.

661
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,600
So, who are you now?

662
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,720
Oh, come on, Foxy.

663
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm The Riddler.

664
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,240
I've always loved the view from here.

665
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,760
Not really a fan.
You understand why.

666
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,040
I want you to know that our
friendship meant something to me.

667
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,560
I cared about you

668
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,400
and I miss you.

669
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,880
Gee.

670
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
Almost makes up for being dead.

671
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,920
You do know the entire
GCPD is hunting you.

672
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,600
- Yes.
- Well,

673
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,400
not to burst your bubble,
but wanted or not,

674
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,800
no one is going to be afraid
of "The Riddler."

675
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,600
Maybe not yet, but they will be.

676
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,800
Goodbye, Oswald.

677
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,400
Well, look who's alive.

678
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,480
Who are you?

679
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,600
Ivy Pepper, you stupid.

680
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,960
Do we know each other?

681
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,520
I pulled you out of the river.

682
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,160
Been nursing you for weeks.

683
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,240
So, boring. You sleep a lot.

684
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,520
You look strange,
like you're gonna puke.

685
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Are you okay?

686
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,720
I just remembered.

687
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,720
There's someone I need to kill.

688
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,600
Uncle Frank?

689
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,320
How did he take it?

690
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,920
His interest is piqued.

691
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,200
But convincing him
will take some time.

692
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,040
We don't have time.

693
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,240
I won't let you down, Kathryn.

694
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,600
I assume things went smoothly
on your end?

695
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,520
The clone is in place.

696
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,760
What about Bruce Wayne?

697
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,840
He should be waking up as we speak.
