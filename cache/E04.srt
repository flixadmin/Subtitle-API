Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

2
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,870
Come on.

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,750
- Just come with.
- No.

4
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,710
- Please?
- No fucking way.

5
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,880
This may be their last reunion tour ever.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,180
Yeah, I fucking hope so.

7
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,760
They're the best band.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,850
Come off it.

9
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,140
I ain't stopping you.
If you really want to go,

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,520
I'll buy you front row seats.
You take Rachel.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,850
I don't want to take Rachel.

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,020
I want you to come with me.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,360
I would be forced to chop
my fucking ears off.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,150
- I'll make a mess everywhere.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,900
Then I would just have to clean it up.

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,530
- You would?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,700
Smart-ass.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,200
You love it.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,330
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,450
Yeah.

21
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,390
- Hi.
- Good morning.

22
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,610
Morning, deputy director.

23
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,570
How did you get in here?

24
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,070
You're like the fucking mould

25
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,950
on my laundry room tiles.

26
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,620
You scrape it off, comes right back.

27
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,910
Sounds like you got a bit
of a moisture problem, love.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,040
Security, please.

29
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,540
I can stop them getting Supes
in the military.

30
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,590
What makes you think I care?

31
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,670
Personally, I can't wait
until they're in Syria.

32
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,930
Yeah, I'll bet.

33
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,810
Last week. A-Train,

34
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,680
mainlining before the big race.
His fuck buddy, Popclaw,

35
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,350
pinning the same stuff.

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,270
They call it Compound V. It's some
kind of booster or steroid for Supes.

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,190
Jacks them right up.
Now, word gets out that Supes

38
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,530
are nothing but a bunch of juice junkies,

39
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,160
no one's gonna want them
in national defence.

40
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,830
Got a sample?

41
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,040
Not yet.

42
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,460
This could be heroin.

43
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,870
It could be anything.

44
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,290
You don't trust me.

45
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,290
Susan, I am shocked and saddened by that.

46
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,460
Really? I'm sure.

47
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,050
Speaking of which,

48
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,220
I haven't seen Translucent around anywhere.

49
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,180
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

50
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,720
Cunt's invisible.

51
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,770
He could be standing
in that fucking corner,

52
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,520
plugging one out right now,
for all we know.

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,190
Look, you think Supes are cunts now?
You just wait till they're wearing camo.

54
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,150
I mean, what's to stop Sergeant Homelander

55
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,110
from killing a couple
of hundred thousand

56
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,360
Chinese? How are you
gonna try him for war crimes?

57
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,780
He's gonna murder the bloody lot of us
before he steps one foot in The Hague.

58
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,160
I mean, you might as well
hand the bloody launch keys

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,330
over to Vought right now.

60
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,340
You're really working this one?

61
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,550
Just being an upstanding citizen, love.

62
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,670
I know.

63
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,800
Okay.

64
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,260
You get me some hard proof,

65
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,480
something actionable that I can use,

66
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,060
and maybe I'll throw you a few bucks.

67
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,190
For your operating costs.

68
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,110
But if you fuck me on this,

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,530
for the rest of your life,
you'll be drinking your own piss

70
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,830
at a black site.

71
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,250
Say you understand.

72
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,630
See, now, Susan, this is why
it never went anywhere with us.

73
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,880
You can't have two alpha males,
because inevitably someone's...

74
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,050
Say you fucking understand.

75
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140
I understand.

76
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,970
Remind me, what was our deal?

77
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,430
- What?
- What was our fucking deal?

78
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,060
Go to hell. I already told you,
A-Train runs the...

79
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,360
Yeah, runs the Compound V
to the noodle shop up on Division.

80
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,860
We've been up on it all week
and we ain't seen fuck all.

81
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,650
Wherever he's going, it's around there,

82
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,320
every time he leaves with the V,

83
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,780
he comes back with noodles.
That's all I know.

84
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,030
Well, you'd better be right, love,

85
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,870
or you and your dearly departed landlord
are gonna find yourselves on Pornhub

86
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,710
in the Fatal Cunnilingus section.

87
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,540
You son of a bitch, if you even...

88
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,970
Sorry, baby, just, work's
just been a motherfucker lately.

89
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,510
You know I'd much rather be at home,
rubbing on them toes

90
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,850
than out here breaking up yard fights,
but a brother got to get paid.

91
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,640
Most definitely.

92
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,060
Payday comes, we gonna be
all up in Kay Jewelers, tearing it down.

93
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,270
Champagne showers.

94
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,940
I know, I know, I'm just kidding.

95
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,650
All right, sweetheart. Talk to you.

96
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,490
Say something.

97
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,420
Well, you know, Jean-Paul Sartre said

98
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,170
marriage stifles our essential male urges.

99
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,590
Jean-Paul Sartre also died
an old, lonely motherfucker.

100
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,630
Not to mention his girl
was shacking up with some other dude.

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,760
Oui, they were free to explore.

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,510
Explore what? Gonorrhoea?

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,930
Come on, Frenchie.

104
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,480
Why work so motherfucking hard
if you don't have somebody

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,480
to go home to and sleep next to at night?

106
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Well, I go to sleep next to
someone different every night.

107
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Because you're an old, lonely fucker, too.

108
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
And you're gonna die by yourself.

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,990
Well, if you and Monique
have something so pure,

110
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,070
why are you lying to
her about where you are?

111
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,540
Noodle Guy. He's packing.

112
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,960
About time we see something.

113
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
We got to go in there, don't we?

114
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,840
Don't be scared, Petit Hughie.

115
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,930
Will you stop calling me that?
I'm 6 feet tall.

116
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,230
Let's hurry up, let's go.

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,860
Check those boxes.

118
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,990
Frenchie, look for the V.

119
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,590
Frenchie, come on, let's go,
check these boxes.

120
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,800
Come on, Frenchie, what are you doing?

121
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Are you deaf?

122
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,890
Jesus.

123
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,150
Who's that?

124
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,570
I think we should let her go.

125
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,660
No, no. We're here for
the V, and we get out.

126
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,820
This isn't a rescue.

127
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,580
You sound like Butcher.

128
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,120
I sound like a motherfucker
that wants to be breathing.

129
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,290
Goddamn it, Frenchie, what the...?

130
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,300
Hey! Don't set her free!

131
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,220
My God!

132
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,740
Fuck.

133
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,780
Hughie, let's go! Let's go, Hughie!

134
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,660
Come on!

135
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,970
Couple weeks ago, we were all getting...

136
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,640
We were all getting wasted
in the common room.

137
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,190
It was, like, Super Bowl, I think.

138
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,230
And I don't know.
Maybe I was just drunk...

139
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,950
but, you know, I tried.

140
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,910
I really tried...

141
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,620
to talk to the guys.

142
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,750
About...?

143
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,130
Dolphins.

144
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,670
Did you know, in Japan, that they

145
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,750
hunt down and slaughter
20,000 dolphins a year?

146
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,210
Intelligent animals.

147
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,550
Yeah, that have regional accents,

148
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,850
and a great sense of humour.
I mean, they're...

149
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,260
They're hilarious.

150
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah.

151
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,730
And that night, A-Train...

152
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,360
thought it'd be funny to stick
a blow-up dolphin in my bed.

153
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,320
With lipstick on its blowhole.

154
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,780
Yeah, real creative pricks.

155
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,160
That must have hurt.

157
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,080
Yeah, I'm... I'm the diversity hire.

158
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,210
I'm a joke.

159
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,050
I mean, yeah,
I can talk to fish. So what?

160
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,810
How often do you need to be saved by
a school of salmon?

161
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,560
Kevin, that's just not true.

162
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,600
Where would that Carnival cruise ship be
without you?

163
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,570
Yeah. I know.

164
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,240
Okay, I need to... self-actualise,

165
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,620
show more confidence.

166
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,330
After all, who are you?

167
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,830
I'm one of the Seven.

168
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,410
And what does that mean?

169
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,130
I can do anything I set my mind to.

170
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,000
What do you want to set your mind to?

171
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,620
What a mess.

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,990
You all right?

173
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,660
Just when you think
this shit can't get any more horrible...

174
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,080
Nah, don't worry.

175
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,330
It can get a lot more horrible.

176
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,980
Butcher, come check this out.

177
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,360
Take a look.

178
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
V.

179
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,250
So, A-Train's running it here,

180
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,580
and these blokes are dosing
the Asian bird with it.

181
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,130
- Yeah, back when they had eyeballs.
- Yeah, but why?

182
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,710
Is it a Vought thing
or, like, a side hustle?

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,970
Came gift-wrapped in this.

184
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,260
Find out where it came from.

185
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,220
I'll shake a few trees.

186
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,310
Why the hell were they dosing her?

187
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,440
Why don't we ask foie gras over here?

188
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,400
He's the one that let her out.

189
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,980
- She looked innocent.
- Innocent?

190
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,610
She's locked up in a cage, underground,
with armed guards?

191
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,200
I had a feeling about her.

192
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,950
Nah, Frenchie, you just didn't follow
the plan. You never follow the plan, man.

193
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,240
- You need to unclench your asshole.
- You need to eat my clenched asshole.

194
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,080
Why are you two carrying on
like a bunch of fucking twats?

195
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,880
We're sniffing down a shit sandwich
the size of Watergate.

196
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,800
Vought and the Supes are both
gonna be looking for her.

197
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,010
All we got to do is find the female first.

198
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,430
Keep looking.

199
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,850
Who's that, then?

200
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,730
It's nobody.

201
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,990
"Annie"? Starlight?

202
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,160
Yeah, it's nothing.
I mean, we were supposed to go on a date.

203
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,540
Not a date, just, she asked me
if I wanted to ask her for her number,

204
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,210
and then we just kind of platonically
exchanged information.

205
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,460
The word "date" was never mentioned.

206
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,500
Call her back. You're fucking going.

207
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,010
As a rule, I don't usually go out
after a gory massacre.

208
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,840
Listen, here's the job.

209
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,300
You're gonna hot mic her phone.

210
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,600
From now on, we hear everything she says.

211
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,140
I mean, this is a golden opportunity.

212
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,520
And after all you done, piece of cake.

213
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,400
Yeah, she's not a...
She's not a bad person.

214
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,360
She's a Supe, Hughie.

215
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,700
Just like the fucking rest of them.

216
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,250
Okay, we are not gonna be able
to cover this up forever.

217
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,540
Translucent does not show his face soon,
people are gonna start to notice.

218
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,630
What if we just get in front of it?
Tell the world he died tragically

219
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,090
in the service of his country.

220
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,590
We could have an amazing funeral,
bigger than Kennedy's.

221
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,550
I don't know, admit that one of our
unkillable superheroes just got killed?

222
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,640
Kiss that military bill goodbye.

223
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,800
Let's not overthink it.

224
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,890
We just say he's on a classified mission.

225
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,730
We can't say where,
in the interest of national security.

226
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,060
All we can say is he's fighting MS-13.

227
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,350
Yes. That's good.

228
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,860
Simple. Done. Boom.

229
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,030
MS-13. I like it.

230
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Hello?

231
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,620
What? When?

232
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,250
How many people know?

233
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,750
Seven minutes ago,

234
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,290
Trans-Oceanic Flight 37
from Paris to Chicago

235
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,750
was hijacked mid-air.

236
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,590
- Seven minutes ago?
- A source from NORAD gave us a heads-up.

237
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,260
- How many hijackers?
- Looks like three.

238
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,760
Did they scramble F-16's?

239
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,300
Yep, as we speak.

240
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,180
But you can get there quicker.

241
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,640
Can I please have the room?

242
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,690
Middle of the Atlantic.

243
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,400
- Yep.
- No man's land.

244
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,610
You can't operate on foreign soil, but a
plane hijacked over international waters...

245
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,280
If you intercept, no one will protest.

246
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,200
If you bring those passengers back alive,

247
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,200
not one congressman will have the balls

248
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,160
to vote against our bill.

249
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,170
This is our chance.

250
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,590
More important than Translucent.

251
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,430
More important than anything.

252
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,140
Concentrated halothane.

253
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
It's not a guarantee,

254
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,270
but it should knock out your girl.

255
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,860
Merci, pumpkin. I must go,
this girl, she's got a head start.

256
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,610
Hey, I miss you.

257
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,870
I got us a pied-á-terre on the Bowery.

258
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,000
When will you be coming by?

259
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,420
As soon as I can.

260
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,830
Promise.

261
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,040
Promise?

262
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,220
Don't make me use that gas on you,
pumpkin?

263
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,510
Yeah?

264
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,970
Okay.

265
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,710
Fuck!

266
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,800
When will they intercept?

267
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,130
Corporal, I don't care
who is in the room with you,

268
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,800
I need a goddamn update.

269
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,390
Jesus.

270
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,720
Hey. Do you have a second?

271
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,470
It is not really a good time.

272
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,220
I'd really appreciate it. Super quick.

273
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,350
- Pretty please? Thank you.
- No... Okay.

274
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,320
So... I found a mission.

275
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,530
And I think it's really important.

276
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,700
And I'd like to do it,
with your permission, of course.

277
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,330
What? Where?

278
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,410
- Oceanland.
- Oceanland?

279
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,420
Yeah. So, get this, the dolphins there,

280
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,550
I mean, they are really
underfed and abused.

281
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,800
To be quite honest,
they're really frustrated.

282
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,260
And I'd like to, you know,
just shine a light on it.

283
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,430
I think people would
really respond to that.

284
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,310
You do realise that you
are at the centrepiece

285
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,440
of the Oceanland fall campaign?

286
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,900
Yeah, well, I mean,
we could just bail on that, right?

287
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,230
The deal sucks anyways.

288
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,900
- No, we can't.
- Listen, I'd just like to, you know,

289
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,280
maybe do something
with a little more substance.

290
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,240
Okay.

291
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,490
- Yeah? Okay.
- I hear you. Yes.

292
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,580
Deep...

293
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,870
play to your strengths.

294
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,930
Hey, baby. Hey.

295
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,810
What'd you do?

296
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,570
What the hell are you talking about?

297
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,990
Who did you tell about Compound V?

298
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,320
Nobody. Why? What...?

299
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,160
Because you're the only person who knew,
other than me,

300
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,540
that I had it, where I was taking it.

301
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,830
I didn't tell anyone anything.

302
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,290
You're being paranoid.

303
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,250
Who else did you fucking tell?

304
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,470
Don't yell at me.

305
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,310
Listen to me.

306
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Sit down.

307
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,860
Look, I love you. You know I do.

308
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,570
I've loved you since
the first time that we met.

309
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,490
Really?
I heard you at the race.

310
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,620
No girlfriend. Open to offers.

311
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,420
Come on, I have to say those things.

312
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,630
You know this. They make me.

313
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,960
It's my brand.

314
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,800
Come here.

315
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,220
Come here.

316
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,900
You remember when you relapsed?

317
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,270
- Yes.
- And I stayed and I rubbed your back.

318
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,530
Cleaned up your puke.

319
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,530
I'm there for you, always.

320
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,370
I know, baby.

321
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,370
Please,

322
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,960
tell me who you told.

323
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,710
Because we're in trouble.
We're in a lot of trouble.

324
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,770
I didn't tell anyone.

325
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,030
Either way, you're gonna
have to pack a bag,

326
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,410
so get everything that you need.

327
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,410
Why? Where are we going?

328
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,080
I'm gonna take care of this,

329
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,460
but until I do,
I got to get you somewhere safe,

330
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,210
before Homelander finds out.

331
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,800
I love you.

332
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
I love you, too.

333
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,920
Mani? Pedi? Special deal.

334
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,800
The hilarious
Dolphins Ahoy Extravaganza,

335
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,430
starring these two knuckleheads.

336
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,480
So this fall, remember, go Deep.
Go Oceanland.

337
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,060
All right, let's see what you got.

338
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,450
You said you bowled before?

339
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,370
Yeah, I'm just a little rusty.

340
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,790
- You?
- Yeah. Here, actually.

341
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,540
My whole life.

342
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,760
I had my first kiss with Amy Seeler
in the men's bathroom when I was 14.

343
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,880
- It was really romantic.
- Yeah.

344
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm sure that's exactly how
she pictured her first kiss.

345
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,970
Excuse me.
Where was your first kiss?

346
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,640
Prom.

347
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,520
It was amazing.

348
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,690
Wait, senior prom?

349
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,690
So your first kiss
was when you were 18?

350
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,200
Which you're not joking about,
and that's fine, that's great.

351
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,990
Yeah, I had a very
Jesus-centric childhood.

352
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,290
Yeah!

353
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,960
He never asked me out again.

354
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,840
Sorry. What were you saying?

355
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,760
No, just about prom.

356
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,180
- What about...?
- Nothing.

357
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,510
It's stupid.

358
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,140
I'm gonna... I'm gonna throw one.

359
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,900
So what's Translucent like?

360
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,280
That's a conversational left turn.

361
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,280
Yes, it was. I'm sorry about that.

362
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,490
Sorry. Yeah, it just popped into my head.
As a kid, he was my favourite.

363
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,200
You said the other ones were dicks,
is he a dick, too?

364
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,210
Well, I mean, he's not great
with privacy or boundaries,

365
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,250
I will say that.

366
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,000
But otherwise, he seems like a loner.

367
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,880
He spends most of his
free time with his son.

368
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,100
- He's got a son?
- Yeah. Early divorce, I think.

369
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,680
He's about 10.

370
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,810
Hunter or Maverick or something like that.

371
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,420
It's okay.

372
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,630
All right, everyone, it's all over.

373
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,460
It's all safe. You're all gonna be fine.

374
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,930
Thank you, Homelander!

375
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,350
No, no.

376
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
Come on, now. You guys.

377
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,140
You guys made it.

378
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,020
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

379
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,310
- Yeah? Good for you.
- Yeah.

380
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,570
You guys are amazing, fantastic.

381
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,650
Go, Maeve!

382
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,530
Hey, let's get a round of applause
for Queen Maeve.

383
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,820
Yeah!

384
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,700
Captain?

385
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,960
- Stop. Stop.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, fella.

386
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,550
Take it easy.

387
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,670
There you go, just relax.

388
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,890
ATC!

389
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,400
It's dead!

390
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,610
Can you fly a plane?

391
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,110
Wouldn't matter if I did!

392
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,530
What do we do?

393
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,920
All right, everyone, remain calm.

394
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,380
Stay in your seats.
Everything's under control.

395
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,640
You got to go out there, lift the plane up.

396
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,510
Lift the plane? How?
There's nothing to stand on.

397
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,520
- It's fucking air.
- I don't know, fly at it, ram it straight.

398
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,980
No, that kind of speed,
either the plane goes ass over tit

399
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,980
or I'll punch straight
through the hull, or...

400
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,860
Whoa, that was a big one!

401
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,570
Everything's fine, don't worry about it.

402
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,370
Okay. Okay.

403
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,170
You take everybody, one by one,
you fly them to the ground.

404
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,040
And what? Come back 123 times?

405
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,050
Maeve, think.

406
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,300
We're done here.

407
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,390
- Please.
- Everything's fine, guys.

408
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,770
- Everything's fine. You're okay.
- Wait, you're leaving us?

409
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,190
No, no, no. I'm just
seeing something down the back.

410
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,560
My God, you're leaving.

411
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,150
- He's leaving us.
- I said I'm not.

412
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,900
Homelander, are you going to save us?

413
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,530
Sweetheart, of course I'm gonna save you,
you betcha.

414
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,290
I'm gonna save everyone here,
don't worry about it.

415
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,290
- Ma'am, relax, hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

416
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Maeve!

417
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,280
Okay, you two,
take off your masks. Come on.

418
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,110
Now!

419
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,290
- Take these two!
- No, no.

420
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,430
Just these two! Please!

421
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,370
No! So they can tell
the world that we left

422
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,870
the rest of them to fucking die?

423
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,590
- Come on!
- No, Maeve. No. You stay back!

424
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,300
All of you, stay back.

425
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,210
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you, goddamn it!

426
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,050
I will laser every fucking one of you!

427
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,510
Stay back!

428
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,850
Let's go.

429
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,930
No, Maeve, no!

430
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,640
- Please stay!
- I'm sorry.

431
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,600
- Take us!
- Maeve!

432
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,560
Please, don't leave us. Please!

433
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,230
Maeve!

434
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,110
Don't die with them.

435
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,320
Maeve.

436
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,570
- What is wrong with you?
- Please, Maeve!

437
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,830
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

438
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,620
Please take her.

439
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,000
Take my daughter!

440
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,710
- Please! Please take her!
- Please.

441
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,630
Take her!

442
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,120
Look at this.

443
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,500
- Homicide.
- You got here fast.

444
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,620
- Yeah, it was on the squawker.
- What's with the accent?

445
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,920
What's with yours?

446
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,250
You ever seen her here before?

447
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,960
Maybe a year ago.

448
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,510
It's a gang hit.

449
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,680
A gang hit?

450
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,480
- And who told you that?
- I'm not arguing with him.

451
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,980
I'm looking into it.

452
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,980
Excuse me.

453
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,570
Cheers, mate.

454
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,340
A-Train saw me a fucking week ago.

455
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,850
- What if he made me?
- He didn't see you.

456
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,470
That's easy for you to say, Butcher,
but I got people.

457
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,600
And I don't?

458
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,150
Look, Vought don't send a Supe
to do a gang hit, all right?

459
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,730
He was after the female.

460
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,400
Hey, man, who was the woman?

461
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,150
Roberta Cho, mother of four,

462
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,700
loved Mexican food,
and smuggled in a ton of immigrants

463
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,790
- from all over the Pacific.
- Like our girl.

464
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,290
A-Train, can I get a selfie?

465
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,790
I got it.

466
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,250
That wanker can cover
all of Manhattan in 30 minutes.

467
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,300
He's gonna find her before we do.

468
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,630
No, he won't. I know where she's going.

469
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,890
Penn Station.

470
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,140
She's working her way backwards.
She's trying to get home.

471
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:30,610
I'm Ezekiel, and I want you
to join me at the BELIEVE EXPO,

472
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,690
June 6 to 10 at the Fairgrounds.

473
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,990
Sponsored by Samaritan's Embrace.

474
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,280
We're gonna have music,

475
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,610
we're gonna have worship, food trucks,

476
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,870
and, yeah, Christ.

477
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,500
Featuring Homelander
and Starlight from the Seven.

478
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,250
- Hey.
- I know.

479
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,710
Look, I'm not down to convert
the masses or anything,

480
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,670
I'm just... I'm doing a panel for teens.

481
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,510
And I'm donating my appearance fee
to the Covenant House.

482
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,850
You are literally the
nicest person in the city.

483
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,180
No, seriously.

484
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,680
Every other nice person
can fuck off and go home.

485
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,440
I mean, that's why I do it.

486
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,230
Vindictive personal glory.

487
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,820
You okay?

488
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,450
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

489
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,580
You seem a little...

490
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,210
I don't know.

491
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Okay.

492
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,690
I'll come clean.

493
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,990
If I'm being honest...

494
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,530
I'm a little suspicious of you.

495
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,530
You are?

496
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,490
Yeah. I mean, you say you bowled a lot.

497
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,710
And, you know, you have, like, superpowers,

498
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,420
yet you are a remarkably shitty bowler.

499
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,760
You know what I think is happening?

500
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,760
I think you're holding back for some weird,

501
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,840
"not gonna show me
up on a first date" reason.

502
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,270
You want to quit stroking my ego
and show me what you really got?

503
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,190
Holy shit.

504
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,450
Now that's a strike.

505
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,160
Yeah.

506
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,790
Yeah, that's great, man.
Good looking out. Thanks.

507
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,790
Well? Don't leave us hanging.

508
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,050
Deshawn grew up on my block,
but now he delivers packages.

509
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,090
Yeah, not the part I'm interested in.

510
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,510
He ran down the account number

511
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,680
and the box containing the V
came from Samaritan's Embrace.

512
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,390
Ezekiel's Supe charity?

513
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,310
What the fuck's that Jesus-thumping,
elastic bastard got to do with it?

514
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,190
Maybe we find the girl, we find out.

515
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,230
Yeah. All right.

516
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,030
Platforms, ground
floor, I'll take upstairs.

517
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,490
Whoever pings her, get onto Frenchie
and stick with her

518
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,280
till we use the gas, all right?

519
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,710
If you're just tuning in,

520
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,260
authorities have lost
all radar and satellite imagery

521
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,630
of hijacked Flight 37 and fear the worst.

522
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,260
Search planes have begun to fan out
over the flight path off the Atlantic...

523
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,370
No, no.

524
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,080
It's okay. It's gone.

525
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,710
It's gone, you see?

526
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,670
I'm not here to hurt you.

527
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,520
You like music?

528
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,270
Well, me, too.

529
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,280
Can I tell you a secret
I never told anyone?

530
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,410
When I was a boy,

531
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,540
my father, he stole me from Mama.

532
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,330
In Marseilles, middle of the night,
just broke in, took me.

533
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,540
Kept me with him for years.

534
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,170
Hotel after hotel.

535
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,260
Every few nights, take me out for a walk.

536
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,140
Smoke a Gauloises, tell
me he loved me, then...

537
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,810
I tried to run away so many times.

538
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,070
I jumped buses, trains.

539
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,740
Anything to get back to Marseilles.

540
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,620
To Mama.

541
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,830
But every time, he find me.

542
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,380
So I know what it's
like to want to go home.

543
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,890
You see, I know your secret.

544
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,100
You're not a bad person.

545
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,560
Just a scared one.

546
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,280
Let me help you.

547
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,420
Reports of suspicious activity...

548
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,090
Coming through.

549
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,930
No, no, no...

550
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,270
Frenchie. Did you see her?
Which way did she go?

551
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,020
- I don't know.
- Did you try to gas her?

552
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,110
- No.
- Why not?

553
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,190
- It didn't seem right?
- You went off plan

554
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,860
- because it didn't seem right?
- I'm sorry, okay?

555
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,830
Sean Jakowski. Cross-country team.

556
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,460
I had such a huge crush on him,

557
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,500
and he finally asked me out to this party.

558
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,210
My hair looked cute,
we held hands, it was perfect.

559
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,340
Then, all of a sudden,
this senior shoved Sean,

560
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,260
and then he hit him.

561
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,800
So I stepped in, I kicked the guy's ass.

562
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,510
- Good for you.
- Want to know how Sean thanked me?

563
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,850
- How?
- Never spoke to me again.

564
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,430
Not one word.

565
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,440
And that's when I learned,

566
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,110
never show your strength to a boy you like.

567
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,110
Well, to be honest,

568
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,070
Sean Jakowski had a tiny little baby dick.

569
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,870
It doesn't bother you that I could
whip your ass in bowling?

570
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,710
And in everything?

571
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,790
And bench-press you?

572
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,710
My God, is that a threat or a promise?

573
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,260
No. No. I...

574
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,300
I really think it's awesome, the real you.

575
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,350
You got... ketchup.

576
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,020
What? You don't like that?

577
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,020
Doesn't work for you?

578
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,790
Save my spot. I'll be right back.

579
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,700
- Hey.
- Hey.

580
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,210
So where's the girl, Frenchie?

581
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,710
Since you're the psycho chick whisperer
all of a sudden.

582
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,540
Maybe subway.
Maybe she wants to find a train?

583
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,550
How deep up your ass did you pull that out?

584
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,470
- It depends. How deep does your tongue go?
- You lost her, man.

585
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,550
We had orders,
we're supposed to follow them.

586
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,590
We're professionals,
we count on each other.

587
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,470
But you're on some fucking
bohemian flaky drug shit.

588
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,270
Even Hughie, a fucking white Urkel,

589
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,230
- is more professional than you.
- It's hard

590
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,230
for someone who's anally OCD to understand.

591
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,020
Then help me understand, Frenchie.

592
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,570
What happened the night
Mallory had you tail Lamplighter?

593
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,820
- That's enough.
- Mallory was our boss, man. We had orders.

594
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,240
And you were supposed to follow him.
You were supposed to follow Lamplighter,

595
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,410
- tail him, but you let him go.
- I didn't know.

596
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,950
And Lamplighter goes
and torches Mallory's grandkids.

597
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,910
- I didn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

598
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,170
You didn't follow orders
and it costs some lives.

599
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,420
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

600
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,220
- Knock it off.
- You know what?

601
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,090
Fuck this, Butcher.

602
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,220
And fuck you. I'm done!

603
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,760
- Stupid fucker...
- M.M., wait.

604
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,770
You said this time would be different.

605
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,600
But this motherfucker's still here
doing the same old shit.

606
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,610
And we're all gonna
fucking end up like Mallory.

607
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,400
- Yeah, fuck off. Come on.
- Fuck this.

608
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,650
Oi, both of you.

609
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,910
- M.M.
- What?

610
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,160
What's Sporty Spice up to?

611
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,040
Who?

612
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,450
Sporty fucking Spice.
What is she up to?

613
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,330
I don't know.

614
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,170
Exactly. How about Posh?

615
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,340
- You know what she's doing?
- I don't understand.

616
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,970
Making clothes for anorexics. Right?

617
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,050
Not exactly a growth market.

618
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,680
And Baby?
You know what she's doing?

619
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,390
Fuck all. Not even page six
of the Daily Mail.

620
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,600
And Scary Spice?

621
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,730
Up to her eyeballs in
lawsuits and sex tapes.

622
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,150
Ginger, on the other hand,
has released three albums.

623
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,990
Passion, Schizophonic and
Scream if You Wanna go Faster.

624
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,160
They'll all make your ears bleed.

625
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,660
You see, when they're apart,

626
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,410
they're absolute fucking rubbish.

627
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,880
But you put them together,

628
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,840
they're the goddamn fucking Spice Girls.

629
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,640
How do you know so much
about the Spice Girls?

630
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,060
Look, the point is,

631
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,560
that we're all shite by ourselves.

632
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,610
We need each other.

633
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,570
We need each other,
or we're fucking dead in the water.

634
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,490
You guys can beat the living fucking shit

635
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,740
out of each other, I really don't care,

636
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,990
it ain't gonna change the past.

637
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,750
What do you say we go find
that dirty little bitch,

638
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,340
gas her ass,
then get the fuck out of here?

639
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,350
Jesus, he gives the worst pep talks.

640
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,060
He really, really does.

641
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,690
Yes, yes, yes!

642
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,900
That's right.

643
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,820
Next stop, the Atlantic Ocean.

644
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,610
That's right. That's right.

645
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,870
What?

646
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,120
Okay. Okay, yeah.

647
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,000
I mean, let's just focus on
the escape first and, you know,

648
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,420
we can talk about that some other time.

649
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,090
Well, I like you, too. You know that.

650
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,550
But let's not, you know,
rush into anything too fast.

651
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,890
All right, seriously,
now is not the appropriate time.

652
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,190
Plus, you're making things awkward.

653
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,650
Okay, okay! If I just touch it,
will you shut up?

654
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,740
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

655
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,490
I made you a promise.

656
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,040
Shit.

657
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,550
- Let's go.
- No, Frenchie.

658
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,510
Forget it, mate. She's fucked.

659
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,970
A-Train! Over here! Look, everybody!

660
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,770
It's A-Train right over here!

661
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:43,980
Look, it's A-Train!

662
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,060
Hey.

663
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,980
Cool, look who's here.

664
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,530
Shit, what's up, A-Train?

665
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,240
A-Train, hey.
Hey, can we take a selfie?

666
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,950
Sure, absolutely. I can take one or two.

667
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,910
A-Train, over here.

668
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,610
No. Let me talk to her.

669
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,650
Don't be fucking stupid.

670
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,070
What if she's a Spice Girl?

671
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,780
Frenchie.

672
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,760
Let me help you go home.

673
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,970
She ain't no Spice Girl.

674
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,430
Once again, the horrific wreckage
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37

675
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,730
just beginning to wash up on shore.

676
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,110
Every passenger onboard presumed dead.

677
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,860
They didn't have to die.

678
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,570
We have Homelander
and Queen Maeve on the scene.

679
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,240
Do you have a comment?

680
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,790
I said they didn't have to die.

681
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,460
We arrived three minutes
after the plane went down.

682
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,040
And why?

683
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,750
Because we're not
in the chain of command.

684
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,180
If NORAD called us
before they scrambled jets,

685
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,630
then we could've saved them.

686
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,720
One hundred and twenty-three men,
women and children.

687
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,770
Excuse me.

688
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:18,730
But if they let us into the military,

689
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,990
then this will never happen again.

690
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,450
That is my solemn promise to you.

691
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,410
Right, Maeve?

692
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,870
Talk to your congressmen.

693
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,960
Talk to them.
They'll listen to the people.

694
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,170
And together...

695
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,500
Together, we will make sure
that this never happens

696
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,970
to our great nation ever again!

697
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,180
God bless you.

698
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,010
God bless America.

699
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,770
We hear you, Homelander!

700
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,940
And I hear you, brother! I hear you!

701
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,150
And the world hears you!

702
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,980
And very, very soon, my friend,

703
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,530
whoever did this to us
will hear from all of us!

704
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,410
Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!

705
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:13,430
