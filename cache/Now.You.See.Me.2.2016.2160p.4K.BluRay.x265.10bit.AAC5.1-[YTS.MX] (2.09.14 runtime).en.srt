1
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:33,439
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:35,241
Excuse me. Coming through.

3
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:39,089
<i>Tonight, so-called
magician Lionel Shrike</i>

4
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:41,594
<i>is making another sad
attempt for attention</i>

5
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:45,035
<i>by performing what he calls
an impossible feat.</i>

6
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:48,516
<i>The safe is made of
the strongest iron.</i>

7
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:51,723
<i>It can't be sawed through or pried.</i>

8
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:56,084
<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks
he's able to escape.</i>

9
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,998
Dad! Dad!

10
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:02,837
Hey, buddy.
You made it, huh?

11
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:06,317
Now, see that seat there?

12
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:07,886
It's the best
seat in the house.

13
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:12,200
Is Lionel Shrike the kind
of magician who can pull this off?

14
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:15,166
<i>Or is he actually
in over his head?</i>

15
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:16,840
We'll see about that.

16
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:19,238
- What's the matter?
- I don't want you to go.

17
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:21,479
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

18
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:23,878
Remember?
This is what I do.

19
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:26,437
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

20
00:01:26,518 --> 00:01:29,327
Okay? Besides...

21
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:32,482
I always keep
something up my sleeve.

22
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,640
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

23
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,164
- Okay. How many seconds?
- Three hundred.

24
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,923
Three hundred. Maybe a few less.

25
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:46,161
Mmm.
I love you so much.

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,850
Okay. See you later, big man.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,563
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lionel Shrike!

28
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:59,128
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

29
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,887
Will he be able to
somehow escape the safe?

30
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:08,684
Three, two, one...

31
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,528
Two, three,

32
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:20,166
four, five, six,
seven, eight...

33
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:28,053
296... 297, 298, 299, 300.

34
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:34,290
303, 304...

35
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,054
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

36
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:42,495
<i>and we have not seen or heard
anything from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

37
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:43,728
Move!

38
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:46,167
Dad!

39
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,926
Dad! Dad!

40
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,252
Let go of me!

41
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,247
Dad!

42
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,411
No! Dad!

43
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,576
Dad! Let go!

44
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,934
Find him!

45
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,336
<i>The Eye.</i>

46
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:28,053
<i>It may not lie...</i>

47
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,658
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

48
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:36,256
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

49
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:38,254
<i>But is it truth?</i>

50
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:42,816
<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods. Are they?</i>

51
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:46,056
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

52
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,976
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

53
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:50,218
<i>Here's what you know.</i>

54
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:53,855
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

55
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,583
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

56
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,224
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

57
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,944
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

58
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:04,259
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

59
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,224
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

60
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:08,423
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

61
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,942
<i>Framed. Holding the bag. Me.</i>

62
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,904
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

63
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:19,139
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

64
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:23,266
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

65
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:28,589
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you.</i>

66
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:31,024
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

67
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:34,020
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

68
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:40,943
<i>Because one thing I believe in
is an eye for an eye.</i>

69
00:05:58,387 --> 00:06:00,230
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

70
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:02,634
Who am I speaking to?

71
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,115
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

72
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:11,471
<i>You've asked many questions.
And registered many complaints.</i>

73
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,472
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

74
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,124
Have you? Because I don't...

75
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,480
<i>- Trust?</i>
- No.

76
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:19,280
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

77
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,840
<i>Perhaps even us?</i>

78
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,881
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

79
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,157
I don't like that every message
I get from Dylan is,

80
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,882
"Wait. Be patient.
The Eye has a plan."

81
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:32,351
<i>Wait. Be patient.</i>

82
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:33,637
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

83
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,681
This is games
and it's not working for me.

84
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:41,674
<i>You feel it is you who should be
leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.</i>

85
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:47,233
<i>If that is what you desire,
stay the course.</i>

86
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,314
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

87
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:53,193
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

88
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:55,880
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

89
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:59,037
<i>Dylan has a plan
and will gather you together soon.</i>

90
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:01,924
<i>Now leave!</i>

91
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,726
...North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

92
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,685
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

93
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,679
I need to see some results.

94
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,565
Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.

95
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,733
Just real quick. Can I have you
for a couple of minutes?

96
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:28,453
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

97
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,893
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey,
everybody. Sorry. Sorry about that.

98
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,488
Call the mayor.

99
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:35,959
Thanks a lot.
Twins, huh? Good.

100
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,208
Is he coming?

101
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:40,360
Look, I wouldn't have
brought you out of that meeting

102
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:41,928
unless it was something important.

103
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,365
It's about the Horsemen.

104
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:47,602
Somethings happening here
and it's happening now.

105
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,364
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

106
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,881
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

107
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,202
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

108
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,320
I know what Octa is.

109
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,050
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

110
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,089
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

111
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,487
- And I said that I was wrong.
- He knew that the Horsemen

112
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,216
were going to hit
the Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,296
- I have proof.
- Let him talk.

114
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,528
Thank you.
Communications.

115
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:12,606
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

116
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:15,366
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

117
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:18,810
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones? Any transcripts?

118
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,045
- Pigeons.
- What?

119
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:23,409
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

120
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:26,134
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

121
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:29,174
- Okay? Magicians work with pigeons.
- Doves.

122
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:31,694
Stay with me.

123
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,966
This pigeon, right here...

124
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,650
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

125
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:38,805
East Village.

126
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,488
Same pigeon, West Village.

127
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:43,329
42nd Street, pigeon. 65th Street.

128
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:46,295
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

129
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:50,974
on a sail boat with a guy that looks
just like Merritt McKinney.

130
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:52,456
And what does this all mean?

131
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:54,972
I know what it means.
It means nothing. It's bullshit.

132
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,730
- Could you sing a new song?
- No.

133
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,849
How is it that two years ago
you were so close...

134
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:01,583
You think I went out of my way
to screw up my own investigation?

135
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,863
You think I'm
that big of an idiot?

136
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:04,423
You know what I think now?
I think you're smart,

137
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:05,703
but you want everybody else
to think that you're an idiot.

138
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,695
Okay, stop.

139
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:10,817
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

140
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:13,129
people who don't even know you,
think you're an asshole.

141
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,539
- And you?
- Ma'am.

142
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:19,533
You don't know me, but my first year
in the Academy, you gave a talk.

143
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:24,012
The "long game" you called it.
You talked about a moral compass.

144
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:26,296
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

145
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:33,455
And I thought to myself, "That guy.
One day, I want to be that guy."

146
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,616
And now... A pigeon?

147
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,947
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

148
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:41,547
Okay. So here's what
I'm going to do.

149
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,575
You want to take a vacation day?
Go on your own? Fine.

150
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:47,980
But I'm not going to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

151
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:51,181
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

152
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,734
Boss, thank you. I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

153
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,861
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

154
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:58,378
She's great.

155
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:01,616
The problem is when you're
two people at the same time,

156
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:03,214
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

157
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:06,462
And when that happens,
I will be there.

158
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,294
Duly noted.

159
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,307
- Oh. Hi!
- Who are you?

160
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,113
- What are you doing in my...
- It's actually a funny story.

161
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:34,741
How did you get into my apartment?
Whoa!

162
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,104
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

163
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:39,306
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

164
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,658
I think it's funny.
I guess it's all kind of relative.

165
00:10:41,737 --> 00:10:43,660
I was actually...
No, that's not...

166
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:47,299
I made myself in the neighborhood
and now I'm here, and maybe...

167
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:51,300
Okay.

168
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:52,634
Seriously, how did you get in here?

169
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,060
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

170
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,062
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I recognize you.

171
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,303
You did that B-grade "geek magic" thing,
didn't you? You pulled a...

172
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,635
Pulled a hat
out of the rabbit.

173
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:02,956
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

174
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,116
I know that it didn't work.

175
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,276
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

176
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,796
It was way worse for the rabbit.

177
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,223
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

178
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:13,669
So if you wouldn't mind crawling out
from under my couch and...

179
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,944
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

180
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,708
By the way, that rabbit thing?
That was eight years ago, okay?

181
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:25,466
I've gotten so much
better since then.

182
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:26,873
- Have you?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:28,518
Okay, come here.
What is it that you want?

184
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,193
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

185
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,867
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

186
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:34,628
I said it. I do.
And I want to use my magic for good,

187
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:38,390
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

188
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,519
Oh, that's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

189
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:41,880
I know that he
faked his own death.

190
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:44,748
I am a huge fan of faking deaths.
That was crazy!

191
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,390
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

192
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:48,229
- Yeah.
- It's terrible.

193
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,387
- Embarrassing.
- Okay.

194
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:53,436
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

195
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,315
- Ow! God!
- Sorry.

196
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:57,992
That's actually a little better.
You know what I heard?

197
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,192
- What?
- About Henley?

198
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,792
I heard that she got tired
of waiting around.

199
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,393
She lost faith
and so she asked for an out,

200
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,356
and the Eye gave it to her.

201
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:07,666
But who knows, right?

202
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,715
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

203
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:12,267
I mean, maybe she got sick of you.
You ever think about that?

204
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:13,678
Control issues?

205
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,563
Maybe you just didn't
tie her up tight enough. Ow!

206
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:16,953
Mmm.
Here's what's going to happen.

207
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,355
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

208
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:20,873
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

209
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:23,310
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

210
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,997
- It's all in the wrist.
- Uh-huh.

211
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,119
Let the momentum
of the card do the work for you.

212
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,316
Mmm-hmm.

213
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,199
This last one I call the Stall.

214
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,600
Not bad.

215
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,241
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

216
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,040
- I do indeed.
- Here you go.

217
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:48,352
And bingo bango bongo.

218
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,043
That's good. No, no, no,
it's good to be positive

219
00:12:53,112 --> 00:12:54,636
despite making zero
progress in a year.

220
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:55,759
Yeah.

221
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:57,755
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

222
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:00,279
the student has almost
become the master.

223
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:04,961
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

224
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,114
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

225
00:13:06,193 --> 00:13:07,399
You're right.
You're right.

226
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,714
Your teacher definitely doesn't
know what he's doing.

227
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,756
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

228
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,201
- In fact it was.
- I thought so.

229
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,874
That's not bad.

230
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:23,322
If I can hypnotize Danny
before you hit him with a card,

231
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:24,726
I get top bunk for a week.

232
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:26,718
Okay, that's a deal.

233
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:28,206
- Danny, what's up, man?
- Hey.

234
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:30,332
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

235
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,686
you will begin to notice...

236
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:32,812
Everything, because
I'm not hypnotized.

237
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:35,885
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

238
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,640
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

239
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,453
when there weren't floozies around
to impress.

240
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:41,717
Uh, I think we stopped
trying to impress floozies

241
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:43,925
in, like, 1937.

242
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:46,085
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment,
all right?

243
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,921
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

244
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:50,524
everything about Henley leaving,
and everything about us.

245
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,283
- That's her.
- Hey!

246
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:55,599
- Hi.
- You met Lula.

247
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,199
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

248
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,365
I'm the new Horseman!
I'm the girl Horseman.

249
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:04,964
Whoo!

250
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,120
Yeah!

251
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,765
Nobody. No excitement.
Jack? Anything?

252
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,808
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

253
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,489
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

254
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:18,211
and I think she
has some real talent,

255
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,283
and I'd like to try her on stage

256
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,490
- to balance out the duo.
- What?

257
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:23,892
No, are you serious, man?

258
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,017
After Henley left, you said I could
get back on stage again.

259
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,453
Not someone who just showed up.

260
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:29,365
I told you I'd think about it,
and I have,

261
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,698
and I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

262
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,978
Dylan, come on. I've been
behind the scenes my whole life.

263
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:37,768
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

264
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:41,643
Much as I appreciate the addition
of some femininity to the group,

265
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:43,964
over and above what Atlas provides,

266
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:46,365
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

267
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:48,805
Yeah, the issue is that
we have been rehearsing for months

268
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:51,570
for something...
We don't even know what it is.

269
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:53,060
And you're going to
keep working until...

270
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,101
Until we work as a single organism.
I know, I've heard you say that.

271
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,381
The thing is, when you say that,

272
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:58,885
I think what you're
referring to is us, not you.

273
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,367
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

274
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:02,890
Okay? And then I give them to you.

275
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,542
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

276
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:07,327
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm...
Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.

277
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,742
Guys, can I just
weigh in here really quickly?

278
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,302
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

279
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,171
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

280
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,568
- I'm a new person...
- We are anything but a family.

281
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:19,697
Okay, well, my mother literally
knifed my father in the neck one time.

282
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,783
So you are actually
a little bit like my family unit.

283
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:23,047
- Literally?
- But, yeah.

284
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,051
It was an accident,
I think.

285
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:28,177
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going to do something?

286
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:30,331
Yes.

287
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,852
You've all heard of Octa
and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

288
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:37,500
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

289
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,346
You wanna know what all this
has been leading to?

290
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,417
Yeah.

291
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,856
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

292
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,420
Once these phones
hit the streets,

293
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,334
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

294
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,097
Meaning Octa's selling privacy
to up their profit.

295
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:54,095
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

296
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,253
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

297
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:59,014
Rehearsal's over, guys.

298
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,775
This is what we've
been waiting for.

299
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:02,297
Now it's time to get to work.

300
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:11,694
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,</i>

301
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,423
<i>bloggers and journalists.</i>

302

<i>We're delighted that you've joined us

303
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:20,858

304
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,584
<i>Our latest product, Octa 8...</i>

305
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:25,419
Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

306
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:27,384
Thank you, sir.

307
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:31,904
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

308
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:34,667
Sorry, we will take very good
care of it for you.

309
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,421
Oh, by the way.

310
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,180
Security memo from Case himself.

311
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:42,739
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

312
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,740
We're all good.
I'm heading to the control room.

313
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,307
All right. Thanks, Jack.

314
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:50,778
- Atlas, go.
- No, Dylan, I can't...

315
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:53,233
- <i>What? What's the problem?</i>
- No, there's too many people...

316
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,579
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

317
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,068
Okay, I'm going now.

318
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:58,787
- Stop.
- Oh.

319
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:01,664
- Okay.
- Thanks.

320
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:04,025
Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.

321
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,988
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

322
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,756
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

323
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,197
Which part of that
do you not understand?

324
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,718
- I know, I'm sorry.
- For goodness sake!

325
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:31,347
Mr. Case, John from legal.
Just need your signature for release.

326
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,071
Thank you so much.

327
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,224
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

328
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:43,878
Hey there, buddy! Smile!

329
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:45,746
- Who are you? What the hell?
- Who am I?

330
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:48,190
It is picture day.
Did Julie not tell you it's picture day?

331
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:50,079
- Picture day? What are you...
- Company-wide policy.

332
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,879
- Look, I got a job to do.
- I have a job to do, too.

333
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,109
Hold on a second.
What is that?

334
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:54,279
I'm going to need some backup here.

335
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:55,480
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

336
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:56,585
Security, my name is...

337
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:58,199
- Bo Walsh, thank you.
- Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

338
00:17:58,224 --> 00:17:59,590
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

339
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:00,666
Calm down, please.

340
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,315
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

341
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:03,960
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

342
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:06,192
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

343
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:07,945
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

344
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,987
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

345
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,546
- Mark D. Stooge."
- Hold on a second.

346
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:12,642
I've never seen
this before in my life.

347
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:13,870
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

348
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:15,242
- Come on, Mr. Stooge.
- Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

349
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,074
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's going on here?

350
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,910
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

351
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:23,231
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

352
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:25,122
Get off me!
Look, I want to make a phone call.

353
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,083
- I want to call my boss!
- Hey, hey! What's going on?

354
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,075
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

355
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:31,124
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

356
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:33,354
That's my right.

357
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:35,271
- What the hell?
- You're crazy. Let's go.

358
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,998
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

359
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,752
Where's my phone?

360
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,592
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

361
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:41,955
Okay.

362
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,681
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

363
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,391
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Case.</i>

364
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,075
All right. Lula, show these guys
what you're made of.

365
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,835
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

366
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:03,197
What break? Who's Clark?

367
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,921
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

368
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:07,359
Imagine if I told Roger that,
he'd freak out.

369
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:09,354
- Don't do that!
- What?

370
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:10,763
Who the hell is Roger?

371
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:12,408
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

372
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:13,769
- I don't know who Lisa is.
- Are you kidding again?

373
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,809
- You don't know who Lisa is now?
- No, I don't. Just get away.

374
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,039
- That is a dangerous...
- You're ruining the meat.

375
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,638
Don't make me have to go to Brian!

376
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:21,288
- I don't know who Brian is!
- Why are you acting like this?

377
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:22,834
- I'll go straight to him.
- Give me...

378
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:25,722
Oh, my God!

379
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:30,124
<i>What are you
doing to me?</i>

380
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,556
- Help me!
- Help her. Go!

381
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:36,440
Have some water.

382
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,240
I feel from your face
you're freaked by the flow of blood,

383
00:19:39,315 --> 00:19:40,964
which is fully fixable in a snap

384
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:44,563
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

385
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:46,922
as you're flowing and floating,

386
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:49,921
which is why you're focusing
on my commands.

387
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:51,407
You got this far in life

388
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:54,082
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

389
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:56,038
This is that voice.

390
00:19:58,476 --> 00:19:59,923
Look at the light.

391
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:02,847
Listen to your own voice.

392
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,685
Oh, my God.

393
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,403
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

394
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,163
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

395
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:20,687
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

396
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,364
I quit!

397
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,164
Get another towel.

398
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,608
Thank you, and goodbye.

399
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,649
Oh, God.

400
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,008
Welcome everybody!

401
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,006
And now, the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

402
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,209
- Nice work, lady.
- Thanks.

403
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,330
Revolutionized music with Octa 2.

404
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:47,013
I'm actually nervous,
and I'm not even going onstage.

405
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:49,289
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

406
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:52,367
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

407
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,207
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

408
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,968
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

409
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:57,374
So, I don't know.

410
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:00,653
- Do you want... We should try it.
- Not the right mood.

411
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:02,328
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

412
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:05,213
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

413
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,251
I mean, I admit,
from the neck up there are issues.

414
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:11,448
But from the neck down, the David.

415
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,970
Owen Case.

416
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:18,453
Good morning, Octa-lites.

417
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,976
Now, I've made the claim...

418
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:23,818
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

419
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:26,936
But the truth is, that's just
one of those things I say...

420
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:30,409
<i>You know, the truth is,
that's just one of those things I say...</i>

421
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:32,728
...when in fact
I mean something else.

422
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:37,012
<i>...when in fact
I mean something else.</i>

423
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,373
What else do I mean?

424
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:44,729
<i>Well, here to fill you in on some of my
fabulous lies and hypocrisy,</i>

425
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,779
<i>and to perform some of the most dazzling
feats of magic you have ever seen...</i>

426
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:51,454
- They are the world's...
<i>- greatest magicians.</i>

427
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,294
<i>Here to expose me
for the fraud I truly am.</i>

428
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:58,693
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Horsemen.</i>

429
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,295
Hello, New York!

430
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,300
Thank you so much.

431
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:18,136
Hey, it's great to be back.

432
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,499
And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?

433
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:28,579
- Feels good, right?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

434
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,782
Thank you, thank you. Um, okay.

435
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:34,618
We want to talk to you
about your privacy.

436
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,696
What does your privacy mean to you?

437
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,538
Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.

438
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:42,060
No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.

439
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:45,224
You see, he's mocked your privacy.
He's scorned it.

440
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:48,335
Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to

441
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:50,583
when you signed,
probably without reading

442
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:53,865
the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.

443
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,420
Dylan, the FBI is here.

444
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:02,818
All right. Don't worry about it.

445
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:04,899
All right, go to plan C-4.

446
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,020
Lock the doors.

447
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,702
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

448
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:11,187
Don't.

449
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,389
Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

450
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,744
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

451
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:18,902
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

452
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:21,026
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat,
but I told you so.

453
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,305
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

454
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,540
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

455
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:26,302
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

456
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:27,435
What are you talking about?

457
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,836
You sent agents
to Detroit and Philadelphia.

458
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,147
You've been crying wolf
so we wouldn't send them here.

459
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:33,826
- Boss, please.
- Keep working on the doors.

460
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,866
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

461
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,510
Before we start the show...

462
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:43,301
We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.

463
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,385
So, everything that he had
once considered private...

464
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,030
That he thinks is really private...

465
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:55,073
Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...

466
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,506
Oh, my.

467
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:05,304
<i>As the Horsemen like to say,
magic is about controlling perception.</i>

468
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:09,434
<i>You see them as champions of the truth,
but are they?</i>

469
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:12,428
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

470
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:15,075
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- This is crazy.

471
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:16,641
We got to get everyone
to the other exits.

472
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,271
- Let's go, to the back.
- No. You stay here.

473
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:21,552
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

474
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,152
<i>Let's reveal some of theirs.</i>

475
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:25,954
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

476
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:28,074
<i>Abort.</i>

477
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:30,831
Jack, go with them.
I'll see you at the meet-up point.

478
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:31,908
Let's go.

479
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:34,115
<i>Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?</i>

480
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:39,637
<i>What if I told you he's not just alive,
but he's actually right here.</i>

481
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:49,476
<i>And do you know who else is here?
The FBI.</i>

482
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:51,756
<i>Let's let them in, shall we?</i>

483
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:54,993
<i>And now, for the big reveal.</i>

484
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,719
Go! Go! To the stage.

485
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,872
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

486
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,715
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them all.</i>

487
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,436
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

488
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,713
- I knew it.
- What?

489
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,870
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

490
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,127
You think you're looking at one thing,
but you have no idea.

491
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,596
- Who are you?
- The same man I've always been.

492
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,434
Boys, I'm sorry.

493
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,801
You gotta be kidding me.

494
00:25:28,953 --> 00:25:30,920
We've gotta get to the chute. Go!

495
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:33,758
- Who are those guys?
- Who cares? Come on!

496
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,038
- Hurry, hurry!
- Keep going!

497
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:36,170
How the hell could this happen?

498
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:37,929
I thought Dylan
had everything under control.

499
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,717
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

500
00:25:39,794 --> 00:25:42,876
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.
Where you been sneaking off to?

501
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,490
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

502
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:47,917
- I'm not insinuating. That's your...
- Let's get to the truck, come on!

503
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:50,157
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

504
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:51,282
Lula, come on!

505
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:53,279
Coming! Whoa!

506
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:57,316
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

507
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:05,601
<i>Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.</i>

508
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:17,562
What the hell is going on?

509
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:20,117
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?
- Where the hell are we?

510
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:23,438
Come on!

511
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,407
Hey, hey!
Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

512
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:27,128
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

513
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,815
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

514
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,214
Somebody must
have moved the tube.

515
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,774
Were we above a Chinese restaurant?
Give me that!

516
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,400
- I'm moving! Relax!
- There's something very wrong.

517
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,926
Okay. Why are we here?

518
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,967
Why am I frickin' starving?

519
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,169
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

520
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,527
This makes no sense.

521
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:10,847
Okay, sorry.

522
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:14,490
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

523
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:17,296
but apparently
we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

524
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:19,651
- Right?
- Guys...

525
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:23,285
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

526
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:26,095
It's just called "food."

527
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:33,051
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

528
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:40,897
I believe in your particular parlance,
the word is "magic."

529
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:43,488
That guy looks exactly like you.

530
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:46,616
He looks exactly like you.
Are you seeing this right now?

531
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:47,848
Chase.

532
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:51,899
Must confess, it's like what I heard
about meeting the Rolling Stones.

533
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:53,891
They're a lot shorter in person.

534
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:56,811
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

535
00:27:56,887 --> 00:28:00,177
This is my twin brother, Chase.

536
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,057
Wait, did you do this?

537
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:08,170
As you can see,
my boss don't mess around.

538
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:10,934
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

539
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,091
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

540
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,220
You jumped off a rooftop in New York
and you landed in Macau.

541
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,818
AKA the Vegas of China.

542
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:23,212
And presto-changes.

543
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,453
Don't you just love it?

544
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:26,613
The "greatest magicians in the world"

545
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,172
are the object
of someone else's magic trick?

546
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,415
Isn't that poetic?

547
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:37,096
No? You know what,
I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

548
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,618
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

549
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:45,694
Oh, and you know what they say,
"What happens in Macau..."

550
00:28:45,773 --> 00:28:49,017
Uh, well, I don't know the rest of it,
'cause it's in Chinese, uh...

551
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,822
Hey, thanks, guys!

552
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:12,737
<i>Reports are coming in
that the infamous Horsemen</i>

553
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,938
<i>hijacked the Octa product launch today.</i>

554
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,621
<i>The trick was on them, however,</i>

555
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:20,058
<i>as we learned of the miraculous
resurrection of Jack Wilder.</i>

556
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:23,186
<i>And the stunning revelation
that FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes</i>

557
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:25,704
<i>has been working as a mole
within the Bureau.</i>

558
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:29,145
<i>Questions abound today as an
international manhunt is underway</i>

559
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:32,939
<i>for Dylan Rhodes and his elusive
and criminal band of illusionists.</i>

560
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,700
Hey, seriously, where are you guys?

561
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:38,674
I'm at the meetup.
I've been leaving you messages.

562
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:41,021
I haven't heard from anyone.
Please, call me!

563
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,315
<i>And the stock market</i>

564
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,071
<i>saw big gains and modest
losses on Thursday.</i>

565
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,104
Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

566
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,505
Right where you left me,
18 months ago, Agent Rhodes.

567
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:53,741
Thaddeus?

568
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,703
<i>How does it feel
to lose everything?</i>

569
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,745
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

570
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:02,950
How does it feel to be out of control,
perhaps for the first time?

571
00:30:05,423 --> 00:30:06,549
What do you want?

572
00:30:06,623 --> 00:30:09,627
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

573
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:12,710
- Where are they?
- I'm not telling you on the phone!

574
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:13,784
Where are they?

575
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:17,868
And if you're wondering if I was behind
the Horsemen's recent debacle,

576
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,707
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

577
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,788
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn
you again. I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

578
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:25,550
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

579
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:28,104
You started it when
you locked me in a cell.

580
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:29,868
<i>This is simply my move.</i>

581
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,953
Next one is yours.

582
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:36,596
<i>No!</i>

583
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:38,996
Let go!

584
00:30:39,826 --> 00:30:43,273
Dad! Help me! Dad!

585
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,029
<i>Dad!</i>

586
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:05,392
It's all about blind spots.

587
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:10,315
When you're staring straight
at something, and not see it. Why?

588
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,753
Blind spots.

589
00:31:12,828 --> 00:31:15,070
We learned that together,
didn't we, bro?

590
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,994
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

591
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,233
No? I didn't think so.
The "Mini-McKinneys."

592
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,632
<i>♪ Chasey and a Mer-Bear</i>

593
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,752
<i>♪ Gonna make you scare-bear</i>

594
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,152
<i>♪ Ma-ma-magic McKinneys ♪</i>

595
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,232
Cool.

596
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:37,921
And then, one day, we were 12
and Virginia von Welsheim

597
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:40,882
had a very nice party
down the street.

598
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:43,273
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

599
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:48,883
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and got
a taste of the solo thing, and uh...

600
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:53,559
- ...and kicked me to the curb.
- Oh, God.

601
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:58,116
Chase, you win! I concede.
Just tell me how you did it.

602
00:31:58,193 --> 00:32:04,362
Delivery guy came to your door
about a month ago, little za.

603
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:05,516
Za?

604
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:08,520
Pizza, huh?

605
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:12,960
- Is this apartment d3375?
- Not even close.

606
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:18,562
Sleep!

607
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:22,199
Relaxing, floating,
drifting, dreaming...

608
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,318
Falling.

609
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:26,967
So, what he did,
my little womb-mate,

610
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:30,961
is he downloaded all
your private information,

611
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:34,241
and my employer
had all he needed.

612
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,684
Thanks.

613
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,568
How did you know how to find him?

614
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:41,848
- That's a very good question, Atlas.
- Okay.

615
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:02,887
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

616
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:10,042
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse
with you, broski.

617
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,970
Meow.

618
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:16,122
Have fun at the Sands.

619
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:22,728
- I am so, so, so sorry.
- Yeah, you should be.

620
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:26,006
Don't ever accuse me
of betraying us again, okay?

621
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:41,135
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

622
00:33:41,204 --> 00:33:43,685
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

623
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:47,410
And at the exact right moment,

624
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,728
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

625
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:51,649
"Yes! Thank God you're here!

626
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,206
Thank God!
Just in the nick of time, Eye!"

627
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:58,292
And then we'll just celebrate,
and it was all worth it in the end?

628
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:04,535
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

629
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:06,530
It's cool.

630
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:21,970
Ah.

631
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,931
Ta-da!

632
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,653
So happy to be working with you.

633
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,410
Please, come in. Come in.

634
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,579
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

635
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:33,027
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

636
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,975
Oh, well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

637
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,902
is working with that rabbit.

638
00:34:38,971 --> 00:34:42,533
We'll be working together. Yes.
Allow me to introduce myself.

639
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:45,137
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

640
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:47,101
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

641
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,094
Fake your death,
the world puts its guard down.

642
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,175
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

643
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:52,778
including my old partner, Owen's,

644
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:55,981
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

645
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:59,775
- And that violates how many SEC laws?
- I believe it breaks all of them.

646
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:01,219
All of them.

647
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:04,184
You see, you all want an audience.

648
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:07,702
Need one, desperately.
It's quite sad, really.

649
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:09,857
Hence, my ability to nab you.

650
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:12,745
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

651
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:17,218
I just want to be, and I am
100 percent off the grid.

652
00:35:17,294 --> 00:35:18,582
You know why?

653
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,182
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

654
00:35:21,256 --> 00:35:23,577
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

655
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:26,785
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

656
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:29,138
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

657
00:35:29,217 --> 00:35:31,106
- Follow me.
- Yeah.

658
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,986
- Follow me.
- Okay. All right.

659
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:35,343
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.
That was very colorful.

660
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:38,945
Almost eight and a half years ago.
So, no need to bring that up.

661
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:41,669
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

662
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,867
Can we, Magicolio?

663
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:46,260
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

664
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,228
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.

665
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:49,504
Like you, and many others who,

666
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:52,629
I suppose, were not getting any sex
in high school, I dabbled with it.

667
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:58,070
But, uh, unlike you, I was able to
transition upward towards actual magic.

668
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,308
Science, you may
have heard it called.

669
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:07,190
So, would you like to know,
my friends, just how I got you here?

670
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,592
We know how you did it.

671
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:09,662
No, you don't.

672
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:12,472
Yeah, you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

673
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,987
Stop. No. Seriously, stop.

674
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,383
The strobe was a combo
of binaural beats, as well as...

675
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:18,830
I said stop!

676
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,382
You might not be having fun,
but I am.

677
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,628
You have an unusual way of showing it.

678
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:26,264
So...

679
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:28,907
How did I do it?

680
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:33,546
Easy. You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

681
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,960
In your heightened state of agitation,

682
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,351
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

683
00:36:37,423 --> 00:36:39,826
<i>And your minds filled in the rest.</i>

684
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:42,749
<i>But the tube you meant to go down
was 20 feet to your right.</i>

685
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,880
Go on, sit down. There's no one
standing in your way.

686
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:46,395
Don't mind if I do.

687
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:50,426
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

688
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:54,306
<i>Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained
UV letters pulsing the word "sleep."</i>

689
00:36:56,386 --> 00:37:00,186
<i>And that, combined with the sound,
put you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

690
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:03,076
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

691
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:04,831
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

692
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:08,274
And I can assure you,
you don't know what happened.

693
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:15,993
That's really creepy.
Really, really creepy.

694
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:20,080
That's not cool.

695
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:22,317
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

696
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,440
if you put your mind to it.

697
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,509
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

698
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:29,280
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

699
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,160
Well, to start with,
the man you stole from last year,

700
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,031
turns out I had invested quite a lot
of money in some of his companies,

701
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:38,278
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

702
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,117
Good news is, it's very easy for you
to pay me back.

703
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:43,923
I just need your skills.

704
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:46,882
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

705
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:47,999
Elfin?

706
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:49,403
...geniuses.

707
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:51,117
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

708
00:37:51,192 --> 00:37:53,513
And like them, we had a dream.

709
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:58,079
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

710
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:01,554
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

711
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:04,763
That is what he
would like you to think.

712
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:09,920
My vision was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

713
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:12,354
But Owen wanted it for himself
so he humiliated me

714
00:38:12,434 --> 00:38:15,597
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

715
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,155
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

716
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,357
Did you take a picture of him
while he was sleeping?

717
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:20,852
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

718
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:23,241
and now he goes around
taking credit for a chip

719
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:25,080
that's not just the key to one computer,

720
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:28,160
but every computer
system on the planet.

721
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:31,319
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

722
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:34,162
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

723
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:36,037
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

724
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:37,773
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

725
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:39,209
So he gets the money?

726
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,479
And the pleasure? No.

727
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:44,801
No, no, no. Besides, why would I buy it
when I could have you steal it for me?

728
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:46,039
Oh!

729
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,135
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

730
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,800
which will include your targets,
a crew lead by a South African gangster.

731
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:53,368
South African gangster.

732
00:38:53,438 --> 00:38:55,216
Yes. How your team
gets past security, that's up to you.

733
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:58,481
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

734
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,560
That's it?

735
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,448
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

736
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,656
You're magicians and thieves.

737
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,286
What makes you think we would even
consider doing this?

738
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,728
Um, oh, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Oh, yes.

739
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:10,416
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

740
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,728
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

741
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:17,011
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

742
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:20,487
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

743
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:25,129
You know what?
I'm not stealing a thing for you.

744
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:29,327
- Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay.
- Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

745
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:32,293
It doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm with him.
So you can go ahead and kill us

746
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:34,403
because I'm not gonna
steal anything for you either.

747
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:38,051
Strikes me that a consensus
seems to be forming, Walter,

748
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:39,649
and we're calling your bluff.

749
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:43,412
- Actually, we'll do it.
- What?

750
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:46,250
We're in Macau. The oldest
magic store in the world is here.

751
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:49,692
We'll get the supplies
we need, and we'll do it.

752
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:52,215
Thank you.

753
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:53,774
It should be fun.

754
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:56,850
Chase will take you
to the magic shop in the morning.

755
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:02,967
Badge.

756
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:07,848
Really?

757
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,378
Thanks.

758
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:15,897
Agent Cowan. Your ID.

759
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:17,418
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

760
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:23,969
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

761
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,780
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

762
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,691
What?

763
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,217
All right, so I made my move.

764
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:57,454
Where are they?
I don't have time for bullshit.

765
00:40:57,532 --> 00:41:00,058
Oh, I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

766
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:03,534
And I didn't get to finish my lobster,
which makes me very grumpy.

767
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:06,378
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

768
00:41:06,453 --> 00:41:09,615
You can dispense with
the tough guy act to begin with.

769
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,260
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

770
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:16,980
I said, what do you want?

771
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:20,661
You used a form 219 warrant
to search my room.

772
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:23,419
You found a connection
between me and the Four Horsemen.

773
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:28,626
Which means you can take me
out of here on a 24-hour leave.

774
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,906
- You want me to break you out?
- I want you to take me out.

775
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:35,547
All you need is an extradition order,

776
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:38,348
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

777
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:44,587
Dylan, I had nothing to do
with the Horsemen's disappearance.

778
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:47,138
You were lured into a trap.

779
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:50,267
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

780
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:56,584
you're beginning to realize
that the only way out is through.

781
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:59,662
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

782
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:01,943
You got this place wired.

783
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,150
You don't need me to get out of here.
This is all about payback.

784
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,019
- I believe in an eye for an eye.
- So you're out to destroy me?

785
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,306
Oh, absolutely.

786
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,676
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

787
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,385
I know you will.

788
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:18,465
Because no matter how hard you try
to find a culprit behind all this,

789
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,908
you're going to blame only yourself.

790
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:25,469
When your little vendetta ended with you
putting me in jail 18 months ago,

791
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:29,433
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

792
00:42:29,502 --> 00:42:31,550
And that's where you lost.

793
00:42:34,742 --> 00:42:38,224
So, you can save yourself,

794
00:42:39,983 --> 00:42:44,467
or you can make a deal with me,
and save the Four Horsemen,

795
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:47,831
and stop wasting both of our time.

796
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:55,435
Steal something for this narcissistic
little man boy? I don't like it.

797
00:42:55,504 --> 00:42:57,632
But what I like less
is you deciding for us.

798
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:00,322
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

799
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,189
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

800
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:03,994
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

801
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,306
But we can fix that.

802
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:06,592
- We can fix it?
- Yeah.

803
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,242
So you're officially
part of the team now?

804
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:10,075
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure this is what Dylan

805
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:12,282
meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

806
00:43:12,307 --> 00:43:15,549
Yeah, that is a fairytale
that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

807
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:18,277
Look, even if we get this stick,
he'll never let us go.

808
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:22,433
We can't trust Walter, okay?
The Eye has a history in Macau.

809
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:23,924
They're the only ones we can trust.

810
00:43:23,947 --> 00:43:25,004
Now, if we can get it to them,

811
00:43:25,028 --> 00:43:27,315
they can clear our names
and get us the hell out of here.

812
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:28,918
It's a bad plan, man.

813
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:38,512
Hey.

814
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:39,875
Hi, how are you?

815
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:41,918
Um, we need some
things custom-made.

816
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,645
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

817
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,354
And...

818
00:43:45,431 --> 00:43:47,637
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

819
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:56,878
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

820
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:58,192
- What?
- Got you.

821
00:43:58,272 --> 00:43:59,319
- Okay.
- Look.

822
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:02,353
Where'd it go?

823
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:06,801
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

824
00:44:06,871 --> 00:44:08,443
- $20.
- $20?

825
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,402
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

826
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,713
- $10.
- Uh, no.

827
00:44:12,793 --> 00:44:14,079
- Two for one.
- No.

828
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:15,769
Okay, all right.
Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

829
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:18,035
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack.
Please take these.

830
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,765
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

831
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:24,839
and we also need roughing fluid,
a Sanada gimmick, sleeves, tracks.

832
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,837
This is all in plastic,
though, if you can.

833
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,437
What?

834
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,201
Is there a problem?

835
00:44:36,276 --> 00:44:39,439
My grandmother wants to know
why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

836
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:41,803
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

837
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:45,438
We're going through a very sensitive
metal detector, okay?

838
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,242
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

839
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,406
It detects.

840
00:44:56,918 --> 00:44:57,965
What did she say?

841
00:44:58,038 --> 00:45:01,407
She said just because you're
talking slowly and moving your hands

842
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:03,481
doesn't mean she can suddenly
understand English.

843
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,324
Oh, yeah. So sorry. He's racist.

844
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:10,610
Hey, bro. Listen, I know
that the only thing that we agree on

845
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:13,286
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

846
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,650
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

847
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,210
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

848
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:24,651
- If it's free, it's me.
- Great. Guys, we'll be right back.

849
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,327
Okay, kiddies,
the chaperones are watching you.

850
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:30,688
Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.

851
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:33,809
Okay. Have fun, you two.

852
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:39,610
Hey. Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

853
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,047
Sure.

854
00:45:41,882 --> 00:45:43,533
- On the house.
- Thanks.

855
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:46,284
Who are you calling?

856
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:47,858
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

857
00:45:47,883 --> 00:45:49,648
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

858
00:45:49,723 --> 00:45:51,009
You've been doing it
on your own?

859
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,209
Maybe.

860
00:45:52,284 --> 00:45:54,685
Oh, God.
Dylan's not gonna like this.

861
00:45:54,764 --> 00:45:56,846
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes. Okay?

862
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,164
I'm doing this for us.

863
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:04,091
- What is wrong with this thing?
- Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

864
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:05,496
Yeah, that's what I thought.

865
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:06,930
- Okay. Let me just...
- Ow!

866
00:46:07,004 --> 00:46:09,373
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

867
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:13,852
Hey, can you get this?

868
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:20,414
It's like birth, you know.

869
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:23,934
One person enters the hospital,
two people come out.

870
00:46:24,007 --> 00:46:25,453
Walk and talk.

871
00:46:25,528 --> 00:46:27,848
I'll tell you on the plane.

872
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:30,056
What plane?

873
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:33,098
My sources tell me
your Horsemen are in Macau.

874
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:36,135
- What's the look?
- It's none of your business.

875
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:37,415
Who are your sources?

876
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,171
Just some old friends.

877
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,014
When we have the card, where do I go?

878
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,492
And 0 for 52.

879
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:57,620
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

880
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,535
Then what about girls?

881
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:03,455
Like, relationships?

882
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:04,658
What?

883
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:12,093
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

884
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:18,215
but every girl I get close to,
I end up taking their trust.

885
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,774
And then their wallet.

886
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:22,500
So...

887
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:27,500
- You take their wallets?
- Yeah.

888
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:31,862
You ever take their belts?

889
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:37,744
Or how about some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

890
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:40,786
Not sure why you took those.

891
00:47:40,855 --> 00:47:43,937
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like those other girls?

892
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,305
Oh, Jack.

893
00:47:53,016 --> 00:47:55,224
Okay. So there's a marketplace
down the street.

894
00:47:55,296 --> 00:47:57,425
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

895
00:47:57,497 --> 00:48:00,228
He'll get the stick to the right people
and get us home.

896
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:02,346
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

897
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:04,147
And, hey, put your belt on.

898
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:06,903
Oh, no, it's not...
She took it off me and...

899
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:10,982
You know, the most
heartbreaking moment of my life

900
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:15,781
was when I discovered that you had
stolen all my money and split.

901
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,941
I didn't realize until now

902
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:20,500
how much of that money
you put into your face.

903
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,142
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair
in your nose than on your head?

904
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,792
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

905
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:33,503
you might wanna consider requesting
something other than old man pubes.

906
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:37,631
You know what?
You are such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

907
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,624
And this little ploy you have

908
00:48:39,702 --> 00:48:43,788
of stalling me while your friends
screw over my employer?

909
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:45,505
Not gonna work.

910
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:52,113
Chase! As you stare into my eyes,
you will find that you wanna sleep.

911
00:48:52,183 --> 00:48:54,835
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

912
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:58,066
and realize that you will never be
half the man that he is.

913
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:06,795
Merritt, I am so,
so very, very sorry

914
00:49:06,865 --> 00:49:09,596
about how pathetic your pupil is.

915
00:49:09,665 --> 00:49:12,829
Hey, a little hint
on your technique of surprise.

916
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:17,230
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

917
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:22,115
Hey, this has been fun, Mer-Bear.
Let's do it again sometime.

918
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:30,474
Well, I've had ample time
to do some research, and you know,

919
00:49:30,546 --> 00:49:31,594
I was wrong.

920
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:35,274
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

921
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:36,838
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

922
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:38,911
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

923
00:49:38,987 --> 00:49:42,309
that this road would lead to
the great wizard behind the curtain

924
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:44,959
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

925
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:46,235
That ain't gonna happen.

926
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:47,925
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

927
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,685
Listen to me. I broke you out of there.
We're not changing the terms now.

928
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,441
- You put me there!
- Yeah, because you deserve to be there.

929
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,036
- Listen, I did not kill your father.
- What?

930
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,074
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

931
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:03,712
I know who you are, Shrike.

932
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,073
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

933
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:11,122
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

934
00:50:11,191 --> 00:50:16,039
I know the time in jail was a result
of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

935
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:18,319
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

936
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:19,599
Man...

937
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:22,963
Thirty years.

938
00:50:23,032 --> 00:50:28,643
Thirty years, and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

939
00:50:28,714 --> 00:50:32,514
Just to put me behind bars. Okay.

940
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,964
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

941
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:38,758
Was it all you hoped?

942
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:40,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

943
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:44,440
You're lying.
It was an empty experience.

944
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:46,563
And you wanna know how I know?

945
00:50:47,636 --> 00:50:50,367
I know because you know.

946
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:56,284
There's always, always more
than what's on the surface.

947
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:58,813
So what, the past didn't happen,
and you're not who I think you are?

948
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:00,013
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

949
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:02,880
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

950
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:06,880
I am not my father.
You're not getting in my head, okay?

951
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:09,484
You think you're luring me into a trap?
You're not.

952
00:51:09,558 --> 00:51:12,164
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

953
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:15,721
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

954
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:19,281
And you're gonna lead me to them.
And if you don't, I promise you,

955
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,249
you're gonna end up far worse
than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

956
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:40,248
What if the Horsemen
don't actually need you to save them?

957
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:47,611
All right. So the lab
is made up of two distinct layers,

958
00:51:47,682 --> 00:51:50,730
the security perimeter
and the clean room.

959
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:52,805
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

960
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:54,931
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

961
00:51:55,003 --> 00:51:56,732
and replace it with a decoy.

962
00:51:56,803 --> 00:51:58,219
Now, we're about to get to the chip.

963
00:51:58,243 --> 00:51:59,859
This is the thing
about the chip, it's very thin.

964
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,773
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size to a playing card,

965
00:52:02,844 --> 00:52:04,804
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

966
00:52:06,804 --> 00:52:07,851
Whoa, whoa!

967
00:52:12,283 --> 00:52:13,445
That's no good.

968
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:25,172
So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

969
00:52:25,246 --> 00:52:27,056
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

970
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:28,810
<i>He's RSVP'd with what looks like</i>

971
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:30,855
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

972
00:52:30,927 --> 00:52:33,930
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

973
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:37,693
<i>Yeah, apparently, he travels
with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

974
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:40,418
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

975
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:50,852
Hey, can I get in?

976
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,139
At the soothing sound of the slots

977
00:52:54,209 --> 00:52:57,577
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

978
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,614
<i>Jack, for a moment,</i>

979
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,415
<i>They will think you're Hannes,
so lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

980
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,697
You trust your people implicitly.

981
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,819
You will have them
take care of everything,

982
00:53:07,891 --> 00:53:09,301
and you will wait in the car.

983
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:12,932
And eyes open, wide awake. Go.

984
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,867
Excuse me.
These people are following me.

985
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,291
You might wanna
check their pockets.

986
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:22,533
<i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

987
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:24,747
<i>and get the card to the market,
where I'll hand it off to the Eye,</i>

988
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:26,296
<i>so we can all get the hell home.</i>

989
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:48,623
Hannes, my old friend.
So glad you could make it.

990
00:53:48,695 --> 00:53:51,777
I knew you had a soft spot
for an old-school bidding war.

991
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:52,936
How have you been?

992
00:53:53,016 --> 00:53:56,657
I trust my people implicitly.
What they say goes.

993
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:59,819
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see it for yourself.

994
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:02,706
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

995
00:54:05,097 --> 00:54:07,703
Or not. Also fine.

996
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,779
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

997
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:17,701
You'll have to remove all your metal.
Watches, rings, etc.

998
00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:20,146
- Yeah, of course.
- Excuse me for asking...

999
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:22,061
Where might I have seen you before?

1000
00:54:23,378 --> 00:54:25,824
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

1001
00:54:25,899 --> 00:54:26,979
The book jacket!

1002
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,903
I have to say, Dr. Michaelakis,
I'm a huge fan.

1003
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:31,822
Oh, thank you so much.

1004
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,379
Uh, which book?
There have been so many...

1005
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,271
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1006
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:41,102
Doctor?

1007
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:47,582
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1008
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:48,822
Of course.

1009
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:55,151
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"
for all his boy toys.

1010
00:54:55,222 --> 00:54:58,272
- Yeah. He does. That's good.
- Noted.

1011
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:00,390
By the way,
I got your email, Dr. Michaelakis.

1012
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:01,988
You had a query about our ability

1013
00:55:02,063 --> 00:55:04,145
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1014
00:55:04,223 --> 00:55:08,784
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators, or error correction.

1015
00:55:08,862 --> 00:55:10,467
Do you care to elucidate?

1016
00:55:10,543 --> 00:55:11,909
- Right.
- Yeah.

1017
00:55:11,984 --> 00:55:13,952
Yes, I did send that email.

1018
00:55:14,024 --> 00:55:16,994
- The other day, I saw you.
- I did, I sent it. So what gives?

1019
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,509
I'm sorry, what gives...

1020
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,110
I think what she's trying to say...

1021
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,201
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1022
00:55:22,225 --> 00:55:23,511
Okay.

1023
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:24,824
If you'll hold on to that.

1024
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,634
- Yeah, sure, Doctor.
- Thank you.

1025
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:29,186
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1026
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:31,314
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1027
00:55:31,385 --> 00:55:35,108
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder." Disorder!

1028
00:55:35,187 --> 00:55:39,795
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1029
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,630
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1030
00:55:48,748 --> 00:55:51,796
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1031
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:54,758
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1032
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,870
Thank you.

1033
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:11,479
You know,
Buffy is not a bad name for you.

1034
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,157
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1035
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:17,087
That's good.
Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

1036
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,396
Nubile.

1037
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,600
- That's good. Thank you. Okay.
- There we go.

1038
00:56:31,832 --> 00:56:33,596
Sorry, sorry.

1039
00:56:40,673 --> 00:56:42,915
The stick's metal.
How are we going to get it out?

1040
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:44,200
Yeah. I don't know.

1041
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:47,198
This is the housing.

1042
00:56:47,274 --> 00:56:51,836
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1043
00:56:57,235 --> 00:56:59,691
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

1044
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:04,437
is the processor, which we playfully
refer to as the Magic Broomstick.

1045
00:57:04,515 --> 00:57:05,517
The Broomstick?

1046
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:09,318
Has the power to clear the contents
of any computing system on the planet

1047
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:12,048
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1048
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:14,768
Oh! Broomstick. That's funny.

1049
00:57:14,837 --> 00:57:17,601
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

1050
00:57:17,677 --> 00:57:19,999
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1051
00:57:20,077 --> 00:57:21,284
Thank you.

1052
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,043
Oh, my God.
I must be allergic to something in here.

1053
00:57:26,118 --> 00:57:28,041
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1054
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:31,328
- This room is hermetically sealed.
- That's it.

1055
00:57:31,399 --> 00:57:33,242
I'm allergic to hermetic seals.

1056
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,055
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1057
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:37,764
- That's the one thing.
- Just until he's recovered.

1058
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,410
We're gonna need some anti-bac...

1059
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,324
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1060
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,776
Your hands need to be sterile
if you intend to get any closer.

1061
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,007
Do I make myself clear?

1062
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,490
- Sorry. We couldn't...
- No, I'm fine.

1063
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,857
...take his medicine into the country.

1064
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:54,042
Yeah...

1065
00:57:57,442 --> 00:57:59,887
Can't risk any contamination.

1066
00:57:59,962 --> 00:58:02,727
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1067
00:58:02,802 --> 00:58:04,167
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1068
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:05,898
- All right. If you're done...
- Oh. Here you go.

1069
00:58:05,922 --> 00:58:07,651
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1070
00:58:07,722 --> 00:58:09,851
This happens to him sometimes.
It'll pass.

1071
00:58:09,923 --> 00:58:11,812
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

1072
00:58:11,882 --> 00:58:14,244
Well, something you could do, Doctor.

1073
00:58:33,964 --> 00:58:34,965
Okay?

1074
00:58:42,006 --> 00:58:43,007
Search him, please.

1075
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,532
Didn't we just do that?

1076
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:45,938
Are you serious?

1077
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:47,975
Okay. I wanna run
full diagnostics on the system.

1078
00:58:49,886 --> 00:58:51,776
This is completely unnecessary.

1079
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:22,536
Up, up,

1080
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,776
Okay.

1081
00:59:41,731 --> 00:59:43,861
Ah!

1082
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:46,334
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1083
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:55,505
Whoa!

1084
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:58,175
Sorry.

1085
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:17,017
Hey!

1086
01:00:17,096 --> 01:00:18,985
I can do that myself.

1087
01:00:19,057 --> 01:00:21,344
We just met, man.

1088
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:22,782
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1089
01:00:35,018 --> 01:00:36,019
Hey!

1090
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:39,659
My eyes are up here, man.

1091
01:00:39,778 --> 01:00:41,190
How do you like it?

1092
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:04,822
Hey, I'm good.

1093
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:07,543
Turn around.

1094
01:01:25,703 --> 01:01:26,944
Do you have anything?

1095
01:01:27,024 --> 01:01:28,709
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1096
01:01:30,184 --> 01:01:32,426
- I'm good.
- They're clean.

1097
01:01:33,904 --> 01:01:35,828
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1098
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:38,226
Oh, we're walking
this way again. Yay.

1099
01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:47,352
I don't speak the language.

1100
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:55,158
See?

1101
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:57,187
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1102
01:01:58,107 --> 01:02:00,634
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1103
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:20,311
Something about a big white dance floor,
makes me wanna boogie.

1104
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,670
Hey, thanks for having us.

1105
01:02:23,229 --> 01:02:25,153
That's great stuff.

1106
01:02:31,271 --> 01:02:32,511
Okay.

1107
01:02:32,591 --> 01:02:35,071
You guys are pretty serious
about your security, huh?

1108
01:02:38,512 --> 01:02:40,116
Okay.

1109
01:02:40,192 --> 01:02:43,640
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in with more stuff.

1110
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:46,364
Did I come in with more stuff?

1111
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:48,595
You don't think so?

1112
01:02:50,793 --> 01:02:53,318
Uh, sir, I think you
still have my wallet.

1113
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:56,044
Remember, I, uh, gave it
to you when I came in?

1114
01:02:56,113 --> 01:02:58,275
It would be nice to leave with it.

1115
01:03:03,114 --> 01:03:04,115
Wallet coming through.

1116
01:03:11,995 --> 01:03:13,600
Sorry, my belt.

1117
01:03:19,316 --> 01:03:20,842
Uh...

1118
01:03:20,956 --> 01:03:22,924
I guess that's everything, right?

1119
01:03:22,996 --> 01:03:24,077
Thank you.

1120
01:03:24,156 --> 01:03:26,683
- That is not a toy, Buffy.
- Sorry.

1121
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:33,488
Go, go, go!

1122
01:03:40,038 --> 01:03:41,881
All right.
Drop me off at the market

1123
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,722
so I can get this to the Eye.

1124
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:45,054
You asked me to call you
when they started

1125
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:47,161
running around like headless chickens.

1126
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:49,610
Well, that's what's happening.

1127
01:04:04,401 --> 01:04:07,052
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1128
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:10,921
No, this is where my sources said
we might find an answer.

1129
01:04:22,081 --> 01:04:23,847
She must be familiar with your work.

1130
01:04:23,923 --> 01:04:25,333
Excuse me.

1131
01:04:25,443 --> 01:04:28,607
Miss, have you seen these people?

1132
01:04:39,324 --> 01:04:41,692
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1133
01:04:41,764 --> 01:04:42,971
He's in the back.

1134
01:04:43,605 --> 01:04:44,812
What?

1135
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:46,769
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

1136
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:20,611
Ah! The Coffin to the Beyond.

1137
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:26,618
It was always a flap,
or a trap or mirrors.

1138
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:31,252
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1139
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:35,214
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1140
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:51,613
I believe that's the prototype
for the one your father had made.

1141
01:05:51,693 --> 01:05:55,015
He, like many others over the years,
ordered his supplies from here.

1142
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:58,943
Ah!
Of course.

1143
01:05:59,013 --> 01:06:02,735
That's why you gave me the look
when I said they were in Macau.

1144
01:06:02,814 --> 01:06:05,021
Your father used to come here
when you were young.

1145
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:06,822
Can I please get some space here?

1146
01:06:12,054 --> 01:06:16,105
If you think you're the only one who'd
wondered for 30 years what happened...

1147
01:06:16,534 --> 01:06:18,185
...you're not.

1148
01:06:18,255 --> 01:06:20,576
Lionel was a master magician.

1149
01:06:20,696 --> 01:06:22,185
Either he gamed the hinges,

1150
01:06:22,255 --> 01:06:25,783
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1151
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:29,703
or he had access to the lock
from the inside so he could pick it.

1152
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:34,465
Word is the safe was made
from cheap metal, and it bowed.

1153
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:40,180
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1154
01:06:40,257 --> 01:06:46,869
Unless he'd reached the limit of
his capabilities and his clock ran out.

1155
01:06:51,658 --> 01:06:56,187
Excuse me. My grandmother
has something you might want.

1156
01:06:59,939 --> 01:07:02,180
This was your father's.

1157
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:04,467
He had several of these made.

1158
01:07:23,862 --> 01:07:25,512
And the Horsemen?

1159
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:28,551
I overheard them talking.

1160
01:07:28,623 --> 01:07:33,107
One of them, Atlas, he's meeting
someone at the market nearby.

1161
01:07:50,345 --> 01:07:51,950
As for former Agent Rhodes,

1162
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,632
his location is now
your number one priority.

1163
01:07:54,706 --> 01:07:56,868
We're putting out an international APB.

1164
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:59,711
We have Interpol, including cooperation
from local authorities.

1165
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:01,027
Agent Cowan.

1166
01:08:01,107 --> 01:08:04,714
I'm assuming it was actually not you
who walked into Newburgh Federal Prison,

1167
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:07,711
then walked out 30 minutes later
with Thaddeus Bradley?

1168
01:08:07,787 --> 01:08:09,710
- What?
- He used your ID.

1169
01:08:13,787 --> 01:08:15,756
What are you doing, Rhodes?

1170
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,279
- Atlas, hey.
- Dylan.

1171
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:46,927
- I blew it, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1172
01:08:46,951 --> 01:08:48,192
I'm here to help now.

1173
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:49,607
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1174
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:50,918
I know I messed up, all right?

1175
01:08:50,992 --> 01:08:52,568
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1176
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:54,959
- Where is everybody?
- Where is everybody?

1177
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:56,728
I can't be seen with you,
actually, right now.

1178
01:08:56,752 --> 01:08:58,720
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1179
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,408
the time to take control
for a little while.

1180
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:02,169
- Hey, I'm actually... Yeah?
- Yeah, but I got it now, all right?

1181
01:09:02,193 --> 01:09:03,239
- You do?
- Yeah.

1182
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:04,729
You look like you can
get some rest, buddy.

1183
01:09:04,753 --> 01:09:07,234
- Who you meeting here?
- I'm not meeting anybody.

1184
01:09:07,313 --> 01:09:08,850
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

1185
01:09:08,874 --> 01:09:10,797
At long's?

1186
01:09:10,874 --> 01:09:13,684
Okay, yeah, no, I am, um...

1187
01:09:13,754 --> 01:09:16,156
I'm meeting somebody from the Eye.

1188
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,514
Yeah, no, they agreed to meet me

1189
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:20,559
to exchange this computer chip
for our lives back.

1190
01:09:20,635 --> 01:09:21,915
So that's what it's come to now.

1191
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:23,811
I hope you're happy
with the situation you've put us in.

1192
01:09:23,835 --> 01:09:25,360
You're talking to the Eye?

1193
01:09:25,435 --> 01:09:26,516
Yeah.

1194
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,438
Why are you talking to the Eye?

1195
01:09:29,435 --> 01:09:32,406
Atlas.
Atlas, give me the stick.

1196
01:09:32,476 --> 01:09:34,763
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

1197
01:09:34,836 --> 01:09:37,487
You're not our hero.
You're not FBI.

1198
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:40,527
You're not a magician.
You're not really anything.

1199
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:43,441
And we trusted you for a year.

1200
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:45,974
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really...

1201
01:09:45,998 --> 01:09:48,604
If you really wanna help us,
you would leave.

1202
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,327
I get it. Cool. Bye.

1203
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:19,207
Hello, hello!

1204
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:22,092
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1205
01:10:22,561 --> 01:10:25,531
So much fun though, knowing you'd be
scurrying away from me at the lab

1206
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,047
just to bring it to me here.

1207
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,772
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

1208
01:10:28,842 --> 01:10:31,527
- How did you do that?
- Everyone has their button.

1209
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:35,608
You push it and they go blind.
And yours, obviously, is ego.

1210
01:10:35,683 --> 01:10:37,173
"Stay the course.

1211
01:10:37,243 --> 01:10:40,008
<i>Great changes are in store.</i>

1212
01:10:40,084 --> 01:10:42,609
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

1213
01:10:42,683 --> 01:10:44,254
will not go unrecognized."

1214
01:10:45,524 --> 01:10:46,969
- That was you.
- Yeah.

1215
01:10:47,044 --> 01:10:48,569
Merritt downloaded all the files,

1216
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,375
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1217
01:10:51,444 --> 01:10:52,525
Your phone.

1218
01:10:54,444 --> 01:10:56,413
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1219
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,648
What you actually put your phone on
was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1220
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:05,375
Once again,
science beats magic.

1221
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:08,134
- So, the stick?
- No.

1222
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:12,248
I got it!

1223
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:13,772
I got it. I got it.

1224
01:11:15,807 --> 01:11:17,696
- Fuck, Dylan!
- Wait, leave them!

1225
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:19,264
You really think
I'm gonna walk away from you?

1226
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:21,370
Give me the stick!

1227
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:22,569
Give me it!

1228
01:11:22,648 --> 01:11:25,618
All right.
Don't ever question me again. Beat it!

1229
01:11:36,449 --> 01:11:38,930
- So, the stick.
- Go to hell.

1230
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:40,771
Boys.

1231
01:11:53,251 --> 01:11:55,175
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1232
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,904
There's like 10 of you.

1233
01:12:12,973 --> 01:12:14,782
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1234
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:16,742
He's there! Go!

1235
01:13:05,419 --> 01:13:06,500
Oh...

1236
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:45,104
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

1237
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:48,751
- Doesn't work on me.
- Not even as a distraction?

1238
01:13:51,464 --> 01:13:54,070
- Good job.
- Nice to be involved.

1239
01:14:02,345 --> 01:14:04,394
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1240
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:07,162
- I just saw Dylan, something happened.
- What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

1241
01:14:07,186 --> 01:14:09,234
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1242
01:14:09,306 --> 01:14:11,786
- Atlas.
- I don't know.

1243
01:14:16,626 --> 01:14:17,787
What are they doing?

1244
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:20,313
Those are Walter's men.

1245
01:14:20,387 --> 01:14:23,437
This is what they want.

1246
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:25,714
What the hell?
How do you still have that?

1247
01:14:30,668 --> 01:14:32,478
Whoa. That's Lionel Shrike's safe.

1248
01:14:32,549 --> 01:14:35,074
What the hell
do they want with that?

1249
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:36,912
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1250
01:14:36,989 --> 01:14:40,311
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1251
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:45,949
What do you want?

1252
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:50,672
You to understand something
very important.

1253
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,993
We are mirror images.

1254
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,402
You see, because like you,

1255
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:57,711
I share a very deep connection
with my father.

1256
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:04,032
And like you, I'll stop at nothing
to avenge any wrongs done to him.

1257
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:12,274
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1258
01:15:12,353 --> 01:15:14,242
Mine's still alive.

1259
01:15:14,953 --> 01:15:16,159
Get him up.

1260
01:15:29,674 --> 01:15:33,999
So, this is the man

1261
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:37,158
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1262
01:15:39,155 --> 01:15:41,477
I wouldn't have known your face

1263
01:15:41,556 --> 01:15:45,038
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1264
01:15:45,116 --> 01:15:48,802
But you have spent, what,
30 years thinking about mine?

1265
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:50,163
When my father died,

1266
01:15:50,237 --> 01:15:52,365
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1267
01:15:52,437 --> 01:15:53,813
- I wouldn't even have known...
- She died a pauper!

1268
01:15:53,837 --> 01:15:55,681
...who your mother was.

1269
01:15:55,757 --> 01:16:00,366
She was a digit, a nanobyte
in a stream of data.

1270
01:16:00,438 --> 01:16:02,406
Because nothing is personal to you

1271
01:16:02,478 --> 01:16:04,814
and everyone and everything
is just a number, isn't that so?

1272
01:16:04,838 --> 01:16:07,445
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1273
01:16:07,519 --> 01:16:12,446
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1274
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:15,563
- My son...
- Yeah, the sociopath.

1275
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:20,202
Funny thing is, I have seven
so-called legitimate children.

1276
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,329
Sniveling, snobbish, stupid runts.

1277
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,372
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1278
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:29,807
The point is,
he wants something,

1279
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:35,047
and like any good parent, I will
stop at nothing to get it for him.

1280
01:16:35,121 --> 01:16:36,850
Your Horsemen have it.

1281
01:16:36,961 --> 01:16:41,251
You will turn it and them
over to us, now.

1282
01:16:41,322 --> 01:16:42,403
No.

1283
01:16:46,162 --> 01:16:48,928
Dylan, I would like you
to really take this moment in

1284
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:52,405
because this is the consequence
of your personal vendetta come to life

1285
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,247
and staring you in the face.

1286
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:56,087
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1287
01:16:56,164 --> 01:16:57,211
we're not going to stop.

1288
01:16:57,284 --> 01:16:59,412
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1289
01:16:59,484 --> 01:17:01,692
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1290
01:17:01,764 --> 01:17:03,654
Now then, cast your mind back

1291
01:17:03,725 --> 01:17:06,853
to standing by the banks of the river
watching your father descend,

1292
01:17:06,924 --> 01:17:08,927
disgraced and discredited.

1293
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:11,771
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1294
01:17:12,526 --> 01:17:15,813
I felt that same thing two years ago

1295
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:19,015
as you drained not just my father's
fortune, but his dignity!

1296
01:17:19,566 --> 01:17:21,569
And yet you took pleasure from it.

1297
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:27,013
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1298
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:56,253
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh. Thank you.

1299
01:18:11,971 --> 01:18:14,259
- You ready?
- Over to you.

1300
01:18:21,253 --> 01:18:22,300
Splash!

1301
01:18:25,854 --> 01:18:27,218
Job done!

1302
01:18:42,856 --> 01:18:46,257
Hell is going to
seem like a day at the spa

1303
01:18:46,335 --> 01:18:48,816
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1304
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:51,547
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

1305
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:10,825
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1306
01:19:13,418 --> 01:19:15,820
Always keep something up my sleeve.

1307
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:37,677
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1308
01:20:37,748 --> 01:20:41,833
one speck of remorse,
but I can't.

1309
01:20:41,908 --> 01:20:48,359
So I'll stick to the business at hand
and try not to smile too broadly.

1310
01:20:48,428 --> 01:20:53,754
And, uh, thank you for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1311
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,278
I take it it's done.

1312
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,558
Literally hit the bottom.

1313
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:05,920
- Now, where are the Horsemen?
- They're performers.

1314
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:11,555
Their pride, their ego, their need
to be adored are all too powerful

1315
01:21:11,631 --> 01:21:13,520
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1316
01:21:13,591 --> 01:21:19,075
If they don't make themselves known,
you will find yourself

1317
01:21:19,191 --> 01:21:23,163
in a very similar position
to Mr. Rhodes.

1318
01:21:23,232 --> 01:21:27,078
- Are we clear about that?
- As clear as the water he's under.

1319
01:21:34,553 --> 01:21:38,114
You'll have the rest
when I have the Horsemen.

1320
01:22:10,397 --> 01:22:11,444
Dylan!

1321
01:22:12,918 --> 01:22:15,238
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1322
01:22:15,318 --> 01:22:16,524
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

1323
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,680
Dylan, come on!

1324
01:22:22,959 --> 01:22:25,690
You're okay.

1325
01:22:25,759 --> 01:22:28,444
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1326
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:32,166
- Are you all right, bro?
- Okay!

1327
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,207
- Thank you!
- This is the least I could do.

1328
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,256
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1329
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,611
That was not an option.

1330
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,569
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

1331
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,483
You really did, man.

1332
01:22:44,281 --> 01:22:45,965
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

1333
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,286
Yeah.

1334
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:50,489
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1335
01:22:50,562 --> 01:22:52,803
Literally, in my case,
I was just standing on the shore

1336
01:22:52,882 --> 01:22:54,258
while Atlas jumped down and got you.

1337
01:22:54,282 --> 01:22:55,807
I'm serious.

1338
01:22:56,402 --> 01:22:58,291
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1339
01:22:58,362 --> 01:23:00,092
- What's wrong?
- What?

1340
01:23:01,683 --> 01:23:04,004
- It's fake.
- What?

1341
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:07,288
No, I had the stick.

1342
01:23:07,363 --> 01:23:10,015
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand,

1343
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:12,610
in the lab, and then I put it in
the little case thing.

1344
01:23:12,684 --> 01:23:14,860
- And I gave it to Atlas.
- Right, which I then gave to Dylan.

1345
01:23:14,884 --> 01:23:17,410
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1346
01:23:17,484 --> 01:23:20,853
No, I took it from you
and then slipped it back in your coat

1347
01:23:20,925 --> 01:23:22,689
when I pushed you out.

1348
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,975
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

1349
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:28,652
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us
as if we do have something.

1350
01:23:28,726 --> 01:23:32,094
No. Okay. I agree that somebody
got the better of us. Okay? Somehow.

1351
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:34,567
But I don't agree
that we have a sack full of nada.

1352
01:23:34,646 --> 01:23:37,810
Because we're all here.
That's a sack full of something.

1353
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:45,497
Listen, we all know that Walter is not
going to stop until he gets that chip.

1354
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:49,129
And we're the only ones
that even know that he's alive.

1355
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:53,816
We can't just walk away.
That's not what the Horsemen do.

1356
01:23:56,609 --> 01:23:58,418
There's a quote. Um...

1357
01:23:58,489 --> 01:23:59,900
It's actually by the magician

1358
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:01,769
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1359
01:24:01,809 --> 01:24:03,732
It's, uh...

1360
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:10,500
"A magician's greatest power lies
forever shrouded in his empty fist."

1361
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,892
"And the very idea
that he can convince the world

1362
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:16,134
that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1363
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:19,055
- That's Lionel Shrike.
- Right.

1364
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:21,427
So what are you saying?

1365
01:24:21,451 --> 01:24:24,661
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1366
01:24:27,732 --> 01:24:31,135
- What is Walter's greatest fear?
- Being seen.

1367
01:24:31,213 --> 01:24:35,218
- And what does the stick do?
- The stick can unencode anything.

1368
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:40,221
It can open up a back door
into any computer on the planet.

1369
01:24:40,293 --> 01:24:42,295
- Including his.
- Yeah.

1370
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:46,380
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1371
01:24:46,454 --> 01:24:50,539
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1372
01:24:50,614 --> 01:24:53,983
We need a plan.
But we don't have time.

1373
01:24:54,095 --> 01:24:57,542
We have each other
and there are five of us.

1374
01:24:57,615 --> 01:25:00,539
But we also need supplies, right?
And resources.

1375
01:25:00,615 --> 01:25:03,904
And probably more than five people.

1376
01:25:03,976 --> 01:25:07,867
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1377
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,702
Oh, she speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1378
01:25:10,777 --> 01:25:16,182
Do you know why the Fool is
the most powerful card in the tarot?

1379
01:25:16,258 --> 01:25:19,899
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1380
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:24,427
He's a fool because he's a clean slate,

1381
01:25:24,498 --> 01:25:28,423
and, therefore, can become anything.

1382
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:29,785
You were chosen.

1383
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:32,388
All of you.

1384
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:37,670
Not because of who you are,
but because of who you might become.

1385
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,146
When you say "chosen"...
Are you part of the Eye?

1386
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:47,271
Yes. We are part of the Eye.

1387
01:25:47,341 --> 01:25:50,550
You've each doubted our existence.

1388
01:25:51,381 --> 01:25:55,705
Wondering if we,
indeed, were watching.

1389
01:25:59,302 --> 01:26:02,943
We are.
We always have been.

1390
01:26:03,022 --> 01:26:05,548
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1391
01:26:05,622 --> 01:26:07,830
- You know what she's saying, right?
- Yes.

1392
01:26:07,903 --> 01:26:10,304
That now we have
resources and help.

1393
01:26:12,103 --> 01:26:13,468
Thank you.

1394
01:26:15,944 --> 01:26:17,628
So, who's in?

1395
01:26:21,424 --> 01:26:24,031
- I'm in.
- Yeah, I'm in.

1396
01:26:26,865 --> 01:26:27,866
Let's do this.

1397
01:26:45,586 --> 01:26:47,271
No, no, no.

1398
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:52,036
<i>Not long ago, we were tricked.</i>

1399
01:26:52,108 --> 01:26:55,032
<i>I was exposed
and brought back from the dead.</i>

1400
01:26:55,108 --> 01:26:57,952
<i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

1401
01:26:58,028 --> 01:27:02,398
<i>- to the person who did it to us.
- Midnight, New Year's Eve. London.</i>

1402
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:05,712
<i>We will be performing a series of shows
that all connect to our big finale,</i>

1403
01:27:05,789 --> 01:27:07,951
<i>so pay close attention to each trick.</i>

1404
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:09,110
Get my father.

1405
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:12,351
Run!

1406
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,593
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1407
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:16,950
What do we know about Rhodes?

1408
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:18,873
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1409
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:20,077
Let's get to the airport.

1410
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:22,606
<i>So leave your kiddies
at home and get ready for a wild night,</i>

1411
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:25,714
<i>because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

1412
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:27,600
Let's move, everyone!

1413
01:27:27,671 --> 01:27:29,607
<i>In front of
the largest stage in the world...</i>

1414
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,554
<i>The actual world.</i>

1415
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:35,399
You know they're playing you, right?
Leading you into a trap?

1416
01:27:35,472 --> 01:27:37,122
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1417
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:39,884
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

1418
01:27:39,953 --> 01:27:42,194
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1419
01:27:42,273 --> 01:27:43,763
Me. Everything we've done.

1420
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,881
Is it real, Mr. McKinney?

1421
01:27:53,274 --> 01:27:54,514
The threat is real.

1422
01:27:54,594 --> 01:27:56,881
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1423
01:27:56,954 --> 01:27:59,322
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1424
01:28:08,036 --> 01:28:09,611
<i>We are here in London</i>

1425
01:28:09,635 --> 01:28:12,116
<i>on this New Year's Eve,
and the crowds are out in force.</i>

1426
01:28:12,196 --> 01:28:13,732
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

1427
01:28:13,756 --> 01:28:15,884
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

1428
01:28:15,956 --> 01:28:17,933
<i>A video gone viral from the infamous</i>

1429
01:28:17,957 --> 01:28:19,800
<i>Horsemen magicians has surfaced.</i>

1430
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:21,613
<i>They promise
to make a grand reappearance.</i>

1431
01:28:21,637 --> 01:28:24,720
<i>But will it end in
their arrest on national television?</i>

1432
01:28:24,797 --> 01:28:26,482
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1433
01:28:26,557 --> 01:28:28,639
<i>Who knows where they'll show up...</i>

1434
01:28:28,718 --> 01:28:30,174
<i>But we do know, wherever,</i>

1435
01:28:30,198 --> 01:28:33,328
<i>whenever that is,
people will be watching.</i>

1436
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:36,962
Yeah, texts, tweets, Instagrams.

1437
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:40,009
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1438
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:41,763
tag them and bundle them.

1439
01:28:41,839 --> 01:28:44,207
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

1440
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,441
Whoever you want.

1441
01:28:45,559 --> 01:28:47,440
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1442
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,616
Anyone who wants to work
stationed throughout the city,

1443
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,450
so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1444
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:08,009
Hello! Hey!

1445
01:29:09,962 --> 01:29:11,726
My name's Jack Wilder.

1446
01:29:12,563 --> 01:29:14,531
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

1447
01:29:14,602 --> 01:29:18,210
All right, gather around. Indulge me.

1448
01:29:18,283 --> 01:29:20,491
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1449
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:24,455
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1450
01:29:24,524 --> 01:29:28,848
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

1451
01:29:28,924 --> 01:29:31,814
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1452
01:29:31,884 --> 01:29:33,853
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1453
01:29:36,325 --> 01:29:40,456
While we're at it,
let's find ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1454
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,449
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1455
01:29:45,766 --> 01:29:48,133
Don't worry. I promise you
there's a 50 percent chance

1456
01:29:48,206 --> 01:29:49,543
you'll get her back after the show.

1457
01:29:49,567 --> 01:29:51,376
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1458
01:29:51,447 --> 01:29:54,974
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1459
01:29:55,047 --> 01:29:56,333
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1460
01:29:56,408 --> 01:30:00,174
I know how these guys work now.
They're gonna start with a tease.

1461
01:30:00,248 --> 01:30:02,216
A few little pop-ups.

1462
01:30:02,288 --> 01:30:05,178
<i>Something to lure you in. Like...</i>

1463
01:30:05,248 --> 01:30:09,379
Well, you know, like Three Card Monte,
where the guy goes,

1464
01:30:09,449 --> 01:30:12,020
"Looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

1465
01:30:12,089 --> 01:30:16,014
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

1466
01:30:16,089 --> 01:30:18,172
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

1467
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:22,255
is the inside of your own colon,
with the words

1468
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:25,254
<i>"Horsemen" written all over it.</i>

1469
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,541
In blood.

1470
01:30:27,611 --> 01:30:31,093
We get the picture, Mr. McKinney.

1471
01:30:31,171 --> 01:30:33,219
And get out of my chair.

1472
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:35,499
Hello, everybody!

1473
01:30:35,572 --> 01:30:37,540
Come close, come on!

1474
01:30:37,612 --> 01:30:39,535
All right, all right, so listen.

1475
01:30:39,612 --> 01:30:45,096
Tonight, I am going to make
something fly using actual magic.

1476
01:30:45,172 --> 01:30:46,936
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1477
01:30:47,013 --> 01:30:50,062
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1478
01:30:50,133 --> 01:30:54,503
I'm gonna make it fly over there
and land on the Thames.

1479
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,417
Can you handle that?

1480
01:30:56,494 --> 01:30:58,019
Same rules apply as before.

1481
01:30:58,094 --> 01:31:00,176
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1482
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,620
It's as simple as that.

1483
01:31:01,694 --> 01:31:03,424
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

1484
01:31:03,495 --> 01:31:04,939
Dad, look at this.

1485
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:07,671
Tag this one.
Where does it come from?

1486
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,823
Near the river.
Looks like the shows are starting.

1487
01:31:09,895 --> 01:31:11,472
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1488
01:31:11,496 --> 01:31:13,135
- What do you mean?
- It's on Channel One.

1489
01:31:21,377 --> 01:31:22,633
- Let's go to 2.
- Here we go.

1490
01:31:22,657 --> 01:31:25,263
Got him. We have a location.

1491
01:31:25,337 --> 01:31:27,305
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1492
01:31:27,377 --> 01:31:29,345
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1493
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,146
Typing in grid coordinates now.

1494
01:31:32,937 --> 01:31:35,589
Turn around.
Hide yourselves with the cards.

1495
01:31:36,218 --> 01:31:39,427
And here we go. Switch!

1496
01:31:40,898 --> 01:31:43,075
You guys still have your eye on her?
You want me to go back and do it?

1497
01:31:43,099 --> 01:31:46,182
Okay, all right. I'm moving on.
And switch.

1498
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:49,226
Where is she?

1499
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,628
Down at the end?
You sure?

1500
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:55,510
All right, can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

1501
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,503
Thank you very much.

1502
01:31:58,741 --> 01:32:00,266
Uh-oh.

1503
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,147
Uh-oh.

1504
01:32:03,421 --> 01:32:05,901
There's my girl.

1505
01:32:05,981 --> 01:32:08,588
Not my girl, 100 percent your girl.

1506
01:32:08,702 --> 01:32:10,032
But just in this situation.

1507
01:32:10,101 --> 01:32:12,753
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1508
01:32:12,821 --> 01:32:16,714
So, uh, let me just
make something small fly, like...

1509
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:18,910
Fly, fly, fly!

1510
01:32:18,982 --> 01:32:22,385
Wow, right? Look at that!
Aw. Come on, people.

1511
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:25,393
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1512
01:32:25,463 --> 01:32:26,590
- Me?
- Check your fly.

1513
01:32:29,464 --> 01:32:31,705
You like that?

1514
01:32:31,784 --> 01:32:33,673
You support that relationship?

1515
01:32:33,745 --> 01:32:36,635
That guy had a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

1516
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,401
<i>Copy that.
We've got two sightings reported.</i>

1517
01:32:42,425 --> 01:32:45,349
<i>- Heading to Greenwich Market.</i>
- Get me Thaddeus.

1518
01:32:45,425 --> 01:32:47,713
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

1519
01:32:47,825 --> 01:32:50,909
Let 'em move.
That's what the Horsemen want.

1520
01:32:50,986 --> 01:32:52,723
Well, what if they get there first?
That can't happen.

1521
01:32:52,747 --> 01:32:54,874
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1522
01:32:54,946 --> 01:32:56,152
Find the pattern.

1523
01:32:57,106 --> 01:33:00,077
You do that, and you'll be able
to cut them off

1524
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:02,548
<i>before they get to their final trick.</i>

1525
01:33:02,628 --> 01:33:06,349
If it makes you feel better,
I'll take care of the FBI.

1526
01:33:19,629 --> 01:33:22,075
OK, well, I guess you found me!

1527
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:23,720
We've got a third spot.

1528
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:26,316
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1529
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:33,757
Urn... Give me two, 13 and 21.

1530
01:33:34,831 --> 01:33:37,721
What the hell is that?
Freeze that and zoom in.

1531
01:33:39,832 --> 01:33:42,597
How the hell did this happen?

1532
01:33:42,712 --> 01:33:45,841
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1533
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:48,438
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1534
01:33:48,512 --> 01:33:49,568
what are we gonna do about it?

1535
01:33:49,592 --> 01:33:51,356
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1536
01:33:51,433 --> 01:33:52,514
Where's my coat?

1537
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:55,324
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1538
01:33:55,393 --> 01:33:56,953
Oh, I know
where they're going.

1539
01:33:56,993 --> 01:33:59,600
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1540
01:33:59,674 --> 01:34:01,084
Chase, you need
to get to him

1541
01:34:01,153 --> 01:34:03,394
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1542
01:34:08,994 --> 01:34:12,636
I have a confession to make. I've been
told I have some control issues.

1543
01:34:12,755 --> 01:34:16,077
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1544
01:34:16,155 --> 01:34:20,080
so I'm gonna try to control something
that's a lot easier than people.

1545
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:21,596
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1546
01:34:21,636 --> 01:34:24,401
Yeah, rain, um...

1547
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:27,613
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1548
01:34:27,637 --> 01:34:30,402
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

1549
01:34:30,477 --> 01:34:32,764
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1550
01:34:32,837 --> 01:34:35,728
I'm not just gonna make it clear up.
No, no, no.

1551
01:34:35,798 --> 01:34:37,880
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1552
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,408
And can God do that?
Mmm. No, I don't think so.

1553
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:56,847
Or what about make it go up?

1554
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,523
Are you still with me?

1555
01:35:06,601 --> 01:35:09,650
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it. Turn around.

1556
01:35:13,001 --> 01:35:14,127
Switch!

1557
01:35:17,842 --> 01:35:19,002
Show me the lady.

1558
01:35:19,081 --> 01:35:21,893
Show me the lady!

1559
01:35:21,963 --> 01:35:23,168
The end? End?

1560
01:35:25,643 --> 01:35:27,803
You know what?
I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

1561
01:35:28,763 --> 01:35:31,893
It's just because I can actually feel
that you guys are paying attention.

1562
01:35:31,964 --> 01:35:33,567
It's just that...

1563
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:37,090
You know, it's unfortunate
that it's the wrong kind of attention.

1564
01:35:38,324 --> 01:35:40,804
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1565
01:35:42,004 --> 01:35:45,087
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1566
01:35:45,164 --> 01:35:47,930
Let's kill him, right?

1567
01:35:48,005 --> 01:35:51,977
- Merritt, move into position.
- Got it, Dylan.

1568
01:35:52,045 --> 01:35:53,730
Uh, I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1569
01:35:53,806 --> 01:35:56,172
Lula, stand by, all right?

1570
01:35:56,286 --> 01:35:58,607
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1571
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:10,613
<i>Reports are
coming in from all over London</i>

1572
01:36:10,688 --> 01:36:14,295
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

1573
01:36:17,328 --> 01:36:21,015
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1574
01:36:21,088 --> 01:36:22,425
- Please, bro, don't do this.
- Where are you headed?

1575
01:36:22,449 --> 01:36:24,258
North, south, east?

1576
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:26,654
East. Tower of London?

1577
01:36:26,729 --> 01:36:29,494
Tower Bridge?
Near Tower Bridge? The Thames!

1578
01:36:29,569 --> 01:36:34,097
You're going to
the Thamesy-Whemsy! You're so easy!

1579
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:36,821
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1580
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:39,291
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1581
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:43,170
South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich.

1582
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:46,859
I know where you're going.
I know where...

1583
01:36:48,211 --> 01:36:49,577
Watch it, hobo.

1584
01:36:52,492 --> 01:36:55,019
Hey, Merritt. Oh, come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1585
01:36:56,813 --> 01:36:58,177
When?

1586
01:36:58,252 --> 01:37:00,904
Shit. All right. All right, I got it.

1587
01:37:00,973 --> 01:37:03,021
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1588
01:37:05,974 --> 01:37:07,658
Sorry. Just...

1589
01:37:10,293 --> 01:37:11,470
What? I just told you...

1590
01:37:11,494 --> 01:37:12,495
Phone call.

1591
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:14,976
- Hello?
<i>- Lula.</i>

1592
01:37:15,055 --> 01:37:18,422
Dylan. Ah, yeah, kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1593
01:37:18,495 --> 01:37:21,066
<i>Wrap it up.
Meet me at the rendezvous point now.</i>

1594
01:37:21,134 --> 01:37:22,421
- What?
<i>- Now!</i>

1595
01:37:23,096 --> 01:37:25,064
Was that an act of God?

1596
01:37:25,175 --> 01:37:28,258
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1597
01:37:28,335 --> 01:37:31,499
And the strobe lights
and rain machines.

1598
01:37:31,576 --> 01:37:33,499
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1599
01:37:33,576 --> 01:37:35,937
Because you're gonna need to know
all of that for the final.

1600
01:37:39,337 --> 01:37:42,420
So how did I do it?
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1601
01:37:42,497 --> 01:37:44,819
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1602
01:37:44,898 --> 01:37:45,945
<i>Wham Jack, go now!</i>

1603
01:37:46,018 --> 01:37:47,114
You know what?
I hate to say it.

1604
01:37:47,138 --> 01:37:48,938
You're gonna have to wait to find out.
I know.

1605
01:37:48,978 --> 01:37:51,379
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1606
01:37:54,819 --> 01:37:55,900
<i>Lula, go!</i>

1607
01:37:55,979 --> 01:37:58,061
I have to go.

1608
01:38:16,941 --> 01:38:21,152
Out of the way, FBI!
Move, move, move! Go!

1609
01:38:21,221 --> 01:38:22,951
Get some men in that park!

1610
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:24,148
Men in the park, now!

1611
01:38:24,221 --> 01:38:26,350
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

1612
01:38:26,422 --> 01:38:29,074
Or save room for
the main course?

1613
01:38:29,143 --> 01:38:30,952
Where the hell
are the Horsemen?

1614
01:38:31,023 --> 01:38:32,262
You can chase them
all you want,

1615
01:38:32,342 --> 01:38:34,823
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1616
01:38:35,823 --> 01:38:38,633
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1617
01:38:38,703 --> 01:38:40,273
So, what's it gonna be?

1618
01:38:40,383 --> 01:38:41,509
Chase them?

1619
01:38:42,503 --> 01:38:43,869
Or make a deal with me?

1620
01:38:50,344 --> 01:38:52,154
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1621
01:38:52,224 --> 01:38:54,041
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1622
01:38:54,065 --> 01:38:55,601
- Where's Merritt?
- Fine. I don't know.

1623
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:56,626
I'm here.

1624
01:38:56,705 --> 01:38:58,514
- Where's Lula?
- I'm right here!

1625
01:38:58,585 --> 01:39:00,474
What the hell happened?

1626
01:39:00,545 --> 01:39:02,482
- My goddamn brother happened.
- Don't worry about it.

1627
01:39:02,506 --> 01:39:03,996
We just gotta get to the destination.

1628
01:39:04,066 --> 01:39:06,043
- Lula, can you handle that thing?
- I can ride it.

1629
01:39:06,067 --> 01:39:08,069
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1630
01:39:08,147 --> 01:39:09,386
- Yeah, good point.
- Let's go!

1631
01:39:09,466 --> 01:39:10,547
No, Jack.

1632
01:39:15,228 --> 01:39:16,229
Shit!

1633
01:39:19,188 --> 01:39:20,668
Jack's down. We gotta get him.

1634
01:39:23,988 --> 01:39:25,036
Come on, move!

1635
01:39:30,509 --> 01:39:32,750
- Jack! Go, go!
- That's the brake.

1636
01:39:32,829 --> 01:39:34,433
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1637
01:39:34,509 --> 01:39:36,194
Come on, follow me!

1638
01:39:37,469 --> 01:39:38,470
That's it?

1639
01:39:55,112 --> 01:39:56,716
- Hey, ready?
- Yeah!

1640
01:40:03,552 --> 01:40:04,884
Get on.

1641
01:40:08,713 --> 01:40:10,841
- Yeah!
- Okay, guys, I'm coming!

1642
01:40:10,913 --> 01:40:13,235
Whoa! Jesus!

1643
01:40:14,673 --> 01:40:16,437
I'm coming!

1644
01:40:24,554 --> 01:40:26,397
- Get up! Come on!
- Okay.

1645
01:40:27,795 --> 01:40:29,001
You got me.

1646
01:40:29,075 --> 01:40:31,238
Those things are really dangerous!

1647
01:40:32,996 --> 01:40:35,203
- Come on!
- Go!

1648
01:40:36,996 --> 01:40:39,159
Get him in! Move it!

1649
01:40:43,596 --> 01:40:45,247
What is happening?

1650
01:40:45,356 --> 01:40:47,598
Where are they?

1651
01:40:47,677 --> 01:40:49,679
They should be
arriving any second.

1652
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:53,403
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1653
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:04,488
Ah!

1654
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,080
Okay, feeling fear.

1655
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:11,125
Fear. Anger, anger.

1656
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,844
- Oh, full house!
- That's enough.

1657
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:17,851
I was done.

1658
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,886
So nice to see you all again.

1659
01:41:22,961 --> 01:41:28,491
But since we're such old friends,
let's skip the formalities.

1660
01:41:29,481 --> 01:41:34,249
One of you
has something we require.

1661
01:41:35,882 --> 01:41:37,532
So give it over.

1662
01:41:45,723 --> 01:41:48,011
Nothing at all?

1663
01:41:49,244 --> 01:41:51,690
Really?

1664
01:41:53,484 --> 01:41:54,895
Sit down!

1665
01:42:02,085 --> 01:42:03,530
Let's go, let's go!

1666
01:42:04,765 --> 01:42:06,097
Let's go, let's go!

1667
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:08,772
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1668
01:42:08,846 --> 01:42:10,007
Get those lights off me!

1669
01:42:15,806 --> 01:42:17,377
Get on the plane!

1670
01:42:19,407 --> 01:42:21,569
Ow! Hey!

1671
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:25,248
Get on the plane!

1672
01:42:34,848 --> 01:42:36,089
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

1673
01:42:36,169 --> 01:42:38,058
Yeah, uh, take off immediately.

1674
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:44,101
You know, you make it almost too easy?

1675
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:47,856
I mean, even your hilarious attempts
to make yourselves unpredictable,

1676
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:49,773
just follow the same pattern each time.

1677
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,852
Set up, set up, set up.

1678
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,171
Big reveal.

1679
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:55,651
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1680
01:42:55,731 --> 01:42:58,463
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1681
01:43:03,372 --> 01:43:07,172
Well, there will be a big reveal,
and it will come now.

1682
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:12,016
The stick, dear boy.

1683
01:43:12,572 --> 01:43:13,859
- No.
- Fine.

1684
01:43:14,413 --> 01:43:16,620
Start with her.

1685
01:43:16,693 --> 01:43:19,014
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

1686
01:43:21,214 --> 01:43:24,616
- Give it to him.
- Danny, give him the card.

1687
01:43:24,694 --> 01:43:26,537
- Just give it to him.
- Danny, come on.

1688
01:43:36,575 --> 01:43:37,701
We'll have a closer look.

1689
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,145
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1690
01:43:48,217 --> 01:43:50,504
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1691
01:43:50,576 --> 01:43:52,233
- This is the both of us.
- Okay, it's the both of us.

1692
01:43:52,257 --> 01:43:53,747
- Guys, come on!
- Come on, stop!

1693
01:43:53,817 --> 01:43:56,627
- You, to save your little girlfriend!
- To save my...

1694
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:58,985
- He had a knife to her head!
- I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1695
01:43:59,058 --> 01:44:00,553
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1696
01:44:00,577 --> 01:44:02,023
And you, what's your deal, man?

1697
01:44:02,098 --> 01:44:04,226
Look, they're not gonna get blood
all over the seats.

1698
01:44:04,298 --> 01:44:05,994
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1699
01:44:06,018 --> 01:44:07,355
- Really?
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

1700
01:44:07,379 --> 01:44:09,507
but I just have to
say congratulations.

1701
01:44:09,578 --> 01:44:10,785
And thank you!

1702
01:44:12,339 --> 01:44:13,579
It's real.

1703
01:44:13,659 --> 01:44:15,070
What?

1704
01:44:15,139 --> 01:44:16,664
It's real?

1705
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,427
Bring them through.

1706
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,580
Did you say it's real?

1707
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:21,716
What is he talking about?

1708
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:22,946
Move!

1709
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:24,546
Well done, my boy.

1710
01:44:28,421 --> 01:44:30,822
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1711
01:44:30,901 --> 01:44:35,031
It's the most expensive bottle on Earth.

1712
01:44:35,941 --> 01:44:38,070
$1.2 million.

1713
01:44:38,142 --> 01:44:42,147
And I saved it just for this occasion.

1714
01:44:42,222 --> 01:44:46,467
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1715
01:44:46,543 --> 01:44:49,672
Hey. You got what you wanted.

1716
01:44:49,743 --> 01:44:52,269
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1717
01:44:52,344 --> 01:44:55,268
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1718
01:44:55,344 --> 01:44:59,030
- You sure?
- Chase, what shall we do?

1719
01:45:00,824 --> 01:45:02,986
Toss them out.

1720
01:45:03,064 --> 01:45:05,635
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1721
01:45:07,585 --> 01:45:11,032
- No! Come on! No!
- Farewell.

1722
01:45:11,386 --> 01:45:13,593
Oh, God! No!

1723
01:45:14,865 --> 01:45:17,267
Wait! I just wanna say...

1724
01:45:17,346 --> 01:45:19,588
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1725
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:21,635
but I'm leaving with the right one.

1726
01:45:21,706 --> 01:45:23,277
I love you guys!

1727
01:45:23,347 --> 01:45:24,394
- No!
- No, no, no!

1728
01:45:26,227 --> 01:45:28,673
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1729
01:45:28,747 --> 01:45:29,828
No!

1730
01:45:31,348 --> 01:45:32,712
Who's next?

1731
01:45:38,868 --> 01:45:40,711
No, wait! Let me go!

1732
01:45:40,788 --> 01:45:43,110
Let go of me!

1733
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:45,510
No, no, no!

1734
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,273
- Let me go!
- Toss her!

1735
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:52,594
Oh, God!

1736
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:55,675
Hurry up and shut that door!
It's getting cold in here.

1737
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:57,674
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1738
01:46:03,311 --> 01:46:04,437
No, no, no!

1739
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:08,112
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1740
01:46:11,912 --> 01:46:12,913
Oh, that was fun!

1741
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:18,796
Cheers! Well done, my boy.

1742
01:46:23,313 --> 01:46:24,645
Um...

1743
01:46:24,713 --> 01:46:26,875
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

1744
01:46:26,993 --> 01:46:28,484
No, it is not.

1745
01:46:48,316 --> 01:46:49,886
What the hell is going on?

1746
01:46:59,877 --> 01:47:02,118
Okay, come pick them up!

1747
01:47:02,837 --> 01:47:04,567
- Come on.
- Come on out.

1748
01:47:17,838 --> 01:47:21,686
<i>Ladies and gentlemen... The Horsemen!</i>

1749
01:47:42,041 --> 01:47:44,283
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

1750
01:47:44,402 --> 01:47:47,929
<i>You predicted it correctly.
The Thames, stroke of midnight.</i>

1751
01:47:48,002 --> 01:47:49,811
<i>New Year's Eve. Happy New Year!</i>

1752
01:47:56,843 --> 01:47:58,129
Unbelievable!

1753
01:47:58,203 --> 01:47:59,580
- We are moving now.
- The whole thing just changed.

1754
01:47:59,604 --> 01:48:02,369
- All backup into position stat!
- We're on the move.

1755
01:48:03,843 --> 01:48:06,085
- You're staying here!
- Of course.

1756
01:48:13,445 --> 01:48:15,288
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1757
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:17,607
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

1758
01:48:17,686 --> 01:48:21,974
We would like to acknowledge not just
our old friend, Arthur Tressler.

1759
01:48:22,046 --> 01:48:24,617
But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.

1760
01:48:24,686 --> 01:48:27,087
Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion

1761
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:28,817
even we have ever seen.

1762
01:48:28,886 --> 01:48:33,097
He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!

1763
01:48:33,207 --> 01:48:35,814
But before he did that,

1764
01:48:35,887 --> 01:48:37,252
he revealed someone.

1765
01:48:37,327 --> 01:48:42,459
And we think it only right
to give him a proper introduction.

1766
01:48:42,528 --> 01:48:46,534
He is our friend and he is our leader.
Dylan Shrike!

1767
01:48:46,609 --> 01:48:48,611
- Get over here!
- Yeah!

1768
01:48:54,489 --> 01:48:56,538
So, normally

1769
01:48:56,650 --> 01:49:01,338
only the magician, his assistant,
and a few trusted stage hands

1770
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,652
know the secret of a trick.

1771
01:49:03,731 --> 01:49:06,735
But tonight, however, in this effect,

1772
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:09,894
all of you people
around the Thames here.

1773
01:49:09,971 --> 01:49:14,614
And since we're streaming live,
everyone around the world

1774
01:49:14,692 --> 01:49:17,218
already knows everything.

1775
01:49:17,292 --> 01:49:21,377
And only these fellows
here are the ones left in the dark.

1776
01:49:21,452 --> 01:49:24,376
So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.

1777
01:49:24,453 --> 01:49:28,174
Remember when we were playing
"Find the Lady," and I said

1778
01:49:28,253 --> 01:49:30,176
<i>that we used a Barry Trap.</i>

1779
01:49:30,973 --> 01:49:34,535
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

1780
01:49:34,614 --> 01:49:38,141
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

1781
01:49:41,214 --> 01:49:43,456
<i>Which took us to a duplicate hangar</i>

1782
01:49:43,575 --> 01:49:46,100
<i>where we used your need to rush,</i>

1783
01:49:46,175 --> 01:49:49,179
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

1784
01:49:49,255 --> 01:49:51,064
Get those lights off me!

1785
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:56,620
So, the airplane.
How did we get it to fly?

1786
01:49:57,696 --> 01:50:02,498
<i>Well, we used fans,
and lights and rain machines.</i>

1787
01:50:07,737 --> 01:50:12,380
Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.

1788
01:50:12,458 --> 01:50:13,744
But we needed to make sure

1789
01:50:13,858 --> 01:50:15,940
that you would do exactly
what we needed you to do

1790
01:50:16,018 --> 01:50:17,508
once you did catch us.

1791
01:50:17,578 --> 01:50:23,666
My brother Chase, who was
technical adviser to the losing team.

1792
01:50:23,739 --> 01:50:26,390
He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.

1793
01:50:26,499 --> 01:50:28,024
I know where you're going!

1794
01:50:28,099 --> 01:50:31,707
And, uh, surprises.

1795
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,065
Watch it, hobo.

1796
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,825
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

1797
01:50:36,901 --> 01:50:39,552
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

1798
01:50:39,621 --> 01:50:42,943
It's going to be your idea to throw
the Horsemen out of the plane.

1799
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:45,501
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

1800
01:50:45,581 --> 01:50:47,549
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

1801
01:50:47,622 --> 01:50:50,067
Probably see you what, three to five?

1802
01:50:51,222 --> 01:50:55,591
Come on, put it there.
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1803
01:50:56,142 --> 01:50:59,112
Basically, we showed them everything.

1804
01:50:59,182 --> 01:51:04,474
How you kidnapped us to steal the very
thing that is in your pocket right now.

1805
01:51:06,704 --> 01:51:08,068
Whoops!

1806
01:51:11,704 --> 01:51:14,150
You know, this thing here,

1807
01:51:14,224 --> 01:51:17,707
which you said you could
use to adjust markets,

1808
01:51:17,785 --> 01:51:21,471
manipulate governments,
and spy on whomever you choose.

1809
01:51:21,545 --> 01:51:23,388
Also, you could, as you said,

1810
01:51:23,465 --> 01:51:26,629
control the public
from outside the grid.

1811
01:51:27,546 --> 01:51:32,838
These men destroy people's lives.

1812
01:51:32,947 --> 01:51:36,997
Spying on the world, robbing you
of your right to privacy.

1813
01:51:37,066 --> 01:51:40,310
And they do that
by hiding in the dark.

1814
01:51:40,387 --> 01:51:44,950
So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.

1815
01:51:45,028 --> 01:51:50,069
Tonight, they, like all of us,

1816
01:51:50,148 --> 01:51:53,311
are finally stepping into the light.

1817
01:51:57,269 --> 01:51:58,475
Thank you, everybody!

1818
01:51:58,549 --> 01:52:01,155
We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!

1819
01:52:03,469 --> 01:52:07,475
Five, four, three, two, one!

1820
01:52:24,311 --> 01:52:26,918
- Hey, we're on the clock.
- Get a move on.

1821
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,118
There they are!

1822
01:52:31,192 --> 01:52:33,240
- There's more inside.
- Don't you bloody touch me!

1823
01:52:33,312 --> 01:52:34,997
The Horsemen are over on the...

1824
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,238
Oh, shit!

1825
01:52:39,914 --> 01:52:41,723
Stay with them!

1826
01:52:41,794 --> 01:52:43,796
Everybody spread out!

1827
01:52:43,874 --> 01:52:45,717
Nobody leaves this barge!

1828
01:52:47,634 --> 01:52:50,718
Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

1829
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,080
This contains everything.

1830
01:52:58,155 --> 01:53:01,238
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

1831
01:53:01,315 --> 01:53:04,320
All their contacts,
the entire network.

1832
01:53:04,396 --> 01:53:06,603
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

1833
01:53:06,716 --> 01:53:10,357
I told you.
I'm the same man I've always been.

1834
01:53:10,437 --> 01:53:12,917
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

1835
01:53:12,997 --> 01:53:15,807
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

1836
01:53:15,878 --> 01:53:19,087
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

1837
01:53:19,998 --> 01:53:21,887
Ten minutes.

1838
01:53:23,678 --> 01:53:25,726
Now you're playing
the long game.

1839
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,841
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

1840
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,287
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

1841
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:48,285
There were so many women,
I have no idea whose bastard you are.

1842
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:49,487
What?

1843
01:53:49,561 --> 01:53:51,928
- What happened?
- Thin air, gone. Come with me.

1844
01:53:52,001 --> 01:53:55,643
What're you talking about, gone?
People don't just disappear.

1845
01:53:55,722 --> 01:53:58,453
You realize that he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

1846
01:54:38,126 --> 01:54:39,571
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

1847
01:54:39,646 --> 01:54:42,048
- Good to see you all.
- Good to see you, Li.

1848
01:54:43,167 --> 01:54:44,292
Come on in.

1849
01:54:47,567 --> 01:54:50,411
Good morning. Welcome.

1850
01:54:52,848 --> 01:54:56,409
I'm proud of you.
All of you.

1851
01:54:56,488 --> 01:55:00,016
I have a lot to show you. Come.

1852
01:55:01,249 --> 01:55:02,488
Come.

1853
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:15,056
Dad.

1854
01:55:32,492 --> 01:55:34,096
Yes.

1855
01:55:34,213 --> 01:55:36,944
Your father and I were partners.

1856
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:40,176
Our act was that of rivals.

1857
01:55:41,372 --> 01:55:47,017
I was the hard-eyed realist.
He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

1858
01:55:47,094 --> 01:55:49,825
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

1859
01:55:50,894 --> 01:55:54,535
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

1860
01:55:54,614 --> 01:55:59,461
The only thing we didn't count on
was it going so wrong.

1861
01:56:03,495 --> 01:56:05,305
Why?

1862
01:56:05,415 --> 01:56:07,145
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

1863
01:56:07,216 --> 01:56:08,741
I don't know.

1864
01:56:09,896 --> 01:56:11,182
Give it a name.

1865
01:56:11,297 --> 01:56:14,698
Shame, guilt. Regret.

1866
01:56:18,456 --> 01:56:21,427
Hey, guys, uh, you might
wanna come take a look at this.

1867
01:56:23,098 --> 01:56:24,145
Hmm.

1868
01:56:25,617 --> 01:56:26,824
Look.

1869
01:56:26,938 --> 01:56:28,702
<i>I put you in jail, man.</i>

1870
01:56:28,778 --> 01:56:31,146
Why didn't you
say something then?

1871
01:56:31,219 --> 01:56:34,223
Well, you know, I was going to.

1872
01:56:34,299 --> 01:56:38,941
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

1873
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:43,621
Well, quite frankly
it spoiled the trick for me.

1874
01:56:43,699 --> 01:56:44,986
I showed my weakness.

1875
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:47,870
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

1876
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:50,591
But when you came back to my cell,

1877
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:55,064
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me...

1878
01:56:56,061 --> 01:56:57,551
...for your Horsemen.

1879
01:56:59,141 --> 01:57:03,830
<i>And I said to myself,
"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

1880
01:57:04,702 --> 01:57:08,104
<i>And I knew it was my job to see to it</i>

1881
01:57:08,182 --> 01:57:11,904
<i>that he became the magician
he was born to be.</i>

1882
01:57:11,983 --> 01:57:14,304
All that was left then was...

1883
01:57:16,063 --> 01:57:17,395
For me to hit bottom.

1884
01:57:18,184 --> 01:57:23,031
So the safe, my father's wristwatch,
that was all you?

1885
01:57:25,824 --> 01:57:29,147
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

1886
01:57:29,225 --> 01:57:32,069
<i>Oh, we knew
Walter was in hiding.</i>

1887
01:57:32,145 --> 01:57:35,866
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

1888
01:57:37,585 --> 01:57:41,033
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

1889
01:57:41,146 --> 01:57:46,187
<i>They needed to learn to work together
like a single organism.</i>

1890
01:57:53,867 --> 01:57:56,474
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

1891
01:57:56,547 --> 01:57:58,152
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

1892
01:58:05,868 --> 01:58:07,280
Okay.

1893
01:58:07,349 --> 01:58:09,397
<i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

1894
01:58:09,508 --> 01:58:13,992
You know, the best tricks
work on many levels.

1895
01:58:14,069 --> 01:58:18,041
And the deepest one,
for me, at least,

1896
01:58:18,110 --> 01:58:20,920
is this moment right here.

1897
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:26,076
I'm sorry, Dylan.

1898
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:29,237
I miss your father.

1899
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:32,793
Thirty years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

1900
01:58:32,911 --> 01:58:34,561
Yes, it is.

1901
01:58:44,513 --> 01:58:45,798
So, now what?

1902
01:58:48,233 --> 01:58:51,123
- Now I'm about out of moves.
- Oh...

1903
01:58:51,193 --> 01:58:52,558
And I'm tired.

1904
01:58:52,633 --> 01:58:55,010
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

1905
01:58:55,034 --> 01:58:57,002
led to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

1906
01:58:57,074 --> 01:58:58,121
I did.

1907
01:58:58,194 --> 01:59:00,357
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

1908
01:59:01,754 --> 01:59:03,439
I am.

1909
01:59:09,235 --> 01:59:11,681
It's your game now.

1910
01:59:11,755 --> 01:59:14,362
You play it however you see fit.

1911
01:59:15,595 --> 01:59:21,445
My suggestion, however, is that
you find yourself a successor.

1912
01:59:21,517 --> 01:59:23,406
Hi. Okay, so, um...

1913
01:59:23,477 --> 01:59:26,799
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions. Right?

1914
01:59:26,877 --> 01:59:29,358
Uh... By "a few,"
I think he means, like, five million.

1915
01:59:29,438 --> 01:59:31,007
- Yeah.
- Well.

1916
01:59:31,078 --> 01:59:32,921
Good luck to you all.

1917
01:59:32,998 --> 01:59:34,647
- Okay. See, that's not fair.
- What!

1918
01:59:34,718 --> 01:59:35,854
- Come on.
- That's not right.

1919
01:59:35,878 --> 01:59:37,214
That's gonna make me really angry!

1920
01:59:37,238 --> 01:59:38,495
Not right now.

1921
01:59:38,519 --> 01:59:40,123
Oh, um, by the way...

1922
01:59:42,359 --> 01:59:44,839
Pay no attention to the curtain.

1923
01:59:47,759 --> 01:59:49,124
There is a curtain.

1924
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,531
Go, go, go!

1925
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,370
<i>Seeing is believing.
But is it truth?</i>

1926
02:00:04,441 --> 02:00:07,092
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

1927
02:00:07,161 --> 02:00:09,687
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

1928
02:00:09,761 --> 02:00:14,086
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

1929
02:00:14,162 --> 02:00:17,292
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

1930
02:00:17,403 --> 02:00:22,967
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you</i>

1931
02:00:23,043 --> 02:00:25,694
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

1932
02:00:26,564 --> 02:00:29,249
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

1933
02:00:29,324 --> 02:00:32,453
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

1934
02:00:32,525 --> 02:00:36,416
<i>is an eye for an eye.</i>
