1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,440
Father Creel.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,400
- You have the Wayne boy?
- Not yet.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,360
There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,320
- Mr. Penguin?
- Help me.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,800
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,000
Sell me your company.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,280
I will give you this
as a signing gift.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,320
I've been a very bad girl.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,840
You're a good woman.
You're just sick.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,040
I knew you still had feelings for me.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,360
- I want to show you something.
- You're under arrest!

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,720
May I ask what the charge is?

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,760
The kidnapping and torture
of Aubrey James.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,880
No!

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,400
Tell me who killed them!

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,800
Can you believe it still fits?

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,120
Don't make me kill you.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,560
Do it, Jim. Do me.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
Kill him!

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,240
- It's over.
- Not yet.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Hold on!

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,000
- I love you, baby.
- No!

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,680
- All right, 325.
- Okay.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
Morning.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Help you?

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
I was told to order
a Highsmith Royale.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,520
Bit early, don't you think?

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,600
I said Highsmith Royale.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
No ice.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
There you go, man.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,760
How may I help you?

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,080
I need somebody killed, and I heard
that you employ the best.

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh, yes. I know you.

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,000
Our illustrious mayor's sister.

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Or should I say "ex-mayor"?

37
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,520
Word is, you're quite
the dead-eye yourself.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,960
- Why come to us?
- Had an accident. My aim is off.

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,000
Is this business? Personal?

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,240
- What's it matter to you?
- Personal costs extra.

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
There's always complications.

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
It's business.

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,560
A cop.

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,600
Seems personal to me.

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Anyhow, cops also cost extra.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Fine.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
I want it done today.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,480
- What kind of guarantee do I get?
- I accept a job, the job gets done.

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,240
Period. You see, I believe
in the beauty of extreme measures.

50
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,520
So, who's the lucky fellow?

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,280
Take it easy man.

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,600
Ms. Kean has yet
to regain consciousness.

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,040
With this kind of trauma, we have...

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,680
no idea when she might wake up.

55
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
If ever.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,360
But the medical wing at Arkham
is fully equipped

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,760
to handle her condition.

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,120
Will you be riding over with her?

59
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
No.

60
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
Hello, sleepyhead.

61
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
- Where am I?
- Rapid movement

62
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
and elevated heart rate
are counterproductive

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
to the healing process.

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,120
- Don't kill...
- Apologies in advance.

65
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Rest up, my feathered friend.

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,400
We have a big night ahead of us.

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
{\an5}Looking for this?

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,120
{\an5}- Thank you.
- You left before I woke up.

69
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,720
{\an5}I know. Couldn't sleep.

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Was I snoring?

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
{\an5}- No.
- Are you sure?

72
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
{\an5}My big, loud, rumbling,
barnyard snore?

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,200
{\an5}I've heard complaints. Neighbors.

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,320
{\an5}- Airplanes.
- You don't snore.

75
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,160
{\an5}Look, I'm glad Galavan's
been arrested.

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
{\an5}But he should pay for everything
he's done.

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,040
{\an5}I'm on my way to meet Barnes
at Galavan's penthouse.

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,640
{\an5}Hopefully, we can find some evidence

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,880
{\an5}to corroborate Aubrey James'
testimony.

80
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,880
{\an5}I got a call. They're transferring
Barbara to Arkham.

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
{\an5}I know.

82
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,640
{\an5}I stopped by Gotham General.

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,360
{\an5}- You went to see her?
- She's a witness against Galavan.

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,560
{\an5}I wanted to check on her condition.

85
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,880
{\an5}Her condition is, she's in a coma.

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,600
{\an5}Look, we never talked
about what happened

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
{\an5}with you and Barbara
in that interrogation room.

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
I know. Tonight?

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,760
{\an5}Sure. Tonight. Or right now.

90
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,680
{\an5}Lee, I went over to see her as part
of the case against Galavan.

91
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,280
{\an5}- That is it.
- This isn't jealousy.

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,840
{\an5}That woman is...

93
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,360
How do I put this? She's the devil.

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,120
{\an5}No, she is. She's the devil.

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,640
{\an5}Lee, do you think I wanted things
to go the way they did?

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,160
{\an5}- I had to play her game.
- I know, all right?

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,400
Forget about Barbara.

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,720
{\an5}Most people fight their dark side.

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,080
{\an5}Lately, you find ways
to give into it.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,200
{\an5}That's a problem.

101
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
{\an5}For you and for us.

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
{\an5}I know. I hear you.

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,200
{\an5}Can we please just not talk
about this right now?

104
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
{\an5}I'm late to meet Barnes.

105
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
{\an5}I'll be fine.

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
I wasn't sure you'd ever
want to see me again.

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,040
When you called.

108
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,040
You don't believe
what they're saying about my uncle.

109
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,040
- Do you?
- No. Of course not.

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,760
Silver, I asked you here
because I need your help.

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Anything.

112
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,240
Before he was arrested,
your uncle made me an offer.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,320
- I... I want...
- Right, Master Bruce!

114
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,080
On your feet!
Bought us a couple of lovely rakes

115
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,480
from the ironmongers.

116
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,960
I suggest we get outside and get...

117
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Hello, Ms. Saint Cloud.

118
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,960
Did not expect to see you here.

119
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,080
Hello, Alfred.

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,840
That must have been your car
I saw idling on the main road.

121
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,760
Now, in light of recent events,

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,040
I suggest you get in it
and you leave immediately.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
I invited her and I want her to stay.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
And I'm ordering her to leave.

125
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,800
And it's my house,
and I give the orders.

126
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Oh, is that so?

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
It's okay.

128
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,440
- I don't want to cause any trouble.
- Smart girl.

129
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Off you pop.

130
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm at the Kane Hotel.

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,800
- You had no right to do that.
- I had every right.

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,920
Well, what were you thinking
asking her up here?

133
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,520
Oh, wait, you...

134
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,800
think she was gonna tell you
something?

135
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,720
If Galavan really has the name
of my parents' killer

136
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
in that envelope, it's worth a shot.

137
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, my guess is, there was
absolutely nothing in that envelope.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
It was just a ruse to get you
to sign away the company.

139
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,640
Galavan is smart.

140
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,520
He wouldn't enter
a multibillion-dollar offer

141
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,680
without his end of the bargain.

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
He has the name.

143
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,640
And you think that little minx
is gonna tell you something, do you?

144
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,720
- We're friends.
- No, you're not.

145
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,800
Getting information out of a girl
like that requires a level of

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,720
deception that you do not yet
possess, Master Bruce.

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,320
It's too dangerous.

148
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,560
- It's worth the risk.
- No.

149
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,240
You will not see
Ms. Saint Cloud again

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,600
or pursue Galavan's wild claims.

151
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,480
You have no right to make
that decision for me.

152
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Well, someone has to.

153
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,560
If you force me to be your jailer,
then that is who I will be.

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,440
Excuse me. Thank you.

155
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,240
Press 56, please.

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
You live here?

157
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
No.

158
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Me neither.

159
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,840
Lady's baby grand is flat, so...

160
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,520
I don't mind making house calls.
I like my work.

161
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
You like your work?

162
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Yeah. I do.

163
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
I guess we're lucky.

164
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
Caramel?

165
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,240
No, I'm good.

166
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
You're missing out. They're good.

167
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Where the hell is Gordon?

168
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,520
- Who is that?
- No idea.

169
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,280
But he just tried to kill me.

170
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,480
- He tell you why?
- Wasn't random.

171
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,160
Piano wire.

172
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,360
Guy's a pro.

173
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,000
No, wait. Wait!

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
You feel lucky, Ned?

175
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,680
- Let's go!
- All the way! All the way!

176
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
We got this! Yeah!

177
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,360
Listen up.

178
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
Who wants a shot at 86-ing
one of Gotham's finest?

179
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm waiving any collateral fines.

180
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,520
Just do what you have to do.

181
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,680
But Jim Gordon doesn't see the sun...

182
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,680
rise.

183
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
You drugged me.

184
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,720
That was for your own benefit,
Mr. Penguin.

185
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,520
You have extensive injuries.

186
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,280
I know you.

187
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Ed.

188
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,280
Nygma.

189
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,320
We met once before. At the GCPD.

190
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,920
- You're not a cop.
- Oh, no, no, no.

191
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
No, I'm in forensics.

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,840
Do you believe in fate?

193
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Where are my clothes?

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,080
Oh, I threw them away. They smelled.

195
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
Oh, no. Oh, my.

196
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,600
Oh, I'm afraid, sir,
that you can't leave.

197
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,200
If you sedate me again,
I swear, I will...

198
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Sir!

199
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,000
You are a wanted man.

200
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
You can try and run,

201
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,960
but with your condition
you'll get about three blocks.

202
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
I'm afraid that you're stuck
here until you recover.

203
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,640
Now, drink up.

204
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
It's just water.
Dehydration is common

205
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,440
after prolonged outdoor exposure.

206
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,040
What do you want from me?

207
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
Remember I had mentioned fate?

208
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,440
Recently, I've been going through
a sort of change.

209
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,280
What kind of change, you ask?

210
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,760
- I didn't.
- I've started murdering people.

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Wow.
That is thrilling to say out loud.

212
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,240
- How many people?
- Three in total.

213
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,600
Two of them I didn't really care for.

214
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,760
But one was my girlfriend,
Ms. Kringle.

215
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,640
She was the love of my life.

216
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,400
If you're planning on killing me,
could you get on with it?

217
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,320
At this point, it would come
as a welcome relief.

218
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, heavens! No, no, no.
No, no, no.

219
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,280
I have no ill intentions toward you.

220
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,240
Then what are your intentions?

221
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,840
I need advice, Mr. Penguin.

222
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,560
These murders...

223
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
changed me.

224
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,800
And like the butterfly,

225
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,160
I've come to realize that I cannot
be a caterpillar once again.

226
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
And you're one of the city's
most notorious killers.

227
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,240
I brought you here, in part,

228
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,840
because I was hoping you could
guide me on this new path.

229
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
- Listen, friend...
- Ed.

230
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Whatever.

231
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,880
My empire is in ruins.

232
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm a wanted man with no friends.

233
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,280
And my mother...

234
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,280
the one person I swore to protect,
is dead because of my weakness.

235
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,040
Believe me when I tell you that this
path you're on leads to nothing

236
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,760
but destruction and pain.

237
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
So...

238
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
wanted or not, I'm leaving.

239
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,520
Oh, my.

240
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,480
Rise and shine.

241
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
Hell with this.

242
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,000
Who sent you?

243
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,280
Huh?

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
Who sent you?

245
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,480
Your mother.

246
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,640
That's what I was hoping
you would say.

247
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,040
What are you doing? No!
What are you doing?

248
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,960
Talk!

249
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,520
Detective Gordon! Stand down.

250
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,080
Stand down right now!

251
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,440
Parks, watch the perp.
Cortez, you shut the window.

252
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Come over here!

253
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,240
You know damn well I don't tolerate
that type of behavior.

254
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,520
And yet you pull that crap right
in front of me?

255
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,560
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you losing it, Gordon?

256
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,560
Has that church incident messed
with your mind?

257
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,720
- No, sir.
- 'Cause if I remember correctly,

258
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,560
you disobeying my orders is what
landed you there in the first place.

259
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,200
I ordered you to turn that car around
and you ignored me

260
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
and drove straight into an ambush.

261
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,200
And ended the day putting
Galavan behind bars.

262
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,360
- We need to push the boundaries.
- Captain!

263
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,240
My employer has a strict protocol.

264
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,000
If the first guy doesn't succeed...

265
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,240
keep sending men till the job
is done.

266
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,680
None of you is making it
out of here alive.

267
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,880
When you get here, move carefully.

268
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,200
We don't know how many active
skells we're dealing with.

269
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,600
All right.

270
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,000
Two units on the way here.

271
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,840
We just have to hold out till
they get here.

272
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,880
Hey. Oh, Cortez, kill the lights.

273
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,160
Sir, I'm forensics.

274
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,360
I don't have a gun.

275
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,720
Grab something you can use
as a weapon,

276
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,960
and stay behind us as best
you can, all right?

277
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,080
Parks, take cover behind the desk.

278
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Remember your training.

279
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,680
- Aim for center mass.
- Right. Center mass.

280
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,440
And don't stop firing until
you're sure. And Parks?

281
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
- Yes, sir?
- Breathe.

282
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
Help me!

283
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,600
Drop the knife!

284
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,760
I'm leaving.

285
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,760
- Not gonna happen.
- Try to stop me.

286
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,320
I'll lop off her pretty little head.

287
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,920
You know what I like
about those glasses?

288
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,440
They look like bullseyes.

289
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,160
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

290
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
Okay.

291
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,880
We're not gonna hang around
for round two.

292
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,280
Everybody load up and let's get
the hell out of here.

293
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
I'm not leaving.

294
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,360
That wasn't a request.

295
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,000
This place is still our best bet
for evidence against Galavan.

296
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,440
We leave, they'll destroy it.

297
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
Now you're just looking for a fight.

298
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,000
Parks, make sure
the staircase is clear.

299
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,560
I've got a civilian who's dead

300
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,680
and a rookie who's scared half
out of her mind.

301
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,720
You think we're gonna survive the
next attack with just a few handguns?

302
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,400
We have to get out of here.

303
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,560
Wait.

304
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,760
A monk's cassock?

305
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,560
What the hell is this about?

306
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,400
I don't know, but we have to
get out of here. Let's go!

307
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,840
Captain! Captain!

308
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,840
This could be exactly
what we're looking for.

309
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,960
Knife!

310
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Captain! Captain!

311
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,160
- You okay?
- It's just a scratch.

312
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,360
- Let's get out of here.
- No! No!

313
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
The knife punctured an artery.

314
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,960
You move, it could tear.

315
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
What are you, a doctor now?
I can move.

316
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,040
You stand up, you'll bleed out
in a matter of minutes.

317
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Who's that?

318
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,160
This is Mr. Leonard.

319
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
You were talking in your sleep
last night

320
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
about Galavan killing
your mother.

321
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,280
- I was?
- Yes.

322
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,720
Mr. Leonard works for Galavan.

323
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,440
Oh, before he was arrested,
of course.

324
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,880
Arrested?

325
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,120
Detective Gordon arrested Galavan
for kidnapping Mayor James.

326
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,560
He's in Black gate.

327
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,120
Oh, I thought you'd be pleased.

328
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,160
It doesn't matter anymore.

329
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
Why is he here?

330
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
He was a gift for you.

331
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,280
And what exactly am I supposed
to do with a Leonard?

332
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,440
Kill him.

333
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,360
I thought it might be nice to get
some retribution

334
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,040
for your mother's death.

335
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
That it might cheer you up a little.

336
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
No?

337
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm done.

338
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,880
I need some rest...

339
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,080
and then I'm leaving Gotham forever.

340
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,320
I really thought he would like you.

341
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,960
What to do now?

342
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,560
Please! Please!

343
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,920
Not my ear...

344
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,720
Why just smell the fear on your
victim, when you can taste it?

345
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Right?

346
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,320
Help me! Help!

347
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Help!

348
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,920
<i>- Hola.
- Hola, Eduardo.</i>

349
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
- Long time.
- Yes.

350
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,240
- Just a moment, please.
- Help! Help!

351
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,200
Are you on a job?

352
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,880
It's not a job if you love
what you do.

353
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,600
Oh. Fair enough.

354
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,520
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pinch
over here.

355
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,400
I thought my membership was revoked.

356
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,880
Bygones, darling. Live and let live.

357
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,320
So, you eat people.

358
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,360
Who am I to judge?

359
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
The target is a Detective Gordon.

360
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,120
I'll make it worth your while.

361
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,480
Send me the address.

362
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,640
Death squads have softer touches
than you!

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,120
At least Galavan goes top-shelf.

364
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,680
The EMTs should be on their way.

365
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,120
Yeah, sure.

366
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,600
They'll be here about the same time
as our backup.

367
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,120
So, you wanna tell me what
the hell's going on with you?

368
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,880
In the church that day,
Barbara accused me

369
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
of having a monster inside me.

370
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,960
And?

371
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,800
Lee seems to agree.

372
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,920
She thinks I'm ready and willing
to give in to it.

373
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,040
What do you think?

374
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
There was a moment...

375
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,160
when I had the shotgun on Barbara.

376
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,720
She was taunting me
to pull the trigger.

377
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,720
If Galavan's people
hadn't busted in...

378
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I don't know.

379
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,880
- But they did bust in.
- I nearly crossed the line.

380
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
The line?

381
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,960
Let me tell you something
about the line.

382
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,440
My third tour, we were stationed
in the desert.

383
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,600
We captured three insurgents,
when this sand storm kicks up.

384
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,080
Zero visibility.

385
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,360
Then we start taking fire,
we're getting lit up.

386
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,760
Suddenly, I'm alone.

387
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,080
I come across one of our prisoners.

388
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,400
He was a kid.

389
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,880
His hands were zip-tied,

390
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,680
but he figures, what the hell,

391
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,240
he's gonna use the sand storm
to try to escape.

392
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
So, I jump him.

393
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,160
And I take my gun
and I jam it in his mouth.

394
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,840
I figured it was just a threat.

395
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,560
Show him who's boss, you know?

396
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,560
Next thing I know...

397
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,880
I just pulled the trigger...

398
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
blew his head off.

399
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,640
That kid woke me up every night
for years.

400
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,400
Until I made my peace with him.

401
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,040
So, yeah, I come to find out
I'm just a man...

402
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,360
and at the right moment...

403
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,440
a man might do anything.

404
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Any man.

405
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,200
There is no line.

406
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,400
There's just the law.

407
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,840
That's what separates us
from the animals.

408
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,840
There is no line.

409
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Alfred?

410
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,880
I thought about what you said,
and you're right.

411
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,240
Pursuing Galavan on my own
is too risky.

412
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,680
Well, you don't say.

413
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,360
Best course of action is to call
Detective Gordon in the morning.

414
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,000
- Enlist his help.
- At last, some sense.

415
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,760
You're thinking of retiring,
are you, sir?

416
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,560
Yeah. Yeah. I'm very tired.

417
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,400
Right, can I get you anything
to eat before you go to bed?

418
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,920
No.

419
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,240
- No, thank you, Alfred.
- Right, well, sleep well.

420
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,560
Oh, and Master Bruce

421
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,160
I sent that car off that's parked
at the end of the lane.

422
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
You know, the taxi?

423
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,480
Don't worry, I gave him
a right good tip.

424
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,120
I mean, after all, he did drive all
the way up here, didn't he?

425
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,040
I didn't call a taxi.

426
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,280
You really are the most terrible
liar, aren't you, Master Bruce?

427
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,400
I will not stop pursuing this,
Alfred.

428
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,800
- I'm never going to give up.
- And nor will I.

429
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Good night, sir.

430
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,200
<i>The fire has gone out</i>

431
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,200
<i>Wet from snow above</i>

432
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,080
<i>But nothing will warm me more</i>

433
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,960
<i>Than my, my mother's love</i>

434
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,000
<i>I light another candle</i>

435
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,840
<i>Dry the tears from my face</i>

436
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,320
Why are you playing this song?

437
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,720
I can bring tears to your eyes
and resurrect the dead.

438
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,240
I form in an instant
and last a lifetime.

439
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,240
What am I?

440
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,000
A memory. So, what?

441
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,000
You were humming
this under your covers.

442
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,520
I figure it has meaning for you.

443
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,400
Every night when I was young,

444
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,800
my mother would sing that song
to me when I was going to bed.

445
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
And every time...

446
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,400
she would tell me...

447
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
"Oswald...

448
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,400
don't listen to the other children.

449
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,640
You're handsome and clever...

450
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,720
and some day
you will be a great man."

451
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,440
She said that every time.

452
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,040
That's all I have left now.

453
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,160
Memories.

454
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,120
And they're like daggers in my heart.

455
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,320
Not forever.

456
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,800
These were Ms. Kringle's.

457
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,360
It's all I have left to remember
her by.

458
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
But when I look at these,
I don't feel sadness anymore.

459
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
I feel gratitude.
And do you know why?

460
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,880
No.

461
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,840
And I don't care.

462
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
This little visit is over.

463
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,800
I will just simply bid you adieu.

464
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,080
Mr. Penguin...

465
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,040
for some men,
love is a source of strength.

466
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,000
But for you and I, it will always
be our most crippling weakness.

467
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,200
- Move aside, Ed.
- We are better off unencumbered.

468
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,920
- What did you say?
- You said it yourself.

469
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,160
Your mother is dead
because of your weakness.

470
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,880
But what you need to realize
is that your weakness...

471
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,960
was her.

472
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,360
My mother was a saint!

473
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,600
The only person who truly cared
about me.

474
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,240
And now she's gone...

475
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,200
and I have nothing left!

476
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,040
A man with nothing that he loves...

477
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,920
is a man that cannot be bargained.

478
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,440
A man that cannot be betrayed.

479
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,480
A man who answers to no one
but himself.

480
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,800
And that is the man
that I see before me.

481
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,280
A free man.

482
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,920
Are the EMTs with you?

483
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,560
<i>Captain Barnes needs
immediate attention.</i>

484
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,880
Ambulance is still inbound.

485
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,360
<i>We'll secure the perimeter.</i>

486
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,000
<i>Wait. Hold on!</i>

487
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,480
<i>Behind you! No!</i>

488
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,320
Officer? Officer?

489
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,240
<i>Hola.</i>

490
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,880
<i>Detective Gordon, I presume?</i>

491
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,520
Who is this?

492
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,680
<i>This is Eduardo Flamingo.</i>

493
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,800
Is that name supposed to mean
something to me?

494
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,800
<i>Not yet. But it will.</i>

495
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,280
<i>I'll be upstairs in a few minutes.</i>

496
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,880
<i>I'm going to feast on
your friends first.</i>

497
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,400
<i>Save you for dessert.</i>

498
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,960
<i>If you try to run, I will find you.</i>

499
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,800
I won't.

500
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
In fact, I'm coming down.

501
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,240
What the hell is going on down there?

502
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,880
We've got another hitman.

503
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,640
He's just taken out all
of our backup.

504
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,560
I'm going down to end this.

505
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,120
You, he's just killed four cops!

506
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,400
You're not going anywhere
on your own!

507
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,440
- He's right. I'm coming with you.
- No.

508
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
You're staying here.

509
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,640
You need to make sure
he doesn't bleed out.

510
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,480
I just said you're not going down
there solo.

511
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,800
We'll make them come to us.

512
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,840
We stay here, we're sitting ducks.

513
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,600
He's after me, boss.

514
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,640
Go.

515
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,440
Oh, baby.

516
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,120
You disappoint me.

517
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,120
You have the right to remain silent.

518
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,280
I suggest you use it.

519
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,680
I'll make sure he gets processed
and put in lock-up.

520
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
Thanks.

521
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,120
Hey, Parks.

522
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
You did good today.

523
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,320
<i>For my mother looks over me</i>

524
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
<i>Yeah</i>

525
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,840
<i>The fire has gone out</i>

526
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,360
<i>Wet snow from above</i>

527
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,320
<i>And nothing will warm me more
Than my, my mother's love</i>

528
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,240
What happened to that gentleman
you had tied up earlier?

529
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,680
Galavan's lackey?

530
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
Why do you ask?

531
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,000
My mother always said a party's
not a party without entertainment.

532
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,960
Sneaking out to see your girlfriend,
huh?

533
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
Selina, what are you doing here?

534
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,160
Saving your ass from making
a big mistake.

535
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,840
Silver is bad news, Bruce.

536
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
You've said that before.

537
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,600
This time, I have proof.

538
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
You interested?

539
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,480
You're going away for a long time,
Mr. Flamingo.

540
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,680
Get up!

541
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,280
I said get up.

542
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,000
Let go of her!

543
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,160
- Lee...
- Hold still.

544
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,720
Thank you.

545
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
I almost crossed the line tonight.

546
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,160
No kidding.

547
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,680
How out of character.

548
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,280
Scared me a little.

549
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,480
Welcome to my world.

550
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,000
Why the hell are you with me?

551
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Beats me.

552
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,880
Just tell me the truth.

553
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,600
Always.

554
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,160
I promise.

555
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,080
Detective James Gordon's phone.
This is Lee Thompkins speaking.

556
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Hi, Alvarez.

557
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
I'll tell him.

558
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,080
Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks

559
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,000
before they could
get him into lock-up.

560
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Hitmen?

561
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,000
You sent hitmen after Jim Gordon?

562
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,840
After I expressly told you to do
nothing until I gave you orders?

563
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,360
Nothing.

564
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,520
Tell me this isn't about Barbara.

565
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,160
He hurt her.

566
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,800
I'm disappointed that you let a woman
like that get in your head.

567
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,280
If you're feeling upset, find
yourself a nice librarian to torture.

568
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,520
That always cheers you up.

569
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,760
Everything is ready.

570
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,160
The brothers' arrival is imminent.

571
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,320
Bruce Wayne will die, and his company
and this city will be mine.

572
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,960
Ours.

573
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,360
Everything that we have worked for,
for so long, will be ours.

574
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,640
Endanger that prize again,
and though it breaks my heart,

575
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,200
I will cut your throat.

576
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,040
Welcome, brothers.

577
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,680
- Welcome.
- Hey!

578
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,160
Docks are closed.

579
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,800
I need to see some ID.

580
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,160
Wait. No!
