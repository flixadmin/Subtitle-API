1
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,374
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

2
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,908
<i>You three criminals have been caught</i>

3
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,286
<i>in a further act of seditious treason.</i>

4
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>General Zod, your only feeling
was contempt for our society.</i>

5
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,169
<i>Your only desire was to command.</i>

6
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,549
<i>Ursa, the only feeling you showed
was for your vicious general.</i>

7
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,344
<i>Your only wish, to rule at his side.</i>

8
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>Non, you are as without thought
as you are without voice.</i>

9
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,688
<i>This council has no hesitation
in proclaiming you all...</i>

10
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,148
<i>Guilty.</i>

11
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,651
<i>Guilty.</i>

12
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,487
<i>Guilty.</i>

13
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,572
<i>Guilty.</i>

14
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,808
You will lie down before me, Jor-El.

15
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,977
Both you, and them one day, Jor-El!

16
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,354
Jor-El!

17
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,900
- Here, I'll just get the door for you.
- Yeah, thanks a...

18
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,153
Sorry, affer you.

19
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,865
Yeah, thanks a lot.

20
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,284
- Morning, Phil.
- Excuse me, Kent.

21
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,666
Hi, Alice. That's a very
pretty blouse you're wearing today.

22
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,585
I'Il catch you later, Clark.

23
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,003
Hello?

24
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,506
I don't know. Okay. Yep.

25
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,301
- Morning, Leueen. How's it...?
- Okay. I'll check it.

26
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,053
How do you spell that guy's name?

27
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,597
Mr. White, how Iong
should we hold the front page?

28
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,725
Give it another 10 minutes, and...
Oh, I'll tell them.

29
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,685
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Hello, Pete.

30
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,562
If we don't get anything
new in 10 minutes,

31
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,775
go with the wire-service copy
and run the picture in three columns.

32
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:31,279
Kent, I need a story for the page-three
sidebar on this terrorist group.

33
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,781
Right.

34
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,034
Sorry, terrorists?

35
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,995
Get your head out of the clouds,
Kent. Where you been?

36
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,706
- I was at home.
- Don't you watch television?

37
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,376
I don't enjoy television. Too much violence.
I was just reading Dickens.

38
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,713
Mr. Kent, a gang of terrorists
sElzed the Elffel Tower in Paris.

39
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,091
He knows where the Elffel Tower is, Olsen.

40
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,759
- You do, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

41
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,678
- Has anybody been hurt?
- So far the hostages are unharmed.

42
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,972
- The hostages?
- Yeah, tourists. About 20 of them.

43
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,641
But that's just penny-ante stuff.

44
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,477
They claim if the government
doesn't meet their demands,

45
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,521
they've got a hydrogen bomb.

46
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,856
Mr. White, that's terrible.

47
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,818
That's why they call them terrorists, Kent.

48
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,279
Now, get to the morgue.
I wanna know everything on terrorism.

49
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,573
Mr. White, does Lois know about any of this?

50
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,326
- Does she know about it? She's in it.
- She's what?

51
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,621
The minute the story broke,
I bundled her on the first Concorde.

52
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,749
If Paris is gonna go kablooey,
I want my best reporter in the middle.

53
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,419
- But, gee, Mr. White...
- You're good, but Lois Lane is better.

54
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,005
No, I meant, isn't that
a little bit dangerous, sir?

55
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,424
That goes with the territory, Kent.

56
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,759
Don't worry.

57
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:39,013
If I know Lois Lane, she'll not only
come back with a Pulitzer Prize story

58
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,474
but a one-on-one interview
with a hydrogen bomb

59
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,601
titled "What Makes Me Tick."

60
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,353
Now, don't stand around, Kent...

61
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,398
- How did they get up there?
- They were disguised as repair workers.

62
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,109
Can you tell us why
they released the first hostages?

63
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,155
We insist they do this to show good faith.
If not, we refuse to negotiate.

64
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,532
Will they release
the rest of the hostages?

65
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,036
In return for a guarantee that
we will not launch an attack on them.

66
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,247
There will be no attack,
no attempt to overpower the terrorists?

67
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,083
- We've made a guarantee.
- And you'll honor it?

68
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,085
We have not the choice to refuse

69
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,796
if we believe it's a real
hydrogen bomb they have.

70
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,382
- Where is the bomb?
- It's in a big oilcan.

71
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,594
Hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?

72
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:05,058
How can we be sure? Today it's
possible for anyone to make a bomb.

73
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,477
This could blow up all of Paris.

74
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,605
What's the government's position?
Will they meet their demands?

75
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,107
I am not authorized to say what they will do.

76
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:17,278
At this moment, there is an emergency
meeting in the Elysée Palace.

77
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,791
Wait. Wait, wait.

78
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,426
- Stairs. Stairs? Stairs.
- Stairs.

79
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,178
Okay?

80
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,702
- AII right. We'll bring them down now.
- Get in.

81
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,497
- Come on. Watch out for any tricks.
- Do we Iook Iike the sort of...?

82
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,419
I don't know what you look like.
Get in. You're being released. Shut up.

83
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,003
- Come on then, everybody out.
- Okay, ready.

84
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
This way.

85
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,427
- Come on. Quick, quick, quick.
- Hurry up.

86
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,305
Look, you're being released. Get moving.

87
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,557
I'll take a last look around.

88
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,899
Okay, send them down.

89
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,073
Okay, up we go.

90
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,037
Pulitzer Prize.

91
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,125
Capital P... Darn.

92
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,518
Should we have let the hostages go?

93
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,270
They'll give in to us as
soon as we plant the bomb.

94
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,148
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

95
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,944
Nobel Prize.

96
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,737
Capital N,

97
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,031
little O, little B,

98
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,867
little E, little L.

99
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,246
Nobel. Nobel. Nobel.

100
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,419
Prize.

101
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,093
Now, be careful.

102
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,763
It's me that controls the bomb,
not the bomb that controls me.

103
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,474
I hope you have not
many sins Ieft to be forgiven

104
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,937
because if you let go of that,
you'll only have 60 seconds to list them.

105
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,067
- You are right.
- Did you hear something?

106
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,278
Sounded like someone
moving underneath.

107
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,821
It's your nerves.

108
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,327
- Where are they now?
- They are near to the lift.

109
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:58,458
But one is still inside with the bomb.

110
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,381
The third one has come out of the lift now.

111
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,968
- <i>The third one is out now.</i>
- The bomb, is it still in there?

112
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,136
<i>Yes, we think so.</i>

113
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,310
This is the boring bit.

114
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,999
Tell them to get ready.

115
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,918
Stand by.

116
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,465
Get ready. Come on.

117
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,094
We'll cut the cable
as soon as we get the word.

118
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,305
Are you sure
they haven't primed the bomb?

119
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,142
No, no, of course not. They haven't.
We've been watching them all the time.

120
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,862
Now!

121
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,542
- It started.
- Oh, my God.

122
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,117
I believe this is your floor.

123
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,286
Oh, thank God.

124
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,913
How did I get myself into this?

125
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,334
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

126
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,504
A bomb! There's a bomb up there.

127
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,172
- They've got a bomb.
- I know. I know.

128
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,390
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.

129
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,434
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

130
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,025
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

131
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey!

132
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,162
Clark.

133
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,084
- You ever heard of crosswalks?
- Yeah, but you know, I mean...

134
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,461
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?

135
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,131
Freak.

136
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,094
Clark, you know,
you were really Iucky that time.

137
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,431
You gotta be careful. When you
cross the street, look both ways.

138
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,559
Well, I mean, gee, Lois, usually I do, you know.

139
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,610
- Come in.
- Hi.

140
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,864
You know, maybe you ought
to get your glasses checked.

141
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:45,703
Uh, well, you know, not everybody
can have x-ray vision, you know, Lois.

142
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,457
Do I detect a note of jealousy in that voice?

143
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,419
Jealousy? No, no. Not me.

144
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,298
Golly, Lois, what are you doing?

145
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,134
When was the Iast time
you heard me sneeze?

146
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,928
You are never gonna hear me sneeze again.

147
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,638
- No?
- No. I read this book

148
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:09,685
and it says that if you get 1000
milligrams of vitamin C every day,

149
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,978
you stay in perfect health.

150
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,607
Golly, 1000? That's certainly
a Iot of oranges, isn't it, Lois?

151
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,151
- There are pills. I've seen them.
- Pills.

152
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,487
That's the modern way to do things.

153
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,406
This is natural.

154
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,284
Besides, I get my exercise that way.

155
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,038
And, Clark, you don't have to be jealous.

156
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,417
- Uh, I don't?
- No, you got so much going for you.

157
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,627
I do?

158
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,505
Do you mind if I give you
a little constructive criticism?

159
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,257
- Well, actually, yes, I...
- You gotta be more aggressive.

160
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,635
You have to go from the instinct.

161
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,137
You see something,
you want it, you go for it.

162
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,680
That's what I do.

163
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,017
Yes, I've noticed.
Perhaps I could help you there.

164
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,019
Oh, thanks. That would be great.

165
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,104
Let me see now...

166
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,190
Oh, I see.

167
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,609
Just put the orange in there.
That's really very clever.

168
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,488
Clark.

169
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,452
You know that I wouldn't say all
those things to you if I didn't really care.

170
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,249
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

171
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,669
I mean, what else are friends for?

172
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,297
- Friends, huh?
- Mm-hm.

173
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,594
Here, Clark.

174
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,097
Here's to friendship.

175
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,851
Hm.

176
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,746
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

177
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,207
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

178
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,918
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor,

179
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,004
the greatest genius in this world?

180
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,091
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

181
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,720
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

182
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,269
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked.

183
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,397
I mean, California almost fell down,
right in the ocean.

184
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,357
Millions of people was almost killed.

185
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,861
If it hadn't been for that guy Superman,
that overgrown Boy Scout.

186
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,323
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- There's a scratch on it.

187
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:32,244
What are you gonna do with a guy Iike that?
He flies around so fast and everything.

188
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,498
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

189
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,793
Every time they try, he just flies off.

190
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,170
- Where?
- North.

191
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,755
Why?

192
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,590
To ski?

193
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,135
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

194
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,555
Some, like you, Otis, have more than one.

195
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,641
I didn't see Superman's in time.

196
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:57,436
But now, through patience, invention, and skill,

197
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,607
my little black box is just about ready.

198
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,069
- Oh, that little black box in our cell?
- Shh!

199
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,866
That little black box, Mr. Luthor,

200
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,661
what's it for?

201
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:19,416
That little black box, Otis,
goes beyond any conventional radar.

202
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,419
- It tracks alpha waves.
- Oh.

203
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,256
Alpha waves. Hm.

204
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:37,393
Those alpha waves will take me north
to his secret.

205
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:42,064
And his secret will give me Superman.

206
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,820
<i>The MAB is 190 at 0.5.</i>

207
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,323
<i>We ought to see the old beauty
when we top the rise there.</i>

208
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:56,453
Follow the bouncing ball for a while.
It's giving me a headache.

209
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,707
Anyway, somebody's gotta
check up on those guys.

210
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,710
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

211
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,671
How Iong they been up there, 45 days?

212
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,757
The whole world's forgotten about it.

213
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,137
Houston calling <i>Artemis II.</i>

214
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,724
Houston calling <i>Artemis II.</i> Come in.

215
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,560
<i>- Morning, Houston.
- Hold on, Nate.</i>

216
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,603
- Yo.
<i>- How are things going?</i>

217
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,898
AII systems normal, Houston.

218
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,985
- Andy is out doing the geological survey.
<i>- Okay.</i>

219
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,446
<i>More rocks. Nice.</i>

220
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,699
And cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

221
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,452
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

222
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,080
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

223
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,541
Just a little détente humor there, Houston.

224
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,835
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

225
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,921
Well, it's mighty pretty out there. Mighty...

226
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,134
- pretty.
<i>- Mighty pretty.</i>

227
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,635
<i>Right.</i>

228
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,388
<i>Look, Nate?</i>

229
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,432
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

230
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,185
That's it. I'm dreaming.

231
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,270
Artemis, <i>come in.</i>

232
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,900
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

233
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,485
U nidentified?

234
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,780
<i>- What does it look like?</i>
- Well...

235
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,657
a lot like a girl.

236
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,347
You.

237
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,018
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

238
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,770
A man?

239
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,085
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

240
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,657
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

241
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,003
Come in, Houston. Come in.
Attempting manual liftoff.

242
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,421
Can somebody hear me?

243
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,340
Houston!

244
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,555
Come in, Houston!

245
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,266
Oh, no. No!

246
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,228
Somebody help me!

247
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,611
<i>- Artemis,</i> this is Houston calling.
- What's up?

248
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,115
<i>- Artemis,</i> Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?

249
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,244
- I don't know. We've Iost contact.
- So?

250
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,079
Well, we really...

251
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,916
<i>Artemis,</i> come in, please. Houston calling.

252
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,711
What was that he said before? He saw a girl?

253
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,674
- I thought he said "curl ."
- What's a curl?

254
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,802
Isn't that what the old
Canaveral guys used to call a comet

255
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,470
with an east-west trajectory?

256
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,807
How should I know?
I was back in high school in those days.

257
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:32,562
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper.

258
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:36,650
And what he did was amazing.

259
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,737
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

260
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,661
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun,

261
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,663
a yellow sun,

262
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,834
the more our molecular
density gives us unlimited powers.

263
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,794
They come from there.

264
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,963
A place called Houston.

265
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,507
Then we will go there too,

266
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,592
to rule.

267
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,721
Finally, to rule.

268
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,326
Three-Elghty, out.

269
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,912
Three-Elghty-one, out.

270
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,832
Three-Elghty-two, out.

271
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,917
Three-Elghty-three, out.

272
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,671
Three-Elghty-four, out.

273
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,966
Three-Elghty-five, out.

274
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,472
Lights out, Luthor.

275
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,183
I said, lights out.

276
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,522
You guys are about 10 seconds
away from solitary, you know that?

277
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,526
I told you to...

278
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,339
Freeze, freeze.

279
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,145
Go out there and find it.

280
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:42,192
- What am I Iooking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

281
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,872
I think I found it.

282
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,713
What is it?

283
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,800
It's a ladder, you dummy.

284
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,178
- Hi, Miss Teschmacher.
- Shh!

285
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,855
Come on.

286
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,776
Hurry up. Hurry up.

287
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,946
Come on, hurry.

288
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,075
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

289
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,079
<i>50-yard line, touchdowni
Oh, what a beautiful play.</i>

290
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,957
<i>But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...</i>

291
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,589
- Come up.
- Come on.

292
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,383
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

293
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,261
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

294
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,723
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

295
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,727
Excuse me.

296
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:47,901
If you'd like to carry Mrs.
Smith over the threshold...

297
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,819
It's sort of traditional.

298
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,447
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting.

299
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:56,535
- Oh! No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

300
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,328
Certainly, dear.

301
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:04,084
- Well, here you are.
- Well, sure is pink.

302
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,919
Careful with the bags, please, sir.

303
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,213
Is this your first visit
to Honeymoon Haven?

304
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,217
- Together, anyway.
- Yes.

305
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,761
Let me just show you
some of our special features.

306
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:19,182
These are our Flames of Love,
exclusive with this motel in the area.

307
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,352
If you want the flames to
go higher, you just pull this.

308
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,687
Oh, I see.

309
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,816
- Look, dear. That's kind of romantic.
- In July?

310
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,527
- Honey?
- For a nominal charge,

311
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,196
our staff photographer
will be happy to prepare

312
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,949
a special souvenir album
of your honeymoon stay.

313
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,452
He'll photograph you in some
of our more intimate locations,

314
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,747
in the tub for two, on the bearskin rug.

315
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,583
Gee, real polyester!

316
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,043
And here's the bed.

317
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,878
Right. Thank you.

318
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,922
Thank you, sir.

319
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,551
Oh, of course. Um...

320
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,637
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

321
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,598
And have a happy...

322
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,391
whatever.

323
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,813
Ugh! Can you believe this?

324
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:11,109
Posing as newlyweds to expose
a honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.

325
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,654
- Well...
- What a waste of a great writer.

326
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,823
Writers.

327
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,743
Perry White and his
Sunday magazine exposés.

328
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,204
How am I supposed to get a
Pulitzer Prize writing about a pink bear?

329
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,249
I don't know, I think this
kind of thing should be exposed.

330
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,794
They get kids who are just starting
out, and take them for every cent.

331
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,464
- That's what Mr. White says.
- Yeah?

332
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:36,926
On the other hand, this is kind of nice.
Complimentary champagne.

333
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,137
- Kissing contest tonight.
- Really?

334
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,972
Lois, would ...? Uh...

335
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,849
No.

336
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,517
Hey, Iook at this.

337
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,646
Lois? Gee.

338
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,441
Look what I found.
A complimentary corsage.

339
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,319
Yeah, everything's complimentary
around here till you get the bill.

340
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,029
Yeah.

341
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,533
Gee, you look very pretty.

342
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,286
Thank you, Clark.

343
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,038
Sure.

344
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,625
You know, Lois, um,
I was sort of thinking...

345
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,794
Well, later on... Well, I...

346
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:15,465
I was wondering what you
wanted to do about the arrangements.

347
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,384
What arrangements, Clark?

348
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:23,390
Well, um, I was thinking
primarily about the, um,

349
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,475
sleeping arrangements.

350
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,603
- Mr. Smith?
- Uh-huh.

351
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,273
- The complimentary couch.
- Right.

352
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,901
What? Ooh.

353
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,324
Gosh, it's alive.

354
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,872
Very good, Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

355
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,208
Why am I here? What am I doing here?

356
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,712
Miss Teschmacher,
is this a philosophy seminar?

357
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,589
No. This is a getaway.

358
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,049
- Getaway.
- Right.

359
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,927
Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

360
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,221
What else is ballast for?

361
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,806
Miss Teschmacher,

362
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:09,310
north. Due north.

363
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,605
Right. North.

364
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,295
- Where's Jimmy when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

365
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,256
Yes, gorgeous. Gorgeous.

366
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,799
- Lois?
- Yeah?

367
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:44,804
Look. EVerybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

368
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:48,016
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

369
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,478
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

370
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,564
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

371
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,609
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

372
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,861
That's because you're blind, Clark.

373
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,155
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

374
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,240
- No, I've got it. No, I...
- Yeah. Clark.

375
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,660
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

376
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,287
- God.
- Lois?

377
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,622
- Now, here.
- Right.

378
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,625
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

379
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,755
Son! Excuse me, please.

380
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,632
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

381
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,592
Get down! Get down!

382
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,765
You embarrass me here in front of everybody.

383
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,312
Lois, did you see what almost
happened there? That Iittle boy...

384
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,525
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

385
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,027
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

386
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,031
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles

387
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,201
and you're thinking about food.
Aren't you impressed?

388
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,788
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action,

389
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,457
Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

390
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,417
Him again, huh?

391
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

392
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,381
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

393
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,717
Well, my one-track mind
is telling me that I'm hungry.

394
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,010
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

395
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,554
Hot dog.

396
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,305
Could I have some orange juice?

397
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,600
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know. Okay.

398
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,859
Hey, Mom. Look!

399
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,986
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

400
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,825
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

401
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,497
Oh, my God!

402
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,208
Help!

403
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,127
Help!

404
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,630
Somebody help!

405
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,136
Somebody do something!

406
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,355
Way to go, Superman!

407
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,239
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.

408
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,212
- There you go.
- Again, again!

409
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,633
No, I'm sorry. Only one ride to a customer.

410
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,762
Superman. Superman, it's me, Lois!

411
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,139
Come here. You're gonna get it!

412
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,809
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

413
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,020
Lois Lane.

414
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,273
Well, hello and goodbye.

415
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:46,569
What's the hurry? I mean, seeing
as you happen to be in Niagara Falls?

416
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,365
Happen to be in Niagara Falls.

417
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,660
And Clark...

418
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:57,038
Clark is not around, as usual.

419
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,539
Hmm.

420
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,388
Lois?

421
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,349
Hey, Lois?

422
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,685
- Here you go.
- Where were you?

423
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,688
I was getting hot dogs.
What do you mean?

424
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:25,608
Well, it just seems kind of strange to me
that every time Superman's around,

425
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,652
you disappear.

426
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,029
Superman? You mean he was here?

427
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:34,784
- Golly.
- And you weren't. As usual.

428
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,203
So, what have you
got to say about that?

429
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,330
Darn, I forgot your orange juice.

430
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,249
Clark.

431
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,793
No orange juice?

432
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,847
Mush! Mush!

433
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,057
I am mushing.

434
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,227
Ice and snow.
Is this your idea of a good time?

435
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,022
A good time? Is that all you care about?

436
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,149
North, Miss Teschmacher.

437
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,027
North. North, north, north!

438
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,029
Yes, Lex. North.

439
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,031
Look. It's his home.

440
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,866
It's Superman's home.

441
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,285
Oh, good, more ice.

442
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,709
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

443
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,296
It's fantastic!

444
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:34,802
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

445
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,347
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

446
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,443
- This place is genius.
- Genius.

447
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,698
- Lex.
- I'Il be all right.

448
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,825
No, me.

449
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,994
Oh! Ah!

450
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,330
Why can't you be more careful?

451
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,459
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

452
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,003
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

453
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:14,509
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

454
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,851
This Iooks like some kind of control panel.

455
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,566
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

456
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,695
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

457
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,740
- It's not ice.
- It Iooks Iike a crystal.

458
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:50,878
<i>Kryptonian memory bank.
Education crystal number 308.</i>

459
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,381
- I told you it's a crystal.
- Shut up.

460
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,466
<i>Earth culture, section B.</i>

461
00:43:56,384 --> 00:44:00,346
Trees <i>by Joyce Kilmer

462
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,098
What's this?

<i>- A tree whose hungry mouth...</i>
- He's not here.

466
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:13,651
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's very cute.

467

00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,135
<i>as keeper of the archives of Krypton,</i>

473
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:43,472
<i>it falls to me to tell you of the
darkest episode in our planet's history.</i>

474
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,266
Now, this I wanna hear.

475
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,686
<i>After eons of harmony, there
appeared among us three rebel elements.</i>

476
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,230
<i>What you would call
on Earth "criminals."</i>

477
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,900
Criminals. My kind of people.

478
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,862
<i>Despite all our efforts, we were
unable to change their evil natures,</i>

479
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,405
<i>thElr evil ways.</i>

480
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,741
<i>And as you know, we had no death penalty.</i>

481
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,534
- Sensible enough.
<i>- Therefore,</i>

482
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:07,663
<i>our scientists constructed the Phantom Zone.</i>

483
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:11,626
<i>In it, we placed
these three arch criminals,</i>

484
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,962
<i>imprisoning them there for all eternity.</i>

485
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,340
No possibility for parole?

486
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:22,011
<i>Your father, Jor-El, thought
long and hard upon that question.</i>

487
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,931
- I asked the right question.
<i>- And there is one danger.</i>

488
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,974
<i>The Phantom Zone might,</i>

489
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:32,146
<i>just might, be cracked by
a nuclear explosion in space.</i>

490
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,691
<i>I wish you had not asked me that.</i>

491
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,944
I didn't ask anything.

492
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:41,697
<i>We do not know what would
happen if they were to escape.</i>

493
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:45,910
<i>On Krypton, these
villains were uncontrollable.</i>

494
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:50,873
<i>On Earth, they would have the
same powers, each one of them,</i>

495
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,750
<i>that you have.</i>

496
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,961
- Think of it.
<i>- The first of the three...</i>

497
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,296
- Three.
<i>- Is their leader, General Zod.</i>

498
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,424
- Three super villains.
<i>- Together with Non and Ursa...</i>

499
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:04,095
Each one with the same power he has.

500
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,640
Each one totally dedicated
to corruption, violence and evil.

501
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:12,478
That explains the three alpha waves
I've been getting on my black box.

502
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,146
They'll need a contact on Earth.

503
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,109
Someone with the same contempt for
Iife, Iiberty and the pursuit of happiness.

504
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,568
South, Miss Teschmacher.

505
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,737
You know, it's really amazing.

506
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,490
I never started to
put it together before now.

507
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,661
It's just kind of funny, because a good
reporter doesn't let anything slip by her.

508
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,162
No, of course not.

509
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:33,082
Well, I'm beginning to get the picture.

510
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:38,921
As usual, Lois, I really don't
know what you're talking about.

511
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,300
Tell you what,
I'Il meet you back at the hotel.

512
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,093
What's your hurry, Superman?

513
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,432
Sorry?

514
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,811
I gotta admit,
your disguise is nearly perfect.

515
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,313
You had me fooled.

516
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,606
And I am nobody's fool, believe me.

517
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,191
No, of course not, Lois.

518
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,527
I mean, you just have
an active imagination.

519
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,195
You just get carried away sometimes.

520
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:06,032
- I understand. It can happen to anybody.
- Listen.

521
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:10,619
I'm so sure that you're Superman,
that I'm willing to bet my life on it.

522
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,663
What?

523
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,000
Now, if I'm right, you'll turn into Superman.

524
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,170
And if I'm wrong,

525
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,466
you've got yourself one hell of a story.

526
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,427
You think I'm Superman?

527
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,055
Boy, you certainly have
some imagination, Lois.

528
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,891
For a minute you almost
had me convinced. For a minute.

529
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,101
Bye-bye, baby.

530
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,107
Oh, my God!

531
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,654
Excuse me, please.

532
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,876
Superman!

533
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,589
Lois, swim. Swim!

534
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,257
Help!

535
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,178
Look out for the rocks! Oh, God.

536
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,722
Clark!

537
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,705
Lois, grab the branch!

538
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,833
What?

539
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,465
Help!

540
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,279
Lois, you all right?

541
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,619
I gotcha.

542
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,958
Here, here, here!

543
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,422
Clark!

544
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:36,182
You're what I thought was Superman?

545
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,933
Sorry.

546
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,227
This is really embarrassing.

547
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,717
So this is planet Houston.

548
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,181
A very strange surface.

549
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,978
A primitive sort of Iife form.

550
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,363
Hm...

551
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,990
Did you see that?

552
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,535
Did you see what I did?

553
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,246
I have powers beyond reason here.

554
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,665
We all have them, my dear.

555
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,314
Boy, I sure must have Iooked Iike an idiot.

556
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,942
Jumping in the river, waiting for Mr. Wonderful

557
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,570
who obviously had better things to do.

558
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,491
Well, I'm sure it must have
been something very important, Lois.

559
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,785
And then thinking that you were...

560
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,790
If Perry White could see me now.

561
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,254
Where's my comb?

562
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,632
Where's my comb?

563
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,470
God, not only have I Iost my mind,
I've Iost my comb.

564
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,181
Clark, can you pass me
that brush over there, please?

565
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,974
Sure.

566
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,441
Clark!

567
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,820
- No, no, no. It's okay.
- Let me see your hand. Give it to me.

568
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,406
- No, no. It's all right, Lois.
- Let me look at it.

569
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:55,005
- You are Superman.
- Lois, come on. Don't be s...

570
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,902
I'm sorry.

571
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,823
No, you don't have anything to be sorry about.

572
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,453
I don't know why I did that.

573
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,664
Maybe you wanted to.

574
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,624
I don't think I did.

575
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:36,255
Well, maybe you didn't want to with your mind

576
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,632
but maybe you wanted to with your heart.

577
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,722
We'd better talk.

578
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,479
I'm in Iove with you.

579
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,693
Well, we really better talk.

580
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,988
I'm listening.

581
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,326
We can't talk here. Perry will call
at about 6 to find out what's happening.

582
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:10,497
"What's happening"?
That's the understatement of the year.

583
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,423
Where do you wanna talk?

584
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,264
Lois.

585
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,479
Now that you know,
I think you should know it all.

586
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:35,147
I want to.

587
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,568
Let's go to my place.

588
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,947
Maybe I should change first.

589
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,330
Maybe you should too.

590
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:23,487
- They have a wide selection.
- I can't eat fish.

591
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,616
You can eat anything you want,
Duane. You can eat meat and potatoes.

592
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,661
I couldn't go anywhere
where I was expected to eat fish.

593
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,538
They got beans.

594
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:35,958
I can't eat beans. I'll come
out in a rash if I eat beans.

595
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,126
Look, Duane,

596
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,964
they have a wide selection.

597
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,259
I think I'll try the fish.

598
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:57,187
I don't know. From the Iook of them,
I'll bet $ 10 they're from Los Angeles.

599
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:05,195
Hey, you hippies,
get your butts off the road!

600
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,657
I Iike the globe.
It flashes red like our Krypton sun.

601
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,243
But not this irritating noise.

602
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,704
Make way.

603
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,415
Did I hear right?

604
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,333
That son of a bitch give me an order?

605
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,752
Duane, you take care of it.

606
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,087
- But I...
- Duane.

607
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,883
You gotta learn to kick ass,
you wanna be a peacemaker.

608
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:38,103
AII right. Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

609
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,272
What is this symbol?

610
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,274
Do you follow another leader?

611
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,735
Follow the leader?

612
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,322
Holy skunk sweat.

613
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,657
- AII right.
- A weapon of some sort.

614
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,454
Huh?

615
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,331
Wha...? Oh!

616
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,753
How the hell did you do that?

617
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,845
Jesus H. Christ.

618
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,058
Crude noisemaker.

619
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,617
I'm just checking the tire, you know.

620
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,309
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

621
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,521
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

622
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,358
No, this is a very special place for me.

623
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,777
I wanted you to see it.

624
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,363
Listen, you warm enough?

625
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,742
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

626
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,577
Good.

627
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,871
Come on, Iet me show you.

628
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,745
You see? You only smell strong.

629
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,459
Whoa, baby!

630
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,174
It's only because I didn't want
to lose my place in the orchestra.

631
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:59,429
Oh, my. The circus is in town.

632
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:05,727
Hey, sweet thing.
Set them buns down here.

633
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,194
Let's just hold hands.

634
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,741
Let me know if this tickles.

635
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:24,955
Mm-hm.

636
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:31,753
Your right front tire is flat, Duane.

637
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:41,054
- Sheriff, what happened?
- Willie.

638
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,057
I think my arm's broke.

639
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:49,563
Girl or no girl,
you're gonna spit teeth. Get up.

640
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,070
What the sam hill?

641
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,619
Is that you, Boog?

642
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,791
U h, oh. Uh...

643
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,714
AII right. Get them up and keep them up!

644
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,800
These humans are beginning to bore me.

645
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,562
- Please, mister...
- He's a general.

646
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,148
Please, Mr. General.
Please let my daddy down.

647
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,401
Hey... Hey! Hey, hey!

648
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,614
You okay, Jody?

649
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,578
See, when my father died...

650
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,788
That's my Earth father, I mean.

651
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,626
...I found this crystal.

652
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:55,128
- Huh?
- Uh...

653
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:58,506
This is kind of hard to explain,
but you see, it, um...

654
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,966
It called to me.

655
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,219
Oh.

656
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,638
Yeah. And it brought me here.

657
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,182
It helped me to build this place.

658
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,894
Well, actually, it built it, really.

659
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,064
But, um,

660
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,859
that's when I found out who
I really was, and what I had to do.

661
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,283
So, what do you think? You Iike it?

662
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,160
Like it?

663
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,037
It's incredible.

664
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,917
I mean, not that it couldn't
use a woman's touch, you know?

665
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,128
- Especially around dinnertime.
- Dinner. Oh.

666
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:40,090
I'm sorry. See, I don't
usually do too much about...

667
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,176
Listen, tonight, sky's the limit.
Anything you want.

668
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,310
- I'm home.
- Oh!

669
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,812
Should we eat?

670
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,190
- Sure.
- Great.

671
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,031
Good morning, America.
This is East Houston, Idaho.

672
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:50,035
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

673
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:54,664
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

674
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,207
...Has increased by three.

675
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,461
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

676
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,297
As I Iook west into
East Houston this morning,

677
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,843
I see a town gripped with fear.

678
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,679
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

679
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,390
<i>Okay, yeah, we 've gotta be a...</i>

680
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,602
- No.
<i>- We 've got a crack</i>

681
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,270
<i>in that diode.</i>

682
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,565
<i>- Come in on him ifyou can.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

683
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,692
Who else is seeing this?

684
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:26,738
Well, with this satellite linkup,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

685
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,074
The whole planet Houston?

686
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:30,992
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

687
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:34,662
<i>Get over to the commentator.</i>

688
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,998
You may continue.

689
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,752
As the extraordinary story continues...

690
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,922
- As this extraordinary...
- Enough of this man.

691
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,509
If the whole planet is watching,
Iet's show them something interesting.

692
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,387
<i>Throw down your arms and surrenderi</i>

693
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,807
<i>This is an order.</i>

694
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,978
General Zod does not
take orders. He gives them.

695
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,088
Hey, you all right, buddy?

696
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:57,036
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

697
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,456
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

698
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,167
<i>Yes? yes.</i>

699
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:07,088
<i>The</i> Newsbeat <i>control room has informed
me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...</i>

700
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:10,800
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

701
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,261
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

702
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,846
Where's Superman?

703
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:18,099
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?

704
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,936
General Smythson has
said that nuclear weapon strikes

705
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,815
have been ruled out because of
the danger to the civilian population.

706
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,242
<i>Starting fire run now.</i>

707
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,955
<i>- Stand by, rockets.</i>
- Clear it!

708
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,624
<i>Fire one.</i>

709
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,336
<i>Fire again.</i>

710
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,131
<i>Fire again.</i>

711
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,722
<i>Locked on target. Gotta take a run now.</i>

712
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,974
<i>The rockets didn 't have any effect.</i>

713
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,978
Look. They need machines to fly.

714
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,482
What bravery.

715
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:11,361
Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.

716
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:22,372
<i>We 're out of control.
We don 't understand.</i>

717
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:27,877
<i>We 're coming in,
coming down. Can't control it</i>

718
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,546
<i>We 're coming down.</i>

719
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,394
I win.

720
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,189
I always win.

721
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,986
Is there no one on
this planet to eVen challenge me?

722
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:03,329
- Mm. That was good.
- I thought we might, uh,

723
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,250
abandon the orange juice for once.

724
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,594
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

725
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,726
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

726
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,979
No. No, I really...

727
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,315
I really like it sometimes.

728
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:32,775
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

729
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:38,865
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would haVe met you.

730
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,870
But he is you.

731
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,206
It's kind of confusing.

732
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,084
Not to me, it isn't.

733
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,340
For the first time in my life,

734
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,675
everything's clear.

735
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,994
I'm gonna go change into
something more comfortable.

736
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,344
Come forward.

737
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,471
Your general wishes to speak.

738
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:47,934
I am General Zod, your ruler.

739
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:53,314
Yes, today begins a new order!

740
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,983
Your lands, your possessions,

741
01:09:56,067 --> 01:10:01,280
your very lves will gladly be
given in tribute to me, General Zod.

742
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,866
In return for your obedience,

743
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,703
you will enjoy my generous protection.

744
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:10,790
In other words, you will be allowed to live.

745
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,920
So you are a general?

746
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,424
And who is your superior?

747
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:25,304
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

748
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:30,393
Or all of his cities will end up like this one.

749
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:34,522
<i>Your father and l have tried to
anticipate your every question, Kal-El.</i>

750
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,358
<i>This is the one we hoped you would not ask.</i>

751
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:42,155
But I have to,
because she's everything I want in life.

752
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,950
<i>And she, the one you have chosen,</i>

753
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,411
<i>she feels as much for you?</i>

754
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:49,954
Yes.

755
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,956
<i>Then, if this is what you wish,</i>

756
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,168
<i>ifyou intend to live your life with a mortal,</i>

757
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,463
<i>you must live as a mortal.</i>

758
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,673
<i>You must become one of them.</i>

759
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:07,597
<i>This crystal chamber has harnessed
the rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

760
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,807
<i>Once exposed to these rays,</i>

761
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:14,604
<i>all your great powers
on Earth will disappear forever.</i>

762
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,818
<i>But consider.</i>

763
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:23,654
<i>Once it is done, there is no return.</i>

764
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,823
<i>You will become an ordinary man.</i>

765
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:29,035
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

766
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,122
<i>You can be hurt like an ordinary man.</i>

767
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,469
<i>Oh, my son, are you sure?</i>

768
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,269
Mother...

769
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,855
I Iove her.

770
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,884
You did all that for me?

771
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:54,472
Huh. I don't know what to say.

772
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,851
- Just say you Iove me.
- Oh.

773
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,863
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

774
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:56,242
I magine what they'll do
to the world if we resist.

775
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,225
The whole place is gonna fall!

776
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,643
Watch it!

777
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,473
You are the one they call president?

778
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,683
I am.

779
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:50,815
I see you are practiced
in worshiping things that fly.

780
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,317
Good.

781
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,487
Rise before Zod.

782
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,828
Now, kneel before Zod.

783
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,593
You are not the president.

784
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:24,515
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

785
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,600
I am the man they are protecting.

786
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,645
I am the president.

787
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,982
I'Il kneel before you if it will save lives.

788
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,733
It will.

789
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:37,736
Starting with your own.

790
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,042
What I do now,

791
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:55,379
I do for the sake of the people of the world.

792
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:59,675
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

793
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:03,262
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

794
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,431
I wish I knew.

795
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,145
Oh, God.

796
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,147
Zod.

797
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,233
Hey.

798
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:20,196
You're awfully quiet over there.
I'm supposed to be the shy one.

799
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:21,822
Hm? Oh.

800
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,825
Yeah, I was just thinking,

801
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:28,495
I can't believe what you've given up for me.

802
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:32,833
Are you kidding?
I didn't do it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

803
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,545
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

804
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:40,674
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

805
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,593
Hurry up.

806
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,762
- Come on.
- Okay.

807
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,681
My back's stiff.

808
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:50,142
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

809
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,398
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

810
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,236
Thank you.

811
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:05,074
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

812
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,993
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

813
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,455
Hi, what would you folks like?

814
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:15,209
I'd Iike a cheeseburger
with everything on it, and a Coke,

815
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:19,004
an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

816
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,217
- And for you, sir?
- I'Il think about it when I get back.

817
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,843
Right. That's one cheeseburger...

818
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,763
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

819
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,640
Coming right up.

820
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:33,102
- Sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

821
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,397
Can I buy you something to eat?

822
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,691
No, thank you.

823
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,194
Excuse me. I think
you're sitting in my seat.

824
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,531
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

825
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:52,037
Gee, I think perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

826
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,000
Yeah? Well, let me
know when he comes in.

827
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,669
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.

828
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,298
Excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

829
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,342
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

830
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,307
Now, listen, Rocky,
your steak's coming right up.

831
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:15,602
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

832
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,397
After you.

833
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,108
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

834
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,404
Clark!

835
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,033
You all right, fella?

836
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:31,577
He's gonna be fine, just give me that.

837
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,497
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

838
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:40,878
I think maybe we ought to hire
a bodyguard from now on.

839
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:44,340
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

840
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,508
I know that, Lois.

841
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,011
I wish he were here.

842
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,602
Clark.

843
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:01,190
Boy, you just don't have
enough sense to stay down, do you?

844
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,912
Settle down!

845
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,290
I don't like your meat anyway.

846
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,002
Oh, God.

847
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:31,970
Clark? Clark?

848
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,431
Clark, can you get up?

849
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,309
- It's all right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow.

850
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,553
Try and get up in that chair.

851
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,273
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

852
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:48,821
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.

853
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,198
I'Il turn the box on.

854
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,910
<i>We interrupt this
program for an urgent message</i>

855
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,038
<i>from the President of the United States.</i>

856
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,499
<i>This is your president.</i>

857
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:05,712
<i>On behalf of my country, and in the name
of the other leaders of the world</i>

858
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:08,841
<i>with whom I have today consulted,</i>

859
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:12,261
<i>I hereby abdicate</i>

860
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:16,682
<i>all authority and control over this planet</i>

861
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,767
<i>to General Zod.</i>

862
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:20,811
Zod.

863
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:24,481
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions</i>

864
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:29,236
<i>will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.</i>

865
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,405
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

866
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:35,325
<i>- Superman, where...?
- Who is this Superman?</i>

867
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:41,582
<i>- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.</i>

868
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,375
<i>I defy you.</i>

869
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:47,004
<i>Come Come and kneel before Zod.</i>

870
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:50,883
<i>Zod!</i>

871
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,178
- Here? When?
- When?

872
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:58,098
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

873
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,352
I have to go back.

874
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,480
You can't go back.

875
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,274
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

876
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:10,652
I've gotta try, damn it.
I've gotta try something, anything.

877
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:13,697
It's not your fault.

878
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:17,242
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

879
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,454
They knew.

880
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,873
I heard them.

881
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:25,292
I just didn't listen.

882
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,908
Hey, come on! Please!

883
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,536
God.

884
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,245
Father?

885
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,080
Mother?

886
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,419
Boy, I really wish you could hear me.

887
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,589
Because I need you.

888
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,426
See, I...

889
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,722
I, uh...

890
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,850
I failed.

891
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:13,108
Father!

892
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:29,184
You're master of all you survey.

893
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,395
And so I was yesterday.

894
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,022
And the day before.

895
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,204
Hello, there.

896
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,624
Lex Luthor.

897
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,170
Lex Luthor.

898
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,632
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

899
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,760
I told you this was a puny planet.

900
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,554
Wait just a moment.

901
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,849
Wait until you get to know
me better. Will you, please?

902
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:12,728
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

903
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:14,896
I can give you the brass ring,

904
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:19,484
the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

905
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:24,906
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

906
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:29,369
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

907
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:33,832
We have all of this without you.

908
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,793
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

909
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,588
Magnificent One,

910
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,967
what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

911
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,552
The son of Jor-El.

912
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:49,389
- The son of Jor-El? On this planet?
- Aye.

913
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,142
Possibly you know him better
by his <i>nom de voyage</i>

914
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:55,437
or his name he travels under:

915
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,355
- Superman.
- Oh.

916
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:01,359
So this is Superman.

917
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:03,945
How do you know of Jor-El?

918
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:08,533
My Fullness, as I explained to you before,

919
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:11,119
I'm about the best there is.

920
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,579
Revenge.

921
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,790
We will kill the son of our jailer.

922
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:17,959
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

923
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,128
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

924
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,339
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

925
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:27,135
But, uh, magnificent one,

926
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,846
he's just one

927
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,473
where you are three.

928
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,728
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

929
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,438
Wait!

930
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,483
First, you must find him.

931
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:45,070
And Lex Baby is the only one
who knows where he is.

932
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,157
What do you want?

933
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,451
Well, general,

934
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:54,204
the world is a big place.

935
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,790
Thank goodness, uh,

936
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:59,000
my needs are small.

937
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:06,258
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

938
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,678
What do you want?

939
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,055
Australia.

940
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:18,103
I can't understand it.

941
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,398
Where is he? He shows up
every time a cat gets stuck in a tree

942
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,984
and now he's decided
to pull a disappearing act.

943
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,152
Maybe we haven't figured out his game plan.

944
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:29,489
Game plan? It's fourth down,
the two-minute warning has sounded

945
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,658
and the ball is deep in our territory.

946
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:35,370
Just how brilliant do you have to be? I mean...

947
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,667
Superman's got something up
his sleeve. That's for sure, chief.

948
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,671
- We just haven't figured it out, right?
- He'll be here!

949
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,340
If it's at all possible, he'll be here.

950
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:51,678
See? Yeah, and she knows
his plays better than anybody.

951
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,642
Yeah, better than anybody.

952
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:00,395
Maybe he hasn't heard about it yet, chief.

953
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,488
Sounds like an earthquake.

954
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,368
Quick, take a picture.

955
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,292
Get down the back way! Get out!

956
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:12,133
Oh! Ow!

957
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:25,438
You all right, chief?

958
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:30,193
Even with all this knowledge when will
these dummies Iearn to use a doorknob?

959
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:32,320
Hi.

960
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,950
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

961
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,451
Lex Luthor.

962
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:41,579
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

963
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:44,374
Yes, Your Grace.

964
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:48,461
But what I've given you
is the next best thing.

965
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:52,465
You just hold on to that little lady,
and he'll be along.

966
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,217
See, they have this relationship.

967
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:58,638
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

968
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:01,474
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

969
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:05,228
What an undemanding male
this Superman must be.

970
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:07,439
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself.

971
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,816
Wait!

972
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:11,609
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

973
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,904
Kill the rest, starting with him.

974
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:17,657
Wait. Wait.

975
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,660
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room?

976
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,579
We had a few laughs, right?

977
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:42,599
General,

978
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,393
would you care to step outside?

979
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:47,020
Superman!

980
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,898
Superman, thank God.

981
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:51,399
I mean, get him!

982
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,277
Come to me, son of Jor-El!

983
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,322
Kneel before Zod!

984
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:18,718
Watch out. You all right?

985
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,313
Wait there.

986
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,741
Son of Jor-El.

987
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:46,663
- We were beginning to think you were a coward.
- I'm not a coward, Zod.

988
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,666
Let him prove it.

989
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:11,479
Then die as you deserve to!

990
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,867
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

991
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,286
Man, this is gonna be good.

992
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:33,334
Take him. He's yours.

993
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:02,906
<i>Come on! Kill himi</i>

994
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,657
<i>Superman.</i>

995
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:16,294
The big one's just as strong as Superman.

996
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:45,073
Ah!

997
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:50,536
Hold him.

998
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,748
Wow, home run.

999
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,447
Oh, my God! My baby!

1000
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:34,872
Thank you.

1001
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,175
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

1002
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:49,095
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

1003
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:50,555
He cares.

1004
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,975
He actually cares for these Earth people.

1005
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:57,437
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

1006
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,856
Sentimental idiot.

1007
01:37:05,445 --> 01:37:07,947
He's caged Non.

1008
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:10,116
I'Il draw his fire

1009
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:12,160
with some of my own.

1010
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:50,281
Get out of here! The rig's gonna blow!

1011
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:04,003
Get away from that truck!

1012
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:56,097
- Did you see that?
- They went down there.

1013
01:39:37,763 --> 01:39:39,307
Hey, what the...?

1014
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:42,602
Superman, help us!

1015
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,152
Superman.

1016
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:46,332
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

1017
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:50,086
You people, get back.

1018
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:52,380
Here, take the end of this.

1019
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:08,312
No! Don't do it!

1020
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:10,398
The people!

1021
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:16,904
Throw it!

1022
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,723
- This way, please. This way.
- Help me.

1023
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:54,191
Where's your wife, sir?
I got her. I got her. Don't worry.

1024
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,861
He's dead. He's dead.

1025
01:41:57,528 --> 01:42:01,157
- Superman is dead.
- He's not coming out.

1026
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,618
- They've killed Superman.
- Oh, no!

1027
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:05,995
- What are we gonna do?
- He's dead.

1028
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:07,455
Let's go get them!

1029
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:10,207
- Come on, let's go!
- I know judo. Come on, let's go!

1030
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:41,405
Hey, hey, hey!

1031
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:44,825
What sound?

1032
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:47,411
You forgot your cha...

1033
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:51,082
Wait a minute!

1034
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:58,923
- I'm holding it, I'm holding it!
- I got it.

1035
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,509
I can't see what's happening.

1036
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,849
- My hair!
- Your hair? What about mine?

1037
01:43:08,974 --> 01:43:10,351
Hold on!

1038
01:43:20,778 --> 01:43:22,655
Yeah, yeah, I got your message.

1039
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:25,241
No, go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah?

1040
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:27,910
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

1041
01:44:33,142 --> 01:44:35,895
Look, he's alive. He's alive!

1042
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:39,774
It'll be all right.

1043
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:56,624
Come back, please!

1044
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:59,293
Please come back!

1045
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:05,007
So he is a coward affer all.

1046
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:06,675
Damn it!

1047
01:45:06,759 --> 01:45:08,636
Come back, Superman!

1048
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,060
What about us?

1049
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:19,271
- Don't leave us!
- We can't handle it without you.

1050
01:45:19,355 --> 01:45:22,399
- It's not our fault.
- He chickened out.

1051
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,443
Ah, phony!

1052
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,738
Superman didn't even do nothing.

1053
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:30,157
Come on, let's go.

1054
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:34,078
Get away from here. Jimmy.

1055
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:40,125
Our victory is complete.

1056
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:42,294
The son of Jor-El has fled.

1057
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:45,339
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

1058
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:49,301
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

1059
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:51,595
The next time?

1060
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,431
What am I gonna do with you people?

1061
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:57,351
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.

1062
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:59,228
What do I get from my triple threat?

1063
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:02,940
"Bow, yield, kneel ."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.

1064
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:07,361
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

1065
01:46:07,444 --> 01:46:11,198
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

1066
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:14,535
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

1067
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,663
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Kill him!

1068
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:19,874
Superman's address?

1069
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:24,086
Come.

1070
01:46:24,169 --> 01:46:29,383
The three of us will
crush the son of our jailer.

1071
01:46:29,633 --> 01:46:32,553
Why not increase his handicap?

1072
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:35,598
Since he cares so much
for these Earth creatures,

1073
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:37,850
Iet us take his favorite.

1074
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:34,406
Hey, ever heard of parachutes?

1075
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:41,664
Another small step for mankind.

1076
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,458
Scruffy.

1077
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,628
So morbid.

1078
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:51,465
A sentimental replica
of a planet long since vanished.

1079
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:54,301
No style at all.

1080
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:59,348
I expect better manners from my guests, Zod.

1081
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:15,197
We must combine our strength.

1082
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:42,683
Fools! Take him!

1083
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,172
What?

1084
01:49:17,176 --> 01:49:20,888
We used to play this game at school.
Never was very good at it.

1085
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:25,225
Superman, I knew that you'd... Huh?

1086
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:30,397
Wrong again, Zod.

1087
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:35,694
No, no!

1088
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:38,864
Release the general or we'll tear her apart.

1089
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:41,825
Superman, no! No!

1090
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:43,243
Superman, don't!

1091
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:45,913
AII right!

1092
01:49:57,299 --> 01:50:00,469
Did you really think we
would give up our advantage?

1093
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:05,349
Now, the son of Jor-El
will be my slave. Forever.

1094
01:50:06,058 --> 01:50:09,436
If not, the millions of Earthlings you protect

1095
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,814
will pay for your defiance.

1096
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:13,982
Destroy this place.

1097
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:17,361
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- We have no more use for this one.

1098
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:20,906
- Kill him.
- Me?

1099
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:22,324
Lex Luthor?

1100
01:50:22,407 --> 01:50:26,495
General, you came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1101
01:50:26,829 --> 01:50:28,163
Silence!

1102
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:29,957
Well, look...

1103
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,709
Watch it. Don't touch me.

1104
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:35,212
Guy's a clod.

1105
01:50:37,089 --> 01:50:39,925
Promises were made, gifts exchanged.

1106
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:43,637
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1107
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,098
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1108
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:52,688
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber.

1109
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:55,149
It takes away their powers, see,

1110
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,776
and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1111
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,278
Now, if you could...

1112
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:00,737
Shh, shh!

1113
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:05,492
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1114
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:07,161
That's a molecule chamber.

1115
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:11,165
It makes people like you
into people like me.

1116
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:13,000
You've done well, Lex Luthor.

1117
01:51:13,792 --> 01:51:18,839
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1118
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:22,009
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia,

1119
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:23,886
activate the machine.

1120
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:28,056
Thank you.

1121
01:51:30,642 --> 01:51:32,644
With your permission.

1122
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:49,096
And now, finally...

1123
01:52:59,398 --> 01:53:01,775
Take my hand

1124
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:07,614
and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1125
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:48,322
He switched it.

1126
01:53:48,405 --> 01:53:49,698
He did it to them.

1127
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:52,409
I mean, the lights were on out here

1128
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,494
while he was safe in there.

1129
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,832
Hey, you know something?

1130
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,251
You're a real pain in the neck!

1131
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:12,596
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

1132
01:54:13,764 --> 01:54:17,559
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1133
01:54:17,642 --> 01:54:19,895
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1134
01:54:19,978 --> 01:54:24,149
Hey, I was with you all the time.
That was beautiful.

1135
01:54:24,232 --> 01:54:26,485
Did you see the way
they fell into our trap?

1136
01:54:26,568 --> 01:54:28,779
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1137
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:32,324
Look. Look, Superman.

1138
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:34,534
I got a proposition for you.

1139
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:37,329
Now, don't stop me till you've heard this,

1140
01:54:37,412 --> 01:54:41,041
because I know I owe you one,
but we're in the North Pole, right?

1141
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:43,377
Let's wipe the slate clean.

1142
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:47,172
If you give me a ride back,
I promise to turn over a whole new leaf...

1143
01:54:51,134 --> 01:54:54,429
It looks so beautiful from up here.

1144
01:54:54,513 --> 01:54:58,225
I guess I'll never get to fly with you again.

1145
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:01,436
Oh, no. Anywhere you want to go.

1146
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,688
You don't have to worry.

1147
01:55:03,772 --> 01:55:06,691
I'll never tell them who you really are.

1148
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:09,736
I know, Lois. I know.

1149
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:25,085
See you later.

1150
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,743
- Hi, Leueen.
- Hm.

1151
01:56:17,387 --> 01:56:18,472
Hi.

1152
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:22,767
Hi.

1153
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:26,605
How'd you sleep? All right?

1154
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,236
No, I didn't close my eyes all night.

1155
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:42,120
- Look, Lois...
- I understand, I understand.

1156
01:56:43,622 --> 01:56:48,335
I sat up all night listening
to the voices of reason.

1157
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:51,713
You know how vile it is to hear
the first bird of the morning

1158
01:56:51,796 --> 01:56:53,715
when you've been crying all night?

1159
01:56:53,798 --> 01:56:57,761
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

1160
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:02,933
I guess it's sort of like being
married to a doctor, you know.

1161
01:57:03,016 --> 01:57:05,644
The doctor gets awakened
in the middle of the night

1162
01:57:05,727 --> 01:57:09,022
and the wife has to cope
with the fact that he's gone.

1163
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:11,441
I guess I'm just too selfish.

1164
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:14,319
No, no. You're not selfish at all.

1165
01:57:14,402 --> 01:57:18,573
Yes, I am selfish when it
comes to you. I am selfish.

1166
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:21,868
And I'm jealous of the whole world.

1167
01:57:26,206 --> 01:57:31,086
Lois, it may not be easy for you to
hear this now, but someday you'll...

1168
01:57:31,169 --> 01:57:33,380
Clark...

1169
01:57:33,463 --> 01:57:37,842
Look, don't tell me that I'll meet somebody.

1170
01:57:38,677 --> 01:57:42,305
You're kind of a tough act to follow, you know.

1171
01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:49,396
Now, I'm gonna be fine.
You don't have to worry about me.

1172
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:56,695
I Iike worrying about you.

1173
01:57:57,696 --> 01:58:00,282
Would you stop?

1174
01:58:00,365 --> 01:58:03,577
Don't you know that this is killing me?

1175
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:07,872
Do you know what it's like to
have you come in here every morning

1176
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:10,625
and not be able to talk to you?

1177
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:14,421
Not be able to show I
have any feelings for you?

1178
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:18,383
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

1179
01:58:18,466 --> 01:58:21,344
I don't even know what to call you.

1180
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:27,517
Lois, I don't know what to say.

1181
01:58:30,604 --> 01:58:34,482
I don't know. Just say that you Iove me.

1182
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:23,365
Um... Gee, Lois, are you okay?
What happened?

1183
01:59:23,448 --> 01:59:25,325
- I just got so dizzy.
- You all right?

1184
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:28,787
- I don't know.
- Get her some water, will you?

1185
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:31,498
That's what happens
when I don't have orange juice.

1186
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:35,126
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine!
- Breathe. Breathe, Lois.

1187
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:38,880
- I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
- Good for you. Good.

1188
01:59:38,963 --> 01:59:41,132
- God.
- Just drink.

1189
01:59:41,216 --> 01:59:43,885
- Okay.
- Just sip it, sip it, sip it.

1190
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,929
- I'm fine.
- Boy...

1191
01:59:48,598 --> 01:59:50,308
What was I talking about before?

1192
01:59:50,392 --> 01:59:53,103
If I know you,
it was probably about Superman.

1193
01:59:53,687 --> 01:59:55,980
- Him again?
- Clark, Clark.

1194
01:59:56,064 --> 01:59:59,693
You've gotta stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

1195
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:02,320
Nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

1196
02:00:02,404 --> 02:00:04,030
Well, I'Il try to remember that.

1197
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:06,574
You better remember that. I appreciate you.

1198
02:00:06,658 --> 02:00:08,827
- You do?
- Sure.

1199
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:11,663
- Especially if you get me a hamburger.
- Uh-huh.

1200
02:00:11,746 --> 02:00:15,166
A hamburger. At 9 a.m.?

1201
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:17,377
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

1202
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:19,379
Everything on it.

1203
02:00:19,462 --> 02:00:21,923
- Oh, and...
- Orange juice. Sure.

1204
02:00:22,006 --> 02:00:24,008
Freshly squeezed. Okay.

1205
02:00:24,092 --> 02:00:26,052
Isn't he a nice guy?

1206
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:30,306
Well, let's see what trouble
I can get into today.

1207
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:33,643
Leueen.

1208
02:00:34,185 --> 02:00:35,937
What's happening in the world?

1209
02:00:38,815 --> 02:00:40,358
Leueen?

1210
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:54,372
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1211
02:00:54,456 --> 02:00:56,374
Give me another plate of this garbage.

1212
02:00:56,458 --> 02:00:59,419
Garbage? That's my number-one special,
Rocky.

1213
02:00:59,502 --> 02:01:03,131
AII right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1214
02:01:04,424 --> 02:01:08,595
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1215
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:20,482
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1216
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:22,192
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1217
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:28,698
Now cool it, Rocky.

1218
02:01:29,783 --> 02:01:30,950
Take it easy, will you?

1219
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:34,537
I just had this joint
fixed. It cost me a fortune.

1220
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:53,306
Oh, God!

1221
02:02:04,943 --> 02:02:07,070
This order's to go.

1222
02:02:14,536 --> 02:02:18,331
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1223
02:02:21,084 --> 02:02:24,420
Oh, I've been, uh, working out.

1224
02:02:48,653 --> 02:02:50,655
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

1225
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:53,324
Sorry I've been away so long.

1226
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:56,536
I won't let you down again.
