1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,560
He's the most handsome and
coolest guy in all of year three.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,560
I think we're going to sleep together.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,520
I like it.
I think it's a little hot.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,020
You! Don't be some dick tease.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,280
Ingrid..
I miss you.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,580
You look like a slut.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm not going behind
your back and talkign to Ingrid.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,220
Where are you?
-I can't come.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,620
Who was that?

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,200
Jonas!

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,940
Sorry, I have to go.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,480
Hello.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,040
Hi.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,080
So sad?

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,260
No!

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,240
I bought coffee for you!

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,040
Thanks.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,280
What should we talk about?

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,620
Nothing. It's just nice with coffee.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,100
What did you do on the weekend?

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,020
Eh.. Nothing.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,220
What did you do on Friday?

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,520
Mom had her birthday.

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,680
So you were just home?

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,900
Yeah!

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,120
Did something happen on Friday?

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,840
No, I was just wondering what you did.

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,680
I think that maybe
Jonas was with Ingrid.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,060
Do you know anything about it?

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,380
No.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,180
Why do you think so?

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,100
I talked on the phone with
him and heard her voice in the background.

33
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,160
Did you ask him?

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,360
Yeah, but hee said it was his sister.

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,840
Maybe it was.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,480
I know Ingrid's voice.
We were best friends since we were four.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,900
Say that to him.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,180
I did, but he got really mad
 and said that I didn't trust him.

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,840
Eva, why are you with him?

40
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,640
What do you mean?

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,100
Jonas is my bro, but why
are you with someone you don't trust?

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,420
So do you think I should trust him?

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,400
Or you could go for option three.

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,080
You could ask Ingrid.

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll soon meet William again.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,480
I think we have something going on,
but the age difference is quite sick.

47
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,880
There can really be something between us.

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:20,980
He said he thinks I'm really special. 
And I'm ready for it.

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,160
Did I tell you I had an orgasm?

50
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,360
<i>[Smile.]</i>

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,080
How was that?

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,420
<i>[Smile yourself.]</i>
How was that?

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,240
<i>[Smile yourself.]</i>

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,440
It was a bit like
a sneeze. Just down there.
<i>[Smile yourself.]</i>

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,020
It was a bit like
a sneeze. Just down there.

56
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,140
Like a sneeze?

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,200
Hm-hm.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,420
<i>[I am smiling.]</i>

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,620
I think I know
why everyone got an orgasm with him.

60
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,080
<i>[You're angry.]</i>
I think I know
why everyone got an orgasm with him.

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,560
Yeah, why is that?

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,900
Because he was really big.

63
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,680
You can't go around telling
people about his dick.

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,000
Why not?

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,300
You're asking why you
can't tell people about his most vulnerable body part?

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,400
Firstly, that body part wasn't that vulnerable.

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,540
And secondly, he'll surely talk
about my body to his friends.

68
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,080
Girls should also
be able to do that.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,640
I support equality and feminism.

70
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,620
But Vilde, firstly, size doesn't 
have anything to do with orgasms.

71
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,040
And secondly, just because guys
are fools, doesn't mean we have to be fools as well.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,220
It doesn't have anything
 to do with equality at all.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Whatever..

74
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,980
But it was good, then?
That's the most important.

75
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,660
It was really good.

76
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,080
But, there's just one thing.

77
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,460
There's no one who tells you
it practically runs out again.

78
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,200
You didn't use a condom?

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,440
No, he said he tends to not use one.
-Vilde!

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,360
What the fuck is that?

81
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,200
Where are those from?
-Sana knows someone.

82
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,380
It's to fetch the toilet paper.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,460
But I need to have a payment first.
-That's not how it works.

84
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,960
He receives payment from his people,
and then you can pay your people.

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,400
But I don't have "people".

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,340
Do you think MasterCard operates without people?

87
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,120
Hello.

88
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,520
Hi!
-Hello.

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,380
Are you guys coming
to the Halloween party on Friday?

90
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,060
Yeah, maybe.
-We're coming!

91
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,980
Good. We'll talk.

92
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
Bye!

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,940
You smell like smoke.

94
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,700
What's up, Eva?

95
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,240
This doesn't bother me..

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,940
I think there's something
 between you and Ingrid.

97
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,700
Really?

98
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,220
You still think so?

99
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,820
I know I heard her voice on the phone!

100
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,620
For the last time, that was my sister
talking in the background!

101
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,040
Why would she be talking in the background?
-Because she thought it was my mom!

102
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,280
Wasn't your mom at home?

103
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,080
Jonas!

104
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,040
You said you would help
your mom with something at home.

105
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,640
But your mom wasn't even home?
-No, she came home later. That's why I called.

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,720
Why are you lying to me?
-I'm not lying!

107
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,680
This is not working.

108
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,780
It doesn't work?

109
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
What do you mean by that?

110
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,180
Do you want a break or something?

111
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,240
That's what you want.
-No, that's not what I want!

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,140
Stop being so
insecure all the time.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,220
What's up with you? Why aren't you
 listening to me? I want to talk to you.

114
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,320
Can't you come to
the point? Just admit it!

115
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,320
I got a glass of water and..
He's a guy who only looks-

116
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,060
How's it going with
the alcohol for the party?

117
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,580
I sent William a message if he
could get it for us. -Can he?

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,960
He hasn't replied yet. He's extremely busy.
He's in the third year, and he's the bus boss.

119
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,200
He has so much to think about in his situation.
We haven't talked properly since last time.

120
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,200
But we do keep in
contact via Snapchat.

121
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,160
You know what I did yesterday?

122
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,320
No?

123
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,640
I sent William a topless picture.

124
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,900
What did you do?

125
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,760
They're just boobs.
William likes confident girls.

126
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,160
What did he reply?
-He didn't reply directly, but he took a screenshot.

127
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,520
Now listen, Einstein.

128
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,980
William is not interested.

129
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,100
How do you know?
-He didn't even reply to a topless picture.

130
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:16,240
In "The Game" it says that boys
don't reply to make girls more interested.

131
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,860
If I were you, I would put down "The Game" 
and start reading "He's just not that into you".

132
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,060
Why are you always so mean?

133
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,640
Hello?!

134
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,460
We are her friends. If we don't
tell her the truth, who will?

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,600
She's sending topless pictures
to a guy who is lying to sleep with her.

136
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,760
That's mean!
-You don't know if he's lying!

137
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,540
He doesn't really seem
like the most trustworthy guy.

138
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,580
I mean that you can't just 
claim people are lying without having proof.

139
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,320
Sometimes you have to trust people.

140
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Everyone knows that guys lie.

141
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,700
And how do you know that?
-Their stories are inconsistent.

142
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,840
They get mad when you ask.
Afterwards, they get a bad conscience..

143
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
.. and they start drowning you in compliments.

144
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,580
Believe me, just wait and see.

145
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,680
William will break her heart.

146
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,340
<i>[You know you're the coolest, best, hottest, 
funniest, prettiest girl in the whole world? I love you.]</i>

147
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,980
Were you with Jonas last Friday?
Just answer me.

148
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,200
Last Friday?

149
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,300
Yeah! Yeah, I was with Jonas.

150
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,160
He didn't tell you?

151
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,860
Oops.

152
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,220
Fuck you!

153
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,040
No, fuck you Eva. Fuck you!

154
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:40,400
<i>[I talked to Ingrid and she told me EVERYTHING!]</i>

155
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,220
You're sitting here?

156
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm sitting here.

157
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,640
Someone's obviously trying to reach you.
-Yeah.

158
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,020
Who is Jonas?

159
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,160
My boyfriend.

160
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Or, eh..

161
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,900
You don't know if he's your boyfriend, or?

162
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,320
He is my boyfriend, it's just that..

163
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,440
We're having a fight.

164
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,000
Hey, you..

165
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,860
Fuck him.

166
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,340
If he makes such a 
nice girl cry, fuck him.

167
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,620
This can't happen.

168
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,240
There you are.

169
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
What are you guys doing?

170
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,280
Eva's fighting with her boyfriend.
Have you greeted Eva?

171
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,540
Eva, this is Iben.
My girlfriend.

172
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,740
You shouldn't be talking to me.
Iben's really good with boyfriend trouble.

173
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,760
She's fighting with her boyfriend.
-Ah, poor you.

174
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,940
I'll give you two some time.

175
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm fine, really.
You don't need to-

176
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,980
Believe me, I know what it's like.

177
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:30,340
You're a first year. When people try to figure
out who they are, and they change a lot.

178
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,480
People might not be
the way you thought they were.

179
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,940
The same goes for boyfriends.
When I was in the first year my boyfriend was an asshole.

180
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,340
He cheated five
times without me knowing about it.

181
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,840
It gets better when you get older.

182
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,940
It's going really well between me
and Christoffer, because third year guys are mature.

183
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,380
We can talk about everything,
and I trust him 110%.

184
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,920
You'll get a more mature
relationship, if you know what I mean.

185
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,300
Are you also in the third year?

186
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,960
No, second. But a lot happens
from your first to your second year.

187
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,860
Don't take relationships so seriously.

188
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,940
Think of it as something temporary.
Don't let him stand in your way.

189
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:32,280
It's Halloween! There's a really cool
party here. And you're sitting here like a sad ballerina.

190
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,540
Don't you agree?

191
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,260
Come on, let's go.
Let's have an awesome time.

192
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,580
Thanks, you're really kind..

193
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,260
But I don't feel too good, 
so I think I might go home.

194
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,080
Are you sure?

195
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,280
Really sure?

196
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,900
It'll get better.

197
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,460
Black Swan?

198
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,720
I can't handle us breaking up.

199
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,820
The thing is that 
Ingrid's brother is a dealer.

200
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,960
Dealer of what?
-Greens.

201
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,140
Have you started smoking marijuana?

202
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,460
Huh?

203
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,900
Why?

204
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,680
You're reacting as if it was heroin.

205
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,660
Marijuana is a drug.

206
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,900
So you think it's equally dangerous as heroin?
-Yes!

207
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,520
I was at Ingrid's brother's place to buy stuff.

208
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,420
Ingrid showed up. But she lives there,
so I couldn't say anything to you.

209
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,980
Why didn't you say anything to me?
-Seriously? Did you see your reaction just now?

210
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,820
Anyway, my point is that
there's nothing between me and Ingrid.

211
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,400
And there never
will be anything, either.

212
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,580
It was really dumb of me to lie.

213
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,600
The fact that you believe there was..

214
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,820
That really hurt me.

215
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,800
Because I trust you 100%.

216
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,440
You have to start trusting me.

217
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,140
I would never do 
anything that could destroy us.

218
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,560
Because it's us.

219
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,760
Right?

220
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,420
Don't cry.
