1
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,900
It all started on the day that I died.

2
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,900
If there had been an obituary...

3
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,300
...it would've described
the unremarkable life...

4
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,000
... of an unremarkable woman...

5
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,200
... survived by no one.

6
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
But there was no obituary...

7
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,600
... because the day that I died...

8
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,800
... was also the day I started to live.

9
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
But that comes later.

10
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,300
This was my life.

11
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Days blended together,
consistently ordinary...

12
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,900
... thanks to a job that was the practical
version of my passion.

13
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
- I' m sorry.
- Watch where you' re going!

14
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,100
I was supposed to be an artist by now.

15
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,500
Instead...

16
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,200
...I was designing ads for beauty cream.

17
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,600
- You are so addicted to that stuff, Sally.
- Happily.

18
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
- Beau-Iine is magic in a bottle.
- I don't know how you get it.

19
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,600
- It's not even in production yet.
- We have our ways.

20
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,400
- Hey.
- No!

21
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,200
Headaches again.
My brain's all tight and cranky.

22
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,200
In one week, precisely, we will Iaunch
the most exciting...

23
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,300
...and revolutionary product
to hit the beauty industry since...

24
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
...soap.

25
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,800
Beau-Iine.

26
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,500
Now, Beau-Iine doesn't
just hide the effects of aging...

27
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,700
...it actually reverses them.

28
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,900
However, with change...

29
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,500
...must come sacrifice.

30
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,700
My husband...

31
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,100
...and I have decided that
it's time for me to step aside...

32
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,900
...as the face of Hedare.

33
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,100
It has been a magnificent 15 years.

34
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,100
But we have decided to choose
a new face to represent Beau-Iine.

35
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,700
Exactly.

36
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,300
Drina.

37
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,500
The future of Hedare Beauty.

38
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,900
And now, Iadies and gentlemen,
I Iook forward...

39
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
...to seeing you at the gala, where you
can toast to Drina and our success.

40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Careful, George.
She's not old enough to drink.

41
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,500
You've got more talent than anybody
in the building, which I hate you for.

42
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,300
Sal, this is my first Iead campaign.
It's gotta be perfect. You know that.

43
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,900
What is wrong with you?!

44
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
Good Iuck.

45
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,700
Yeah.

46
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,700
You simply couldn't resist it, could you?

47
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,300
You had to make
a scene out of it, Laurel.

48
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,000
What's the matter, George?

49
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,600
Did I steal your moment?

50
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,400
Come in!

51
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,900
Hi, Mr. Hedare.

52
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Did you still want to see me, or...?

53
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,700
- Sit.
- Right. Okay.

54
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
I'm not pleased.

55
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,100
This isn't even close to what I wanted.

56
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,900
I can't imagine what on earth
you were thinking.

57
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
I am so sorry--

58
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,800
I mean, Iook at this red. It's all wrong.
I wanted it darker.

59
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,900
- I specifically heard you say--
- I know what I said.

60
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,200
- Okay. Maybe I misunderstood you.
- CIearly.

61
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,100
Mr. Hedare, I know I can fix it.

62
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,900
If you give me a chance,
I know I can fix it.

63
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,600
I do not reward incompetence.

64
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,000
I have no idea why I expected your art
to show better taste than your wardrobe.

65
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,300
Oh, and do try and get
a manicure, will you?

66
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh, for God's sake, George.

67
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,500
Let her fix it.

68
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,300
She's good and you know it.

69
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,500
Whatever.

70
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,100
By tomorrow night.

71
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,300
Midnight.

72
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,600
Right. Thank you.

73
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
Excuse me. Hi!

74
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,200
Do you think you could just
maybe turn the music down...

75
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,400
...just a Iittle bit?

76
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
No? Okay.

77
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,500
Kitty! Kitty.

78
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,000
How'd you get up there?
Come down here.

79
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,400
What, are you stuck?

80
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,700
You're gonna make me come out there.

81
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,100
Hey! Easy! Hold on a minute!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

82
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,500
Whatever you're thinking or feeling...

83
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
...it's not worth it, you understand?
I'm a cop. Maybe I can help.

84
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,100
Okay. I'm fine.

85
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
- It's just that--
- Listen to me.

86
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,100
We'II get through this together.
What's your name?

87
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Patience Phillips.

88
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
But this cat...

89
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Sure, sure, Patience,
and it's a real beauty.

90
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,400
- Very cute.
- The cat's not up here anymore.

91
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay. And I'm sure that
makes you very sad.

92
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,700
- What's your apartment number?
- Twenty-three!

93
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
Hold on!

94
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Hurry.

95
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,500
I got you.

96
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,100
- You okay?
- Thanks.

97
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,400
You sure you're okay?

98
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,300
That was the cat.

99
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,700
You weren't kidding.

100
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,200
You actually climbed out there
to rescue your cat?

101
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,300
Yeah. I mean, no.
It's not my cat, it's a cat.

102
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
To rescue somebody else's cat?

103
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Well, that's something else.

104
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,200
Oh, my gosh, I'm Iate for my job!

105
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,900
- I'm on a deadline today.
- Yeah? Well, good Iuck with that.

106
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,200
Thanks.

107
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Thank you!

108
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,800
After all, no one can defeat Father Time.

109
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,300
Though you did put up
a hell of a fight, didn't you?

110
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,500
Beau-Iine works wonders, doesn't it?

111
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Yes, it does.

112
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,100
I have a busy day today.

113
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,700
Drinks, then dinner.
Don't wait up, will you, darling?

114
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I stopped waiting
a Iong time ago, George.

115
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, and that Iunch tomorrow?

116
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,400
- Cancel that too, will you?
- Problems?

117
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
I doubt it...

118
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,500
...but Slavicky won't stop calling.
You know scientists.

119
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,600
They're worse than models. You have to
coddle them all the time Iike Iittle children.

120
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,300
I'II have Wesley reschedule. Bye.

121
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,600
Hey! Man sandwich, 12 o'clock.

122
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Oh, my God.

123
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,400
Hello, Miss Phillips.

124
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,200
Hi.

125
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,000
This is the officer I was telling you
about from earlier.

126
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,700
Detective Lone.

127
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,300
- Tom Lone.
- God, that is such a good name.

128
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,300
Tom Lone.

129
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,700
Rhymes with cone, phone, bone.

130
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,500
Not that rhyming's all that important.

131
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,400
I'II just be in my cubicle.

132
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,500
Alone.

133
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

134
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
How'd you get...?

135
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,500
You dropped something.

136
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,300
You can really cover a Iot of ground
when you're in a hurry.

137
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
Thanks.

138
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
Is this yours?

139
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,800
Yeah.

140
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,400
- It's nice.
- Thanks.

141
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,300
Yeah, it kind of reminds me
of early Chagall.

142
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,900
Elegant, but whimsical.

143
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,300
Very much in the...

144
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,300
- ...tradition of the old Dutch Masters.
- I'm impressed.

145
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't be. I noticed all the art in your
apartment, so I Googled it at the office.

146
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,300
- No, but really, I Iike it.
- Thanks.

147
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,700
Listen, I wanted to apologize about this
morning for thinking you were a jumper.

148
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,600
I was hoping to make it up
by taking you to coffee.

149
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,700
I know this great Italian place
around the corner, Grecchio's on 6th.

150
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,600
Or, listen, maybe tomorrow's better.
Say, 1:00?

151
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes.

152
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,300
- Okay.
- Y eah?

153
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,100
Okay. So tomorrow then, 1:00.

154
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,600
- You make sure she gets there.
- Yes, officer.

155
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,000
- Counting on you.
- I screw it up...

156
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
...you can throw away the key.

157
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
See you tomorrow.

158
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay, bye.

159
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,100
Patience.

160
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,000
- That is a man in serious Iike with you.
- You think?

161
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,700
- Hello.
- We got a Iot of work to do.

162
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,700
First, you gotta shave those Iegs.

163
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Second, wear that Ieather outfit
we got you for your birthday.

164
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,700
- Remember?
- First, it's only coffee.

165
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,800
And second, I will never, ever,
ever wear that Ieather outfit.

166
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,400
Good night!

167
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,400
Hi, this is Patience
in the art department.

168
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,300
Yeah, I'm expecting a messenger
to come and pick up--

169
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,700
But it's gotta be there by midnight.

170
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,100
Well, I...
I know it's not your fault, but...

171
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,300
Okay.

172
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
I'II take it myself.

173
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,200
Hello? Is anybody in there?

174
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,900
Oh, come on, Slavicky.

175
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,100
When did you grow a conscience?

176
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,600
I don't care that the FDA never saw
the headaches...

177
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,400
...and the nausea
and the fainting spells.

178
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,900
Those are symptoms I can Iive with.

179
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Hello?

180
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,100
And with what we stand to make
from consumers demanding their fix...

181
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
...I can Iive with it being addictive.

182
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,600
But these side effects
from the Iong-term studies...

183
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,800
That won't happen if they keep using it.
And we'II make sure they do...

184
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,700
...because that's where
the money comes from.

185
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,600
I'm not sure anymore.

186
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Hello? Hello?

187
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,900
I thought I could Iive with it...

188
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,800
...but I can't Iive with turning
people into monsters.

189
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,900
Oh, my gosh!

190
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,700
You've gotta Iet me pull the plug.
We can't Iet this go on the shelves.

191
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,700
Who's there?

192
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,500
- Armando, come in.
- I'm on my way.

193
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,100
You can come out now.
It's okay.

194
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,700
We'd just Iike to ask you
a few questions.

195
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,500
Sorry.

196
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,100
But I think maybe I'm in the wrong--

197
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
- What are you doing?
- Don't ever do that again.

198
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,400
Where is she?

199
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,500
She ran down to waste treatment,
jumped in a pipe.

200
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,300
We don't know who she is,
but we know what she heard.

201
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
We can 't risk it.
Get rid of her.

202
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
Seal the door.

203
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,100
Patience Phillips,
I've never been so proud of you.

204
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,800
You 're probably sipping
your decaf soy whatever...

205
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,900
... fantasizing about licking
the foam off his lips.

206
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,900
Wait, that's what I'm doing.
How 'd the presentation go?

207
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
Did you get me free samples of it?
Listen, call me.

208
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,900
What...?

209
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,300
Hi, I'II take a decaf Iatte.

210
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Hey, Patience, it's T om Lone.
I' m here at Grecchio's waiting...

211
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
...and you 're not here.

212
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,600
Anyway, I gotta get back to work, so...

213
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,300
Bye.

214
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,200
Okay, kitty.
It's time for you to go home.

215
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Now...

216
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,000
- Are you Ophelia Powers?
- Y es.

217
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,200
- I got your cat off a Iedge and ever since--
- Why, Midnight.

218
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,300
You've never brought a stranger
home before.

219
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,700
Please, come in.

220
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,000
No, I can't come in.
I've got to go to-- I'm Iate.

221
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,000
- Midnight.
- I'm sorry?

222
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,400
Her name.

223
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,900
She's an Egyptian Mau,
the rarest of breeds. Temple cats.

224
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,000
It's said that Maus have
special powers.

225
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,000
Like popping out of nowhere? I know.

226
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,100
Among other things.

227
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,900
Your cat...

228
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,400
Socrates!

229
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,100
No caffeine.

230
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
It makes him irritable.

231
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,700
You Iook a Iittle out of sorts yourself,
my dear.

232
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,100
The cats, perhaps.

233
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
They seem to be taking quite
an unusual shine to you.

234
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,000
This has been a really bad day
for me already.

235
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,100
- I can't even remember most of yesterday.
- Perhaps I can help you.

236
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,100
Right.

237
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,700
This really isn't your problem.
I don't even know why I'm here.

238
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,400
- It's all right. Tell me.
- Really. I'm Iate for work.

239
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,700
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't even...
- Come back anytime. I'm always here.

240
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,900
Catnip.

241
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,500
No--

242
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,500
I'm fine. I am fine.

243
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,700
What the hell is wrong with you?!

244
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,900
You never delivered the design!

245
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,300
You don't even know where they are.

246
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,900
You do not know where they are because,
and I quote you, you "cannot remember"!

247
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,700
Your incompetence is staggering!

248
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,900
Are you even Iistening to me?

249
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm sorry!

250
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,400
"Sorry"?

251
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Sorry's not nearly enough.

252
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
Okay.

253
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,100
Then Iet me try the remix.

254
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm sorry for every second I wasted...

255
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,600
...working for an untalented,
unethical egomaniac Iike you.

256
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,300
Clean out your cubicle. You are fired.

257
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,600
Wait! Mr. Hedare!

258
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,800
I didn't mean it.

259
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Did I?

260
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,900
My hero.

261
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,100
Where did that come from?

262
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,300
I don't know,
it's Iike I can't describe it.

263
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,100
I was saying it, but I wasn't saying it.
Do you understand?

264
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Whoever said it has the thanks
of a grateful art department.

265
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
You don't understand, Sal.
I wanted to cause him pain.

266
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,500
I'm sorry.

267
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,500
- What was that?
- Allergies?

268
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
Maybe?

269
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,500
You just got fired, remember?

270
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,400
But it's so pretty.

271
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,900
Sal? Sal?

272
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,600
Sally?

273
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,700
Sally! Sally?

274
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,100
Hey.

275
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Ever noticed when they keep you for
observation no one really observes you?

276
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,500
- Did they tell you what was wrong?
- Oh, they have no idea.

277
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,500
They did run a million fun tests, though.

278
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,800
Hey, upside, you gotta see my doctor.

279
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
I can see you're feeling better.

280
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Reminds me, what's up with the
"hot yet modest, but who cares...

281
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,200
...because he's so hot" detective?

282
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,500
It's not gonna work out, Sal.

283
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Patience, you never think
it's gonna work.

284
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,900
Because it doesn't. I've got a good
reason for saying it this time. Trust me.

285
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,000
Look, this time I refuse
to Iet you sabotage a good thing.

286
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,100
If it's broke, fix it.

287
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,600
AII right? Now, I Iove you,
and he is gonna Iove you. Now, go.

288
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Go give him some brown sugar.

289
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,700
I gotta meet my hottie doctor.

290
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,300
Tell me I Iook vulnerable.

291
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,600
Being good is something you keep
in your heart because you put it there.

292
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying
some people don't choose to be bad.

293
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,600
But I want something different for you.
I want something better.

294
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,100
- You understand?
- Yeah.

295
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,000
- Can I see your gun?
- No.

296
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,500
- You know what makes somebody--
- Will you shoot it?

297
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,400
No.

298
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,200
I want you to be
the good guys, got it?

299
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,100
- Yeah.
- Let's go shoot some hoops.

300
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,600
I called the police station
and they said you might be here.

301
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,600
You never got your coffee.

302
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,000
Well, you're a brave man to be facing
a mob Iike this. No backup?

303
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm used to working alone,
most of the time.

304
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,300
- Is that by choice, or--
- Yeah, theirs.

305
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,400
No, I've had partners before.

306
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,300
Turns out I take my job too seriously.

307
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,400
You know my friend Sally?
That's what she says about me.

308
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,500
She says that I'm fun-deficient.

309
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,700
- I don't believe that.
- That's what she says.

310
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,300
One-on-one?

311
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,900
- Who? Me and her?
- Yeah, come on.

312
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,200
You wanna do this?

313
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,500
One-on-one
One-on-one

314
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,000
I haven't done that since I was a kid.

315
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,700
Come on.

316
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,500
Can we have our ball back?

317
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,300
You don't seem so fun-deficient to me.

318
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,800
Mr. Hedare wanted me to inform you
he'II be at the factory the rest of the day.

319
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,900
If by "factory"
you mean the Four Seasons...

320
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,300
...teaching Drina
to unlock the minibar...

321
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,200
- ...consider me informed.
- He'II be working with--

322
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Wesley, George hasn't said anything
meaningful to me since he said "I do. "

323
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,800
- Hello?
- You'd think with the advances...

324
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,700
...in medicine, this place
would have a wet bar.

325
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,000
- Seems Iike you're feeling better.
- Some new medication I can't pronounce.

326
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,500
- So, what's up?
- Nothing. Just fixing a Iittle snack.

327
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
What I'd Iike to know is
did you fix it with the cute cop?

328
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,100
I think I did.

329
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,000
Details! And make it good, honey.

330
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I'm sitting here in a paper dress,
for God's sakes.

331
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,900
AII we did was talk.
And play a Iittle one- on-one.

332
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,000
- You know how to play basketball?
- Apparently I do.

333
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,900
- I even went Shaquille on his butt.
- Patience, have I taught you nothing?

334
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,900
You never beat a guy at sports.
It messes them up.

335
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,000
They end up in a men's group,
banging on a drum.

336
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,300
It's not Iike I meant to.
It just happened.

337
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,200
I'm telling you, Sal, something really,
really weird is happening to me.

338
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,300
- I practically jumped him.
- That's called Iust, sweetheart.

339
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,500
- Animal attraction.
- You think?

340
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,500
What if it gets worse?

341
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,600
- I mean, what if the next time--
- Next time? He asked you out again?

342
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,700
- I love this guy.
- So do I. But it's me I' m worried about.

343
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,100
- I felt Iike I couldn't be myself.
- Well, feel free to be me next time.

344
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,700
- Sally--
- I'm teasing. Just be yourself.

345
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,400
Myself.

346
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,600
Okay.

347
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,400
- I'II try.
- Oh, I gotta go.

348
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Future father of my children's coming.
Sweet dreams, honey.

349
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,100
Excuse me.
I think I might have a fever.

350
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,500
Hey!

351
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,000
- Shut that off!
- Get a Iife!

352
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,700
Yeah, get a Iife, you Ioser!

353
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,900
Sorry, babe.
This ain't the slumber party.

354
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,800
However...

355
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,000
...in your case,
I can make an exception.

356
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,600
I'm flattered.

357
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
But do you think this one time...

358
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,600
...you could turn the music down
just a Iittle...

359
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,600
...bit.

360
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,500
Tell you what,
why don't I do it myself?

361
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,500
Hey! Hey! Listen, you freak--

362
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Is the music still too Ioud?

363
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,700
Hey!

364
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,200
You hear that? It's called silence.

365
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,900
That's all I ever wanted.
Now, keep it down.

366
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,600
Thanks for the party. I had fun.

367
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,000
- Time to accessorize.
- My bike!

368
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,500
Amateurs.

369
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,300
You boys thought you could come in here
and steal all these beautiful things?

370
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,600
What a perfect idea.

371
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,800
Meow.

372
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,500
That was one of a kind.

373
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,900
- From Egypt.
- That's a hell of a profile.

374
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,400
Thieves said she jumps around
Iike a cat.

375
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,200
What should we call her?
"Cat Chick"? No, no. "Cat Broad. "

376
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,300
What do you got?

377
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,300
Cupcakes.

378
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,000
Midnight.

379
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,300
I knew you'd come back
when you were ready.

380
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,400
The goddess Bast.

381
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,600
The Maus are sacred to Bast.
They're her messengers.

382
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,800
- You wrote this?
- I was a professor for 20 years...

383
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
...until I was denied tenure.

384
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,700
Male academia.

385
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,500
Bast is a rarity.

386
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,500
A goddess of the moon,
and of the sun.

387
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,400
She represents the duality in all women.
Docile, yet aggressive.

388
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,300
Nurturing, yet ferocious.

389
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,900
But what does all of this
have to do with me? I mean--

390
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,600
What happened the other night?

391
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,900
- I don't remember.
- Do you want me to tell you?

392
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,900
Yes.

393
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,600
You died.

394
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,100
What?

395
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,900
I didn't die. Look at me, I'm right here.

396
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,900
You died.

397
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,400
- But you were reborn.
- Oh, you're crazy.

398
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,000
- You are a crazy cat Iady.
- Midnight knew your fate.

399
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,300
That's why she tested you.

400
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,600
To see if you were worthy
of a gift she could give you.

401
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,900
A gift that could change your Iife...

402
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,300
...and give you a new one.

403
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,100
You're not alone, child. He's saved
others before you. Look.

404
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,900
Catwomen are not contained
by the rules of society.

405
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,000
You follow your own desires.

406
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,600
This is both a blessing and a curse.

407
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,300
You will often be alone
and misunderstood.

408
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,800
But you will experience a freedom
other women will never know.

409
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,700
You are a catwoman.
Every sight, every smell...

410
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
...every sound, incredibly heightened.

411
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:25,000
Fierce independence, total confidence,
inhuman reflexes.

412
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,900
- So I'm not Patience anymore?
- You are Patience.

413
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,900
And you are Catwoman.

414
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,100
Accept it, child.

415
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,100
You've spent a Iifetime caged.

416
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,000
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

417
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,300
...you can be free.

418
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,600
And freedom is power.

419
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,000
You saved my Iife, Midnight.

420
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,200
But somebody killed me...

421
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,000
...and I've got to find out who,
and why.

422
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
You dealt with Slavicky?

423
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,200
It's done.

424
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,900
Oh, my God. We danced all night.

425
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,600
- Been here all night.
- Absolutely.

426
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,800
Keep the change.

427
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,500
- What can I do for you?
- White Russian.

428
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,200
No ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua.

429
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,200
Cream. Straight up.

430
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,000
Looking for something?

431
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:32,300
The other night you killed somebody.
She was a nice girl. Why?

432
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Cat got your tongue?

433
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,800
I don't know. They told me to flush
the pipes so I flushed the pipes.

434
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
- Why?
- I don't know why.

435
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,900
Beau-Iine. There's something
wrong with Beau-Iine.

436
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,400
She heard something
she wasn't supposed to hear.

437
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,400
And Hedare is covering it up.

438
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I can't Iive with turning people
into monsters.

439
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,900
Hey, hey, hey.

440
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,300
Wow!

441
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,500
You Iook amazing.

442
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,100
- Do you Iike it?
- Love it.

443
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,100
- Like the hair?
- Love the hair.

444
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,700
- Did good?
- You did real good.

445
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,500
This guy is good for you.

446
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,800
Aren't you glad I pushed you into it?
Props to Sally. Let me hear my props.

447
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,900
- Props to Sally.
- Yeah.

448
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,700
Clothes, and a treat.

449
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,200
So are you gonna be okay, or what?

450
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,400
I do feel better. That's maybe Iaying off
the Cosmos for a couple days.

451
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,500
Check this out.

452
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,500
Some chick in a cat suit
murdered Slavicky last night.

453
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,600
The actions of this lunatic will not
keep Beau-line off the shelves.

454
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,700
We will launch next week as planned...

455
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:51,100
...because we owe it to the women
of this country.

456
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,000
- Because--
- Please. That guy is so full of himself.

457
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,900
- I' m almost out.
- Let's see.

458
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,200
How Iong have you
been having headaches?

459
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,000
- About a month.
- Do me a favor.

460
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,500
- Stop using this.
- Why?

461
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,600
Because it's making you sick. Trust me.

462
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,900
Thank you, Iieutenant.
You're gonna roll with him.

463
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,800
For Tom, from forensics.

464
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,000
Oh, and Slavicky homicide.
Maybe you'll want to look at that.

465
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,800
Hey, Bob, Iet me ask you a question.

466
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,500
Would your wife crawl out on the Iedge
of a building to rescue a cat?

467
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,000
Maybe, if the cat was carrying a pizza.

468
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,900
Well, there are similarities.

469
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,900
- Shape of the S, harsh stroke of the R's.
- Were they written by the same person?

470
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,700
Well, it's not an exact science.

471
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,700
But this first one. The broad spacing
of the Ietters? Indicative of Ioneliness.

472
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,800
And the O reaching out, insecure.
Handwriting of a people-pleaser.

473
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,700
Now, we Iook at the Ioop of the Y.

474
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,200
Very self-confident, almost angry.

475
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,500
And the O, well, this person
doesn't Iike to play by the rules.

476
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,900
- So they're different people.
- Very.

477
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,900
If you put these two women
in the same room...

478
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,100
...you're gonna have one hell of a party.

479
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,200
- You got a big weekend planned, Tom?
- I do now.

480
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,100
Aren't you supposed to Iet me win?

481
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,700
Not that kind of girl.

482
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,400
- What kind of girl is that?
- A Ioser.

483
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,200
Hey, can I ask you a question?

484
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,900
You work for Hedare, right?

485
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:54,400
Somebody was murdered at his factory
the other night.

486
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,500
I'm sorry.

487
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,800
Can you think of anybody who might
have a grudge against the company?

488
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,200
Lots of people. George Hedare isn't
the nicest guy in the world, you know.

489
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,400
He fired me.

490
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,700
What? Am I a suspect now, detective?

491
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,600
No.

492
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,500
Looks Iike we'II be
up here for a while.

493
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,500
You in a hurry?

494
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,700
Mom!

495
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,400
- Hey!
- Don't move!

496
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,100
Hold on tight. I gotta stop this thing.

497
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,400
- Mom!
- Frankie.

498
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,300
Mom! Mom!

499
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,700
Help, Mom!

500
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,600
Mom!

501
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,700
Help, Mom! Help! Help!

502
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,400
You are one tough Iittle guy,
you know that?

503
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,800
- Take it easy, partner.
- Bye.

504
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,100
It's over.

505
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,700
Well, I'm not sure how you did it,
but I'm impressed.

506
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,300
Well, I saw how you did. And so am I.

507
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,300
- You know what?
- What?

508
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,300
We should celebrate. Why don't you
Iet me take you to dinner tonight?

509
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,000
I would Iove to, but I can't.
Not tonight. I've got...

510
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,500
...some business
that I have to take care of.

511
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,400
You picked the wrong house.

512
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,300
You're the cat that killed Slavicky.

513
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,300
You don't believe everything
you see on TV, do you?

514
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,100
- What do you want?
- Your husband. Is he home?

515
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,800
I'm here. Why on earth
would he be home?

516
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,700
Oh, too bad.

517
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,200
If your husband ever comes home,
tell him I know all about Beau-Iine.

518
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,400
It's disease in a jar.
I wouldn't caulk a sink with it.

519
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:28,900
- Come on. I've been using it for years.
- It's your funeral.

520
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,300
Because whoever killed Slavicky did it
to keep Beau-line's toxic little secret.

521
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,900
Are you suggesting that my husband
is a murderer?

522
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,200
I'm suggesting that
you tell me where he is.

523
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,300
- So I'II ask him myself.
- I suppose I should be shocked.

524
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,100
Protest his innocence. But the truth is...

525
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,000
...that man's capable of anything.

526
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,400
You wanna find him?

527
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,100
There he is.

528
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,800
- Thanks.
- I'd Iike to help.

529
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,900
How can I reach you?

530
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,300
I'm not exactly Iisted.

531
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,200
Take my phone.

532
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,400
Call the cops.
You're not going to believe this.

533
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I think this is a total waste of time.

534
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,800
- Don't.
- What?

535
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,200
Think. Ever.

536
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,800
Consider it a condition
of our relationship.

537
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,100
I Iove this part.

538
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,300
- Who the hell--?
- Like my nails?

539
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,700
Just got them done.

540
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,100
My bad.

541
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,900
Get your paws off me this instant!

542
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,700
I know about Beau-Iine,
and your cover-up.

543
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,600
What?

544
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,100
So did my girl, Patience.
That's why you killed her.

545
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,200
- What? I didn't kill her--
- Too bad your Iast words will be a Iie.

546
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,900
Freeze!

547
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,800
Hey!

548
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,200
Hold it right there.
Don't you move.

549
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,700
Now, come down from there
nice and easy.

550
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,900
Cats come when they feel Iike it.

551
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,400
Not when they're told.

552
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,900
I won't tell you again. You turn around.
Hands on your head.

553
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,900
You're under arrest.

554
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,300
Gotcha!

555
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,800
- You think this is a game?
- Now we're playing.

556
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,400
- You're playing. I'm at work.
- Seems Iike you Iove your job.

557
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,600
- Don't I get din-din first?
- I'II feed you in your cell.

558
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,500
Careful. That cable hits us,
we're both fried.

559
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,000
I knew I felt a spark between us.

560
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,900
- Not on the first date.
- Don't flatter yourself. I'm taken.

561
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,500
Does she know about us?

562
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,300
There's no "us. "

563
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,900
Too bad.

564
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,200
It's over.

565
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,500
There she is.

566
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,100
Okay, boys.

567
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,300
Show of hands.
Who can see in the dark?

568
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,600
I can.

569
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,000
But this is a disaster!
It's a total bloody disaster.

570
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,300
How does she know all this?
Who is she, anyway? And how come--?

571
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,300
It's all right.

572
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,600
Don't be scared.

573
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:55,500
Great. You haven't got a clue, do you?
We are in absolute ruin here...

574
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,300
...and your brilliant piece of advice
to me is: "Don't be scared"?

575
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,500
No. My advice to you, George...

576
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,700
...quit the self-tanning.

577
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,100
Stop eating Viagra Iike they're vitamins.

578
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:13,000
Resist the urge to date children born the
same day they invented the cell phone.

579
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,600
For once, George,
in your miserable Iife...

580
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,200
...be a man!

581
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,000
Terrific.

582
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,400
Beau-Iine works wonders, doesn't it?

583
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,700
Okay, Sal. What do you think?

584
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,300
I don't know. You going to a church
or a PIayboy mansion?

585
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,100
Well, that was helpful.

586
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,200
I'm such a freak.

587
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,000
Please, I'm a freak Thursday
through Sunday, big deal.

588
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,800
Okay, but what if he doesn't Iike...

589
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,400
- ...the real me?
- He can't pick and choose, Patience.

590
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,100
If he wants this to work,
he's gonna have to Iike all of you.

591
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,100
- Senora Hedare. Perdon.
- Go.

592
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,700
Pretty.

593
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,500
- Thanks.
- Oh, you too.

594
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,000
But I was talking about the fish.

595
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,400
Detective work is Iike dating.

596
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,200
It's all about the pursuit.
But when you catch them--

597
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,600
You Iike your sushi, huh?

598
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,700
That's good.

599
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,300
So tell me about this one...

600
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,700
...that got away.

601
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,400
Catwoman.

602
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,500
- You heard of her?
- Oh, yeah. Hot, black Ieather, whip.

603
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,700
She kissed me.

604
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

605
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
- What do you think about that?
- Depends.

606
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,700
- You Iike bad girls?
- Only if they Iike me back.

607
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,900
No, Iisten, bad isn't something
that does it for me.

608
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,700
Okay, bad, good.
Gotta be something in between, right?

609
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,300
Maybe it's a Iittle more complicated.

610
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,600
- Why don't we talk about you?
- Okay.

611
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,900
- What's it Iike to be an artist?
- Well, I'm not really an artist.

612
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,000
I mean, yeah, I did go to art school...

613
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,100
...but then I got a regular job
at an advertising agency...

614
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:55,800
...and now I don't really know
what I am anymore.

615
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,600
Well, I know what you are.

616
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,800
You're different.

617
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,200
You're special.

618
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,800
- And I Iike that about you.
- Thanks.

619
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,400
No, it's true.

620
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,700
And I want to know more about you.

621
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
You know...

622
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,100
...I guess there's a few things
I need to explain.

623
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,000
Like what, your new Iook? Huh?

624
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,300
- Your dunk shot?
- No, that's not what I was thinking.

625
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,100
Hey.

626
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,400
You can tell me anything.

627
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,900
I'm...

628
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,900
I hate the rain!

629
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,400
What were you saying?

630
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,000
Nothing important.

631
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,800
Tom?

632
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,900
It's me.

633
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
You were right about Beau-line's secrets.

634
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,700
I can 't believe it, but you were right.
Beau-line is toxic.

635
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:12,100
I have proof. We can stop him,
but we have to stop him together.

636
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,100
George will be launching Beau-line
at a press conference tomorrow.

637
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,200
Beau-line will be on the shelves
on Monday.

638
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,500
So, what'd you find?

639
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,900
Enough evidence to put someone away
for a Iong, Iong time.

640
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,200
I was everything they wanted me to be.

641
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,700
I was never more beautiful.

642
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,000
Never more powerful.

643
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,200
And then I turned 40
and they threw me away.

644
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,800
It's all there behind the desk.

645
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,700
How'd I do?

646
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,300
The clawed-flesh thing
was a Iittle tricky...

647
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,500
...but I think I pulled it off.

648
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,800
- You killed him?
- No one is gonna stop Beau- Iine...

649
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,100
...from hitting the shelves.

650
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,600
Not Slavicky.

651
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,200
Not George. And certainly not you.

652
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,400
I'm sorry. I'm forgetting my manners.

653
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,700
Can I offer you something?

654
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,600
Can of tuna? Saucer of milk?

655
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:29,500
Smoking gun? Which, sweetheart, you
just emptied into my husband's chest.

656
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,300
Oh, George!

657
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:40,000
Help, somebody help!
It's Catwoman! She killed George.

658
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,100
Oh, my God!

659
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,100
Patience.

660
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,500
I'm sorry.

661
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,800
I guess you could take this right
out of my hands if you wanted.

662
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,300
If I wanted.

663
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,200
I'm telling you, SIavicky had evidence
that Beau-Iine was toxic.

664
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,600
That's why Laurel killed him.

665
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,200
George found out and she killed him too.
She was covering it up.

666
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,100
Ballistics show the same weapon killed
both men: the gun in your hand.

667
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,400
- Catwoman's hand.
- What's the difference?

668
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,400
- Guess it doesn't matter.
- Don't you understand?

669
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,900
AII of the evidence, every single piece,
it points to you.

670
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,900
There's nothing that shows me
anything else.

671
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,500
There's me.

672
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,400
You can believe me.

673
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,000
Do you remember the first time
you saw me?

674
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,300
Yeah.

675
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,700
What did you see?

676
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,300
A girl...

677
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,400
...rescuing a cat.

678
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,000
No, you didn't.

679
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:33,400
You saw a crazy person out on a Iedge
trying to jump.

680
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:39,800
And all the evidence pointed to that,
didn't it?

681
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,000
I really need you to believe me.

682
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,500
How can I?

683
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,900
I don't know who you are.

684
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,800
I'm the same girl
you were with Iast night.

685
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,300
Take her back.

686
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,000
You be a nice kitty, now.

687
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,300
Look at it this way, Lone.

688
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,300
You may have Iost your woman,
but at Ieast you got your man.

689
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,900
Did I?

690
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,700
Yeah.

691
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,400
Hello, Midnight.

692
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,700
You've spent a lifetime caged.

693
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,200
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

694
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,500
... you can be free.

695
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,600
And freedom is power.

696
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,100
It's not just about me
anymore, Midnight.

697
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,400
You know...

698
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,800
... Lassie would have brought me a key.

699
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,300
Cross your paws.

700
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,300
- We' re gonna shift-change in half an hour.
- AII right.

701
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,300
- Dave's gonna take over then?
- Yeah, as far as I know.

702
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,500
Yeah, right through here, pal.

703
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,100
You'II get to talk to a Iawyer.

704
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,100
Are you okay?

705
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,000
A girl Iike me Iands on her feet.

706
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,500
Wait! Wait!

707
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,900
My husband dreamed of a world...

708
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,500
...where every woman could be
as beautiful as she wanted to be.

709
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:49,000
He dedicated his Iife pursuing that dream.
As Hedare's new chief executive...

710
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,400
...I intend to make that dream a reality...

711
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,700
...by proceeding with tomorrow's Iaunch
of Beau-Iine.

712
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,200
Thank you!

713
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,600
Thank you so much. I have been dying
to get some of this stuff.

714
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:19,100
My husband would have wanted you
to have it. He wanted that for everyone.

715
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,500
- Detective Lone. What a surprise.
- Yeah?

716
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:30,200
Everyone, this is the man that brought
my husband's killer to justice.

717
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,500
Can I talk to you, in private?

718
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,800
Come upstairs to my office.

719
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,200
- Number five, ready to go.
- Yeah, yeah.

720
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:51,400
Yeah, go ahead. Right there.

721
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,700
Get a move on.
Gotta meet that midnight delivery.

722
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I saw her standing over him.
There were claw marks all over his body.

723
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,900
- But not on Slavicky's.
- Because she didn't have the time.

724
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,200
She also didn't have a motive.

725
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,700
- I don't know.
- What if I told you I know the truth?

726
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,900
That I know who killed your husband,
I know about Beau-Iine.

727
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,600
Why, detective, you make it sound
Iike I'm a suspect.

728
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,200
What if I told you I had evidence?

729
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:11,200
If you have evidence,
then how come I'm not in cuffs?

730
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,600
Well, you're a smart woman,
Mrs. Hedare. Beautiful. Rich.

731
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,500
I thought maybe we could
work something out.

732
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So this evidence... You'II make it
disappear? Pin it on the other girl?

733
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,800
If that's what you want me to do.

734
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,900
And you?

735
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,900
- What do you want?
- You just gave me what I want.

736
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,900
You just told me it was you.

737
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,800
Now, why would you believe it was me?

738
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,100
Because I finally trusted a friend.

739
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, well, your friend
just got you killed.

740
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,800
Don't be stupid, Laurel.
You don't want to kill a cop.

741
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,500
I'm a woman, Lone.

742
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:56,100
I'm used to doing all kinds
of things I don't wanna do.

743
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Give my regards to my husband.

744
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,800
How sweet.

745
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,500
Thanks. Now I can kill you both.

746
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,600
Hold on, I gotta stop.

747
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,600
How is it?

748
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,500
Well, there goes my jump shot.

749
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,300
Listen.

750
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,400
I want you to know I'm sorry.

751
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,100
I should have trusted you all along.

752
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,000
You're confusing me
with somebody else.

753
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,800
Come on, Patience.

754
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,900
I'II take this side.

755
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,900
I can't believe I ever trusted you.

756
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,700
- You're a fake.
- And what are you? A hero?

757
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,600
A thief?

758
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,800
A freak?

759
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:16,100
If you don't have an identity,
why keep it a secret?

760
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,400
Because you killed me.

761
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,300
It was me you flushed down the pipes.

762
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,500
I'm Patience Phillips.

763
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,500
That's who's under there?

764
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,200
- I can't be hurt.
- Beau-Iine.

765
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,000
You stop using it
and your face disintegrates.

766
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:22,300
And if you keep using it,
skin Iike Iiving marble.

767
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And you can't feel a thing.

768
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,800
You're just a scared Iittle girl
playing dress-up.

769
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,700
Nobody. Nothing.

770
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,300
Where do you think you're going?

771
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,500
You're gonna Iook Iike a cop-killer.

772
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:32,100
You wanted to save him.
Honey, you couldn't save yourself.

773
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,500
Game over.

774
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,000
Guess what.

775
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,200
It's overtime.

776
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,500
Give me your hand!

777
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,700
Help me!

778
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:18,900
I might not be a hero,
but I'm certainly not a killer.

779
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,200
You know...

780
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,400
...once Laurel's boys start talking...

781
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,800
...we'II be able to wrap up
these murder cases pretty easy.

782
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,900
And if Patience is back in her cell
by tomorrow morning...

783
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,900
...it'II be awfully tough to prove
that she was Catwoman.

784
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,100
Exactly.

785
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,900
Delicious, thank you.

786
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:18,100
You know, the strawberry was good too.

787
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,600
The day I died
was the day I started to live.

788
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,700
In my old life, I longed for someone
to see what was special in me.

789
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:42,300
You did, and for that
you 'll always be in my heart.

790
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,700
But what I really needed
was for me to see it.

791
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,100
And now I do.

792
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,000
You 're a good man, Tom.

793
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:54,500
But you live in a world that has no place
for someone like me.

794
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:58,200
You see, sometimes I'm good.
Oh, I'm very good.

795
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:02,200
But sometimes I'm bad.
But only as bad as I wanna be.

796
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,400
Freedom is power.

797
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:10,000
To live a life untamed and unafraid
is the gift that I've been given...

798
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,600
...and so my journey begins.
