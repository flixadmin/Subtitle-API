1
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,250
Dear students…

2
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,250
on this event
of World Science Day celebrations,

3
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:10,666
may we cordially invite
the most knowledgeable professor

4
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,375
and a very popular atheist,
Dr. Lenin Satyam.

5
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,708
And may I now request him
to please say a few words.

6
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi.

7
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,875
Thank you.

8
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,583
Faculty members and my dear students…

9
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,625
we seek an auspicious time
when we enter our new home.

10
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,875
We look for an auspicious moment
to step outside our homes.

11
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,208
We seek an auspicious time
for marriage and death.

12
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
We seek an auspicious time
when we send rockets into space as well.

13
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,458
And the worst part is…

14
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:55,083
some doctors deliver the child by
cutting the womb at an auspicious time.

15
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,541
Is it science or dogma?

16
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,833
Is this all science?

17
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,958
We put lemons in front
of our cars to avert danger.

18
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,958
And tie talismans around
the neck when our kid gets a fever.

19
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,791
From dawn to dusk,
our world revolves around astrology,

20
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,750
horoscopes, discourses,
and reincarnation theories.

21
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,416
Believe in science,
and search for the truth.

22
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,291
As an atheist, as a professor
who believes in science, I am telling you,

23
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,750
that if faith is suppressing the truth,

24
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,625
that faith is buried by blind faith.

25
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,875
Rachalakshmi!

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,916
Don't do it.

27
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,916
Praise the Lord.

28
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,666
Praise the Lord.

29
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,291
Praise the Lord.

30
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,708
Hey Lord, please bless us.

31
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,333
Bless us, Lord.

32
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,625
Praise the Lord.

33
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,541
Take blessings.

34
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,750
Won't you listen to me?

35
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,250
What if Dad learns about it?

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,000
You will directly go
to hell if you don't bother

37
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,041
about good and evil.

38
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,166
Mom, we are atheists.
It doesn't affect us.

39
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,208
It doesn't bother you but it bothers me.

40
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,416
You went to study in London and
came back with this white-skinned girl.

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,958
She knows zilch
about our customs and traditions.

42
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,000
Rajalakshmi! I have
such a beautiful name.

43
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,833
She mispronounces that as well.

44
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,666
Yes, Rachalakshmi!

45
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,291
Come here! You can eat that later.

46
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,708
Do you know what he did yesterday?

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,041
I sent him to buy lemons.

48
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,125
He brought the ones thrown on the road.

49
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,458
I had no clue
so I used it to make lemon-rice.

50
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,541
I kept fearing day and night
if those lemons were used for black magic.

51
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,666
What if our whole family gets cursed?!

52
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,083
What's my fault in this?

53
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,208
It's not your fault but mine.

54
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,583
-Grandpa…
-Yeah.

55
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,583
See, what she is doing.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,875
What?!

57
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,333
You…

58
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,666
Here I spread the word that have
more faith in yourself than in God

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,875
and you keep visiting temples.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,375
What will happen to me
if someone spots you here?

61
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,375
My image will be ruined.

62
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,250
Don't worry about that.
No one knows me there.

63
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,333
I wear a double mask
so that no one sees me.

64
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,583
Have you lost your mind?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,916
Mom.

66
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,125
Please calm down.

67
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,041
What is it, Mom?

68
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,458
-Interview?
-I am leaving.

69
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,000
-All the best.
-Thanks, Dad.

70
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,666
Why don't you join an MNC company?

71
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,916
Why are you taking up a government job?

72
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,166
Because who wants to work?

73
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,083
Bye, Mom.

74
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:09,875
Bye.

75
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,458
Mr. Viplav!

76
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,333
May I come in, madam?

77
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,541
You are very lucky.

78
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,625
You're the only one
to get posted in Mumbai.

79
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,625
-Really lucky…
-How am I lucky?

80
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,625
I am bored with Mumbai.

81
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,916
It's the same Marine Drive,
the same Gateway,

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
the same vada pav,
the tolls, and the same potholes.

83
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,791
Please select something
more exotic, madam.

84
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,833
Do you think it's a government office
or a tourism company?

85
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,291
Sorry!
Please don't misunderstand me, madam.

86
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,458
I am still young and haven't seen enough.

87
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,458
-Raju…
-Yes, madam.

88
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,250
-Send that new groom in.
-Okay, madam.

89
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,625
Excuse me, madam.

90
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,000
He's newly married
and got posted in Kashmir.

91
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,958
-If you both agree mutually…
-I'll gladly go to Kashmir.

92
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,750
I even have a sweater.

93
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,916
Thank you, sir.

94
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,500
-You can leave.
-Okay, madam.

95
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,500
Why are you laughing?

96
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,916
He should have gone to Kashmir
and enjoyed his honeymoon.

97
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,541
What's there in Mumbai?

98
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,083
Do you think you can enjoy your stay
over there with this kind of salary?

99
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,250
You don't need money to enjoy.
You just need the vibe.

100
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,333
The experience of listening
to A. R. Rahman's music,

101
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,333
eating hot noodles
in the snow-clad mountains,

102
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,208
and plucking fresh red apples
from the trees.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,291
I will call you
and share the experience

104
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,041
and see how happy or jealous you feel.

105
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,958
Forget about my feelings.

106
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,875
I hope you are clear.

107
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:01,916
I am clear about it, madam.

108
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,750
-I am approving it.
-Go ahead.

109
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,125
I told you, Sweetie.

110
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,875
No officer from South Mumbai
will accept the posting to Kashmir.

111
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,500
-Really?
-Yes.

112
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,041
I'll close the telephone exchange quickly.

113
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,041
And leave for Patna immediately.

114
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,083
Sweetie, the train is here.
Stay on the line.

115
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,416
Is he here?

116
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,500
I can't see him.

117
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,083
He is not here!

118
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,625
Didn't I tell you?
He will not come here.

119
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,208
I will come to Patna.

120
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,291
What will I eat in the garden?

121
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,166
We will have rasgulla.

122
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,458
-What shall we eat?
-We'll eat apples.

123
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,166
Sweetie, here he is.

124
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,916
You can have rasgulla
and I will again have an apple.

125
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,083
Pitobash?

126
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,833
I couldn't notice you, sir.

127
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,041
I took the seat next
to the driver for a better view.

128
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,875
Is that so?

129
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,625
Please come.

130
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,125
Pitobash!

131
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,708
Can we engage in some off-roading?

132
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,666
These terrains are too dangerous
to try such things.

133
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,583
Really?

134
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,958
How far is the telephone exchange
from here?

135
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,875
We'll reach by evening.

136
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,750
No problem. Go slowly.

137
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,500
The terrain dictates the speed here, sir.

138
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,166
Wow! It's so beautiful!

139
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,291
Looks just like a frame
out of the film Roja.

140
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,125
It's the same snow! The same feel!

141
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,583
All I need is a heroine!

142
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,583
Nice.

143
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,958
I swear in the name
of the Himalayas, Pito.

144
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,500
I am madly in love with Kashmir!

145
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,416
Oh, sir! Oh God!

146
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,083
Sir, let go of me!

147
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,833
Control yourself, sir.

148
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,958
Hey, RK, look how beautiful Kashmir is!

149
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,625
It's so beautiful.

150
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,583
Yes.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,291
Stop the vehicle by the side
and have two pegs.

152
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,375
You already have ice with you.

153
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,500
Come here. Let's have it together!

154
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,291
If you fall from here,
you'll end up in Pakistan.

155
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,291
-Hey, Viplav.
-Hello? RK?

156
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,666
To heck with the signal!

157
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,416
Hey, lift it.

158
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,333
These mountains…

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,083
this beautiful sky…

160
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,666
where are we, Pitobash?

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Praise the Lord!

162
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,458
Praise the Lord!

163
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,208
Praise the Lord!

164
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,833
-Praise the Lord.
-Where are we, Pitobash?

165
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,333
A war just broke out, sir!
Don't you get it?

166
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,041
Are you blind?

167
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,750
Pakistan is on the
other side of this hill.

168
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,541
Pakistan?

169
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,875
Yes, of course. What did you expect?

170
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,125
This is very common here.

171
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,083
Both sides keep hurling
bombs at each other, sir.

172
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,916
What do you mean, Pitobash?

173
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,833
Why did you come here, sir?

174
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,208
Who will take care of my Sweetie
if something happens to me?

175
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,250
Sweetie!

176
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,666
Oh, Lord!

177
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,958
-Hey, who are you?
-Sir.

178
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:58,916
-Sir…
-What are you doing here?

179
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,500
Sir, we are BSNL employees.
J.T.O., Kashmir posting, sir.

180
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,458
Why Kashmir?

181
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:08,333
Sir, the location is beautiful here.
I've come to enjoy the scenery here.

182
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,333
What?

183
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,083
I've come to enjoy here, sir.

184
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,416
Enjoy?

185
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,458
We are risking our lives
to protect the country

186
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,958
and you have come here for enjoyment.

187
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,083
-Just get out of here. Quick.
-Go! Go!

188
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,458
-Hail Mother India!
-Hail Mother India!

189
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,500
This is our exchange office, sir.

190
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,541
Can't we exchange it?

191
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,375
You can sleep in your car if you wish.

192
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,666
Sorry, sir.

193
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,041
-Bring my luggage inside.
-Yes.

194
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,708
-Greetings, brother.
-What's up?

195
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,791
Oh, shit!

196
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,958
-Pitobash.
-What happened, sir?

197
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,000
The bathroom is stinking.

198
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,500
It's a government office.
That's how things will be, sir.

199
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,875
Why don't you go in the open?

200
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,083
What? Are you joking?

201
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,333
-Hey, get up.
-What?

202
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,583
I am sorry, Pito.

203
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:46,041
I can't pee in the open.

204
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:52,791
Let's find something more comfortable
nearby like a hotel or a restaurant.

205
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:53,958
Comfortable?

206
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,541
This beautiful night…

207
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,958
Come and embrace me

208
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,916
-Come and embrace me
-Come and embrace me

209
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,291
-Who knows whether or not
-Who knows whether or not

210
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,000
-This beautiful night will ever
-This beautiful night will ever

211
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,541
-Hey, Pito!
-Come again

212
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,416
Your song
doesn't match the situation.

213
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,416
-It's very distracting. Please!
-In this life…

214
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,750
You need a fag to freshen up.
I need a song to perk up.

215
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,416
You are my boss in the office
and not over here.

216
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,416
The locals will be here anytime soon.

217
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,500
They may even shoot us
mistaking us for bears.

218
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,708
Wrap it up fast.

219
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,791
-Come and embrace me
-Come and embrace me

220
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,625
-Me…
-This beautiful night…

221
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,041
-Will ever come again
-My Sweetie loves this song.

222
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,250
Poor Sweetie.

223
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,375
In this life…

224
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,083
Hey!

225
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,041
What's that?

226
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,083
You worry too much!

227
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,916
Everyone's got their talent.

228
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,500
-I am hungry, Pitobash.
-So am I, sir.

229
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,916
Let's eat something.

230
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,291
Pito…

231
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,708
why are all the shops shut?

232
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,250
It's wartime, right?

233
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,625
So, there will be a curfew for a week.

234
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,208
-What next?
-There will be a war again.

235
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,625
What about our meal now?

236
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,125
We will have to beg for food.
I hope we find some kind people.

237
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,125
-Or else?
-They will abuse us.

238
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,625
-What are you staring at?
-Hello, sir.

239
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,541
It's curfew time. Just leave!

240
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,708
-Yes, we are moving.
-Move.

241
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,750
-We are going. Okay.
-Move.

242
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,875
-Pito.
-Yes, sir…

243
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,708
How do we ask in their language?

244
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,250
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

245
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,583
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

246
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,666
You have to beg for it
and not demand for it.

247
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,666
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

248
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,958
Okay. All the best.

249
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,250
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

250
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,583
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

251
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,833
Ma'am…

252
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,625
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

253
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,666
Ma'am…

254
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,416
Ma'am…

255
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,708
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

256
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,083
I don't want an apple.

257
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,333
Stop, guys.

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,208
I don't want this!

259
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,333
Bloody apples!

260
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,208
-Kids, have these apples.
-Yes.

261
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,666
-I don't want.
-I don't want.

262
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:59,875
Ma'am, could you…
please give me some food?

263
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,208
Eat this.

264
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey, do you think I am crazy?

265
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,375
What's wrong?
Why is everyone giving me an apple?

266
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,291
-Don't you have anything else?
-Really?

267
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,791
-Don't you eat anything else?
-I am not your chef! Get out of here!

268
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,166
-Vada pav or pav bhaji.
-What are you saying?

269
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,458
-You can get anything in Mumbai.
-Get the hell out of here.

270
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,291
-Everyone is giving me an apple.
-I will show you!

271
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,166
-What happened?
-Get out!

272
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,250
Ma'am, what's wrong?!

273
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,208
-I am leaving!
-Don't bake my brains in the morning.

274
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,625
Don't you dare come back here!

275
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,833
Uncle, eat this.

276
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,958
-Madam.
-Viplav, how are you?

277
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,166
Madam…

278
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,375
I came to the market to buy
apples at 250 rupees per kilogram.

279
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,125
And that's when I thought of calling you.

280
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:52,291
You must be plucking fresh
apples from the orchard there.

281
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,250
Madam, this is a different Kashmir.

282
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,291
There's biting cold on one side
and insatiable hunger on the other.

283
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,166
There's war and curfew everywhere
with nothing else but apples to eat.

284
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,666
I will come back to Mumbai.
Post me there.

285
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,250
How can I do that?

286
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,208
We have to fend for
each other as BSNL employees.

287
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,291
-Viplav, I can't hear you!
-Madam, I know you can hear me.

288
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,583
I can't hear you, Viplav.

289
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,791
Madam, don't disconnect!

290
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,666
I don't want to live here. I…

291
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,791
Ma'am!

292
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,125
She's at work now.

293
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:29,875
Will you have an apple?

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,333
But they won't pay you money!

295
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,541
This little heart of mine

296
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,750
And its little desires

297
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,041
Stop singing, Pito.

298
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,625
Why, sir?

299
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,375
I need to meet Mani Ratnam
and A.R. Rahman.

300
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,416
-Why, sir?
-They took us for a ride.

301
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,750
How can they be inspired by Kashmir?

302
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,791
But there's nothing here
except snow and apples!

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,291
Then why don't you leave, sir?
I will get some relief.

304
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,666
Aara… flowers

305
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,916
Brother, can you come here?

306
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,291
Pito, I found the inspiration.

307
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,791
Inspiration for what?

308
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,583
Rahman's background score.

309
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,458
Don't stare at them.
This is Kashmir, not Mumbai.

310
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,916
The heart doesn't understand geography.

311
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,375
-Deepu…
-Yes.

312
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,708
Someone's following us on that boat.

313
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,250
-Where?
-Look over there.

314
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,708
Look at how he is staring at us.

315
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,000
He is just gazing at us, dear.

316
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,541
He is ogling at us. Can't you see?

317
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,458
Give that paddle to me.

318
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,541
For what?

319
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,791
-Give it to me!
-Give that! Here you go.

320
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,958
-He is following us!
-Pito, I am the Captain now!

321
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,791
I am coming, Begum.

322
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,875
-Sir… No, he's not!
-I am coming.

323
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,125
What are you doing, sir?
Please.

324
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,791
Look at how he's breaking
the paddle and rushing to us.

325
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,000
He will get closer if he figures out
that we are from Pune.

326
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,291
Have you forgotten why we are here?

327
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,250
I will somehow avoid him.
You stay quiet.

328
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,916
Brother, go fast.

329
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,375
Fast. Fast.

330
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,500
-Hey, Pito!
-Sir…

331
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,833
-She's leaving. Push!
-The paddle is with you, sir.

332
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,583
-Why don't you push with your hands, Pito?
-What a torture!

333
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,166
The thing you are making me do!

334
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,875
Now I am liking Kashmir.

335
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,583
-Begum.
-Stop, sir!

336
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,083
-Listen to me.
-Catch!

337
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,958
-Oh God!
-Wait a second.

338
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,250
-Hey! What do you want?
-Sir.

339
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,291
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

340
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,958
-Can we speak to the Begum once?
-Please let them go, sir.

341
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,916
Which Begum?

342
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,666
Do you know where we are from?

343
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,333
I don't know about you.

344
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,291
-But Begum is straight from heaven!
-Sir!

345
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,458
We are from Pakistan.

346
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,458
What the hell is she saying?!

347
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,375
We're here in search of her brother,
Feroze who is eight years old.

348
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,416
She's come all the way
from Pakistan to Kashmir

349
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,750
in search of her eight-year-old brother,
Feroze who's gone missing.

350
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,541
Her relatives are all training
in different terrorist camps.

351
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,375
Why are you so keen to die?

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,125
-If you even look at her…
-Look at me, sir. I am harmless.

353
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,500
-They will kill you with an AK-47 gun.
-Oh, my God!

354
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,291
They have an AK-47!

355
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,333
-They will gun us down!
-Let's go.

356
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,458
-It's not worth it.
-Excuse me.

357
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,416
-This is suicide.
-Would you mind…

358
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,041
-If I fall in love before I die?
-Hey!

359
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,666
Hey!

360
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,958
Sir, she will kill us all!
She's a terrorist!

361
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,541
They are very dangerous!

362
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,583
You will be blown to bits.

363
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,416
So, what if they are terrorists, Pitobash?

364
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,250
They are still humans and have feelings.

365
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,166
Feelings are unpredictable.

366
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,375
Here's my ID card.

367
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,166
It has my number.

368
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,583
-Hey!
-No.

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,166
Keep it, Begum.

370
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,208
Think again.

371
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,375
Feel my love.

372
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,666
And do call me.

373
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,666
Yes, of course.

374
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,625
Let's go.

375
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,625
He's a bit too much!

376
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,000
He even gave us his number!
Who does that?

377
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,250
Men will always be men.

378
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,125
To hell with him. Ignore him.

379
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:53,958
Joy is when I spot you

380
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:59,625
Joy is when you are with me

381
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:25,458
My sweetheart
She casts a spell full of warmth

382
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:29,541
She tantalizes me like a cute dream

383
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:36,125
Her eyes sparkle all over like moonshine

384
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:40,333
Your presence is as magical as twilight

385
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,666
You and I together

386
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,250
You are my only love

387
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,875
Look at the shower of love in my heart

388
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:57,958
Joy is when I spot you

389
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:03,375
Joy is when I am mesmerized by you

390
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:08,583
Joy is when I spot you

391
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:14,083
Joy is when you are with me

392
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:48,583
My love for you has made me intoxicated!

393
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:53,916
Walking in the air in a trance of you

394
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:59,166
I am getting lost in this love

395
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:04,541
I carry my heart on my sleeve
My life hangs by the thread that you hold

396
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:09,875
The heartbeat goes on
And every beat reverbs your name

397
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,625
A storm in my heart
But the storm feels harmonious

398
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:20,291
My sweetheart
She casts a spell full of warmth

399
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:24,208
She tantalizes me like a cute dream

400
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,583
You and I together…

401
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,333
We are a match made in heaven

402
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:36,166
Look at the shower of love in my heart

403
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:41,916
Joy is when I spot you

404
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:47,333
Joy is when I get mesmerized by you

405
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:52,625
Joy is when I spot you

406
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:58,208
Joy is when you and I are together

407
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:08,458
Dear, did you change
Chintu's diapers on time?

408
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,250
I haven't come here to relax.

409
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,333
Look at how he is making us work.

410
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:15,583
Good morning, madam.

411
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,083
I heard it.

412
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,291
I told you on day one of your joining.

413
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:22,541
If you are working under me,
forget about your family and the world.

414
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,125
I was fine with work-from-home,

415
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,583
but this work-from-vacation
is a bit too much.

416
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,125
-Where is Aaradhya?
-No idea, sir.

417
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,000
-Sir…
-Where are you, Aaradhya?

418
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:38,916
Sir, I am…

419
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,291
The client is driving me mad
about the presentation.

420
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,291
Chatur sir…

421
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:48,458
Aara is embarking on a prayer
trip to Mamuleswar temple

422
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,166
for relief to her
grandmother from knee pains.

423
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,000
She needs to break coconuts
as part of her prayer.

424
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,958
Break them on my head.
Where are they now?

425
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,375
The Anantnag road is blocked, sir.

426
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,625
We are traveling via Pulwama now.

427
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,125
That place had a blast recently.

428
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,333
That place is infested with infiltrators!

429
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,125
At least send me the presentation.

430
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,250
We have the perfect disguise.

431
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,958
If Aaradhya is not back
in the resort in the next hour,

432
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,333
I am going to fire her

433
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,875
-Hello!
-after reaching Mumbai. Hello!

434
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,000
-I can't hear you.
-Brother…

435
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,000
-Need a vehicle to go
-Hello!

436
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,083
to Mamuleswar temple.

437
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,208
-Mamuleswar?
-Yes.

438
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,291
Will tonga be fine?

439
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,333
It's fine.

440
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,375
Salim…

441
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,666
Yes, bro.

442
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,541
Okay. Come over.

443
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,541
Please go.

444
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,791
Brother…

445
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,000
two girls are here
who are wearing a burqa.

446
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,583
They are inquiring about the way
to Mamuleswar temple.

447
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,500
She looks like an Indian Officer
on a secret mission, bro.

448
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,458
Nobody shall leave this place!

449
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,291
I was wondering,
what must be in Begum's red bag?

450
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,833
What else can it be, Pitobash?

451
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,916
If a girl is holding onto the bag,

452
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,333
it must be lipstick
and other accessories.

453
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,875
She's a Muslim, right?
So she must be carrying surma, etc.

454
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,125
Are you sure?

455
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,750
-Yes.
-Thank God.

456
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,750
-I worried that it carried explosives.
-Pito…

457
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,500
Begum!

458
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,125
Brother, how much will it cost a trip?

459
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,291
-Ma'am, 6,500 rupees.
-Sixteen, seventeen…

460
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,291
Begum.

461
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,458
Why are you here?

462
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:27,458
We… are…

463
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,083
You're here for Feroze, right?

464
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:33,250
-Yes, for Feroze.
-Yes, for Feroze.

465
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:39,208
I know you're frantically
searching for Feroze.

466
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,458
Give me a chance.

467
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,166
Let me try as well.

468
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,625
Instead of looking around everywhere,

469
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:48,333
I will make an announcement for Feroze.

470
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,916
No! No!

471
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,583
Begum.

472
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,750
I am here for you.

473
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,125
Brothers and sisters…

474
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,666
this is Aara Begum.

475
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,583
Her younger brother,
Feroze has gone missing.

476
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:17,708
If anyone knows about his
whereabouts, please inform me.

477
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,458
Who is Feroze amongst you?

478
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,500
Come forward. Don't be shy.

479
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:25,958
I am Feroze!

480
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,750
I am Feroze!

481
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,625
I am Feroze!

482
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,166
I am Feroze!

483
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,166
I am Feroze!

484
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,291
-I am Feroze!
-I am Feroze!

485
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,458
See brothers…

486
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,000
all of you look like wild bears.

487
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,416
That boy Feroze is a cute,
young boy, like my Begum.

488
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,708
Pitobash, translate this in Kashmiri.

489
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,125
Pito…

490
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,583
Okay, tell me now. Who is Feroze?

491
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,791
I am Feroze.

492
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,750
Kill him.

493
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,583
Hey. But why?

494
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,750
Why kill me?
Let's sit and talk.

495
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,125
Begum, these are your brothers, right?

496
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,458
Please talk and sort it out.

497
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:25,708
No…

498
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,208
-Hey!
-Hey!

499
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,833
Don't come near me!
I will smash your heads, bloody fellows.

500
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,583
I will break your heads,
I am warning you.

501
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,666
Praise the Lord. I am Feroze!

502
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,791
Begum, come with me.

503
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,833
-Sir…
-Get lost!

504
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,583
-Pito.
-Sir, come here.

505
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,041
Hey, stop!

506
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,958
Oh, God! Go back!

507
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:29,791
Praise the Lord.

508
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,833
Begum, don't get scared.

509
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,541
I am used to these kinds
of chases in Kurla.

510
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:49,750
You are safe.

511
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,500
Praise the Lord!

512
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:11,875
-Hold me, Begum.
-No.

513
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,458
They will chop our heads off!

514
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,791
-What happened?
-Begum, two more to go.

515
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:42,750
Let's finish them.

516
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:02,125
Sir…

517
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,666
Do not go into the water.

518
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,500
If you want something,
you have to give up something.

519
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,375
But what do you want?

520
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,583
Someone's heart.

521
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,875
Praise the Lord!
Sir, come fast!

522
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,333
Hail Lord Bholenath!

523
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,458
Begum?

524
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,916
You are a Muslim, right?

525
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,041
Why are you visiting a Hindu temple?

526
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,833
Aara can do anything for Feroze.

527
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,583
She prays to every God.

528
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:47,750
-Aren't all Gods created equally?
-Yes, all Gods are equal.

529
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,166
-Yes, all are the same.
-All are the same.

530
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,083
Yes, we'll go.

531
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,083
Hey, stop.

532
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,958
She wants to pray in solitude inside.
Can you wait here?

533
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,041
-We will go inside. Okay?
-Okay, please carry on.

534
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,333
-Pito…
-Sir…

535
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,500
A Pakistani girl.

536
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,666
Look how broad-minded she is!

537
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,333
My family will love her.

538
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,166
Hurry up.
He may barge in anytime.

539
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,750
Hail Lord Shiva!

540
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,083
Hail Lord Shiva!

541
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:26,583
-Guruji.
-Hey, don't touch!

542
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,791
You look familiar, Guruji.

543
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,625
Have you ever been to a temple?

544
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,208
I never even put a tilak on my forehead.

545
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,708
You will pray to God in the future

546
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,250
with folded hands.

547
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,041
Hail Lord Shiva!

548
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,291
You will wear the tilak…

549
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,166
and break the coconuts as well.

550
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,791
Hail, Lord Shiva! Please relieve
my Grandma from knee pain.

551
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,958
You will also wear a talisman.

552
00:34:57,041 --> 00:35:01,708
God, bless me with a happy life
without the hassles of marriage!

553
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:04,375
You will beg God to spare you
from the agony of hell!

554
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:06,250
You have a long journey ahead, son.

555
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,958
God, bless me for the on-site job.

556
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,250
-What? Highly unlikely!
-Hail Lord Shiva!

557
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,000
The girl is from Pakistan.
It is not possible.

558
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,166
-Okay.
-Tell him, dude.

559
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,666
Yes, sir. His lover is from Pakistan.

560
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,375
Oh, my dear love

561
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,375
She is from Pakistan!

562
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,625
-Oh, my dear love!
-Hey, shut up.

563
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,250
Stop all this nonsense.

564
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,916
Before you get ready
to get trapped for life,

565
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:35,583
take this fruit.
It is good for your health.

566
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,041
-Guruji, what about me?
-You won't need it. He needs it.

567
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,416
Convey my regards to Sweetie.

568
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,541
-Sweetie?
-Hail Lord Shiva!

569
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,708
Hail Lord Shiva!

570
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:47,958
He is very powerful, sir.

571
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,583
There is some connection
between this fruit and that girl, sir.

572
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,541
Nonsense!

573
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:56,125
Look at the way he is
standing like a tower.

574
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,166
I'll manage him.

575
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,208
Thank you for everything.

576
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,875
-We are leaving.
-Please! Don't leave, Begum.

577
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,916
Please come to my exchange tonight
and enjoy our hospitality and dinner.

578
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,708
Both of you sleep with me.

579
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,666
What?!

580
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,958
Don't you have manners?!

581
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:13,208
Is this how you talk to girls?

582
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,125
What did I say, Pitobash?
Why is she upset?

583
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,166
Of course,
she is upset when you talk so vulgarly.

584
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,375
No.

585
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,750
Oh, no, that's not what I meant.

586
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:24,416
What I meant was that
both of you can come to my place.

587
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,416
You can take some rest there.

588
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:29,666
And we will step out in search
of Feroze in the morning.

589
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,166
Those goons can be back anytime, Aara.

590
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,250
We can stay with him.

591
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,375
But we know nothing about him.

592
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:37,750
I'll take care of it.

593
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:39,541
It's okay.

594
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,583
Okay. We will come.

595
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,250
-Please come, Begum.
-Please come.

596
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:44,833
Come.

597
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,791
Keep walking.

598
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,208
Don't worry.

599
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,125
Hope you had a good veneration.

600
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,625
Everything is fine, sir.

601
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,875
Aara and I will
reach the resort in the morning.

602
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:59,750
Just tell me your location.
I will pick you both.

603
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,375
The place seems like a hill station…

604
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,750
Telephone Exchange…

605
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,041
Hello…

606
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,416
Hello!

607
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,166
Hello, Chatur sir.

608
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,541
Will they leave without us?

609
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,958
No way. You have the presentation.

610
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,208
He needs it to present to the client.

611
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,541
Don't worry about him.

612
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,708
He will come to you.
Just wait and watch.

613
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:22,958
-Are you sure?
-Begum…

614
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:25,583
-Oh, no!
-He is back.

615
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:30,833
Begum…

616
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:38,041
Here's a special meal for you from afar.

617
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,833
What is it?

618
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,250
Your favorite dish.

619
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,291
Mutton biryani.

620
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,250
-Begum?
-Duffer!

621
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,916
-Aara!
-I have had enough!

622
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,208
How dare he offer me that?
I am a Brahman! A vegetarian!

623
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,583
I am feeling dizzy.

624
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,666
He will pay in hell for this misdeed.

625
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,791
I feel like throwing up, Deepu!

626
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:16,958
You didn't like it?

627
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,708
Since you are from Pakistan,
I thought you'll love it.

628
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:20,916
This bloody idiot…

629
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,458
Do you think only India has vegetarians?

630
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,666
We have vegetarians even in Pakistan.

631
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,416
Aara is a pure vegetarian
Pakistani Muslim.

632
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:31,416
Pakistani… vegetarian Muslim?

633
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,041
Oh, God!

634
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,666
Where the hell should
I fetch rice and lentils from?

635
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,916
Thank you, Lord!

636
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,583
Such tasty food after a long time!

637
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,333
I will devour it.

638
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:47,291
Pito.

639
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,541
Yes, sir.

640
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,916
Do you know the meaning of selflessness?

641
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,333
To be concerned more with the needs
of others than with one's own.

642
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:56,041
-Why don't you practice it?
-What do you mean, sir?

643
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,458
-Sir, I am a vegetarian.
-Leave the meat aside and have the rice!

644
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,291
Begum…

645
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:09,583
This is my home
but consider it as your own.

646
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:11,958
Don't be shy.

647
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,291
Promise?

648
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:18,750
Hey, Pito…

649
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,291
Are you sleeping here?

650
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,208
Of course! Like I do every day.

651
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,208
You idiot!

652
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:27,250
These girls are all alone.

653
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,666
Their parents are not here.

654
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,083
It will be awkward for them
to sleep next to the two of us.

655
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,125
What is awkward about it, sir?
I think of her as my sister.

656
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,208
Don't you?

657
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,125
Hey…

658
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,041
She's your sister-in-law.

659
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,333
Begum!

660
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,250
You sleep here.

661
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,375
Please.

662
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,666
We will keep vigil outside.

663
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,166
Please.

664
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,458
-I can't bear the chill outside. No, sir!
-Hey, let's go.

665
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,833
How do they say "good night" in Pakistan?

666
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:03,791
Shabba khair.

667
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,166
Shabba khair, Begum.

668
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,291
Shabba khair.

669
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,083
Shabba khair.

670
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,416
Hopefully, we'll meet tomorrow.

671
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,916
Begum.

672
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,916
I'm parched.

673
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,083
If you don't mind, may I have some water?

674
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,625
Thank you.

675
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,583
Begum…

676
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,666
It is very cold out here.

677
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:16,833
If you don't mind,

678
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,333
can I have some warm water?

679
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,041
Thank you.

680
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:51,708
Deepu.

681
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,125
He was here.

682
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,666
-Inside?
-Yes.

683
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,333
-Twice.
-Did he misbehave?

684
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:05,208
He is trying his best to flirt with me.

685
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:10,125
If I am not careful, I will become
easy prey to him in this snowy weather.

686
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:11,791
I have an idea.

687
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,041
Tell me.

688
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:04,750
Love with Aara
Has cost my heart to me

689
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:10,083
From a star
I turned into dust

690
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:14,916
Love with Aara
Has cost my heart to me

691
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,250
-I have gone crazy in your love, baby
-Hey, come here.

692
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,041
You are my Roja

693
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,416
You are my love

694
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,000
Since I found you…

695
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:29,500
Life's been a joyous journey!

696
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,250
You are my Roja

697
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,458
You are my love

698
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:37,041
Since I found you…

699
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:39,875
Life's been a joyous journey!

700
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,041
He is her younger brother.

701
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,541
No, I didn't see anyone.

702
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,916
Did you see a small boy named Feroze?

703
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,125
Go and search there.

704
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,416
-Did you see a small boy?
-No.

705
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,750
-He looks just like him
-No.

706
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:16,958
Thank you.

707
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,333
Sorry, Begum.

708
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,458
In the ocean waves
You are my silent melody

709
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:29,541
In your divine torrent
A fight started

710
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:34,583
You are my partner
I am your commander

711
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:38,958
You are my friend I am your leader

712
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:44,666
I will accept whatever decision you make

713
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,375
Okay, sweetheart

714
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,416
You are my Roja

715
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:52,958
You are my love

716
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,416
Since I found you…

717
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,708
Pito…

718
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,875
Oh, God.

719
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:09,041
Let's get every orphan boy named Feroze
in Kashmir and present him to Begum.

720
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,833
-Get up. Get the car ready!
-Psycho.

721
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,791
-Feroze.
-No.

722
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:15,583
-Feroze.
-Haleem.

723
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:16,500
Haleem?

724
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,791
Nice name.
I used to eat it on Mohammad Ali Road.

725
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,458
Are you Feroze? Damn it!

726
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,333
I am Feroze!

727
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:32,041
Useless fellow, Feroze!
You don't know how to do this.

728
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,916
Don't know how the world works.

729
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:37,166
Hey, Feroze, where are
you taking the flock to?

730
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,250
Hey, Feroze…

731
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:45,041
Praise the Lord.

732
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:50,666
Feroze?

733
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,416
Come here.

734
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,291
Where's your mom and dad?

735
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,416
Not there?

736
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:58,541
Do you want ice cream?

737
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,666
Chocolate flavor?
Come with me.

738
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,041
Hey, Mustak. Come here.

739
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,958
-Someone has kidnapped Feroze.
-Make some space for him.

740
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:06,875
-Who are you all? Someone stop them.
-Sit. Let's go!

741
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:07,875
-Feroze! Stop!
-Drive! Let's go!

742
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:16,958
Brother, give me two cups of tea.

743
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,333
Make it fast!

744
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,625
Hey, Feroze.

745
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,750
If I slap you once,
you will come to your senses.

746
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,125
Did you see his cat eyes, sir?

747
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,166
He can not be Aara's brother.

748
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,750
Let Begum confirm that, not you.

749
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:40,000
-Ready. One, two, three!
-Praise the Lord!

750
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,750
-Chatur sir, listen to me.
-Yes, tell me.

751
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,041
-Listen to me.
-I am listening.

752
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,083
-We are on a hill station called Pampur.
-Pampur?

753
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:47,833
-Yes! That's what…
-Hello.

754
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,500
-Come on, boys. Come inside.
-Hello!

755
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:51,958
Begum…

756
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,000
all of them are named Feroze.

757
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:56,708
Come here.

758
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,833
Who is your Feroze here?

759
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:01,958
No one.

760
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,333
Begum, just look at them once.

761
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Look at him. He looks just like you.

762
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:10,416
No.

763
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,375
Drop them back, Pitobash.

764
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:19,125
Come on. Let's go.

765
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,208
No, we won't leave.

766
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,833
Why won't you go?
We can't feed you food. Let's go.

767
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:25,625
If we go back, we will all get beaten up.

768
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,125
Yes, brother. They will beat us all.

769
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:41,791
It's all because of you.

770
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:46,750
He is roaming with us just
because you made up a story.

771
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:48,583
-Let me tell the truth.
-Hey!

772
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,250
Just stay silent for a day.
We shall leave tomorrow.

773
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,750
Chatur sir is on his way.

774
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:57,666
Karim, these are all the boys
who lost their way.

775
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,583
Please check the register
and call for any of their kith and kin.

776
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,291
-What's the name?
-Feroze.

777
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,291
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

778
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:09,000
If there's anyone amongst you
who is their parent, please come here.

779
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:12,083
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

780
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,416
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

781
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,375
Feroze…

782
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:19,500
Feroze!

783
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,583
Mom.

784
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,833
My son!

785
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,083
Mom!

786
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,125
Where did you go?

787
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,458
Where did you go?

788
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:47,875
Begum…

789
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,833
I did all this to impress you…

790
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:56,250
but looking at the joy on her face,

791
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,833
I promise you we will find your
Feroze before you go to Pakistan.

792
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:26,458
I am the poetry
And you are the first line of this poetry

793
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:31,750
To your heartbeat
I can become the echo

794
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:36,875
When our eyes meet mine
I dreamt of many dreams

795
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:41,875
I want to be in your footsteps in
Your Journey and be in your shadow

796
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:46,916
I will agree to whatever you say

797
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,291
Okay, sweetheart

798
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:55,750
Love with Aara
Has cost my heart to me

799
00:49:56,125 --> 00:50:01,208
From a star, I turned into dust

800
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,833
You are my Roja

801
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,333
You are my love

802
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:06,458
Hello.

803
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:08,625
Chatur sir, where are you now?

804
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,541
I am near Pampur.

805
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:13,291
Something is wrong over here.
Please come fast.

806
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,666
Love with Aara
Has cost my heart to me

807
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:24,083
From a star, I turned into dust

808
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,708
You are my Roja

809
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,208
You are my love

810
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,708
Since I found you…

811
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,166
Life's been a joyous journey!

812
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:35,750
You are my Roja

813
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,291
You are my love

814
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,791
Since I found you…

815
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,750
Life's been a joyous journey!

816
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:52,708
Deepu…

817
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,958
I want to tell the truth to Viplav.

818
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,041
Begum.

819
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,000
What happened?

820
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,666
Aren't you able to sleep?

821
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,666
Please come, Begum. Please sit.

822
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:30,833
Please sit. Two minutes.

823
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,583
It's cold, right?

824
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,750
Even I couldn't sleep.

825
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:45,416
I just had a dream, Begum.

826
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,208
I got married.

827
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,791
And my wife and I lived in this house…

828
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,958
with two kids.

829
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,500
I feel as if we just served
them dinner, put them to bed,

830
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:05,708
and are now merrily chatting
on the balcony like this.

831
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,875
The one I will fall in love with…

832
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:16,291
will be the only one I will ever love.

833
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:19,916
Dreams are just dreams.

834
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:21,958
I know!

835
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,750
Uncle, one special tea
with double cashew nuts!

836
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:38,291
You won't drink?

837
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,000
I will have it with Begum.

838
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:40,916
Really?

839
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,625
Just like Begum warmed up to tea,

840
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,500
she will take a liking
to me too in the future.

841
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,083
I hope you will come
to visit me in Pakistan!

842
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:53,708
I will if you are alive.

843
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:57,041
Thank you, brother.

844
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,625
-Write in my account.
-Okay.

845
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,583
What's the point of
walking so far just to get tea?

846
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:06,250
My legs are hurting.
This tea can be had…

847
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:08,000
Begum is sleeping.

848
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:09,541
-Be quiet.
-Okay.

849
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:14,208
Begum…

850
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,875
Begum…

851
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:21,500
Aara Begum!

852
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,041
Sir…

853
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,291
have a look.

854
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,333
Begum has fled.

855
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,041
Keep munching cashew nuts now.

856
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,083
You were talking about going
to Pakistan.

857
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,750
These days there's
no guarantee for lovers.

858
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,500
Whereas yours is from Pakistan.

859
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:44,416
WE HAVE FOUND FEROZE.
WE ARE LEAVING FOR PAKISTAN.

860
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:46,666
She found her younger brother
and hence she left.

861
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,791
No problem. Let's go and sleep inside.

862
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,791
-It is biting cold outside.
-Begum still loves me.

863
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,666
I have felt it.

864
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,125
Didn't you?

865
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,958
-Ours is an inter-nation marriage.
-Oh, man.

866
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,125
Maybe she was skeptical
about it, and hence she left.

867
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,041
If necessary,
we'll initiate a surgical strike

868
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:17,000
to reach out to her family
and persuade them for our marriage.

869
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:21,041
Sir, the Begum would have
taken the Amritsar Express by now

870
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,500
to cross the Wagah border.

871
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:27,250
-Come, let's go to Pakistan.
-Pa--

872
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,750
JAMMU TAWI - AMRITSAR

873
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:58,416
Brother, did you see two Muslim girls
along with a young boy?

874
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:05,541
Pitobash!

875
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,416
JAMMU TAWI - PUNE - HYDERABAD

876
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,333
Michael, the presentation--

877
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,666
-Why are you blocking the way?
-Hey, you fool.

878
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,500
You left me?

879
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:28,958
You were the one in my dream.

880
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,416
You didn't get that?

881
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,458
Oh, man! When will she understand me?

882
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,041
Say something, Pitobash.

883
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,958
Madam, please. Please go there.

884
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,208
Sit here. Thank you.

885
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:43,583
Begum…

886
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,666
I already told you, I am
with you till death do us part.

887
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:51,291
I know you have the same feelings for me.

888
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:55,291
Don't get scared. Let's go to Pakistan.

889
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,208
We need to get on the train
to Pakistan, Begum.

890
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,000
-Not this one. This one goes to Hyderabad.
-Yes, that's right.

891
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,291
Let's leave now. I am coming with you.

892
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,375
Give me your luggage.

893
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,833
Begum, where's Feroze?

894
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:08,416
-Feroze! The kid…
-Feroze? Tell me, Begum.

895
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:10,916
I am not Begum.

896
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:12,375
Brahmin.

897
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,000
Pitobash…

898
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:17,458
did she just speak in Marathi?

899
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,833
She also said she's a Brahmin.

900
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,416
-Br… Brahmin?
-Yes.

901
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,666
My name is Aaradhya.

902
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:25,416
From Kothrud.

903
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,666
-Kothrud?!
-Kothrud is in Pune!

904
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,416
What about Feroze?

905
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,875
And Pakistan?

906
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,500
We just made it up to

907
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:42,166
avoid getting followed by you.

908
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:44,666
But who lies about being from Pakistan?

909
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,250
Forget all that.

910
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,916
Do you love me?

911
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:57,541
I believe in God and destiny.

912
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:01,458
After passing all the hurdles,
I held your hand

913
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,666
and felt blessed after having
visited Mamuleshwar Temple.

914
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:09,750
Those days spent with you at the Exchange

915
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:14,875
and the pains you took to search for a
Feroze who didn't exist melted my heart.

916
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:20,333
I fought hard to hide
my feelings towards you.

917
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,125
Without knowing anything
about me or my antecedents, you

918
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,125
were prepared to spend
the rest of your life with me.

919
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,208
That very moment I fell in love with you.

920
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,458
That's enough.

921
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,083
I will never leave your hand.

922
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:40,791
Hey, saint.

923
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,625
I am discussing the most
important matter of my life.

924
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:44,958
Can we stop that nonsense for a while?

925
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,916
-Nonsense! Don't talk like that.
-Hey!

926
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,958
-You can't call that nonsense, dear.
-Hey, it's all a nuisance.

927
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,708
It's a holy discourse.
Seek his pardon.

928
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,125
Do it, sir.

929
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:57,333
The discourse is by my dad himself.

930
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,333
-Who is it?
-Don't you know him?

931
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,500
The famous preacher from Pune.

932
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:07,333
Don't you know
Mr. Sakharam Maharaj Wadekar himself?

933
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,000
Our religion is an eternal one.

934
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:31,333
It outlasted various invasions
and attacks from atheists.

935
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,291
The path of devotion.

936
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,375
Don't you see the "Bhakti" channel?

937
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,250
Do you know my dad?

938
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:42,291
Who?

939
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,625
He is the president of the
State Atheists Association.

940
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,333
Lenin Satyam.

941
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:48,291
Are you his son?

942
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:49,958
Yes.

943
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:55,000
Well, then both our dads hate each other
and are diametrically opposite.

944
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,333
Do you think this will work out?

945
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,541
I didn't give up when it was Pakistan.

946
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:05,416
I won't give up now
even if it's Pune.

947
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,291
We won't give up.

948
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:15,750
In two weeks, we'll witness
a complete lunar eclipse.

949
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:18,125
While the atheists are describing
it as a celestial spectacle,

950
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:20,541
the priests are apprehending
it will bring in more doom.

951
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,500
We'll soon find out the truth.

952
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,000
Let's welcome our two seasoned speakers,

953
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:27,750
famous atheist, Mr. Satyam Lenin

954
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,666
and noted Hindu preceptor,

955
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,375
Mr. Sakharam Maharaj Wadekar
who will debate this out.

956
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:33,166
-Welcome, Mr. Sakharam.
-Greetings.

957
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,291
Can we see the moon on new moon day?

958
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:39,666
The lunar eclipse happens
because of Rahu.

959
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:43,333
This lunar eclipse happens
because Rahu is swallowing the moon.

960
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,250
Is the moon chocolate…

961
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,916
to be swallowed by Rahu?

962
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:51,750
Where is Rahu to be found
in our solar system?

963
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,916
It's just a shadow of
the earth on the moon.

964
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:58,583
You are unnecessarily scaring the public.

965
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,583
Look here.

966
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:03,708
Our saints have determined the planetary
movements without the help of a telescope.

967
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:05,208
What do you have to say to that?

968
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,416
They spew all kinds of nonsense.

969
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,250
If they were true, then we wouldn't
have scientists working at ISRO.

970
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,541
We cannot suffer their stupid
views corrupting the public.

971
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:17,541
You please share your views

972
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,166
and the list of do's and don'ts that day.

973
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:21,958
Nothing dramatic.

974
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:26,125
You shouldn't have any food
or take a bath during the eclipse.

975
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,708
Can we take nature's calls?

976
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:30,541
Or do we need permission
for that as well?

977
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,875
Don't you go to the doctor
if you get a heart attack?

978
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,833
Nonsense!

979
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:38,125
We should be ashamed of why we are
organizing such debates such as this.

980
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:39,041
This is ridiculous.

981
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,375
-I will not talk to this brainless fellow.
-Sir…

982
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:44,458
-What is saying? This is ridiculous.
-Mind your tongue!

983
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:45,416
Pathetic!

984
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,041
-Why is he talking without decorum?
-One minute. Please stop.

985
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,750
-He talks only baloney.
-Sir…

986
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,166
-How can he command any respect?
-We are live right now.

987
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,208
-Please calm down
-Why are you barking like a dog?

988
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:56,000
Start wearing a silver ring with a pearl
to control your anger.

989
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,416
Father-in-law, let's leave now.
We have to catch the train.

990
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,166
They are conveniently evading
us and running away from here.

991
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:03,791
We are not scared.

992
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,375
You are safe because
this is not Pune.

993
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,458
Come to our city to see
who is more powerful.

994
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:08,916
-Calm down. He's a fool.
-Shut up and get out.

995
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,083
-Don't waste your energy on him.
-He's testing my patience.

996
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,541
-He needs to meditate.
-Let him go.

997
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:14,750
Mr. Jaffer…

998
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,041
Don't call me for a debate
with this fellow ever again.

999
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,041
It's over.

1000
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,875
Sir, Viplav requested an immediate
transfer from Kashmir to Mumbai.

1001
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:28,333
His mother… has asthma.

1002
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:32,083
His father has back pain issues.

1003
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,666
He has to take care of his parents.

1004
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,750
Okay, sir. Thank you so much.

1005
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,291
What a breezy love story in just a week
of seeing each other! And now marriage.

1006
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,041
Is she so good-looking?

1007
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,791
She is as beautiful
as an angel, madam.

1008
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:19,500
My granddaughter prayed for me

1009
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:23,125
at Mamuleshwar temple.

1010
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,541
I got fully cured after that.

1011
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,250
Mr. Sakharam.

1012
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,208
This is our contribution
to your discourse.

1013
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:43,875
Oh, no! I don't take money
for giving discourses.

1014
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:45,750
It's all in the service of God.

1015
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,166
Mr. Shankar,
did you watch TV last night?

1016
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,583
He gave a proper comeuppance
to that stupid atheist Satyam.

1017
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:53,666
I saw that.

1018
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,583
He is the perfect antidote to such folks.

1019
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,875
She's all grown up.
Are you looking for a groom for her?

1020
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,291
Yes.

1021
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:10,958
We should be ashamed of why
we are organizing such debates!

1022
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:13,041
Why are you barking like a dog?

1023
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,666
Start wearing a silver ring with a pearl
to control your anger.

1024
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,083
Jaffer!

1025
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:19,875
On the next new moon day,
all of us are going to watch

1026
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:22,750
the lunar eclipse and
have chicken biryani.

1027
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:25,166
If we don't get harmed,

1028
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:28,375
ask if Mr. Sakharam
can keep quiet after that.

1029
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,875
Call him for a debate.
I will not spare him.

1030
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,583
Arrange a discussion in Pune
if possible. I'll come.

1031
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:38,833
During Sita's groom-selection ceremony,
Lord Ram broke the bow of Lord Shiva

1032
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,708
and married Sita. And after that…

1033
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:43,875
Oh, no, it's you!

1034
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,666
I dreaded if it was your dad.

1035
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:51,916
Mr. Sakharam Maharaj's
discourses are engrossing.

1036
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Mom!

1037
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,916
Do you know Mr. Sakharam's
daughter is even better?

1038
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,916
Who are you talking about?

1039
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,083
Your daughter-in-law.

1040
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:07,458
She is so beautiful.

1041
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,208
She is Mr. Sakharam's daughter.

1042
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:11,041
Her name is Aaradhya.

1043
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,625
We met in Kashmir and fell in love.

1044
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,916
Only you can get us married.

1045
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:22,416
I will try my best. Do not worry.

1046
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,583
At least, she will address
me as "Mother-in-law"

1047
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:29,791
instead of mispronouncing
my name like your sister-in-law.

1048
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:31,541
-Am I right?
-Shall I call her?

1049
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:33,500
-Right now?
-I will call her.

1050
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:40,583
Viplav!

1051
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,750
-Baby!
-Baby!

1052
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,166
Talk to my mom.

1053
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:47,041
Here you go.

1054
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,291
-Hello!
-Auntie.

1055
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:53,541
Can you call me mother-in-law?

1056
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,708
Mother-in-law!

1057
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,750
One more time!

1058
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:00,291
Mother-in-law!

1059
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:04,083
What a blessing!

1060
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,958
Hey, who's this "Mother-in-law"?

1061
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:09,666
In Kashmir…

1062
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:11,000
In Kashmir?

1063
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,125
I fell in love with this boy.

1064
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:16,625
Who's this boy?

1065
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,250
-Did you take your tablets?
-Yes.

1066
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,583
Son of Mr. Lenin Satyam.

1067
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,416
Oh, my God!

1068
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,166
Be quiet!

1069
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,166
He is coming here
tomorrow to talk to Dad.

1070
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,750
You must take care of the rest.

1071
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:35,291
-No, I can't…
-Grandma, please!

1072
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:38,375
To Pune?

1073
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,125
-To Pune?
-Yes.

1074
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,541
Dad will censure us if hears this!

1075
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:44,250
Let's do it before he comes to know.

1076
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:46,166
-Don't involve me in this.
-Mom…

1077
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,208
She will call you mother-in-law.

1078
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:52,666
The final chapter of today's sermon.

1079
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:04,083
Tulsidas wrote this brilliant
line in Hanuman Chalisa.

1080
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:09,958
It describes how Lord Hanuman
leaped into the sky seeing a glowing sun…

1081
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:13,333
mistaking it for a fruit, and traveled
thousands of miles to kiss the Sun.

1082
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:17,833
That's how powerful Hanuman is.

1083
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:19,791
Hail Hanuman!

1084
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,250
Hail Hanuman!

1085
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,666
-Son, this is enough for my life.
-Forget about the devotion,

1086
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,250
-focus on the main job, Mom.
-What happened?

1087
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:26,875
-He is behind you. Talk to him.
-Behind me?

1088
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:28,791
-Salutations, sir.
-Enough.

1089
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:30,000
Blessings to you.

1090
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:33,208
-I am your big fan, sir.
-God is kind.

1091
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:39,291
-Both of us are deeply religious.
-It is quite self-evident. Be blessed.

1092
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,583
But my husband is an atheist.

1093
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,041
He doesn't even bow before God, Guruji.

1094
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,125
-And…
-And chastises anyone who does it.

1095
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:46,833
He even beats them.

1096
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:49,750
Everyone is different in a family.

1097
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:54,750
Don't you feel angry
about such people, Guruji?

1098
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:58,583
Why should I get angry with your husband?

1099
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:03,916
Then…

1100
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:09,833
will you give consent to your
daughter Aaradhya to marry my son?

1101
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:12,208
What?

1102
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:16,000
-Marriage?
-I am Mr. Lenin Satyam's son, Guruji.

1103
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,916
Aaradhya and I love each other.

1104
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:19,958
We would like to get married.

1105
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:24,708
With just a twist of logic, look how
they trapped our daughter.

1106
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,333
And the alliance is the
son of the noted atheist.

1107
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:27,833
At least Aaradhya should
have had some sense.

1108
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,875
-Oh, Guruji is leaving.
-Mom, do something.

1109
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:37,083
Guruji!

1110
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:45,083
How did you fall in
love with Satyam's son?

1111
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:47,791
I didn't know that Viplav
was Mr. Satyam's son.

1112
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:49,291
Mr. Satyam, it seems!

1113
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:53,291
He is an educated fool.

1114
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:58,125
He undermines the faith of people and
keeps hurting their religious sentiments.

1115
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,833
We should have some discretion.

1116
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,958
Love knows no discretion.

1117
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,000
At least you should have
had some sense.

1118
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:07,000
Why are you defending her?

1119
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:12,791
Well, haven't you seen the boy
and his mother in the temple?

1120
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:15,416
They were so good and
the boy looked handsome.

1121
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,541
We have seen many folks like him.

1122
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:19,916
-You please stop.
-You wait.

1123
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:24,916
Both, the boy and
the girl love each other.

1124
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:27,625
Let's go as per our tradition.

1125
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:30,125
We will wait for
Satyam's consent as well.

1126
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,291
-What do you think?
-Why should we even talk to them?

1127
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,666
Do we want to push our
daughter into that dungeon?

1128
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,416
-Father-in-law…
-We'll send her off. Who am I?

1129
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,125
He is coming here because of his son.

1130
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:41,500
He needs it now.

1131
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,833
We will settle scores
with him right here.

1132
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,666
Dear son, look at her face.

1133
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,000
Father-in-law, please agree.

1134
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,541
She is very keen on him.
He is a good boy.

1135
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:54,041
-Accept this. It's a great chance.
-Think about it.

1136
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,458
Okay, let's talk.

1137
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:03,458
Neither I will go to his house,
nor he will come here.

1138
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,125
Let's talk.

1139
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:12,375
Dad, Aaradhya is not like her dad.

1140
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,416
She is very practical
and logical like us.

1141
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,708
Mom, tell him.

1142
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,375
She is quite modern, dear.

1143
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,625
Would you like some curry?

1144
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,708
Have some.

1145
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:29,000
After marriage, Sakharam will change
your name from Viplav to Vipranarayan.

1146
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:32,666
He is a fool who injects ignorance
and dogma into people's minds.

1147
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,208
And you fell in love with his daughter.

1148
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,416
Dad, I want to marry Aaradhya,

1149
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,083
not her father.

1150
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,208
Anyway, they are visiting us
tomorrow to discuss the alliance.

1151
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,083
Is he coming?

1152
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,000
Let him come.

1153
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:53,333
But let's meet them somewhere
outside and not in our house.

1154
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:55,541
Okay, Dad.

1155
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,208
Look…

1156
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:16,750
It's not the appropriate time
to talk about marriage.

1157
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,833
What?

1158
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:26,708
Tell me.

1159
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,083
Let me come straight to the point.

1160
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,666
My son is in love with your daughter.

1161
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,833
Don't stop this marriage. That's it!

1162
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:33,750
That's it.

1163
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:39,166
Can you give a good reason why my daughter
deserves to step into your household?

1164
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,458
We are not fussy about caste,
creed, and religion.

1165
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,750
We are not ritualistic.

1166
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
We don't pick auspicious
moments for doing anything.

1167
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:50,291
All we care about is they are in love.

1168
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:51,500
That's all.

1169
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:53,750
You may think that's enough.

1170
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,166
But we need to match
their horoscopes as well.

1171
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,833
Right?

1172
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:00,041
Horoscopes?

1173
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,625
We don't believe in them.

1174
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:02,916
We are done here. Come.

1175
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:04,708
-Viplav, let's leave.
-Wait.

1176
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:06,166
-What planet are they from?
-Dad.

1177
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,750
-Let's leave.
-First, why should we get down?

1178
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:10,583
It will look bad. Let them get down.

1179
01:11:10,791 --> 01:11:11,875
Uncle, we look bad.

1180
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,208
Let's not do it then.

1181
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,333
Sit down, Dad.

1182
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,833
Is this why you planned this in the metro?

1183
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,750
-Keep quiet. Sit down.
-You're a genius!

1184
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:25,791
We don't want to check
the horoscope. What next?

1185
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:27,958
Well, for whatever good,

1186
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:31,041
I did cast Viplav's horoscope
when he was born.

1187
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:32,500
-Here.
-Give it.

1188
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,208
What are doing?!

1189
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,750
Why did you tear it?

1190
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,125
Uncle!

1191
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:45,916
It's the original.

1192
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,708
The girl's star is Uttarashada.

1193
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,041
The boy's star is Rohini.

1194
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:10,958
It is going to be opposites
like a snake and a mongoose.

1195
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,541
They will fight to the death.

1196
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,833
-It's a big defect!
-What?

1197
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,625
If they marry, they will invite
untold misery and mayhem…

1198
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,000
and problems galore from
misunderstandings to miscarriage.

1199
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:30,125
If they marry, they will have all the
mayhem that a marriage shouldn't bring.

1200
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,791
What's the remedy, Guruji?

1201
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:37,583
Both father and son should
do a remedial oblation.

1202
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,250
An oblation?!

1203
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:43,750
The boy should anoint a copper plate
with sacred mantras on the entrance,

1204
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:46,458
chant the hymn Mahamrutyunjaya mantra,

1205
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:52,875
donate clothes, food, and a cow to
Brahmin priests and the cow dung…

1206
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:54,625
And plaster the cow dung
on the wall, right?

1207
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:58,750
I don't care about you, but I
am not approving of this marriage.

1208
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:02,125
Let's leave.

1209
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,291
-Even we want that.
-Dad…

1210
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:04,208
Let's go, Father-in-law.

1211
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:06,291
Don't mind, Guruji.
I am leaving, dear.

1212
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,041
-What are you staring at? Come.
-We made a total mess of it.

1213
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,708
Do you see their stupidity?

1214
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:30,333
Do you still want to marry the girl?

1215
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:36,250
Even if he had agreed,
I would have never approved it.

1216
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:39,333
Dad…

1217
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:42,916
we need no permission from anybody.

1218
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:46,500
I am going to marry Aaradhya…

1219
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,583
tomorrow.

1220
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:57,458
So, you have made up your mind?

1221
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:00,958
You stop.

1222
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:08,416
Look, my dear Aaradhya.

1223
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,500
I am speaking to you not as a dad…

1224
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,791
but as Sakharam Wadekar,
who's well-versed in scriptures.

1225
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:22,333
He has a snag in his horoscope

1226
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,583
because of which, your
future happiness is bleak.

1227
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,791
Convince him for an oblation ceremony.

1228
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,875
Or else, you will see hell in marriage.

1229
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:36,416
I can't force this on him, Dad.

1230
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:40,375
Viplav is a good boy.

1231
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,541
He will take good care of me.

1232
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,833
-Without him…
-You can't live, right?

1233
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,500
-But you can live without us.
-No, Dad.

1234
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,291
-So, you can be without us.
-Dad, I didn't…

1235
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:01,458
So, it is fine.

1236
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:03,041
Did you hear that?

1237
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,833
-Dad, I didn't mean that.
-That's what you said. It's okay.

1238
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,875
Dear, get her suitcase.

1239
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,000
-Get it now. She will go.
-Father-in-law…

1240
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:11,375
How can we let go like that?

1241
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,541
-Let her go.
-You wait, dear.

1242
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,750
We can explain things to others.

1243
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,875
But some things must
be experienced first-hand.

1244
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,375
She will come back in six months.

1245
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,833
Write it down.

1246
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,083
But…

1247
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,666
Come, child. Go.

1248
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,416
Give that to her!

1249
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,958
Here. Take this!

1250
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:28,458
-Dad…
-Take that also.

1251
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,583
-Here is your suitcase.
-Listen to me.

1252
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:32,541
-You can leave as well.
-No.

1253
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,000
Son, listen to me…

1254
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:36,166
-Start your new life.
-Listen to me.

1255
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:37,208
Go.

1256
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:08,541
Is that how a father behaves?

1257
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:11,291
Why is he cursing his daughter?

1258
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:14,250
Why is he slamming the door in the face?

1259
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:17,625
If someone slams the door on me,
I don't bother about them.

1260
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:18,958
-I don't want my family.
-Okay.

1261
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,208
Then I don't want them either.

1262
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,583
-Let's not take any sides, okay?
-Okay.

1263
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:25,125
Okay. Let's not take sides.

1264
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,416
Let's prove to the world
what an ideal couple we are.

1265
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:32,625
-Yes, we'll show it to them.
-We'll show it to them.

1266
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:34,000
We will.

1267
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,083
We will prove it to them.

1268
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,916
We will prove it to them.

1269
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:02,583
We will prove it to them.

1270
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,000
We will prove it to them.

1271
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,416
We will show it to all who
believe in horoscopes.

1272
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:08,958
And to your dad.

1273
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,791
And to those disbelievers.

1274
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:12,250
We'll show it to everybody.

1275
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,916
-Let's show the world.
-World?!

1276
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:20,958
Viplav!

1277
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:23,750
What happened?

1278
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:30,791
A black cat.

1279
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,291
So, what?

1280
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:35,375
It's a bad omen.

1281
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:37,166
So?

1282
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:38,833
We shouldn't leave immediately, Viplav.

1283
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,583
Shall we stop for two minutes and go?

1284
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:48,541
Okay?

1285
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,208
Everybody, clap!

1286
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:12,708
-Who are the witnesses?
-I am.

1287
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,166
I hope you'll take good care of her.

1288
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,833
Madam? Do you doubt me?

1289
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,166
I know he will take care of me.

1290
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:21,958
Look at how she's relying on you.

1291
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:28,666
Now that you're married,
what will you call our boy?

1292
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:29,750
Hello, husband!

1293
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,833
Oh, no. It is not the 1960s anymore.
That's so boring.

1294
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:34,750
Viplav!

1295
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:36,500
-That's what I call him.
-Yes!

1296
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:38,208
Anything else?

1297
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:41,875
-Cutie.
-Oh.

1298
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:45,583
Did you eat anything, cutie?

1299
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,708
Hey, the wedding is over.
What about the party, Pushpa?

1300
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:56,583
Nobody should be seen around
for the next three days!

1301
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:01,750
The most improbable marriage between
the son of noted atheist Mr. Lenin Satyam…

1302
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:05,625
and the daughter of a famous Hindu
speaker Mr. Sakharam Maharaj Wadekar

1303
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,833
happened at the registrar's office today…

1304
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,958
-Let's hear from the couple.
-Viplav!

1305
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:12,125
Do your parents know about your marriage?

1306
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:14,166
Or did you alienate your
parents for this marriage?

1307
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,375
We didn't alienate them.

1308
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:17,666
Okay, but what if both of you
spar in the future like your parents?

1309
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,875
-We won't let that happen.
-Then how will you manage?

1310
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:28,250
With love.

1311
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:33,541
Do you see any remorse
on her face, Father-in-law?

1312
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:36,791
You better keep your mouth shut.

1313
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:41,333
Son, if you keep these aspersions aside,

1314
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:43,750
they're a really cute couple!

1315
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:45,625
Sure! Why not garland them
for their deeds?!

1316
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:49,666
Father-in-law has said
that this marriage won't last long.

1317
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:51,916
The defect is in the boy's horoscope.

1318
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:56,583
Both the fathers will forget all
their differences to cradle the babies…

1319
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,250
Thomas' chicken biryani is just…

1320
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:11,166
But nobody knows the secret recipe.

1321
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:15,083
Hey, don't tell them my secret.
Just enjoy the biryani.

1322
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,166
Viplavam?

1323
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,416
-Viplav.
-Sorry, Viplav.

1324
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:21,750
Viplav.

1325
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:27,416
I planned to delight Zoya on our wedding
day with a lovingly cooked biryani.

1326
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:33,541
My bad! Because after that day,
she stopped stepping foot in the kitchen.

1327
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,333
Oh, come on!

1328
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:39,125
-Can you cook, Aaradhya?
-What are you talking about, madam?

1329
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:43,666
-Aaradhya makes amazing halwa.
-Hey!

1330
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:47,708
You must have heard
about the famous halwa from Pune.

1331
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:49,791
It's her recipe.

1332
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,000
Wow.

1333
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:54,000
Aaradhya, you can learn
culinary skills from Thomas.

1334
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:56,750
And then, he won't be making fun of you,

1335
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,958
he'll literally be eating out
of your hands.

1336
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,708
Is it just the two of you?

1337
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,125
We have a daughter, Lissy.

1338
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:09,541
She stays in Alleppey, our native place.

1339
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,041
She loves nature and silence.

1340
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:15,250
We go there to meet her
on her birthday every year.

1341
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:17,291
Have it…

1342
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:19,166
Serve them some biryani!

1343
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:25,791
What are you doing?

1344
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:28,541
Are you done?

1345
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:32,458
Did you like it?

1346
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:35,583
Take it home.

1347
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:38,000
-Aaradhya, shall we leave?
-Yes.

1348
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:41,375
Viplav, why do you
go to that old quarters?

1349
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,833
It smells of fresh paint.
Why don't you stay back?

1350
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,916
We don't want to disturb you.

1351
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,541
We will manage. Come.

1352
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,416
The mosquitoes won't let you sleep!

1353
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:54,041
Please give us the mosquito coil, madam!
We will adjust.

1354
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:55,583
Why do you have to suffer?

1355
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:59,500
Madam, just spare us a pillow
and a quilt. We'll manage it.

1356
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,916
Hey, let them go.

1357
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,000
Okay.

1358
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:08,958
Hey, why did you say no?

1359
01:22:09,041 --> 01:22:10,458
Do you think we are going
to sleep tonight?

1360
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:20,875
Whichever leg we use
to step inside the house

1361
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,833
it's going to
offend one of our dads.

1362
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:23,833
What should we do?

1363
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:29,458
I won't allow you to keep
your leg on the floor at all!

1364
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:32,833
You are my sunshine

1365
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,041
You are my moonlight

1366
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:36,375
You are the stars in the sky

1367
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,375
Come with me now

1368
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:40,750
You have my desire

1369
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,958
Come along

1370
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:48,416
Just the way you are Aaradhya

1371
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:52,166
Waltzing towards you

1372
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:56,666
The gait is yours

1373
01:22:57,416 --> 01:23:00,875
The body draped itself

1374
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:04,333
Take hold of it

1375
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:09,458
You plundered my heart
My heart proclaims…

1376
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:12,166
Take your name softly

1377
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,541
Amidst all the cacophony

1378
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,833
Amidst all the raucousness

1379
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,958
Our love will strive through

1380
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:25,250
Aaradhya… Aaradhya…

1381
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:29,625
I seek nothing else but you

1382
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:34,125
Aaradhya… Aaradhya…

1383
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:38,791
I seek nothing else but you

1384
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:27,666
Let me be the words
And you be the rhyme

1385
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:31,500
Let our song of love echo forever

1386
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:36,458
Let your poetry and poems

1387
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:40,083
Always adorn me!

1388
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:45,375
A beautiful…

1389
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,083
Tune…

1390
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:52,416
In the heart…

1391
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:58,291
We sing the song of our love

1392
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:03,041
Aaradhya… Aaradhya…

1393
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:07,250
I seek nothing else but you

1394
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:11,791
Aaradhya… Aaradhya…

1395
01:25:12,083 --> 01:25:16,208
I seek nothing else but you

1396
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:47,666
Yearning to say something

1397
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:51,000
And listen to your words

1398
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:56,333
I crave for a lover like you

1399
01:25:56,416 --> 01:26:00,416
In every birth of mine

1400
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:05,250
The lights…

1401
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,291
Calls us

1402
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:14,208
You come…

1403
01:26:14,291 --> 01:26:18,291
And make my heart dance on your tune

1404
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:20,583
You plundered my heart
My heart proclaims…

1405
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:23,166
My heart proclaims…

1406
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:26,708
Your name softly amidst all the cacophony

1407
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:32,083
Amidst all the raucousness
Our love will strive through

1408
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:36,291
Aaradhya… Aaradhya…

1409
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:40,625
I seek nothing else but you

1410
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,166
Aaradhya… Aaradhya…

1411
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:49,458
I seek nothing else but you

1412
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:51,375
Your lover

1413
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:56,125
-Aaradhya…
-Your one and only lover…

1414
01:26:57,458 --> 01:27:03,291
You are everything to me
My life…

1415
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:10,125
Aaradhya…

1416
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:09,500
Hey, RK.

1417
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,625
You're going to be an uncle.

1418
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:14,541
Good news, brother.

1419
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:17,166
Get sweets and come to the hospital.

1420
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,833
-Okay, brother.
-Right.

1421
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:36,375
Are you fine?

1422
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,875
I need a baby Aaradhya.

1423
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:51,458
With the same features.

1424
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:54,291
No, not with my nose. I like your nose.

1425
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,375
She should resemble you…

1426
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:59,625
She should be as tall as me
and should be brainy like me.

1427
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,125
If she's as tall as you, it's difficult
to get a boy for marriage.

1428
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:08,000
Boys? Boys are bad!

1429
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,125
I won't let any of them get near her.

1430
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:11,791
Look who's talking!

1431
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:14,333
She'll always be with us.

1432
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:21,750
Hi.

1433
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:24,291
Doctor, how's the baby?

1434
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,875
Does she bear the same
features as Aaradhya?

1435
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:29,541
We can't say that now.

1436
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:31,333
Why are you whispering, doctor?

1437
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,666
Say it aloud! Everyone in Pune
should also come to know about it.

1438
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,625
Baby.

1439
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:38,958
Dear, such things are common
in a seven-week pregnancy.

1440
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:40,875
What's common, doctor?

1441
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:43,541
Don't make me tense.
Just tell me what's wrong.

1442
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,541
It's a miscarriage.

1443
01:29:50,916 --> 01:29:52,375
Baby's heart is not beating.

1444
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:59,625
Is there a history of
miscarriage in your family?

1445
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:05,375
But the pregnancy kit
shows that she is pregnant.

1446
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,125
The pregnancy kit claims it,
but the scan shows the actual report.

1447
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:11,291
-Is your scanning machine working?
-Of course!

1448
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,375
Hey, Aaradhya.

1449
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:17,708
Don't cry.

1450
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:21,333
We can still go to better hospitals.

1451
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,250
We'll get another opinion
from better doctors.

1452
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:26,875
-Excuse me.
-Please don't cry.

1453
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:30,041
You'll get the same reports everywhere.

1454
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,666
We have to go for an MTP.

1455
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:34,916
-What is MTP?
-It's a cleaning procedure.

1456
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:47,458
It's a good time to sign the documents.

1457
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,083
You will be settled for life.

1458
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:54,250
Hello, who is this?

1459
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:55,458
Mr. Shankar.

1460
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:59,041
You're going to become an uncle
to Viplav's soon-to-be-born child.

1461
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:04,083
So, tell your father-in-law
to junk the horoscopes.

1462
01:31:04,166 --> 01:31:05,333
Okay? Bless you.

1463
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:08,583
Daddy!

1464
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:12,000
-In one year…
-RK!

1465
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:15,250
What happened, dude?
Why are you so dull, sister?

1466
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,125
RK, do we need kids so soon?

1467
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:23,166
It's been only a year.

1468
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:27,166
We have so much more to do in life.

1469
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,166
Don't we both need our personal space?

1470
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:35,541
Luckily, the doctor said that she
was not pregnant.

1471
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:36,666
What? She's not pregnant?

1472
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:40,500
What about the sweets?

1473
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:41,958
Distribute to everyone.

1474
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,708
Does he want me to distribute it?

1475
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:50,625
Viplav, all this happened because
we didn't do that oblation.

1476
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:54,250
Aaradhya, didn't the doctor
say this is quite normal?

1477
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:56,666
That's not a problem.

1478
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:00,416
Shall I tell you something?

1479
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:04,583
This is the time to be strong.
Everything will be fine. Okay?

1480
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:12,833
-Ramaya.
-Ramaya.

1481
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,166
-Rambhadraya.
-Rambhadraya.

1482
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,833
-Ramchandraya.
-Ramchandraya.

1483
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:17,833
Father-in-law…

1484
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,083
-Vedhase.
-Vedhase.

1485
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,333
Raghunathaya.

1486
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:22,458
-Raghunathaya
-Aaradhya is pregnant.

1487
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,041
Did you hear the news?
Aaradhya is pregnant.

1488
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:32,541
Didn't you tell us that the defect in
their horoscope will not get her pregnant?

1489
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:35,833
In less than a year, they
proved your shastras wrong.

1490
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,083
How do we face that Satyam now?

1491
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,125
I was shocked when I heard about
Aaradhya's pregnancy!

1492
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,375
Just shut up.

1493
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:48,541
There's no end to your horrible talk.

1494
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:52,500
Shame on you to wish
ill for your niece like that.

1495
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:58,541
The horoscope cannot dictate the
destiny that can be altered by the self.

1496
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:03,166
Aaradhya is lucky.
Let's go see her once.

1497
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:12,125
If her mother were alive, she
would have rushed immediately.

1498
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:16,833
Son, let's go.

1499
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:26,375
What's the matter?

1500
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:31,291
I can't stop thinking about it.

1501
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:36,166
My feet trembled when
the doctor broke the news.

1502
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:38,708
I blanked out.

1503
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:44,916
Zoya and I didn't want
to have kids for two years.

1504
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,333
Later, Lissy was born.

1505
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:53,500
But those two years were
the best time of our lives!

1506
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,208
Put it.

1507
01:33:57,125 --> 01:34:00,083
You are still recently married.

1508
01:34:04,666 --> 01:34:10,041
You must enjoy every
moment of your life.

1509
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:15,541
Otherwise, Viplav will keep
devouring that lemon rice, etc.

1510
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:16,916
That fish.

1511
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:20,166
It smells, right?

1512
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:22,666
One piece of fish.

1513
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,416
Give it to me.

1514
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:57,333
Cutie.

1515
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:03,083
Father? Is everything fine?

1516
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,875
How are you, dear?

1517
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:07,375
I can smell fish curry here!

1518
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:09,375
You must be careful now, dear.

1519
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,916
You always thought I didn't do enough.

1520
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:17,458
Well, I convinced your dad to come here!

1521
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,083
Father-in-law, look around!

1522
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:27,875
There's no photo of any deity
or even a basil plant.

1523
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:29,041
Oh, God!

1524
01:35:29,208 --> 01:35:32,958
Look there. They put liquor bottles in the
most auspicious direction of the house.

1525
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:36,708
He has done it.
He has converted Aaradhya like him.

1526
01:35:37,291 --> 01:35:39,375
They have started
eating fish curry as well.

1527
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:41,583
What a blasphemy!

1528
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,583
Oh, no, Dad. Our neighbors
are from Kerala.

1529
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,708
They cook meat day and night.

1530
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:49,291
Did you see how she covered it up?

1531
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:52,750
He saw it.

1532
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,666
Why don't you freshen up, Dad?

1533
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,833
Where's the marriage photo?

1534
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:09,583
My dear!

1535
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:11,833
Everything will be alright.

1536
01:36:17,166 --> 01:36:19,500
-Hey, RK, what are you doing here?
-Your dad is here.

1537
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:21,083
-My dad?
-Yes.

1538
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,833
Why?

1539
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:26,958
He wants to congratulate you
on the verge of becoming a dad.

1540
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:29,083
How did he come to know?

1541
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,500
I couldn't hold the
news and told everyone.

1542
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:32,958
You can't even hold urine for long, man.

1543
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,500
Forget that, dude.

1544
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:37,958
Even your dad is unable
to contain himself here.

1545
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:40,416
Watch the spectacle!

1546
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,958
-What is this?
-You know your dad better.

1547
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:53,625
-Hey, Viplav. Is this true?
-What is all this, Mom?

1548
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:54,708
Have some sweets.

1549
01:36:55,666 --> 01:36:57,083
My dear son!

1550
01:36:57,208 --> 01:36:59,250
You made a grandpa!

1551
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:04,958
Well done, Viplav.

1552
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:08,083
Sakharam will hang himself
if he comes to know about this news.

1553
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:13,291
My cute son! I can't believe
you're going to be a dad.

1554
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:15,125
He can't believe it either.

1555
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:16,125
Look, Viplav.

1556
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:18,083
That Wadekar family

1557
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:21,375
is capable of rubbing all their
orthodoxy on the unborn child too.

1558
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:23,208
Stay away from all that.

1559
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:25,333
Don't worry about that, Dad.

1560
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,125
Aaradhya is a good girl.

1561
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:30,375
She has even learned to cook
fish curry for me.

1562
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:34,458
A fish curry by Sakharam's daughter!

1563
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,458
He's my son!

1564
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,083
Really?

1565
01:37:38,916 --> 01:37:40,041
Auntie, you can't believe, right?

1566
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:42,250
Hey, call Aaradhya right now
and put it on the speaker.

1567
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:44,833
Son, please call your
daughter-in-law once.

1568
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:51,125
-Viplav!
-Aaradhya!

1569
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:55,166
My mom and dad are coming home,
can you cook fish curry for all of them?

1570
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:58,416
That's not possible!
Even my dad and mom are here.

1571
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:02,166
I feel numb and can't think
of anything. Where are you?

1572
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,916
Aaradhya…

1573
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:05,708
I am coming, Dad.

1574
01:38:06,041 --> 01:38:07,000
Aaradhya!

1575
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:10,250
Got him!

1576
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:12,541
Son…

1577
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:17,625
we're fortunate that Aaradhya
is starting a family.

1578
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,208
Why don't you talk to her?

1579
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:22,166
What are you thinking?

1580
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,375
Talk to her.

1581
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:27,083
Talk to her.

1582
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:30,541
-Hello, Mr. Sakharam.
-Greetings.

1583
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:34,458
-A great man said…
-How are you?

1584
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:38,208
that you must do
oblations to beget children

1585
01:38:39,375 --> 01:38:43,583
and some nonsense about cow dung, etc.

1586
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,500
Now, Viplav and Aaradhya are soon

1587
01:38:45,583 --> 01:38:48,500
going to be parents
without any of these rituals.

1588
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,583
Mr. Sakharam,

1589
01:38:50,916 --> 01:38:54,666
there is a science behind
an apple falling from the tree.

1590
01:38:55,416 --> 01:38:56,875
It's called the law of gravity!

1591
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,958
There is a science
behind a woman conceiving.

1592
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:01,583
It's called the reproductive science.

1593
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:05,666
To understand this,
you need to understand science.

1594
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:08,916
Admit defeat if you
have any iota of shame,

1595
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:11,833
and stay away from the to-be-born child.

1596
01:39:11,916 --> 01:39:13,708
-Sir, he is just joking--
-Shut up!

1597
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:18,458
Otherwise, wipe that
sacred ash and be like us.

1598
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:21,083
-Father-in-law…
-Let me finish.

1599
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:22,458
-I am not pregnant!
-Aara…

1600
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:28,875
It was a miscarriage.

1601
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:35,041
What? Oh, no!

1602
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,083
What, dear?

1603
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,583
What are you saying?

1604
01:39:43,041 --> 01:39:44,541
The fetus couldn't survive, Grandma!

1605
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,666
-My dear! Oh, my dear!
-It didn't survive!

1606
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,416
It's okay, dear.

1607
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,375
Mr. Satyam…

1608
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:00,416
You said something a while ago.
Science, my foot!

1609
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,958
That there's a science
behind an apple falling…

1610
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,541
and that there's a science
behind a healthy baby's birth.

1611
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:13,500
But nothing happens without
the five elements of nature.

1612
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:17,583
Science is born out of creation.

1613
01:40:18,791 --> 01:40:20,666
Creation is not born out of science.

1614
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:24,333
-Look, Mr. Sakharam--
-Folks like you won't get it. Leave it.

1615
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,708
You will only conceive if
an oblation is performed.

1616
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:42,458
I am saying this as your well-wisher dad…

1617
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:46,500
and not as Sakharam Maharaj.

1618
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:03,208
Let me console him.

1619
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:04,625
Come with me.

1620
01:41:05,041 --> 01:41:06,208
Take care of her.

1621
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:21,166
Baby…

1622
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:23,875
Why did you rush to tell them the truth?

1623
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:27,750
You could have withheld for a day.

1624
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:31,000
-Are you angry with me?
-Not that, Aaradhya.

1625
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:35,958
Use your brains, sometimes.
You can't get emotional all the time.

1626
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:40,000
Baby, just listen to me--

1627
01:42:04,125 --> 01:42:05,208
Did you notice?

1628
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:08,833
Yesterday was the first night we slept
without kissing each other.

1629
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:12,791
You're looking fresh.

1630
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:15,625
What do you mean?

1631
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,458
I've been crying the whole night, Viplav.

1632
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:19,750
What happened, dear?

1633
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:23,166
Why did you slam the door on me?

1634
01:42:23,916 --> 01:42:26,250
I didn't slam the door on you.

1635
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:28,583
I let it slide slowly.

1636
01:42:28,916 --> 01:42:29,833
I was…

1637
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:34,000
-You deliberately did it.
-Why would I?

1638
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:39,541
Why didn't you utter a word when
your dad verbally abused my dad?

1639
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,875
Well, didn't we decide
not to take any sides?

1640
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:47,875
Being silent is also
tantamount to taking sides.

1641
01:42:48,333 --> 01:42:50,458
-You were sleeping like a log.
-What?

1642
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:52,291
What if I had taken an extreme step?

1643
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:54,875
What if I had taken an extreme step?

1644
01:42:54,958 --> 01:42:56,583
Aaradhya, why are you getting worked up?

1645
01:42:57,416 --> 01:42:59,500
You don't know what happened, madam.

1646
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:02,416
Madam, we want to stay
away from both sides.

1647
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:04,708
How can I scold my dad
in front of her dad?

1648
01:43:05,041 --> 01:43:06,625
I didn't ask you to scold him.

1649
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,708
I said you could've stopped.

1650
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:11,291
Well, you stopped it
all by telling the truth.

1651
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,125
As if you never lied to anyone.

1652
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:15,791
What did I lie about?

1653
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:17,541
Forget it now.

1654
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:20,166
It's okay, Viplav, tell me.

1655
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,041
When did I lie to you?

1656
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:23,916
Pakistan.

1657
01:43:24,958 --> 01:43:25,875
Feroze.

1658
01:43:26,666 --> 01:43:27,500
Terrorist camp.

1659
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,375
She has lied to me as well, madam.

1660
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:33,875
I was large-hearted
enough to forgive her.

1661
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:35,583
Stop it, Viplav.

1662
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:39,083
Let's discuss this later.
It's getting late for the office.

1663
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:40,750
Yes, I told all lies.

1664
01:43:42,291 --> 01:43:46,333
I should have also lied that I didn't love
you. It would have saved all this labor.

1665
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,125
I deserve this for
leaving everything for you.

1666
01:43:52,416 --> 01:43:54,208
Why are you behaving like a kid?

1667
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:59,375
Is it right for you to intrude when wife
and husband are arguing?

1668
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:01,833
Hey…

1669
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:04,416
why are you venting out on her?

1670
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:06,416
You calm down.

1671
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:07,583
Apologize to her.

1672
01:44:07,916 --> 01:44:09,333
Why should she say sorry to me?

1673
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:12,125
Don't bother, dear.
Let's go to the office now.

1674
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:16,250
Apologize to her, Aaradhya.

1675
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:22,750
Sorry, madam.

1676
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:28,458
Viplav…

1677
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:39,583
Aaradhya is a girl with self-esteem.
She is hurt for sure.

1678
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:42,166
Let it be, madam.
Nothing will happen.

1679
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:44,416
She said she erred in trusting you.

1680
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,166
That's an uneasy
feeling for any girl to get.

1681
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:48,916
Madam, we should
keep them within their limits.

1682
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:50,583
Hey, stop.

1683
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:52,750
What happened, madam?

1684
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:54,208
Get down.

1685
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:56,500
What did you say?

1686
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:59,625
We should keep them within their limits.

1687
01:44:59,708 --> 01:45:02,166
That applies to all the women, right?

1688
01:45:02,833 --> 01:45:07,958
That coconut seller, Aaradhya,
myself, everyone, right?

1689
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:10,291
What is the connection with
that coconut seller, madam?

1690
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:11,416
Well, didn't you just say it?

1691
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:14,541
Why do you paint every
woman with the same brush?

1692
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,458
You're just like any other male.

1693
01:45:18,041 --> 01:45:19,000
Do one thing.

1694
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:20,916
Walk to the office.

1695
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:22,708
Madam.

1696
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:25,541
Yes, just think about what you said.

1697
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:28,000
Madam.

1698
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:29,458
Don't leave me here, madam.

1699
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:39,166
Why is Aaradhya doing this?

1700
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:42,458
The moment I stepped in…

1701
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,666
she said I slammed the door on her,
and she felt like committing suicide.

1702
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:49,666
Even I am outside that door now.

1703
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:51,500
What if I also commit suicide?

1704
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:53,583
Marriage itself means
writing our own obituary.

1705
01:45:53,666 --> 01:45:56,291
You are a dead meat. RIP…

1706
01:45:56,375 --> 01:45:57,541
Sir, shall I squeeze a lemon?

1707
01:45:57,625 --> 01:45:59,708
Who asked you to barge in like this?

1708
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:03,541
We were bitching about our wives!
Get the hell out of here.

1709
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:04,541
Keep the munchies here.

1710
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:08,291
You should always be kept
within your limits.

1711
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:09,625
You…

1712
01:46:10,458 --> 01:46:11,375
Have you got any shame?

1713
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,833
Why do you talk like a male chauvinist?

1714
01:46:15,208 --> 01:46:16,250
How do we treat women then?

1715
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:19,166
You should think highly of them.

1716
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:21,166
Oh. Okay.

1717
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:24,166
Sister. Sorry. Please don't mind.

1718
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:25,625
Please squeeze a lemon.

1719
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:28,083
Squeeze one for him first.

1720
01:46:36,791 --> 01:46:38,041
Sister! Hey!

1721
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,083
-Sister, wait!
-How many glasses will you break?

1722
01:46:41,666 --> 01:46:43,166
Why are you scared so much?

1723
01:46:43,708 --> 01:46:44,791
Relax. Come.

1724
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:47,041
What do you think about me?

1725
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:51,375
People may have their opinions about me.

1726
01:46:51,875 --> 01:46:53,166
But I am a feminist at heart.

1727
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,375
Please sit. Sit.

1728
01:46:57,333 --> 01:46:58,208
Sit down.

1729
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:04,416
Clean yourself.

1730
01:47:05,458 --> 01:47:07,416
Wow!

1731
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:09,666
Poor Aaradhya. I can empathize
with how she must be feeling.

1732
01:47:12,916 --> 01:47:16,125
I just wanted to draw her
closer, hug her, and say sorry.

1733
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,916
You can still do that.

1734
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:21,166
Just imagine our maid Lakshmi
to be Aaradhya for a moment.

1735
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:22,333
You can hug her

1736
01:47:22,416 --> 01:47:23,875
-Dirty fellow!
-and show your emotions.

1737
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:27,125
Aaradhya is the only woman
I have in my life.

1738
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:29,291
Nobody else.

1739
01:47:29,375 --> 01:47:30,250
Okay, sir.

1740
01:47:33,416 --> 01:47:35,291
I can't stand these night shifts.

1741
01:47:36,291 --> 01:47:38,958
What are you wearing
for tomorrow's success party?

1742
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,750
I am not in the mood for it.

1743
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:46,958
Hey, there's your husband!

1744
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:49,625
Look, there.

1745
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:00,250
Aaradhya!

1746
01:48:00,458 --> 01:48:01,333
Aaradhya!

1747
01:48:02,333 --> 01:48:03,166
Aaradhya!

1748
01:48:11,166 --> 01:48:12,041
Baby.

1749
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:15,083
Look at your eyes.
They are restless.

1750
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,791
You should stop these night shifts.
Hold this.

1751
01:48:19,666 --> 01:48:20,583
Have this coffee.

1752
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:22,166
I made it.

1753
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:29,791
Baby! Hey!

1754
01:48:32,291 --> 01:48:33,416
Baby, have it. Please.

1755
01:48:33,708 --> 01:48:36,208
Dear, do you know him?

1756
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,625
-Yes.
-No.

1757
01:48:39,166 --> 01:48:41,000
-Baby…
-Don't you have any other work?

1758
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,875
Auntie, no.
She's kidding.

1759
01:48:42,958 --> 01:48:44,416
Move out. Go and stand over there.

1760
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:46,333
-Baby, tell her.
-Move.

1761
01:48:47,166 --> 01:48:48,875
-Move.
-Take this as well.

1762
01:48:49,041 --> 01:48:50,250
Baby, say something.

1763
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:56,583
-Today's match was excellent!
-It was great!

1764
01:48:56,708 --> 01:48:58,875
-He batted so well!
-He could have been dismissed.

1765
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:00,208
We bowled really well as well.

1766
01:49:01,666 --> 01:49:02,958
He took three wickets.

1767
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:05,375
If not for him,
we would have lost the match.

1768
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:09,083
-The match went till the last ball!
-Exactly.

1769
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:10,041
It was fun.

1770
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:12,166
-Shall I play? I'll teach you.
-No.

1771
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,416
-Let me teach you. Leave it!
-Hey!

1772
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,625
-Please!
-Let me play.

1773
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:17,375
Say it…

1774
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:20,875
-I am yours!
-I am yours!

1775
01:49:21,375 --> 01:49:24,666
Say it…

1776
01:49:24,875 --> 01:49:27,416
-I am yours!
-Hey!

1777
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:28,416
Hey, give it back.

1778
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,333
Do you want me to call the police?

1779
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:33,125
Hey, the teacher is upset.

1780
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:36,958
Guys, it's finals tomorrow.
Let's be serious about it.

1781
01:49:37,041 --> 01:49:39,166
Hey, listen!
She's the girl from our colony.

1782
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:40,875
Remember the one at the medical shop?

1783
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:44,208
She's trying hard for a kid
for over a year now.

1784
01:49:46,166 --> 01:49:47,041
Baby…

1785
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:49,791
You're tender like a baby.

1786
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,250
Do you still need babies?

1787
01:49:58,708 --> 01:49:59,583
Hi.

1788
01:50:00,166 --> 01:50:01,083
Dilip!

1789
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,791
Why don't you give me a chance?

1790
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:05,500
-I will fulfill your wish.
-Hey.

1791
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:08,666
I've helped many aunties get pregnant.

1792
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:10,791
I can assist you as well.

1793
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:13,541
You can trust me.
Just give me a chance.

1794
01:50:13,916 --> 01:50:17,375
Please! Just give me a chance. Please!

1795
01:50:27,416 --> 01:50:28,333
Dilip!

1796
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:29,375
Dilip!

1797
01:50:37,333 --> 01:50:38,208
Hey!

1798
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:44,833
Never tease a lady
if she is wearing a nuptial chain.

1799
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:47,958
Especially when her husband is with her.

1800
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:52,000
That's me.

1801
01:51:41,125 --> 01:51:43,333
Hey, if I hit, it will be a six for sure!

1802
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,333
-Got it?
-Hey!

1803
01:51:44,416 --> 01:51:45,416
-Go and hit it then!
-Hey!

1804
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:48,375
Hey, I am the best player
from Ghatkopar! Don't mess with me!

1805
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:49,875
-Get lost!
-Teacher!

1806
01:52:19,791 --> 01:52:22,833
Say it…
I wrecked you!

1807
01:52:23,458 --> 01:52:24,333
We are sorry, sir.

1808
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:25,583
Out!

1809
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
-He smashed us!
-Let's get out of here!

1810
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,583
Let's go!

1811
01:52:42,416 --> 01:52:43,291
Baby!

1812
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:45,041
Baby, sorry.

1813
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:48,750
We didn't talk for two days.

1814
01:52:48,958 --> 01:52:50,958
I won't leave you until you talk to me.

1815
01:52:51,791 --> 01:52:52,708
Baby.

1816
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:57,416
I feel these rifts are because
of the defects my dad pointed out.

1817
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,916
What are you saying?
I don't think so.

1818
01:53:01,791 --> 01:53:02,708
What about the miscarriage?

1819
01:53:03,458 --> 01:53:04,583
That's a medical condition.

1820
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:06,750
Didn't the doctor say that
it is quite common?

1821
01:53:07,375 --> 01:53:08,291
What about the fight on the terrace?

1822
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:11,250
Oh, that's not a fight.

1823
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:13,291
It's a miscommunication.

1824
01:53:16,625 --> 01:53:19,250
We're the best couple in the colony.

1825
01:53:19,916 --> 01:53:21,666
Nothing will crop up between us.

1826
01:53:25,875 --> 01:53:26,916
Don't you believe me?

1827
01:53:29,083 --> 01:53:30,041
Okay.

1828
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:35,875
The world will see how good
a husband I am for the next 24 hours.

1829
01:53:40,791 --> 01:53:41,708
Baby!

1830
01:53:43,375 --> 01:53:44,500
Let's both get tested.

1831
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:51,041
If there's some issue, we will fix it.

1832
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:53,000
Else, as my dad said…

1833
01:53:53,083 --> 01:53:54,375
Why talk about your dad?

1834
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:57,791
You want to get tested, right?

1835
01:54:00,041 --> 01:54:01,333
I will do…

1836
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:02,958
as you say.

1837
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:04,625
Fix it!

1838
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:11,791
Love you, baby.

1839
01:54:18,125 --> 01:54:19,041
Isn't the doctor here?

1840
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,000
Hello, brother.

1841
01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:28,833
My friend, Viplav is a fresher.

1842
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:30,833
Five years seniority.

1843
01:54:32,666 --> 01:54:33,583
You…

1844
01:54:33,958 --> 01:54:35,250
Why are you calling me out by name?

1845
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:37,833
I will leave if you do all this.

1846
01:54:37,916 --> 01:54:39,041
Hey, just sit down, dude.

1847
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:42,041
We're meeting Dappu Subhani,
the best sexologist in Kurla.

1848
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:46,291
Don't call him a sexologist.
It is a fertility clinic.

1849
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:48,916
There are deadly stories about him, dude!

1850
01:54:49,625 --> 01:54:51,583
But why are you embarrassing me, dude?

1851
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:52,916
Please keep quiet.

1852
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:55,125
I don't doubt my abilities.

1853
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:57,250
I came here because of Aaradhya.

1854
01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:58,750
Calm down, man.

1855
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,500
Love you too, nurse.

1856
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:05,208
-Idiot!
-Let's go.

1857
01:55:06,875 --> 01:55:07,750
Hi, Subhani sir.

1858
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:09,291
-Come sit.
-Greetings.

1859
01:55:12,333 --> 01:55:13,291
He's my friend, sir.

1860
01:55:13,625 --> 01:55:15,375
Works like a bull, but to no avail!

1861
01:55:15,708 --> 01:55:17,333
His wife wants a child.

1862
01:55:17,708 --> 01:55:18,916
Please help him out, sir.

1863
01:55:19,208 --> 01:55:20,250
What's the hurry?

1864
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:22,166
Let them take the test.

1865
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:24,541
If the test is successful,
will they beget children?

1866
01:55:24,916 --> 01:55:27,750
What's the hurry?
Let them take the test.

1867
01:55:28,416 --> 01:55:29,625
What if there's a problem?

1868
01:55:29,791 --> 01:55:32,791
What's the hurry?
Let them take the test.

1869
01:55:33,083 --> 01:55:35,916
-Sir, you must make him manly again.
-Hey!

1870
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,666
What's the hurry?

1871
01:55:37,791 --> 01:55:39,708
-Let them take the test.
-Come.

1872
01:55:40,041 --> 01:55:41,875
-Go! Get it done.
-Okay, sir.

1873
01:55:42,166 --> 01:55:43,833
Viplav, be blessed with kids.

1874
01:55:45,125 --> 01:55:46,041
Fill it to the brim.

1875
01:55:46,125 --> 01:55:47,500
Is it the Niagara Falls?
Come, let's go.

1876
01:55:51,833 --> 01:55:52,708
Hey!

1877
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:53,916
What happened?

1878
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:55,041
Look at the rush!

1879
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:57,875
-This doctor is very famous!
-I am not staying here!

1880
01:55:57,958 --> 01:55:59,208
Hey, stop! Let me handle it!

1881
01:55:59,333 --> 01:56:00,750
Come. Uncle, move aside, please.

1882
01:56:00,833 --> 01:56:03,166
Move aside!
We are from the department.

1883
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:05,500
So what?
How can you jump the queue?

1884
01:56:05,583 --> 01:56:08,666
Uncle, my friend is from BSNL.
This test is very important for him.

1885
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:10,166
Don't tell them about me.

1886
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:11,958
Our phones have not been working
for the past two months. Go, fix it.

1887
01:56:12,041 --> 01:56:13,958
It has been fixed. Go and check it.

1888
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:15,583
We all have the same problem.

1889
01:56:15,708 --> 01:56:17,208
Please try to understand.

1890
01:56:17,333 --> 01:56:19,166
-What's there to understand?
-What are you talking?

1891
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:21,583
Listen to me for a minute.

1892
01:56:21,666 --> 01:56:22,916
-Listen to me. Try to understand.
-Don't we have anything else to do?

1893
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,291
Hey! Shut up!

1894
01:56:25,625 --> 01:56:26,833
My name is Viplav.

1895
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,541
A BSNL employee.

1896
01:56:29,833 --> 01:56:32,125
Just wait for two minutes.
I will fill the container and come out.

1897
01:56:33,166 --> 01:56:35,666
-What nonsense is this?
-How can you let him go inside?

1898
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:36,833
I have sent you a link on WhatsApp.

1899
01:56:39,708 --> 01:56:41,333
For ten years of our company.

1900
01:56:42,083 --> 01:56:43,166
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1901
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:45,041
And Michael,

1902
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,500
as I promised, your project
was completed on time.

1903
01:56:48,666 --> 01:56:50,708
Thanks to my dedication,
devotion, and hard work.

1904
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:53,708
Not yours.
It's Aaradhya's hard work.

1905
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:57,875
Of course, but she's on my team.

1906
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,333
Can you leave us for some time?

1907
01:57:01,916 --> 01:57:02,750
Now?

1908
01:57:10,458 --> 01:57:11,333
Aaradhya.

1909
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:13,083
I am so impressed with your work.

1910
01:57:13,916 --> 01:57:15,125
You are a big support for me.

1911
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:16,708
Thank you, Michael.

1912
01:57:17,125 --> 01:57:18,291
Hey, listen to me.

1913
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:21,666
Whatever happens in life,
never miss a party, dude.

1914
01:57:21,875 --> 01:57:23,291
Okay? Just chill.

1915
01:57:23,958 --> 01:57:25,416
-Aaradhya.
-Wow! Hey!

1916
01:57:27,041 --> 01:57:27,958
Are you married?

1917
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:30,500
Yes, I am.

1918
01:57:30,916 --> 01:57:31,958
That's bad news for me.

1919
01:57:32,708 --> 01:57:34,375
Otherwise, I would've married you.

1920
01:57:35,291 --> 01:57:36,291
He's into you.

1921
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:38,875
Anyone can easily fall in love with you.

1922
01:57:39,208 --> 01:57:40,833
Hey, what happened?

1923
01:57:42,625 --> 01:57:45,458
That white fellow says
he will date her if she is single.

1924
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:47,208
She should have slapped him!

1925
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,333
But she's laughing with him.

1926
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,208
-I don't want to stay here. Let's go home.
-Hey, wait.

1927
01:57:54,375 --> 01:57:56,708
The drinks are free.
Let's have some and then leave.

1928
01:57:56,916 --> 01:57:58,916
I promise. Just two drinks.

1929
01:57:59,583 --> 01:58:01,333
-One drink for you, two for me.
-Excuse me.

1930
01:58:01,416 --> 01:58:02,416
-Hey, no. Let's go.
-Please…

1931
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,375
Viplav…

1932
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:06,000
-Hi.
-Let me introduce my client.

1933
01:58:06,583 --> 01:58:07,458
No need.

1934
01:58:07,666 --> 01:58:08,750
-Are you okay?
-Go.

1935
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:10,875
What happened to the test?

1936
01:58:14,583 --> 01:58:16,125
He must have failed the test.

1937
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:18,583
He's surely down now.

1938
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:20,958
Guys are very sensitive on these matters.

1939
01:58:21,125 --> 01:58:22,750
Don't ask him now, Aaradhya.

1940
01:58:22,958 --> 01:58:25,166
You can discuss it at home.

1941
01:58:26,708 --> 01:58:27,541
Come.

1942
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:33,000
Pour me some more.

1943
01:58:33,875 --> 01:58:34,875
Perfect. Yes.

1944
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:35,958
Here. Drink it.

1945
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:40,166
Everything will be fine after two drinks.
Drink. Come on!

1946
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:41,708
Come on. Drink.

1947
01:58:42,791 --> 01:58:43,708
Cheers.

1948
01:58:43,833 --> 01:58:44,708
Hey!

1949
01:58:45,166 --> 01:58:46,750
Who are you? who invited you?

1950
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:47,791
I am his friend, sir.

1951
01:58:48,208 --> 01:58:50,541
Aaradhya told us about Viplav.

1952
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:51,625
Where did he come from?

1953
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,000
What is this?
What are you drinking?

1954
01:58:55,041 --> 01:58:56,041
-It is a foreign brand.
-Glenfiddich.

1955
01:58:56,125 --> 01:58:57,458
-Repeat after me.
-Fridge.

1956
01:58:57,625 --> 01:58:58,791
It's beyond your status, man!

1957
01:58:59,291 --> 01:59:01,458
It is for premium people like me.

1958
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:05,625
You can't buy this one
with even your monthly salary.

1959
01:59:05,791 --> 01:59:06,875
Go to the other counter.

1960
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
We've kept cheap liquor
for freeloaders like you.

1961
01:59:10,916 --> 01:59:11,750
Go.

1962
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,625
Idiot. What's wrong with you?

1963
01:59:16,375 --> 01:59:17,208
Give me a tissue.

1964
01:59:24,958 --> 01:59:27,666
Even my dad has never
humiliated me like this.

1965
01:59:27,916 --> 01:59:29,833
At home, she is always depressed.

1966
01:59:30,625 --> 01:59:32,291
Look how happy she is with her colleagues.

1967
01:59:33,875 --> 01:59:36,416
I throw a party for many friends
every day at my penthouse.

1968
01:59:36,875 --> 01:59:38,000
Now he's talking about my status!

1969
01:59:38,208 --> 01:59:39,750
She won't even talk to me
just because I said no?

1970
01:59:40,458 --> 01:59:42,000
She should come here and talk to me.

1971
01:59:42,916 --> 01:59:45,750
Dude, you're always obsessed
with your wife. Don't you value me?

1972
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,708
I've helped you so much! Got you married!
Took you to the doctor.

1973
01:59:49,875 --> 01:59:52,250
Your pain is mine,
but my pain isn't yours!

1974
01:59:52,333 --> 01:59:54,625
You didn't even say anything to that jerk
after he humiliated me!

1975
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:55,875
You look nice.

1976
01:59:58,833 --> 02:00:00,041
-Come with me.
-Why?

1977
02:00:09,291 --> 02:00:12,083
Now Glen-fridge won't work.
Only cheap liquor will soothe your pain.

1978
02:00:12,333 --> 02:00:14,166
Do you understand?

1979
02:00:25,666 --> 02:00:27,833
Mustafa, Mustafa!

1980
02:00:27,916 --> 02:00:29,791
-Don't worry, Mustafa!
-I am sorry.

1981
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,250
Viplav, remember me?

1982
02:00:33,041 --> 02:00:34,083
I am Ratna.

1983
02:00:34,583 --> 02:00:35,833
From Wilson High School?

1984
02:00:37,333 --> 02:00:38,833
-Oh…
-Oh…

1985
02:00:39,125 --> 02:00:40,083
-Ratna!
-Ratna!

1986
02:00:41,625 --> 02:00:43,875
-Tenth class, C-section.
-Tenth class, C-section.

1987
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,875
-You were so small.
-How you've grown!

1988
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,291
-I proposed to you thrice then.
-Me?

1989
02:00:49,416 --> 02:00:52,166
-But you rejected me every time.
-Oh, shit!

1990
02:00:52,333 --> 02:00:54,375
Are you mad? Who rejects a girl?

1991
02:00:54,458 --> 02:00:57,083
-I was a kid. I made a mistake.
-How could you?

1992
02:00:58,041 --> 02:00:59,625
Apologize. Apologize to her.

1993
02:01:00,208 --> 02:01:01,416
Sorry, Ratna.

1994
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,541
But bad luck. I am married now.

1995
02:01:04,666 --> 02:01:07,458
I am happy that you got married.

1996
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,666
-Why?
-Because now I have three beautiful kids.

1997
02:01:12,291 --> 02:01:14,833
I feel sorry for your plight.

1998
02:01:14,916 --> 02:01:15,958
So sad!

1999
02:01:16,083 --> 02:01:17,166
My plight?

2000
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,375
Hey!

2001
02:01:18,583 --> 02:01:21,500
Why is Ratna feeling sad for me, brother?
What happened to me?

2002
02:01:21,666 --> 02:01:24,541
Aaradhya, my uncle is a
famous doctor in Australia.

2003
02:01:24,833 --> 02:01:28,166
He has treated men
aged over 50 for infertility.

2004
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,625
Let's consult him for Viplav.

2005
02:01:33,125 --> 02:01:35,000
I know a saint from Solapur.

2006
02:01:35,083 --> 02:01:36,708
Let's take Viplav there.

2007
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:38,583
How do all of them know about it?
Did you tell them?

2008
02:01:38,708 --> 02:01:40,083
Why will I tell them?

2009
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:42,166
I thought he was a powerhouse.

2010
02:01:42,833 --> 02:01:44,041
Oh, my God!

2011
02:01:45,166 --> 02:01:46,791
I'm going to kill myself.

2012
02:01:46,916 --> 02:01:48,250
-Don't worry.
-I'm going to die.

2013
02:01:48,583 --> 02:01:51,625
Why is she telling everybody
about my personal issues?

2014
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,333
These wives can't
keep anything to themselves.

2015
02:01:54,416 --> 02:01:56,416
Hey, stop it. Are you crazy?

2016
02:01:56,666 --> 02:02:00,250
Get on the stage!
Announce it! Go!

2017
02:02:10,625 --> 02:02:12,125
Greetings to everyone.

2018
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:17,791
A humble request to all the folks here

2019
02:02:17,875 --> 02:02:20,833
who are agog with discussions
about my virulence and manliness.

2020
02:02:22,791 --> 02:02:25,333
I just got the lab test results.

2021
02:02:25,625 --> 02:02:28,875
I've got the certificate
for my virulence.

2022
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:34,583
But my wife is spreading
fake stories to defame me.

2023
02:02:36,125 --> 02:02:38,041
Let me now share a story about my--

2024
02:02:38,583 --> 02:02:39,500
Sorry.

2025
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:43,750
I mean, wives in general.

2026
02:02:43,916 --> 02:02:44,875
Just listen to me.

2027
02:02:57,375 --> 02:02:58,291
Hey!

2028
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:06,708
For the first time
I saw her in Kashmir

2029
02:03:06,791 --> 02:03:09,416
Without thinking anything
I started loving her

2030
02:03:09,666 --> 02:03:12,375
Without listening to my mother
I came out for her

2031
02:03:12,833 --> 02:03:15,541
Got married married to her
And made a blunder!

2032
02:03:16,916 --> 02:03:18,750
Then the struggle began

2033
02:03:19,958 --> 02:03:21,250
She has changed day by day

2034
02:03:21,416 --> 02:03:22,666
My dear wife

2035
02:03:24,333 --> 02:03:27,083
You have become like a hot chili

2036
02:03:27,375 --> 02:03:28,666
Please stop dear

2037
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:32,666
I am struggling like a hen
Before the butcher kills it

2038
02:03:33,666 --> 02:03:36,625
Listen everybody
Let me tell you something

2039
02:03:36,791 --> 02:03:39,708
Don't even dream to get married

2040
02:03:39,791 --> 02:03:44,375
Wife is powerful than gun
She will get you pissed

2041
02:03:45,791 --> 02:03:48,625
Listen every body
Let me tell you something

2042
02:03:48,708 --> 02:03:51,708
Don't even dream to get married

2043
02:03:51,791 --> 02:03:56,416
Wife is powerful than gun
She will get you pissed

2044
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:24,458
They won't open the door
When we go home late

2045
02:04:24,791 --> 02:04:27,416
If we drink with friends
They will peel off the skin with words

2046
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:30,333
They always keeps eye on ex-girlfriend

2047
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:33,250
They can track their husbands
Like a drone

2048
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:36,541
They pamper you with nicknames

2049
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:39,333
They will treat you like God
On special occasions

2050
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:42,541
If we speak one word against them

2051
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:45,541
Just do as you have been instructed

2052
02:04:46,916 --> 02:04:48,583
Wife became a knife

2053
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:51,416
Life has become arid

2054
02:04:52,875 --> 02:04:54,541
With her entry

2055
02:04:55,916 --> 02:04:58,208
My fate has burnt to ashes

2056
02:05:12,708 --> 02:05:17,083
Wives are ghosts

2057
02:05:18,708 --> 02:05:23,083
Ghosts are wives

2058
02:05:24,666 --> 02:05:27,541
Wives… you are not good wives

2059
02:05:27,625 --> 02:05:30,375
Ghosts… you are all ghosts

2060
02:05:30,458 --> 02:05:31,791
My dear wife

2061
02:05:33,208 --> 02:05:36,125
You have become like a hot chili

2062
02:05:36,291 --> 02:05:37,750
Please stop

2063
02:05:37,875 --> 02:05:39,125
Please stop dear

2064
02:05:39,333 --> 02:05:42,166
I am struggling like a hen
Before the butcher kills it

2065
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:45,458
Listen, everybody
Let me tell you something

2066
02:05:45,541 --> 02:05:48,500
Don't even dream to get married

2067
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:53,375
Wife is powerful than gun
She will get you pissed

2068
02:05:54,666 --> 02:05:57,541
Listen, everybody
Let me tell you something

2069
02:05:57,708 --> 02:06:00,583
Don't even dream to get married

2070
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:05,500
Wife is powerful than gun
She will get you pissed

2071
02:06:36,708 --> 02:06:39,083
We've a fight in less than 24 hours.

2072
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:41,250
Who said couples don't fight?

2073
02:06:42,041 --> 02:06:43,416
This is very common.

2074
02:06:45,875 --> 02:06:50,291
If both of us don't have a problem,
then where's the problem?

2075
02:06:52,083 --> 02:06:53,125
You tell me about it.

2076
02:06:53,625 --> 02:06:56,250
As my dad foretold, the problem
lies in that horoscope defect.

2077
02:06:56,416 --> 02:07:00,541
All this is because you
haven't done that oblation yet.

2078
02:07:00,625 --> 02:07:01,541
Aaradhya…

2079
02:07:02,458 --> 02:07:04,458
my dad has an image
to live up to in society.

2080
02:07:05,875 --> 02:07:08,541
I can't make him do all these rituals.

2081
02:07:10,833 --> 02:07:12,791
Please give me some time.
Everything will get sorted.

2082
02:07:13,583 --> 02:07:15,375
Nothing will change for years, Viplav.

2083
02:07:15,958 --> 02:07:18,000
Do you remember that one day
we were talking about miscarriage

2084
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:20,125
at a traffic signal,

2085
02:07:20,208 --> 02:07:22,708
and a saint threw holy ash
and said the same thing?

2086
02:07:22,791 --> 02:07:23,666
So?

2087
02:07:24,083 --> 02:07:26,625
Everyone is trying to
nudge us to do the oblation.

2088
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:27,625
Hey!

2089
02:07:28,708 --> 02:07:29,625
Have you gone mad?

2090
02:07:30,333 --> 02:07:31,375
Are you possessed?

2091
02:07:31,458 --> 02:07:34,208
So, you trust the devil but can't
seem to believe in God!

2092
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:35,625
Oh, Aaradhya. Just leave me alone.

2093
02:07:37,666 --> 02:07:38,833
So, do you want me to walk out?

2094
02:07:38,916 --> 02:07:40,458
No, I am asking you
to leave me now!

2095
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:42,166
Let me go to sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

2096
02:07:46,041 --> 02:07:46,916
Viplav.

2097
02:07:49,083 --> 02:07:51,083
Who were you thinking about
during the test?

2098
02:07:56,625 --> 02:07:58,291
When I was young,
I saw the movie Titanic.

2099
02:07:58,625 --> 02:08:02,041
So whenever I am in a bad mood,
I talk to that heroine.

2100
02:08:04,541 --> 02:08:05,416
Why?

2101
02:08:05,916 --> 02:08:07,000
Did you think
I was thinking about you?

2102
02:08:19,208 --> 02:08:20,083
Have something.

2103
02:08:22,666 --> 02:08:23,791
Did you guys fight again?

2104
02:08:26,541 --> 02:08:28,541
It's Lissy's birthday in two days.

2105
02:08:29,416 --> 02:08:31,083
Thomas and I are going to Alleppey.

2106
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:33,416
It's a beautiful place.

2107
02:08:34,666 --> 02:08:36,750
You and Aaradhya need a change.

2108
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,083
Both of you can come with us.

2109
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:39,916
Oh, madam.

2110
02:08:40,625 --> 02:08:41,625
Why us?

2111
02:08:42,875 --> 02:08:46,000
We don't want to play
spoilsport in your party.

2112
02:08:48,125 --> 02:08:50,416
Don't make excuses, Viplav.
It's my daughter's birthday.

2113
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,750
Please listen to me…

2114
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:54,375
Come with her,
or I'll send you back to Kashmir.

2115
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:56,666
Okay?

2116
02:09:05,041 --> 02:09:06,500
Zoya and her
husband left for Alleppey.

2117
02:09:10,625 --> 02:09:11,916
I just dropped them off at the airport.

2118
02:09:12,458 --> 02:09:13,458
It's Lissy's birthday.

2119
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:19,166
They also invited us.
It will be nice to go to Kerala.

2120
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Look, Aaradhya…

2121
02:09:25,791 --> 02:09:28,791
Zoya ma'am has helped us
a lot since day one.

2122
02:09:29,875 --> 02:09:31,166
So, drop your ego…

2123
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:34,375
I mean,

2124
02:09:34,666 --> 02:09:38,875
let's drop our egos and go there.
They will be happy to have us.

2125
02:09:41,208 --> 02:09:42,875
Let us not be childish…

2126
02:09:43,666 --> 02:09:45,000
and act more mature.

2127
02:10:13,416 --> 02:10:17,250
Sir, Kunjappan's boat is the
best boat available in Alleppey.

2128
02:10:17,583 --> 02:10:19,791
If you are in love, you will tie the
knot when you get onto this boat.

2129
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,125
If you are married,
you will have kids here.

2130
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:23,916
How many kids do you have?

2131
02:10:24,583 --> 02:10:25,958
How many kids?

2132
02:10:26,208 --> 02:10:27,166
Tell me.

2133
02:10:31,416 --> 02:10:33,375
You drive it.

2134
02:10:36,375 --> 02:10:37,250
Go forward.

2135
02:10:45,333 --> 02:10:46,291
Give me some water.

2136
02:10:47,291 --> 02:10:48,166
Aaradhya.

2137
02:11:04,125 --> 02:11:05,125
It's not what you think.

2138
02:11:05,458 --> 02:11:06,791
I am in my monthly cycle.

2139
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,083
We would have canceled
the program in that case.

2140
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:13,333
Now, you say that.
But if I said this earlier…

2141
02:11:14,875 --> 02:11:19,958
you would have been angry at me
and called me a liar. That's why I didn't.

2142
02:11:20,583 --> 02:11:22,750
Please don't start arguing with me.

2143
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:24,958
-Am I arguing?
-Obviously!

2144
02:11:26,083 --> 02:11:27,041
All I am saying is that…

2145
02:11:27,916 --> 02:11:30,333
you should have told me before
we started. What's wrong with that?

2146
02:11:31,375 --> 02:11:33,083
Did you really ask me
if I was alright or not?

2147
02:11:33,166 --> 02:11:35,583
Why do you girls turn out like
this after marriage?

2148
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:37,625
Always fussing about it.

2149
02:11:39,708 --> 02:11:43,458
If you didn't want to spend time with me,
you could've stayed back at home.

2150
02:11:44,083 --> 02:11:45,458
I came here for Zoya madam.

2151
02:11:46,125 --> 02:11:47,833
Superb! Thank you.

2152
02:11:49,291 --> 02:11:52,625
Just stay patient for two days for the
sake of Zoya madam without fighting!

2153
02:11:53,666 --> 02:11:55,000
Later, you can do what you feel like.

2154
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:58,458
You can decide if you want to stay with me
or go to your house.

2155
02:12:00,541 --> 02:12:03,166
Let's stay away from
each other for two days.

2156
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:04,416
You are driving me crazy!

2157
02:12:34,375 --> 02:12:36,666
The moment

2158
02:12:37,125 --> 02:12:39,291
When my heart dissolves

2159
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,000
In your nearness

2160
02:12:45,625 --> 02:12:48,291
Praising your name

2161
02:12:48,416 --> 02:12:51,125
With all my heart

2162
02:12:51,208 --> 02:12:55,291
Is all I want

2163
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,625
Oh Lord

2164
02:12:59,791 --> 02:13:02,375
Who saves this world

2165
02:13:02,583 --> 02:13:07,125
With boundless love

2166
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:10,791
In your world

2167
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:13,625
My child's life is

2168
02:13:13,875 --> 02:13:18,000
Sweeter than the elixir

2169
02:13:21,166 --> 02:13:23,666
Let's celebrate Lissy's birthday.

2170
02:13:23,833 --> 02:13:25,500
Happy birthday, Lissy.

2171
02:13:26,583 --> 02:13:27,750
Happy birthday.

2172
02:13:28,666 --> 02:13:30,208
Okay. Thank you, Father.

2173
02:13:30,291 --> 02:13:31,375
Come on, let's enjoy.

2174
02:13:31,458 --> 02:13:35,083
-Everybody, please enjoy!
-Enjoy your food and drinks.

2175
02:13:35,583 --> 02:13:37,833
-Viplav! Welcome.
-Hi, Viplav. Aaradhya.

2176
02:13:38,875 --> 02:13:41,000
Hey, why are you looking sad, Viplav?

2177
02:13:41,166 --> 02:13:42,625
Don't you know it is
Lissy's birthday today?

2178
02:13:42,708 --> 02:13:44,375
Come, let's enjoy.

2179
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,625
Lissy doesn't like gloomy faces.

2180
02:13:50,708 --> 02:13:52,375
It is Lissy's birthday, Viplav.

2181
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,916
You must have a drink.
Right?

2182
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:56,291
Come on. Cheers.

2183
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:57,583
Cheers, Aaradhya.

2184
02:13:58,916 --> 02:13:59,791
No!

2185
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,541
What happened to Lissy, madam?

2186
02:14:09,666 --> 02:14:12,541
Lissy… Her time's up.

2187
02:14:14,125 --> 02:14:15,083
She's gone.

2188
02:14:26,416 --> 02:14:28,916
I still remember the
day I delivered Lissy.

2189
02:14:30,541 --> 02:14:31,791
She was a premature baby…

2190
02:14:34,208 --> 02:14:38,083
with most features unformed yet.

2191
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:45,833
When I picked her up,
the doctors warned that…

2192
02:14:47,125 --> 02:14:48,500
she was extremely fragile
and may break her bones.

2193
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:52,625
My heart sank…

2194
02:14:53,875 --> 02:14:55,333
that very moment.

2195
02:14:59,083 --> 02:15:02,583
All the relatives who saw her
left without saying a word.

2196
02:15:05,291 --> 02:15:07,666
Doctors gave her just six months.

2197
02:15:11,875 --> 02:15:13,875
That was when Thomas held my hand…

2198
02:15:15,166 --> 02:15:16,041
and said…

2199
02:15:18,541 --> 02:15:23,291
he would do everything in
his power to save her life.

2200
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:28,625
The confidence he gave me…

2201
02:15:30,625 --> 02:15:32,333
helped us save Lissy for five years.

2202
02:15:37,083 --> 02:15:38,666
After that, we didn't want any kids.

2203
02:15:39,958 --> 02:15:41,083
We don't want to…

2204
02:15:42,541 --> 02:15:44,125
trouble another life.

2205
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:47,166
We just became kids to each other.

2206
02:15:51,125 --> 02:15:53,875
With or without Lissy…

2207
02:15:55,708 --> 02:15:57,208
Thomas stood like a
rock of support for me.

2208
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,375
Thomas is my courage.

2209
02:16:07,333 --> 02:16:08,208
Hey.

2210
02:16:15,041 --> 02:16:16,083
Why talk melancholic

2211
02:16:16,166 --> 02:16:18,125
-when the mood is so upbeat?
-Correct.

2212
02:16:25,416 --> 02:16:26,416
Yes, Viplav.

2213
02:16:28,083 --> 02:16:29,041
Backwaters…

2214
02:16:30,791 --> 02:16:31,666
romantic mood…

2215
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:34,375
Enjoy.

2216
02:16:34,541 --> 02:16:35,708
-Right?
-Yes.

2217
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:36,958
Enjoy.

2218
02:17:31,541 --> 02:17:32,458
Aaradhya.

2219
02:17:45,666 --> 02:17:46,541
Kunjappan!

2220
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:49,666
Kunjappan!

2221
02:17:53,625 --> 02:17:54,583
Yes, brother?

2222
02:17:54,833 --> 02:17:56,000
Did you see Aaradhya?

2223
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:57,125
Who?

2224
02:17:57,291 --> 02:17:58,791
Aaradhya? My wife?

2225
02:18:00,083 --> 02:18:01,250
Hey, Johnson!

2226
02:18:01,583 --> 02:18:02,458
What?

2227
02:18:02,541 --> 02:18:04,458
Did you see his wife
traveling in a boat?

2228
02:18:04,833 --> 02:18:07,083
Yes, she left a while ago.

2229
02:18:07,875 --> 02:18:10,375
Sir, she left. Is there a problem?

2230
02:18:11,375 --> 02:18:13,000
Kunjappan, take the boat out!

2231
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:16,166
It's difficult to catch up in a boat.
Let's go on the bike.

2232
02:18:28,875 --> 02:18:29,750
There she is, sir.

2233
02:18:32,416 --> 02:18:33,250
Aaradhya.

2234
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,333
Where are you going?

2235
02:18:40,791 --> 02:18:43,625
As you wanted, I came for Zoya madam.

2236
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:45,458
Now I am leaving.

2237
02:18:47,166 --> 02:18:48,250
Where are you going, Aaradhya?

2238
02:18:51,125 --> 02:18:51,958
Pune.

2239
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:58,583
To Alleppey Railway Station.

2240
02:18:58,708 --> 02:19:00,458
Okay then, let me also join you.

2241
02:19:00,708 --> 02:19:03,791
Why do you want to come when
you wish to part ways, Viplav?

2242
02:19:05,416 --> 02:19:06,916
What are you saying, Aaradhya?

2243
02:19:09,541 --> 02:19:11,083
You don't get what I want.

2244
02:19:12,625 --> 02:19:14,083
When I tell you, you get irritated.

2245
02:19:15,583 --> 02:19:17,916
I am scared to even talk to you, Viplav.

2246
02:19:22,666 --> 02:19:23,791
All this while, I thought

2247
02:19:23,875 --> 02:19:26,583
you had a problem only with
my family and our orthodox ways.

2248
02:19:27,083 --> 02:19:28,250
Ma'am, will you come or not?

2249
02:19:29,625 --> 02:19:31,958
But you have a problem with me.

2250
02:19:34,333 --> 02:19:35,250
Aara…

2251
02:19:39,958 --> 02:19:46,375
Dear heart

2252
02:19:47,333 --> 02:19:53,250
Biding goodbye to us

2253
02:19:54,791 --> 02:20:00,666
Amidst nostalgic thoughts
I hope you are happy

2254
02:20:01,583 --> 02:20:04,708
The heart is wounded

2255
02:20:05,041 --> 02:20:08,458
Wishing to end life

2256
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:12,416
Your eyes wound me

2257
02:20:12,583 --> 02:20:16,000
Like a thorn

2258
02:20:16,125 --> 02:20:23,000
Heart is lost in anxiety
While silent pauses go up

2259
02:20:23,666 --> 02:20:26,791
We go on our separate paths

2260
02:20:27,250 --> 02:20:31,041
Our lives don't walk along now

2261
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:10,958
You stood by me

2262
02:21:11,041 --> 02:21:15,625
All these days like a loyal shadow

2263
02:21:16,375 --> 02:21:22,666
But now you desire to
Desert me for few days only

2264
02:21:23,208 --> 02:21:26,625
Every thought
In remembrance of you

2265
02:21:27,166 --> 02:21:30,500
Is meditation in love

2266
02:21:30,833 --> 02:21:34,208
But even a moment of forgetting me

2267
02:21:34,458 --> 02:21:37,458
Makes me pine for you

2268
02:21:37,541 --> 02:21:44,166
The heart is wounded
Wishing to end life

2269
02:21:44,916 --> 02:21:48,291
We go on our separate paths

2270
02:21:48,541 --> 02:21:52,250
Our lives don't walk along now

2271
02:21:58,916 --> 02:21:59,791
Hello!

2272
02:22:03,833 --> 02:22:04,791
Aaradhya!

2273
02:22:15,583 --> 02:22:16,958
Hello, Mr. Shankar.

2274
02:22:17,583 --> 02:22:20,125
It's common to see fights
between a wife and a husband.

2275
02:22:20,208 --> 02:22:22,125
My friend is pining for Aaradhya, sir.

2276
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:23,625
Please ask her to talk to him once.

2277
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:25,000
What's there to talk about now?

2278
02:22:25,083 --> 02:22:26,625
There is no relationship between them.

2279
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,750
Aaradhya herself says it's all over.

2280
02:22:32,458 --> 02:22:34,666
It seems there's nothing between the
both of you. Aaradhya herself said it.

2281
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:36,541
Let's leave.
It's getting late.

2282
02:22:39,875 --> 02:22:41,500
I can't stay without her, dude.

2283
02:22:46,125 --> 02:22:53,125
Like a kite that burns in fire
I burn in love

2284
02:22:54,250 --> 02:23:00,708
Even in my wildest dreams
I cannot imagine forgetting you

2285
02:23:01,083 --> 02:23:08,000
Pierce me with as many arrows as you want

2286
02:23:08,625 --> 02:23:10,375
My love

2287
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:15,208
Won't reduce a bit
You can test me

2288
02:23:15,291 --> 02:23:18,250
The heart is wounded

2289
02:23:18,958 --> 02:23:22,166
Wishing to end life

2290
02:23:22,666 --> 02:23:26,000
Your eyes wound me

2291
02:23:26,333 --> 02:23:29,750
Like a thorn

2292
02:23:29,833 --> 02:23:36,416
Heart is lost in anxiety
While silent pauses go up

2293
02:23:37,416 --> 02:23:40,500
We go on our separate paths

2294
02:23:41,041 --> 02:23:45,083
Our lives don't walk along now

2295
02:23:45,375 --> 02:23:51,916
Dear heart

2296
02:23:52,708 --> 02:23:59,125
Biding goodbye to us

2297
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:06,250
Amidst nostalgic thoughts
I hope you are happy

2298
02:24:14,541 --> 02:24:15,916
The auspicious time needs to be changed.

2299
02:24:16,250 --> 02:24:17,458
I will consult my father-in-law
and revert.

2300
02:24:17,791 --> 02:24:19,375
Call me after reaching Kothrud.

2301
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:32,333
Father-in-law!

2302
02:24:51,458 --> 02:24:53,000
I will do the sacred oblation, sir.

2303
02:24:54,541 --> 02:24:56,041
What about your father?

2304
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:58,333
Both of you need
to perform the oblation together.

2305
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:00,125
My father-in-law made this very clear.

2306
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:02,541
I still reiterate the same.

2307
02:25:03,708 --> 02:25:08,416
Is the hard-core atheist
Mr. Lenin Satyam coming to the temple?

2308
02:25:13,291 --> 02:25:14,375
Aaradhya.

2309
02:25:14,708 --> 02:25:16,208
We will talk about it only
after the oblation.

2310
02:25:20,625 --> 02:25:24,000
Oh, it's you, son! Come inside.

2311
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:25,791
Why don't you call him in?

2312
02:25:27,708 --> 02:25:33,166
Does he really want to come inside our
home amid the cows and the rituals we do?

2313
02:25:34,250 --> 02:25:35,958
Carry on. We'll notify you later.

2314
02:26:07,875 --> 02:26:08,958
Do you want to do the oblation?

2315
02:26:10,666 --> 02:26:14,333
This is their plan
to make me appear like a clown in public.

2316
02:26:16,291 --> 02:26:18,166
You can go for it
but don't drag me into it.

2317
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:22,500
I am warning you again. You can't stand
their nonsense for even ten minutes.

2318
02:26:23,291 --> 02:26:25,875
I am done with this discussion.
Forget Aaradhya.

2319
02:26:33,166 --> 02:26:35,500
Dad, aren't you and Mom
now married for 30 years?

2320
02:26:37,416 --> 02:26:38,333
Of course.

2321
02:26:38,791 --> 02:26:40,791
Mom never believed in your philosophies.

2322
02:26:42,625 --> 02:26:45,125
She still believes in God.

2323
02:26:46,958 --> 02:26:48,958
How did you stand her
for all these years?

2324
02:26:50,875 --> 02:26:52,250
Why didn't you desert mom?

2325
02:26:53,708 --> 02:26:54,916
She is my wife…

2326
02:26:57,125 --> 02:26:58,250
and I…

2327
02:27:00,833 --> 02:27:01,708
love her too much.

2328
02:27:05,375 --> 02:27:08,375
If your love for your wife
can stand for 30 years…

2329
02:27:10,666 --> 02:27:13,750
can't I stand my wife for three hours to
sit for the oblation and oblige her?

2330
02:27:15,791 --> 02:27:17,333
The oblation is in Pune tomorrow.

2331
02:27:18,083 --> 02:27:19,291
It starts with me,

2332
02:27:20,375 --> 02:27:22,083
but it will be completed
only with your presence.

2333
02:27:22,875 --> 02:27:23,750
I am leaving.

2334
02:27:46,833 --> 02:27:51,083
Wear this dhoti and circumambulate
101 times around the temple.

2335
02:27:51,166 --> 02:27:52,333
Then you must sit for the oblation.

2336
02:27:53,083 --> 02:27:54,291
Is your dad here?

2337
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,625
If this Satyam fellow doesn't turn up,
the whole ceremony will be a waste!

2338
02:27:57,708 --> 02:28:00,083
-Are we ready for the oblation, priest?
-Yes, we are ready.

2339
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,166
Dear, can you help me tie up?

2340
02:28:08,416 --> 02:28:11,208
You're such a grown-up!
Don't you know how to wear a dhoti?

2341
02:28:14,291 --> 02:28:15,208
Turn around.

2342
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,750
Hey, the boy is here.
Talk to him.

2343
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:41,500
Talk to him.

2344
02:28:53,333 --> 02:28:54,250
Aaradhya…

2345
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,916
I need to speak to you once.

2346
02:29:00,458 --> 02:29:01,333
Aaradhya.

2347
02:29:02,333 --> 02:29:03,208
Hey, Viplav.

2348
02:29:07,125 --> 02:29:08,291
Did she speak to you?

2349
02:29:09,208 --> 02:29:10,333
What's this attire?

2350
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:12,791
Can't you make out if the
damn thing is coming off?

2351
02:29:12,875 --> 02:29:14,666
Hey, we need a holy cow.

2352
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:15,583
What cow?

2353
02:29:15,750 --> 02:29:17,750
We need to gift one cow after the ritual.

2354
02:29:17,833 --> 02:29:18,750
Get one.

2355
02:29:19,125 --> 02:29:19,958
A cow?

2356
02:29:21,083 --> 02:29:22,750
-It's only been a minute since he set foot
-Mom, where's dad?

2357
02:29:22,833 --> 02:29:24,416
in a temple,
and my friend has already changed.

2358
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:26,708
You wished for too much
to expect your dad to turn up.

2359
02:29:28,125 --> 02:29:32,041
For him, it is principles
before anything else.

2360
02:29:33,083 --> 02:29:36,958
Let me sit on his behalf.
I will convince her dad.

2361
02:29:37,083 --> 02:29:38,166
Mom, he won't allow it.

2362
02:29:39,166 --> 02:29:40,791
The ritual will be completed
only if Dad comes.

2363
02:29:41,083 --> 02:29:42,041
But he won't!

2364
02:29:45,375 --> 02:29:50,250
He sees God and these
temples as mere stones.

2365
02:29:50,625 --> 02:29:53,500
But in reality,
he himself is made out of stone!

2366
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:56,750
How did you think

2367
02:29:56,833 --> 02:30:01,000
he would mend ways
and come for the oblation

2368
02:30:01,166 --> 02:30:03,875
only for his son? Is this possible?

2369
02:30:25,208 --> 02:30:28,333
But I will do anything for you, my son.

2370
02:30:29,291 --> 02:30:32,958
Even if it means,
falling at their feet. Yes.

2371
02:30:50,833 --> 02:30:51,750
Tell me…

2372
02:30:52,708 --> 02:30:54,041
what do I need to do, Son?

2373
02:30:55,500 --> 02:30:57,541
You don't worry…

2374
02:30:58,916 --> 02:31:01,708
Father-in-law, Lenin Satyam has arrived!

2375
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,833
Put kumkum on the forehead.

2376
02:31:32,208 --> 02:31:33,750
Put it on your forehead.

2377
02:31:33,833 --> 02:31:35,583
Pray to God.

2378
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:56,958
Sir, hold your nose with
your hands and say, "mama."

2379
02:31:57,541 --> 02:31:58,416
"Mama."

2380
02:31:58,708 --> 02:31:59,541
"Mama."

2381
02:32:08,375 --> 02:32:10,625
Pray to God to grant your wish.

2382
02:32:26,958 --> 02:32:28,000
Make a wish.

2383
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,791
Like this.

2384
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,541
Dear, can I bring water for you?

2385
02:32:37,708 --> 02:32:38,666
Dad, are you okay?

2386
02:32:39,833 --> 02:32:40,791
I am fine.

2387
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:55,416
If you place that in the sacred fire,

2388
02:32:55,541 --> 02:32:57,125
then the ritual will be done.
Get up.

2389
02:33:28,291 --> 02:33:29,541
Let's go.

2390
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:30,875
Bring your dad inside.

2391
02:33:31,041 --> 02:33:31,958
Fast.

2392
02:33:33,083 --> 02:33:35,041
Dear, come inside.

2393
02:33:35,125 --> 02:33:36,625
Viplav, bring your dad inside.

2394
02:33:42,833 --> 02:33:44,000
Ask him to come in.

2395
02:33:45,083 --> 02:33:45,958
Come inside.

2396
02:33:47,333 --> 02:33:49,666
Oh, God! Why did it have to rain?

2397
02:34:08,083 --> 02:34:09,000
It's okay.

2398
02:34:10,666 --> 02:34:13,750
I'll participate in the ritual
however long it takes.

2399
02:34:15,833 --> 02:34:19,166
I am fine if I lose,

2400
02:34:20,375 --> 02:34:21,541
and you win.

2401
02:34:24,833 --> 02:34:25,833
But my son…

2402
02:34:27,541 --> 02:34:29,083
is going to prosper.

2403
02:34:30,750 --> 02:34:32,166
That's enough for me.

2404
02:34:37,541 --> 02:34:38,458
Mr. Satyam…

2405
02:34:40,083 --> 02:34:43,833
when Viplav relented and
came home to commit to this ritual,

2406
02:34:44,875 --> 02:34:46,458
I didn't think I won.

2407
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:50,916
We saw the depth of love
your son had for my daughter.

2408
02:34:54,166 --> 02:34:57,458
Even today, when you stooped down to
perform this oblation for your son's sake,

2409
02:34:57,541 --> 02:34:59,125
I didn't see that as my victory.

2410
02:35:01,458 --> 02:35:03,875
I only saw your love for your son.

2411
02:35:06,541 --> 02:35:10,000
While fighting for my
shastras or your philosophy,

2412
02:35:11,125 --> 02:35:12,875
we are forgetting humanity.

2413
02:35:17,583 --> 02:35:19,083
I know that even if I seem like a winner

2414
02:35:19,166 --> 02:35:21,833
by making you bend your
way to sit through the ritual,

2415
02:35:22,625 --> 02:35:25,541
I have lost it as a human being.
What's the point?

2416
02:35:32,458 --> 02:35:34,958
Before I called it off,
God intervened and called it off.

2417
02:35:36,041 --> 02:35:38,333
He will take care of both the kids now.

2418
02:35:42,875 --> 02:35:45,041
You can leave with my
daughter after the rain stops.

2419
02:36:02,125 --> 02:36:04,416
Aaradhya, I will do any
number of rigorous rituals…

2420
02:36:06,125 --> 02:36:07,791
or do as many tests as you want.

2421
02:36:10,125 --> 02:36:11,500
But please stay with me.

2422
02:36:16,833 --> 02:36:20,083
If this oblation can settle our love,
I would have agreed to it long back.

2423
02:36:22,250 --> 02:36:25,416
I wanted both of us to overcome all
of this and prove that we are strong.

2424
02:36:28,708 --> 02:36:30,416
What does strong mean, Viplav?

2425
02:36:33,708 --> 02:36:37,000
Is it called being strong
to separate over a disagreement?

2426
02:36:39,375 --> 02:36:40,791
Will you fight the world alone?

2427
02:36:45,333 --> 02:36:48,250
I will ensure we will never
fight again, Aaradhya.

2428
02:36:49,666 --> 02:36:50,958
Fights will happen, Viplav.

2429
02:36:51,625 --> 02:36:52,750
Fights will happen.

2430
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:58,625
But if we stay united despite that,
we can say we are stronger.

2431
02:37:00,541 --> 02:37:03,708
Perhaps these arguments
may seem irritating to you,

2432
02:37:04,583 --> 02:37:05,875
but for me, I see it as love.

2433
02:37:08,708 --> 02:37:10,083
We are women, Viplav.

2434
02:37:12,458 --> 02:37:14,125
There are things we confess to God…

2435
02:37:14,958 --> 02:37:17,375
that we wouldn't dare share
even with our dad or husband.

2436
02:37:19,166 --> 02:37:20,708
And I left that…

2437
02:37:22,416 --> 02:37:24,708
God to be with you.

2438
02:37:28,708 --> 02:37:31,208
Where should I go if you ask me to leave?

2439
02:37:34,041 --> 02:37:35,333
I am still learning, Aaradhya.

2440
02:37:36,583 --> 02:37:37,708
I am still learning.

2441
02:37:39,541 --> 02:37:41,125
I can see the pain you went through.

2442
02:37:43,583 --> 02:37:47,458
And I can see the affection
behind your desire to do the ritual.

2443
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:54,916
But when I was alone for ten days…

2444
02:37:56,541 --> 02:37:59,125
It felt like
my life had become a living hell!

2445
02:38:03,208 --> 02:38:05,041
The way Thomas stood like a rock for Zoya…

2446
02:38:05,333 --> 02:38:06,291
That's true love.

2447
02:38:08,125 --> 02:38:09,583
I promise to stand by you too.

2448
02:38:10,541 --> 02:38:13,750
Each and every day,
for the rest of our lives!

2449
02:38:15,875 --> 02:38:18,208
Let's complete this ritual
and get back home, Aaradhya.

2450
02:38:19,208 --> 02:38:21,250
I don't want any more
of these rituals, Viplav.

2451
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:24,250
All I need is your love.

2452
02:38:25,041 --> 02:38:27,083
Whether we beget kids or not,

2453
02:38:28,083 --> 02:38:31,166
or whether we spend our
last days in an old-age home,

2454
02:38:31,333 --> 02:38:33,125
but we must be together.

2455
02:38:35,458 --> 02:38:36,416
Our kids?

2456
02:38:38,125 --> 02:38:39,583
Before they send us to an old-age home,

2457
02:38:40,875 --> 02:38:42,583
I will send them to a hostel.

2458
02:38:47,833 --> 02:38:52,000
Let us demonstrate to the world
that we are meant for each other.

2459
02:38:53,458 --> 02:38:54,541
Let's prove it.

2460
02:38:57,333 --> 02:38:58,291
Let's prove it.

2461
02:39:00,208 --> 02:39:01,125
Let's prove it.

2462
02:39:02,041 --> 02:39:02,958
Let's prove it.

2463
02:39:16,125 --> 02:39:17,250
Hello, grandfathers…

2464
02:39:17,375 --> 02:39:20,125
as I told you, Aaradhya and Viplav are
happily married, and have a baby girl now.

2465
02:39:20,208 --> 02:39:21,708
How do you both feel now?

2466
02:39:21,958 --> 02:39:24,041
Hello, what's the matter?

2467
02:39:24,166 --> 02:39:28,291
Why did you call me
when you wanted to talk to each other?

2468
02:39:28,458 --> 02:39:30,875
What's happening?
What's wrong with you?

2469
02:39:32,416 --> 02:39:34,875
You call the famous Brahma Tiwari
from Kanpur here

2470
02:39:34,958 --> 02:39:37,666
to get the baby girl's ears pierced
and then ignore him?

2471
02:39:37,750 --> 02:39:39,458
-Where is the baby? Call her.
-I will call her.

2472
02:39:39,791 --> 02:39:42,833
Aaradhya, get the baby.

2473
02:39:54,208 --> 02:39:57,708
Wait! Are you going to
pierce her ear with that?

2474
02:39:57,916 --> 02:40:00,208
You are scared as if I am holding a sword.

2475
02:40:00,375 --> 02:40:02,750
It will be over in no time.

2476
02:40:02,833 --> 02:40:04,541
It will prick like an ant bite, Viplav.

2477
02:40:04,625 --> 02:40:06,208
Just give her to your mom.

2478
02:40:09,875 --> 02:40:10,958
-Be careful!
-Be careful!

2479
02:40:14,708 --> 02:40:15,833
It's okay, dear.

2480
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:17,375
You'll be fine.

2481
02:40:18,458 --> 02:40:19,750
-Be careful!
-Be careful!

2482
02:40:22,625 --> 02:40:25,375
I understand that you
really care about the baby.

2483
02:40:25,625 --> 02:40:28,500
Do we stop taking a vaccine
just because it causes momentary pain?

2484
02:40:28,708 --> 02:40:30,958
Okay, I have an idea.

2485
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,666
-Be careful!
-I think I should just retire.

2486
02:40:38,791 --> 02:40:43,375
Sir, just be a bit careful.
With soft hands.

2487
02:40:43,583 --> 02:40:44,583
How? Show me.

2488
02:40:45,583 --> 02:40:47,333
Just be careful. Please.

2489
02:40:49,958 --> 02:40:51,125
Please be careful.

2490
02:40:52,083 --> 02:40:53,916
We are just asking you to be careful.

2491
02:40:54,375 --> 02:40:55,875
Why don't you come and do this yourself?

2492
02:40:56,750 --> 02:40:58,708
Everyone is instructing me.

2493
02:40:59,375 --> 02:41:01,625
Not now. We'll do it
after the girl grows up.

2494
02:41:01,708 --> 02:41:02,875
How will you get it done?

2495
02:41:03,500 --> 02:41:05,500
Will she listen to you after she grows up?

2496
02:41:06,416 --> 02:41:09,916
Better do it after she reaches her age.

2497
02:41:10,041 --> 02:41:11,875
You can call me then.
I will do the needful. Strange people.

2498
02:41:11,958 --> 02:41:14,041
-Oh, no. Guruji, please don't go.
-What is this nonsense?

2499
02:41:14,125 --> 02:41:15,041
Sit down.

2500
02:41:15,291 --> 02:41:17,875
-Viplav, just get it done!
-No, Mom.

2501
02:41:18,208 --> 02:41:20,458
-Why?
-Just look at me.

2502
02:41:20,666 --> 02:41:21,875
-Yes.
-Look into my eyes.

2503
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,375
-Come here, dear.
-Look here. It's fine.

2504
02:41:23,458 --> 02:41:25,625
-Please carry on, Guruji.
-Don't look there.

2505
02:41:25,833 --> 02:41:27,333
Dear God, let it happen this time.

2506
02:41:28,416 --> 02:41:30,375
Do not worry. Stay calm.

2507
02:41:30,541 --> 02:41:31,458
Look at me.

2508
02:41:33,791 --> 02:41:35,000
It's over.

2509
02:41:35,708 --> 02:41:37,375
Look at how cute she is.

2510
02:41:38,625 --> 02:41:41,583
All that drama
just to get an ear pierced!

2511
02:41:41,875 --> 02:41:44,458
I got tired of hearing "Be careful."

2512
02:41:44,625 --> 02:41:45,916
By the way, what did you name her?
