Just get me home.

3
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,517
Just get me home.

4
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,886
I'll do the rest.

Yes, hello, this is David Linn

11
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:22,410
<i>from The New York Times.</i>

12
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:24,145
May I speak with Susan, please?

13
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:25,813
Thank you.

14
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:31,786
Hi, Susan, it's David again.

15
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,206
I was just calling
to see if we can set...

16
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:36,874
Well, yes, well, I figured

17
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:39,493
we have to do
the interview by phone

18
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:41,662
since they've already
left New York.

19
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,264
But what we'd really love to get

20
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:45,183
is a photo of
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

21
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,552
to go along with the article.

22
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:50,805
When... when are they
scheduled to get home?

23
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:56,110
Oh, so they'll be home tonight.

24
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:57,845
Gotcha.

25
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:59,447
Now, the address I have on them

26
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,399
is Upper Canyon Road.

27
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,067
Is that still...

28
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:04,986
No, it isn't.
They've... Oh.

29
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,205
Let me get a pen.

30
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,040
Where do they...

31
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:12,493
Tesuque, I see.

32
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:14,295
And the address?

33
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,499
Is that... is that
up near the opera house?

34
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,869
I hear that's nice.

35
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:24,255
Well, I'll be in contact
with my photographer

36
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:26,707
to check on his schedule.

37
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,643
No, no, it's...
it's their call.

38
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:32,563
I know how busy
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

39
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:33,931
Thank you.

40
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:37,568
This should make
one hell of a story.

41
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:39,604
Goodbye.

42
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm just saying

43
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,572
it's apples and oranges.

44
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,259
Listen, I maintain,

45
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,795
if... if...
if I want pizza,

46
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:06,013
- I go to a pizza place.
- Yeah.

47
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:09,250
If I want Thai, I go...
I go to a Thai place.

48
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,886
I mean, what is the...
what is the earthly point...

49
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,887
Did I marry you?

50
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,222
...in comparing pizza
to Thai food?

51
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:15,807
What has happened
to your intelligence?

52
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,608
- This is different.
- They're completely...

53
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:20,645
Oh, come on,
are you the man I married?

54
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:23,264
I am the guy who
wants to end this

55
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:24,765
ridiculous conversation,

56
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:25,933
kick off my shoes,

57
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,069
and have a very large
glass of wine.

58
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,371
Well, I'm gonna tell you

59
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:34,275
to be my guest.

60
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:35,409
All right, wait.

61
00:07:35,443 --> 00:07:38,129
The answer is...

62
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,664
21.

63
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:41,249
- No.
- Yes.

64
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:43,951
Yes, because it has history.

65
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,619
Come on.

66
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,088
Prohibition.

67
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:48,789
<i>The sweet smell of success.</i>

68
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:50,474
And per se has Thomas Keller.

69
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,293
Game, set, and match.

70
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,345
The whole vibe is so Yountville.

71
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,636
You transplant it to Manhattan,

72
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,398
- it starts to feel...
- You could transplant it

73
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,317
to Islamabad,
I would still eat there.

74
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,801
Ooh, there's a good thought.

75
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,654
- What, Islamabad?
- No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

76
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,907
Oh, my God,
all this talk of food.

77
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,409
Do you think Juana
left us anything?

78
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:09,827
No, I don't think so,

79
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,979
she thought that we were
coming back on Wednesday.

80
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:13,247
Unless you told her otherwise.

81
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:14,582
No, I haven't talked to her.

82
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:16,701
Oh, look, here.

83
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:19,086
Just a pear, that'll be perfect.

84
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:22,039
- Yeah.
- You wanna get us a nice bottle of wine?

85
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,708
Mm-hmm.

86
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,042
Do you think
we have any of those...

87
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:27,678
what are those crackers with the,

88
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:29,881
like, the sun-dried
tomato and then

89
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,382
they were kind of
slightly peppery,

90
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,934
but not too peppery.

91
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,001
We don't have them?

92
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,809
I don't know.
Ask Juana.

93
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,396
We haven't had them in forever.

94
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,344
I don't know why she
doesn't get those anymore.

95
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,430
Why don't you talk to her?

96
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,855
I don't know, she's got that thing
going on with her daughter.

97
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:45,956
Anyway, Napa?

98
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,181
Yeah?

99
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:48,679
How long is it since
we've been there?

100
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:49,700
Two years, Thanksgiving.

101
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:51,869
- Jesus, that's two years.
- Yeah.

102
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,121
- Too long, right?
- Is this okay?

103
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:55,823
Oh, that looks perfecto.

104
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:57,909
You wanna get the fireplace?

105
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:01,362
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,214
- Is it ripe?
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:05,466
Yeah.

108
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,752
You know, we could
invite George and Delores,

109
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,220
they could come up from Marin.

110
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:11,555
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

111
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,376
We could have a little
spa action, right?

112
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:17,878
And then we could do some
sort of wine, and then...

113
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,397
Aah!

114
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,523
Hello, Gretchen.

115
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:31,525
Elliott.

116
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,896
I really like your new house.

117
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,667
Walt.

118
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:43,570
This...

119
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,930
Are we looking east?

120
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,215
Oh.

121
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,268
My God, you must
have one great view

122
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:59,353
of the Sangre De Cristos.

123
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:00,421
Walt,

124
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,440
what... what are
you doing here?

125
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:07,928
<i>I saw you on Charlie Rose.</i>

126
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:11,282
You looked great.

127
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:12,450
You both did.

128
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:15,403
If you are here to...

129
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:16,954
to hurt us...

130
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:18,990
Walt, whatever

131
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,958
it is you're planning...

132
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,044
Actually, I'm here
to give you something.

133
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,249
It's out in my car.

134
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:30,617
How about the three of us
take a walk to it?

135
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,619
It's just parked down the road.

136
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,222
I couldn't get it past your gate.

137
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:44,965
Elliott,

138
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,984
if we're gonna go that way,

139
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,653
you'll need a bigger knife.

140
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:00,994
Keep stacking.

141
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,347
It'll all fit.

142
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,637
That's all right.

143
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:14,240
Just... just
throw it on top.

144
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,644
Gretchen, would you mind?

145
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:21,331
We don't want to lose
any under the furniture.

146
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:27,003
All right.

147
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:31,457
That is $9,720,000.

148
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,876
Where did it come from?

149
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:35,929
And why is it here?

150
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,297
I earned it,

151
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,011
and you're going to
give it to my children.

152
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:40,466
What? Why?

153
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,655
Walt, I don't think we...

154
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:43,603
On my son's 18th birthday,

155
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:44,888
which is ten months

156
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,173
and two days from today,

157
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,342
you will give him this money

158
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,528
in the form
of an irrevocable trust.

159
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,696
You will tell him that it is his

160
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:56,682
to do with as he sees fit,

161
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,401
but with the hope

162
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,788
that he uses it for
his college education.

163
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,623
And for the betterment
of his family.

164
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,859
Walt, I'm not sure
that we follow.

165
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:09,712
Why, uh, I mean,

166
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,581
why, in particular, would we...

167
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,383
If you wanna give
your kids drug money,

168
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,751
go do it yourself.

169
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,469
I can't.

170
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,922
My wife and son hate me.

171
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,641
They won't take my money.

172
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,343
Even if they did,

173
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,728
the federal government
wouldn't let them.

174
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,899
But two rich benefactors,

175
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:32,569
who are known for their
charitable endeavors,

176
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:34,387
who would think nothing
of, for instance,

177
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,689
writing a $28 million check

178
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,610
to help victims of
methamphetamine abuse?

179
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:43,029
I have to think that your money

180
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,247
would be very welcome.

181
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,565
It wouldn't make
any sense coming from us.

182
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,234
It certainly would.

183
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:50,403
My children are blameless victims

184
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:53,089
of their monstrous father.

185
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,625
A man who you
once knew quite well.

186
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,082
Call it a beau geste,

187
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,434
call it liberal guilt,

188
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:05,802
call it whatever you want,

189
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,754
but do it.

190
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,890
And you are not to spend

191
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:14,527
a single dime of your own money.

192
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,129
If there are taxes

193
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,798
or lawyers' fees owed,

194
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,566
you will take it right from here.

195
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,486
They use my money, never yours.

196
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,104
Okay, Walt, sure.

197
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:27,373
That...
that sounds reasonable.

198
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:32,495
So what happens next?

199
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,831
I guess we shake on it,

200
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,883
and I leave.

201
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:08,998
I can trust you to do this.

202
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,500
Yes.

203
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:13,536
Absolutely you can.

204
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,218
Oh!

205
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,887
Don't move.
Don't...

206
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,355
Don't dare move a muscle.

207
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:33,523
You don't want them to think

208
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:35,308
that you're trying to get away.

209
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,726
Just breathe.

210
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,513
Just this afternoon,

211
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,648
I had an extra $200,000

212
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,033
that I would have loved dearly

213
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:47,403
to leave on top of this table.

214
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,205
Instead,

215
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,074
I gave it to the two best

216
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,494
hitmen west of the Mississippi.

217
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,862
Now,

218
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,085
whatever happens to me tomorrow,

219
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:04,220
they'll still be out there.

220
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:09,041
Keeping tabs.

221
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,426
And if,

222
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,595
for any reason,

223
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:16,715
that my children
do not get this money,

224
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,935
a kind of...

225
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,220
countdown will begin.

226
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,556
Maybe a day or so later,

227
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,024
maybe a week, a year,

228
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,076
when you're going for
a walk in Santa Fe

229
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,062
or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,

230
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,081
and you're...

231
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:35,118
talking about
your stock prices...

232
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:41,674
without a worry in the world.

233
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,293
And then suddenly,

234
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,179
you'll hear the scrape

235
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,630
of a footstep behind you,

236
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,715
but before you can
even turn around,

237
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,750
- pop!
- Aah!

238
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,608
Darkness.

239
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,283
Cheer up, beautiful people.

240
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,321
This is where
you get to make it right.

241
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,488
Oh, yeah, right.

242
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,764
You know, I don't exactly

243
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,933
know how to feel about all this.

244
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,434
For real, yo.

245
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,104
Whole thing felt kinda shady,
you know, like,

246
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,305
morality-wise?

247
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,340
Totally.

248
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:26,679
How do you feel now?

249
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:27,846
Better.

250
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:30,683
Yeah, definitely improving.

251
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,235
What's this I hear about

252
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:35,872
blue meth still being out there?

253
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:36,873
What do you mean?

254
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,708
Have you heard anything?

255
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,743
Is it still being sold?

256
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,248
Yeah.

257
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:51,637
By whom?

258
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,807
It's you, right?

259
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,759
I mean, aren't you still cooking?

260
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,480
Damn, man.

261
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,182
We were sure it was you,

262
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,850
because that shit is choice, yo.

263
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,235
Better than ever.

264
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,604
I mean, um, you know.

265
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,108
Jesse.

266
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,225
Seriously?

267
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,944
You said he moved to Alaska.

268
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,062
That's what I heard.

269
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,197
Right on, Jesse.

270
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,232
Passing the torch.

271
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,480
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

272
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,008
Wow, what happened there?

273
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,626
It's my birthday.

274
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,095
Yeah? Well,
happy birthday.

275
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,628
<i>It's easy money.</i>

276
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,146
<i>Until we catch you.</i>

277
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,264
Walt, just say the word

278
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,966
and I'll take you
on a ride-along.

279
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:09,151
You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

280
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,071
Get a little excitement
in your life.

281
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,440
Someday.

282
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:42,501
Welcome to The Grove.

283
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,603
Would you like to see a menu?

284
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:44,687
No, thank you.

285
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,522
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

286
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,340
All right, you got it.

287
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,958
Hey, how you doing?

288
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,877
Good.

289
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,162
How's things?

290
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,197
Hey, I like your...

291
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,868
shirt.

292
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:16,886
My blouse?

293
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,871
Nice, yeah, the color.

294
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:22,058
That's a nice color on you.

295
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,426
It's kind of a...

296
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,038
I don't know exactly
what you'd call it.

297
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:28,731
It's kind of a cornflower.

298
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,066
Before you say or do anything,

299
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,935
just hear me out.

300
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,053
Todd...

301
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:35,387
Nobody knows that I'm here.

302
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:37,356
Just listen for two minutes

303
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,908
and then I'll leave.

304
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,276
Please.

305
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:41,661
Please.

306
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,062
Just two minutes of your time.

307
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,082
That's all I ask.

308
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,367
Please.

309
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:57,176
You're running out
of methylamine, aren't you?

310
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,712
I can do the math.

311
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,047
You've been at it long enough.

312
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:04,016
You must be running low.

313
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,219
I have a new method

314
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,138
that requires no methylamine.

315
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,389
And it's easy, and it will

316
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,590
keep you in business.

317
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,093
And Todd, I could
teach it to you.

318
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:17,279
How did you know to find us here?

319
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,282
10:00 AM
every Tuesday morning,

320
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,234
you and I met here.

321
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,103
You're rather...

322
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,871
schedule-oriented,
I guess.

323
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,454
Sorry.

324
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:51,263
I need the money.

325
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,183
I've spent almost all of mine.

326
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,736
Already, just trying to stay

327
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,155
one step ahead of the police.

328
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:02,158
Mr. White, I don't
think there's...

329
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:06,829
How much would it cost us?

330
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,614
Nothing short of a million,

331
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,166
and believe me, for this,

332
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,036
that is...
is giving it away.

333
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,487
I think Jack should hear this.

334
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,373
Yeah, I don't know.

335
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:19,825
Now listen, I can...

336
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:21,794
I can come up there tonight

337
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,796
and talk to him.

338
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,664
He'd get it.

339
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:29,218
This is a win-win
situation.

340
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,970
Hi, what can I get for you two?

341
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:32,471
He's just leaving.

342
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,024
Good seeing you again.
Take care.

343
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,512
For you?

344
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm good.

345
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,200
And I need more stevia.

346
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,244
Okay, no disrespect to the man,

347
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:56,879
but doing business with him?

348
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,247
Right now, that's not...

349
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:01,083
Of course, we're not
doing business with him.

350
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,369
Todd, please.

351
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:06,538
Don't make me
walk you through this.

352
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:13,479
Jesus.
Did you look at him?

353
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:18,267
You'd be doing him a favor.

354
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:07,003
<i>Hello,
please record after the tone.</i>

355
00:27:08,288 --> 00:27:10,406
<i>Truce, all right?</i>

356
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:12,074
<i>Skyler, I have news about Walt,</i>

357
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:13,575
<i>and you need
to hear it immediately,</i>

358
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:16,879
<i>so if you're there, pick up.</i>

359
00:27:16,913 --> 00:27:19,415
<i>Skyler...</i>

360
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:22,218
Hey.

361
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:24,020
What's up?

362
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:26,272
<i>Walt's in town.</i>

363
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,440
Yeah?

364
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:29,225
That car they thought he stole

365
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,393
in New Hampshire,

366
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:31,977
they found it in
a Denny's parking lot

367
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:33,595
right on Central.

368
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,448
<i>And your old
next-door neighbor,</i>

369
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:37,242
<i>the one on the right,
what's her name, Becky?</i>

370
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,452
Becky's on the left.
Carol's on the right.

371
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:41,070
<i>Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>

372
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:43,605
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>

373
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:45,875
Just this morning, plain as day.

374
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,943
He's there, walking
out of your house,

375
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:50,629
and he calls her by name.

376
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:53,132
He didn't hurt her, did he?
He didn't...

377
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,451
No, he's just like,
"Hey, Becky!"

378
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:58,137
Or Carol, whatever.

379
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,923
<i>She said he looked
exactly like the Unabomber,</i>

380
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:02,591
<i>but she's positive it was him.</i>

381
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,677
Skyler, we're getting
calls from all over town.

382
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:06,262
He's here, he's there,

383
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:07,813
he's going to blow up city hall.

384
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,482
Apparently he has
some sort of manifesto.

385
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:10,983
He wants to be on
the six o'clock news.

386
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:13,352
<i>- It's just...
- Who's making these calls, him?</i>

387
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:14,904
<i>There are two or three
different voices.</i>

388
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:16,472
<i>They're not sure
if they're crank calls</i>

389
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,324
<i>or people he's put up to it</i>

390
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,776
<i>or if they're actual
anonymous tips.</i>

391
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,944
<i>And it's stretching them thin,</i>

392
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:23,479
<i>which is maybe the point.</i>

393
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:25,281
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
and I've told them this,</i>

394
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:26,949
there are three places
that he would go.

395
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:29,318
To you, to me, or Flynn.

396
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,320
<i>Right.</i>

397
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:32,988
They're watching the high school.

398
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:36,509
They're probably
watching your place, too.

399
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:38,844
I mean,

400
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,547
I know that's what Hank would do.

401
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,549
There's no way
Walt's getting to you.

402
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,385
They are absolutely
going to catch him.

403
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:47,686
No doubt about it.

404
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,138
That arrogant asshole thinks

405
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,672
he's some criminal mastermind,

406
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,224
but he's not.

407
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:54,176
<i>But on the off-chance...</i>

408
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:56,195
Yeah.

409
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:59,648
On the million-to-one
chance...

410
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:03,068
you be on the lookout, okay?

411
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,158
Thanks.

412
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:14,363
You got it.

413
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:34,450
Five minutes.

414
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,542
Five minutes.

415
00:29:48,832 --> 00:29:50,549
You didn't kill anybody

416
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:54,136
sneaking in here, did you?

417
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,421
You didn't hurt anybody?

418
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:57,556
No.

419
00:29:57,591 --> 00:30:00,092
Didn't have to.

420
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:14,357
You look terrible.

421
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:17,493
Yeah.

422
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:20,613
But I feel good.

423
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:23,666
So talk.

424
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:26,752
Why are you here?

425
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:40,516
It's over.

426
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,854
And I needed a proper goodbye.

427
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,889
Not our last phone call.

428
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:51,277
So you're going to the police?

429
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:55,564
They'll be coming to me.

430
00:30:55,598 --> 00:31:00,069
If you're in custody,

431
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:01,787
what stops those people
from coming back,

432
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:03,605
those people you worked with?

433
00:31:03,623 --> 00:31:08,627
When... when I still
had the house,

434
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:09,795
three men came

435
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,130
in the middle of the night,

436
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:14,216
wearing masks, threatening
Holly and Flynn and me.

437
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,135
They told me not to talk about

438
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:17,490
that woman I saw at the car wash,

439
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,338
and if you're in custody
and they find out...

440
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:20,622
They're not coming back.

441
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,309
Not after tonight.

442
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:25,311
What's tonight?

443
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:35,604
We don't want your money, Walt.

444
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:37,990
I thought Flynn made that clear.

445
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:40,242
He did.

446
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:43,479
And I don't have any to give you.

447
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:48,084
I spent the last
of it getting here.

448
00:31:48,118 --> 00:31:51,487
All I have to give you

449
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:53,506
is this.

450
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:06,802
Call the DEA once I leave.

451
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,521
Tell them I was here.

452
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:11,273
That I forced my way in.

453
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:15,677
Tell them...

454
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:17,530
Tell them I wanted bacon and eggs

455
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:20,733
on my birthday,

456
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:24,286
and that I gave you that ticket.

457
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:28,374
Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

458
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:30,409
For what?

459
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:36,332
A burial site.

460
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,368
That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

461
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:46,542
That's where I buried our money.

462
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,311
The men who stole it from us,

463
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:52,264
the men who still have it,

464
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:54,733
they murdered Hank and Steve

465
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,269
and put them in that hole.

466
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:01,490
Now you trade that

467
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:04,059
for a deal with the prosecutor.

468
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:06,946
You get yourself out of this.

469
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,998
Skyler.

470
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:13,335
Skyler.

471
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:19,925
All the things that I did,

472
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,076
you need to understand...

473
00:33:21,094 --> 00:33:23,846
If I have to hear

474
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,515
one more time

475
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,350
that you did this

476
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:29,518
for the family...

477
00:33:29,553 --> 00:33:31,554
I did it for me.

478
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:43,098
I liked it.

479
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:45,451
I was good at it.

480
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,989
And...

481
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,541
I was...

482
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:55,277
really...

483
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,383
I was alive.

484
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,208
Flynn will be home soon.

485
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:46,845
Before I go...

486
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,350
may I see her?

487
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:33,630
Whoo.

488
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,734
Damn man, this thing's a classic.

489
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,135
What block you got in it?

490
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:42,156
500 or the 425?

491
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:46,910
Couldn't tell you.

492
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:55,619
500.

493
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:58,088
That's the one you want.

494
00:37:58,122 --> 00:38:01,341
No replacement for displacement.

495
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:13,169
Where to?

496
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:15,205
To the clubhouse.

497
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,322
Just go ahead, just park it

498
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:34,357
right in front over here.

499
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,911
No, no, no,
just straight in, man,

500
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:40,964
just, what are...

501
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,001
All right, fine, here, whatever.

502
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:57,848
Hey, how you doing?

503
00:38:57,882 --> 00:39:00,884
Turn around, put your
arms out like this.

504
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:22,923
While you're at it,

505
00:39:22,957 --> 00:39:24,591
why don't you lift your shirt up?

506
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:27,261
Give us a spin.

507
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:29,579
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

508
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:46,613
Okay?

509
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:49,099
My wallet and keys?

510
00:39:49,117 --> 00:39:50,233
Yeah, you'll get them back.

511
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:51,768
Just relax.

512
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:05,382
Stay here.

513
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:09,002
Keep your eyes open.

514
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:11,287
Jesus, look at you
with that head of hair.

515
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:12,889
Is that real?

516
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:14,558
Yes.

517
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,726
That's not a wig?

518
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,927
Seriously?

519
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:18,261
No.

520
00:40:18,295 --> 00:40:21,231
What were you doing before,
shaving it?

521
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:22,316
Yes.

522
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,103
Christ, that is one
fine head of hair.

523
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:27,938
I mean, otherwise you
look like shit, but...

524
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:30,490
Hello to you too, Jack.

525
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,743
Can we talk business?

526
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,612
I don't think so, no.

527
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:37,581
Did Todd tell you
what I'm offering?

528
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:39,149
Yeah, he told me.

529
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,951
Thing is, we're...

530
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,703
not really in the market.

531
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:46,373
You're running low
on methylamine,

532
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:47,507
what happens then?

533
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:50,627
No, we'll get more.

534
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,181
That Quayle woman's
got her own set-up.

535
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:53,997
The heat's off her.

536
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:55,832
She can break loose a barrel
every now and again.

537
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,601
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

538
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:00,387
Todd, please, would you
explain things to your uncle?

539
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:03,056
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

540
00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:07,811
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

541
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:11,565
I'm sorry.

542
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:15,535
Wait. Jack.

543
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,686
Where do you want it?

544
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,188
Well, gee, I don't know,

545
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:19,289
anywhere but my living room?

546
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:20,356
Take him out back.

547
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,958
- Jack, you owe me.
- Hey, come on.

548
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:23,577
- You owe me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

549
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:25,361
I owe you, what for?

550
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,913
Jesse Pinkman, you promised that

551
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:28,882
you would kill him,
and you didn't.

552
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:31,168
Instead, you partnered with him.

553
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:32,368
You're his partner now...

554
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:34,554
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

555
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,680
Partners,
what are you talking about?

556
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:45,381
He's alive, isn't he?

557
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,717
He's cooking for you.

558
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:50,487
What, are you gonna lie?

559
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:51,688
Him being alive is not

560
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,407
him and me being partners.

561
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:55,409
Not by a damn sight.

562
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:57,694
What, you think
I'd partner with a rat?

563
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:59,696
Where's that little
piece of shit?

564
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,364
He's finishing up a batch.

565
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:03,083
Well, go get him.
Bring him here.

566
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,870
- Uncle Jack...
- No. No, no, no.

567
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,872
This one here calling me a liar?

568
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:11,925
He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

569
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,261
Jesus. Hustle it up.
Come on.

570
00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:17,214
Let's get this over with.

571
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:21,134
I'm gonna show you
just how wrong you are,

572
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:24,888
then I'm putting that bullet
in your head myself.

573
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,746
You see what I'm talking about,
you son of a bitch?

574
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:29,619
Now, this look like
a partner to you?

575
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:32,589
Come here.
Take a look.

576
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,624
Come here!

577
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:47,187
Take a look at him.

578
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:49,723
Have a gander.

579
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:51,775
This is my partner.

580
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:55,195
Right, partner?
Right, buddy?

581
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,349
Hardworking, good partner.
50-50 partner.

582
00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:05,705
Can you hurry this shit up?
Make it quick?

583
00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:16,249
Toddy, get him off, would ya?

584
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,034
Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

585
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:24,474
Aah!

586
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:36,112
Uncle Jack...

587
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,482
Jesus.

588
00:45:57,818 --> 00:45:59,319
Mr. White...

589
00:45:59,353 --> 00:46:00,937
Aah!

590
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,540
Wait.

591
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:12,058
Wait.

592
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:22,602
You want your money, right?

593
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,720
Huh?

594
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:26,740
You wanna know where it is?

595
00:47:28,442 --> 00:47:30,744
You pull that trigger,
you'll never...

596
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:22,078
Do it.

597
00:48:30,787 --> 00:48:32,788
You want this.

598
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:36,059
Say the words.

599
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:40,346
Say you want this!

600
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:45,401
Nothing happens
until I hear you say it.

601
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:49,805
I want this.

602
00:49:12,513 --> 00:49:14,514
Then do it yourself.

603
00:49:44,879 --> 00:49:47,881
Pick up the phone.

604
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:53,136
<i>Hello?</i>

605
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,054
Is it done?

606
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,090
Is he gone?

607
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:59,592
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>

608
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:01,561
<i>He's gone.</i>

609
00:50:01,595 --> 00:50:03,513
<i>They're all gone.</i>

610
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:06,516
Todd?
Who is this?

611
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:09,819
It's Walt.

612
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:11,821
How are you feeling?

613
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:15,057
Kind of under the weather?

614
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:17,911
Like you've got the flu?

615
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:19,913
That would be the ricin
I gave you.

616
00:50:19,947 --> 00:50:22,999
<i>I slipped it into
that stevia crap</i>

617
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:26,035
<i>that you're always putting
in your tea.</i>

618
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:28,070
Oh, my God.

619
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,959
Well...

620
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:37,096
goodbye, Lydia.

621
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:38,474
