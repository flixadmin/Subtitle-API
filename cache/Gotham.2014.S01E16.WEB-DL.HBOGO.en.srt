1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,280
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,440
- I start a new job in the morning.
- A new job? Congratulations.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm coming to work at the G.C.P.D.
I'm your new medical examiner.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,680
I have questions I need to ask
members of the board.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,560
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,320
It seems likely those
gangsters were given their shares

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,640
in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,680
This nightclub makes a lot of money.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,240
That's why I wanna reopen
it under your care.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,920
- I can have the club?
- You're with me now.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,760
What is this place? Where are we?

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,360
Some people think it's a prison.
Some think it's hell.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,880
They took my eyes.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,760
- People call him Mace.
- And he's the one in charge.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,520
My name is Fish Mooney.
I'm in charge now.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,600
What's she doing?

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Jim.

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Hi.

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Where's Jim?

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,000
He dropped off his keys,
like, last week.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,880
So, screw him anyway, right?

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,440
So, who are you guys?

23
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,240
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

24
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,960
<i>The Flying Graysons.
Show them your appreciation.</i>

25
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,320
- Thank you from the Flying Graysons.
<i>- Thank you. Thank you.</i>

26
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
What are you doing?

27
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,880
Coming through.

28
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
Get back in there.

29
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,680
Calm down. Stop that!

30
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
Come on!

31
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
Stop it. Calm down.

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
- Ladies come on.
- I hate you!

33
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,840
G.C.P.D.

34
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,800
Everybody freeze.

35
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
Get off, you old bag.

36
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Beautiful.

37
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,240
- Why did you attack Mr. Grayson?
- No reason.

38
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
I don't like him.

39
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,280
I have no idea why he did it.

40
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000
Beats me.

41
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,080
{\an5}You circus people
don't mess around, do you?

42
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,360
{\an5}John Grayson, you give me that look
one more time, I will slap you silly.

43
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,360
- You wish.
- Don't think I can't.

44
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,680
{\an5}Well, kids. What's the big
problem, anyhow?

45
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,240
The Graysons are
arrogant buttheads is the problem.

46
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,600
{\an5}The Lloyds are feckless drunkards
is more like it.

47
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,880
So it's a family feud.

48
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,400
{\an5}Graysons don't get along with the
Lloyds. And that way for years.

49
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,480
- It's sort of a tradition.
- You fight like this every night?

50
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
{\an5}No. That was just her idiot
uncle doing his thing.

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,280
You know, damn well,
it must be Lila's fault.

52
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
- Mary.
- What?

53
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,120
{\an5}Hey.

54
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,560
{\an5}- Sorry, the date went South.
- Are you kidding?

55
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,680
{\an5}Best date ever. Who
gets to see a circus brawl?

56
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,080
{\an5}True. None of them will
talk, of course.

57
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,440
{\an5}I still have no idea
what those two were fighting over.

58
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
I think they're rival lovers.

59
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,200
{\an5}Their families have been fighting
since way back.

60
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,600
{\an5}But this particular fight was
apparently over a woman named Lila.

61
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,000
{\an5}She's a snake dancer in the sideshow.

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,160
{\an5}I know. How cool is that?
A snake dancer.

63
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,480
{\an5}- No, I mean you're really good.
- People talk to doctors.

64
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,440
{\an5}I guess so. I should find this
woman, Lila. Make sure she's okay.

65
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,480
{\an5}Might take a little while.
I'll have a patrolman drive you home.

66
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,520
{\an5}- I could come with you.
- Lee, this is police business.

67
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,600
{\an5}Come on, Jim. I'm dying to meet Lila.

68
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
Well, bringing
along medical personnel is a

69
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,280
- justifiable precaution, I guess.
- There you go.

70
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
{\an5}Sir.

71
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,800
{\an5}- Where's Lila?
- Lila?

72
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,120
Snake dancer.

73
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,120
{\an5}G.C.P.D. We need to speak with Lila.

74
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
{\an5}She's not here.

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,120
{\an5}- Why? What's happened?
- Where is she?

76
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,560
I don't know.

77
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,400
- She was supposed to home ages ago.
- You a relative?

78
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
{\an5}- I'm her son, Jerome.
- Jerome, when did you last see her?

79
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,240
{\an5}This morning. She was here
when I left for the library.

80
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,240
{\an5}Relax, Jerome. This gentleman is
just here because Owen

81
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,840
{\an5}and Al had a disagreement.

82
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,880
Your mother's fine. Gone on a spree,
no doubt. You know how she is.

83
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,880
{\an5}A spree? Without her hat?
Her coat? Her purse?

84
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,120
Look at Sheba.

85
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,600
She's distraught.
She knows something's wrong.

86
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,280
- The snake does seem to be agitated.
- Sir...

87
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,160
She's what you call a party girl.

88
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,200
{\an5}Back in the morning with her knickers
in a handbag. Sure as eggs.

89
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
{\an5}But she didn't take her handbag,
did she?

90
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,320
How fast does an
animal like that move?

91
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,640
Fast walking pace.
They rely on surprise, mainly.

92
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
{\an5}Let her out.

93
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,160
{\an5}- I'm sorry?
- Let her out.

94
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,560
Oh, my God.

95
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,960
You knew.

96
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,960
- You knew she was here.
- No.

97
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,240
Look at me.

98
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,480
She was like that when we found her.

99
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
Let's talk straight.

100
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,960
Those people out there are using us
as transplant donors.

101
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,440
We are simply spare parts.

102
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,320
Unless...

103
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,680
Unless we do something about it.

104
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,800
How?

105
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,160
I have a plan. But you
must do exactly what I say.

106
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,800
You do as I say and I promise you
I will get us out of here alive.

107
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,800
That's right. No,
you heard me correctly.

108
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,440
I said some of us.

109
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,880
Because the truth of the matter is
some will die.

110
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,920
But we will die with dignity.

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
We will die for a reason.
And we will die next to family.

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,640
And I tell you what
we are family. We are all we got.

113
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,240
That's family.

114
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,920
We have one simple choice.

115
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
We die here alone on our knees...

116
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,560
Or we stand up
and we fight with our family.

117
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,160
Yeah.

118
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,240
A couple of riggers
found her right here.

119
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
We decided to hide her on the truck.

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,720
We were going to give her
a proper burial

121
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
as soon as we got back on the road.

122
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,480
Decent of you. Who's "we"?
Who else knew?

123
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,640
Just me and the head of the families.

124
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,320
If an outsider killed her, what
can you do? An act of God?

125
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,560
If it was one of us,
we always find out.

126
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,320
And we make sure they're punished.

127
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,640
- How?
- We have our ways.

128
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,880
And we have ours. Hook him up.

129
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Morning, partner.

130
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,440
- Gonna need a little help here.
- No kidding.

131
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,480
I mean, you're kidding, right?
This isn't an elaborate prank or?

132
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
Tell me about your mother, Jerome.

133
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,560
She's my mother.

134
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,400
What can I say? I love her.

135
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,560
She's perfect.

136
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,440
Not a very good cook.
Except for that.

137
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,160
Did she have any enemies?
Someone with a grudge?

138
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
No.

139
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,080
- Boyfriends?
- No.

140
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,280
No?

141
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,360
She had lovers. Sex partners, really.
But not boyfriends.

142
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,800
- She didn't want the commitment.
- Alphonse Grayson?

143
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,600
- Yes, he was one of them.
- Owen Lloyd?

144
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
Yes.

145
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,200
- Any others?
- Not that I could put a name to.

146
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,920
How did you feel
about your mother's love life?

147
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,640
I feel fine about it.

148
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,680
If not for my mother's love life,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

149
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,400
Sex is a healthy, human activity.

150
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
Yes, it is.

151
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,160
Do you have any other family?

152
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
The circus is my family.

153
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,560
One more time.
Why did you assault Mr. Grayson?

154
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,160
- You know why.
- Tell me.

155
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,680
- He killed Lila.
- Why would he do that?

156
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,960
She was gonna choose me over him.
And he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

157
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,320
Not gonna let a Lloyd humiliate
a Grayson that way.

158
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,800
How come your families
don't get along?

159
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,000
His great grandfather falsely accused

160
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,760
my mother's Uncle Barry of
stealing a horse.

161
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,800
- When was this?
- Before the Great War.

162
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,360
- World War I?
- Yeah.

163
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
For three generations,

164
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,960
your families have
been feuding over a stolen horse?

165
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,840
Yes. And the Lloyds are still trash.
Blood is blood.

166
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
Must be a hell of a horse.

167
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,800
Why did Mr. Lloyd assault you?

168
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,040
He killed Lila and fears
I'm gonna kill him for it.

169
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,080
He says the opposite.
He says you killed her.

170
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,120
Yes, I supposed he would have
to say that, wouldn't he?

171
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,400
It wasn't Uncle Owen. He could
never do such a terrible thing.

172
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,000
Holy crap, Mary.
How can you be so blind?

173
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,640
- Quiet, you.
- Yeah, quiet, you.

174
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,760
You're the blind one.

175
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,480
My brother's a man of honor.
Your uncle's a violent drunk.

176
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
- Do the math little girl.
- My uncle is an artist.

177
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,040
Your brother is
a conceited muscle-head like

178
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,200
the rest of you flying douche bags.

179
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,000
I can't believe I ever
thought I loved you.

180
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Enough.

181
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,840
- They're coming. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,400
- I said are you ready?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,360
MA57A, raise your hand.

184
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Five-seven-A...

185
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,800
Raise your hand.

186
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,080
Step forward.

187
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,080
One moment please, sir.

188
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
We need to talk.

189
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,760
Back up, inmate. You're in violation.

190
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,800
- 50-seven-A, step forward.
- Excuse me. One moment, please.

191
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm the new "shot-caller" here.
My name is Fish Mooney.

192
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,280
And with all due respect,
for you and I

193
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,680
to have a good working relationship,

194
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
there are some
things that need to change.

195
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,320
- Is that right?
- What's your name?

196
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,200
None of your damn business
what my name is.

197
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,680
Right. Okay.
Well, I know you have a job to do.

198
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,000
And I am more than willing to give
you 57-A in exchange for...

199
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,280
60 crates of water, 30 blankets,
50 pounds of fresh fruit

200
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,880
and a few magazines.

201
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,600
What if I refuse? What will you do?

202
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,760
Well, I'd be willing to give
you 57-A, just not alive.

203
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,920
- We need them alive.
- Exactly.

204
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm gonna count to three.

205
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,480
You'll disappear or
get a severe beating.

206
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,440
- I'm gonna take that as a no.
- One...

207
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,720
It's simple economics.
Our lives are worth something.

208
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,000
- 60 crates of water, 30 blankets.
- You...

209
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,640
You're coming with me.

210
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,800
The manager is gonna be
very unhappy with you.

211
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,520
I would think this manager wouldn't
be too happy with you either.

212
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,520
So if he wants to talk to me,
I'll be right here.

213
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,200
The manager doesn't come down here.

214
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,960
Well, looks like we have a stand-off.

215
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,640
I tell you what.

216
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,520
I can be flexible.
So, I'll go talk to this manager...

217
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,920
But while I'm gone, you're going to
stay right here as our guest.

218
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,240
How's that sound?

219
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,920
We'll be back.

220
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

221
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,440
Yeah.

222
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,000
Wait. Back up a little.

223
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,080
- So, you set the snake loose?
- Yes, ma'am.

224
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
- To track down the body?
- Yes, ma'am.

225
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,360
Snakes have an excellent
sense of smell.

226
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,800
Well, now I know.

227
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,960
And your prime suspects are a clown
and an acrobat?

228
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
- Yeah.
- Ain't this one a doozy?

229
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,720
Your victim, Lila Valeska, was
killed by a large knife or hatchet.

230
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,360
Multiple blows to the
head and upper torso.

231
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,120
Around 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

232
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,040
From 2:30 to 4:15, both Grayson and
Lloyd were in ring for the matinee.

233
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,280
Well, how precise is that
time of death?

234
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,680
Give or take 45 minutes.

235
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,120
Still possible then,
but cutting it close.

236
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,800
Hold and press your guys,
but keep looking.

237
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,120
Yeah, boss. Forensics is working
the crime scene.

238
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
We're going
through her phone records.

239
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
All right.

240
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,640
We're gonna send
the rest of you home now.

241
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,000
But the investigation is ongoing.
Nobody leaves town.

242
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,720
And listen up.

243
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
No more fighting.

244
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,040
Look where your friends are.

245
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,160
What good is this feud doing you?

246
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,400
I like it when you act all tough.

247
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,840
"Nobody leave town."

248
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,680
Sounds better when you say it.

249
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,840
I feel like we should
finish up our date.

250
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,680
Do you wanna come over tonight?
I can cook you dinner.

251
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,400
- Sure, that sounds good.
- Good.

252
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
- Get some rest.
- I will try. See you later.

253
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,080
I have to ask.

254
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,760
If you were to guess,
who do you think killed Lila?

255
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,320
I try not to guess. I work the
suspects and I wait on forensics.

256
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
Excuse me.

257
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,800
Am I speaking to
Detective James Gordon?

258
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes.

259
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,160
Then this must be Dr. Thompkins,
the medical examiner.

260
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm sorry, how did you
know who we were?

261
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,360
My name is Paul Cicero.
I'm a psychic with the sideshow.

262
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,880
Lila Valeska was
an old friend of mine.

263
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,800
A psychic. I see.
How can I help you, Mr. Cicero?

264
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,840
I sense that you don't think
Owen or Alphonse are guilty.

265
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,600
You must be psychic.

266
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,520
In which case, perhaps you'd
like to hear the message

267
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,720
Lila sent me from the other side.

268
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,600
Thanks, Mr. Cicero. We're not quite
looking at the other side just yet.

269
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,320
As you wish. I'm merely a messenger.

270
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
What's the message?

271
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,040
Thank you, doctor.

272
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,640
Lila told me that
the servant of the devil...

273
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,960
Lies in the garden of
the iron sisters.

274
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,200
The iron sisters?
What does that mean?

275
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,640
- I don't know.
- We'll get right on it.

276
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,760
I don't think sarcasm is your métier,
James.

277
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,040
Make of the message what you will.
Good day to you both.

278
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,600
That wasn't very open-minded of you.

279
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, come on, Lee. He's a fraud.

280
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,560
He's gonna go to the press
and say he's consulting on the case.

281
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,920
- He's looking for publicity.
- Maybe.

282
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,280
If you were gonna send a message
from beyond the grave...

283
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,760
Don't you think priority number one
would be killer's name, not a riddle?

284
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,280
Who knows how it works?

285
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,360
All right. I'm not
gonna argue with you.

286
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Good.

287
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,680
Later then.

288
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Later.

289
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,480
They called to confirm.

290
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,360
You're meeting with the board
of Wayne Enterprises tomorrow.

291
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,520
Excellent.

292
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,000
I was afraid they'd postpone again.

293
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,960
Well, I'll say it one more time.
I think that...

294
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,000
It's an incredibly bad idea,
Master Bruce.

295
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,960
I think it's reckless.
I think it's premature.

296
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,720
Quite frankly,
I think it's bloody dangerous.

297
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,840
We've already been over this
a hundred times, Alfred.

298
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,800
My mind is made up.

299
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,000
Can you pass me that file over there?

300
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,320
File.

301
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,560
Well...

302
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,120
I've said my peace.

303
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,480
If we're both found dead in a ditch,
don't blame me.

304
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,680
- No.
- No?

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,480
Jim loves me in this color.

306
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,120
It's too obvious. You gotta
dress like you're not trying.

307
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,360
Like you're on your way
to go meet some other guy.

308
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
To go...

309
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,800
Sailing, or whatever.

310
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,000
Really? Sailing?

311
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,560
All righty.

312
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Oh, my God.

313
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,280
- You like?
- Oh, my God.

314
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,720
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

315
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,960
No, it's good. It's my sister's
recipe. She's really brilliant cook.

316
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,120
I was thinking of my sister
and it came to me.

317
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,240
I think I know what the blind-man's
message means.

318
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,280
"The servant of the devil lies
in the garden of the iron sisters."

319
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,720
It's Arkham Bridge.
The iron sisters. Arkham Bridge.

320
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,160
The towers are called Mary and Betty.

321
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,320
I remember as a kid
we used to call them that.

322
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,520
Right. And there's park under
the towers on the Gotham side.

323
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,360
A garden? It all fits.

324
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,840
Lee, it fits an impossible story.

325
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
He didn't speak with Lila Valeska.

326
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,960
- She's dead.
- So you say.

327
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,240
- You're a doctor. A scientist.
- There are things in the world...

328
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,720
That can't be explained by science.

329
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,240
People who enjoy folk dancing,
for instance.

330
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,280
- Doesn't mean ghosts exists.
- You're arrogant your certainty.

331
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,520
What if this is a clue to a murder?
The poor woman.

332
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,440
Fine. I'll go myself.

333
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,920
- Thank you.
- Sure.

334
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
I'll come with you.

335
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,000
We'll go together.
First thing in the morning.

336
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,120
The morning?

337
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,760
Now? You wanna go now?

338
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,840
- It's only a half a mile away.
- It's dark.

339
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,440
I have a flashlight.

340
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,080
So, what are we looking
for exactly, do you think?

341
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,440
I know. I know. This is probably
a complete waste of time.

342
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,440
- Thank you for doing this.
- Not a problem.

343
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,400
But let's not make a habit out of it,
okay? This is no place for a lady.

344
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,040
- What do you mean?
- You're a hypocrite.

345
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,240
You say you want a strong woman
share this crazy life you've chosen.

346
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,560
But when push comes to shove,

347
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,560
you want me to stay
home and bake cookies.

348
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,400
Not cookies, necessarily.

349
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,200
Pie. Any kind of pie.

350
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,520
So if someone were to throw
something from a car on the bridge,

351
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,720
this is where it would land.

352
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
Yeah, I guess you're right.

353
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,720
Lee.

354
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,360
<i>T-H-F-C.</i>

355
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,880
- What does that mean?
- The Hellfire Club.

356
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,640
It's a Satanist cult that committed
a string of ritual murders.

357
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,520
They haven't been active
for a decade or more.

358
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,800
I guess they're back.

359
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,280
No.

360
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,480
No, I don't think so.

361
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,440
Hey, sarge. I'm gonna
need a couple mobile

362
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,600
units to pick some people
up, but listen.

363
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,840
They need careful handling.

364
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,440
- Sir, they're in three and four.
- Thanks, Zeke.

365
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,880
- Neither knows the other one's here?
- Right, like you said.

366
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,560
Good work.

367
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,520
Just bear in mind that you could be
wrong about

368
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,320
Bear it in mind, I will.
But I'm not wrong.

369
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,720
- So go on home now, lady.
- Hey.

370
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,440
We were having a
perfectly lovely evening.

371
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,000
I am not the one that wanted to go
out searching for Satanist hatchets.

372
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,360
You know what I wanted to do.

373
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
- You're right.
- I'm sorry, what?

374
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,920
I tend to get overly
enthusiastic about things.

375
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
It's an issue for me. My
mom always said.

376
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,760
Who gives a crap what
my mom said, right?

377
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,840
Have a good night, Jim.
Let me know how it all turns out.

378
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,040
Goodnight, Lee.

379
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,560
Wait.

380
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,000
What you said earlier about
hypocrisy, sharing lives...

381
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
You're right. Let's go.

382
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm what?

383
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,040
You're right.

384
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,040
Good evening, Mr. Cicero. Sorry
to bring you down here so late.

385
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,200
Good evening, Detective Gordon.

386
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,160
Dr. Thompkins.

387
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,120
- How did you?
- He smells your perfume.

388
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,080
We solved the message Lila sent you.

389
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,440
Took us to Arkham Bridge Park.
We found a hatchet there.

390
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,600
With Satanist symbols
scratched into it.

391
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,720
Dear lord.

392
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,880
Know what that hatchet
means, Mr. Cicero?

393
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,120
Tell me.

394
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
It means you're an
accessory to murder.

395
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,520
Such drama. I merely
passed along a message.

396
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,960
A message from the
dead. Didn't happen.

397
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,720
Which means you invented the message.

398
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,120
Which means you had someone
plant the hatchet for us to find.

399
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,000
You wanted us to think Satanists were
responsible for Lila's death.

400
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
You're protecting somebody.

401
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,200
Lila spoke to me. That's all.

402
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,920
No. The hatchet is a clumsy ploy.

403
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,800
You wouldn't try it
unless you were desperate.

404
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,120
Which suggests
you're protecting someone close.

405
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Someone you love.

406
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,840
This fantasia was conjured
in your blinkered mind.

407
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,480
If you could only see what I see.

408
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,520
Hi, Jerome. Please, take a seat.

409
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
You know Mr. Cicero from the show.

410
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Yes, sir.

411
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,200
- Hello, Mr. Cicero.
- Good evening, Jerome.

412
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,920
Do you know why you're here?

413
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
Did you find out who
killed my mother?

414
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,080
You killed your mother, Jerome.

415
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Me?

416
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,160
You killed her up on that hill and

417
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,040
Mr. Cicero let you
clean up in his trailer.

418
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,440
He told you to scratch
the Satanist stuff on

419
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,560
the hatchet and throw it
off the bridge.

420
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,400
Sir, that's absurd and.
And offensive.

421
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,520
But it's the truth.

422
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,080
What I don't know is why this man
risked so much to help you.

423
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,480
I think he's your father.

424
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,840
You don't know what you're talking
about. My father was a sea captain.

425
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,720
Am I wrong, Mr. Cicero?

426
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,160
- Yes.
- He was a sea captain.

427
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,360
His name was Sven Karlsen.
He died at sea.

428
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,560
What was the name of his ship?

429
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,680
He worked on a
lot of different ships.

430
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,360
The one he went down in.

431
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
She never said.

432
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,560
We can do a blood test to
prove I'm right.

433
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
Takes only half an hour
to get a result.

434
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,400
- Isn't that right, Dr. Thompkins?
- Yes.

435
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,680
Save yourself a needle.

436
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,120
I do hate needles.

437
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm sorry, Jerome.

438
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,240
What are you talking about?

439
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,040
He's right.

440
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,600
I am your father.

441
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,360
No, you're not.
Why would you say that?

442
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,960
You must have suspected the truth.

443
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,280
You're not my father.
My mother would never.

444
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,400
Your mother was a cruel woman.

445
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,800
She was often unkind to me,
but she did once love me in her way.

446
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,400
And she loved you very much.

447
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,160
That's why she gave
you a better father.

448
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,840
My mother was a cold-hearted whore
who never loved anyone.

449
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,520
And she'd never touch
a pathetic old creep like you.

450
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,800
All these years,
do you think I was kind

451
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,520
to you because I'm such a good man?

452
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,560
If I wasn't your father, would I help
you as I have after what you did?

453
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
My father.

454
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,720
I'll be damned.

455
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,560
Oh, that's very funny.

456
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,760
Looks like the bitch got me
with a zinger in the end.

457
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,960
Why did you kill your mother, Jerome?

458
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
Oh, you know how mothers are.

459
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,800
She just kept pushing.

460
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,640
And I'm like, "Fine, Mom. Be a whore.

461
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,120
Be a drunken whore even.

462
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,120
But don't be a nagging,
drunken whore." You know?

463
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,800
"Don't come yell at me
to do the dishes...

464
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,960
If you've been banging a clown
in the next room."

465
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,720
You know?

466
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Long night?

467
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,280
Things got kind of ugly.

468
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,560
- Yes, it did.
- You okay?

469
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,160
I'm good.

470
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,520
Truly.

471
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,760
It was ugly, but it was
also kind of thrilling.

472
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,080
- Thrilling?
- Thrilling and scary.

473
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,960
Like looking down a deep dark tunnel.

474
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,680
Thanks for letting me be there.

475
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,760
You are an unusual woman.

476
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,760
You just don't know many women.

477
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,080
Can we go home now?

478
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,640
Hello, Penguin.

479
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,240
Victor.

480
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,440
How nice.

481
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,400
Don Falcone thinks you're messing up.

482
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,880
You don't know how to run a club.

483
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,360
Your numbers stink.

484
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,680
- With all due respect...
- I didn't come here to talk.

485
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,080
Good manners cost nothing, you know?

486
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,200
Relax.

487
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,120
He's harmless.

488
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,000
- Say hi, Butch.
- Hi.

489
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,640
Falcone didn't
wanna throw him away...

490
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,520
So I worked on him in my basement
for a couple of weeks.

491
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,440
He's a whole new man. Right, Butch?

492
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,960
Yes, sir, Mr. Zsasz.

493
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,400
Butch knows the club
scene up and down.

494
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,640
He'll help you out.

495
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,680
But he's...

496
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,480
He's Butch Gilzean.
He's loyal to Fish Mooney.

497
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,800
And he'll do exactly what you say.

498
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,360
- Really?
- Really.

499
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
Hey, Butch...

500
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,440
Dance for me.

501
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,800
I do good work.

502
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,760
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Bruce.

503
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,880
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.
So happy to see you.

504
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,520
Thank you for meeting with me.

505
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,320
I have some questions regarding
Wayne Enterprises' business affairs.

506
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,680
Of course.
It's your company after all.

507
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,200
Fire away, young man.

508
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,800
I have two main areas of concern.

509
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Underworld involvement
in the Arkham project...

510
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,360
And chemical weapons manufacture
at our Wellzyn affiliate.

511
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,680
That's great. Congratulations.

512
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,800
We wanted to thank you.

513
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,920
If you hadn't figured out
who killed Lila

514
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,800
and talked sense to
us the way you did

515
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,520
our families never
would have reconciled

516
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,120
and we could
have never gotten together.

517
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,560
Just doing my job.

518
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,480
Hey, if we have a son,
we'll name him Gordon.

519
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,800
Well, we'll discuss that.
But we're certainly very grateful.

520
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Sure.

521
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,360
- Why so happy?
- Happy customers.

522
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,640
That's not it. It's something else.

523
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,800
You got laid, didn't you?

524
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,200
That's impressive.

525
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,560
You slept somewhere without razors

526
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,320
and you smell like lady
soap. Easy catch.

527
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,680
I can only conclude
that high-level individuals

528
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,800
or groups within Wayne Enterprises

529
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,800
have colluded in corruption, bribery,

530
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,440
racketeering, and unethical
medical research.

531
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
Thank you for that input, Bruce.

532
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm so sorry if you've
been alarmed or upset...

533
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,280
By these shocking stories
and rumors you've been exposed to.

534
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,840
These are much more than rumors.

535
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,120
We'll look into them thoroughly
and carefully, of course.

536
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,480
Bruce, let's be fair.

537
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,800
You've told us nothing with any
substantive proof behind it.

538
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,400
- I haven't told you all I know.
- No?

539
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,440
What else is there?

540
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,160
I hope you do look closely into these
issues, because I'll be raising them

541
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,000
at the next shareholders meeting
with possible legal action.

542
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,000
Dear me. Legal action?

543
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,040
These are all very deep waters
for such a young man.

544
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,080
My youth is not relevant.

545
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,840
Except that if I were a man...

546
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,080
I would be chairing this board.

547
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,680
And I would be sure that
Wayne Enterprises was run honestly.

548
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,440
Thank you for your time.

549
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,320
The manager says you have a deal.

550
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,360
You go up and see him. I stay here.

551
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,480
- What's your name?
- Schmidt.

552
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,920
Your first name.

553
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,600
- Thomas.
- Thomas.

554
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,280
Welcome.

555
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,120
Why don't you take
off that heavy gear...

556
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,520
And relax?

557
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
My family's gonna
show you a good time.
