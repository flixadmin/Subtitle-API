1
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:22,398
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,525
Who's been naughty?

3
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,819
It is dead centre on your brand.

4
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:28,529
- Let's get a picture.
- I love pictures.

5
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:29,989
Hey.

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,992
Smile.

7
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:35,870
Another one.

8
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,638
Oi, gorgeous.

9
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,932
- Vodka soda, hold the soda.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,100
Drinks are free,
but the food's bloody awful.

11
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,894
Ahi tartare, for fuck's sakes.

12
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,397
Okay. Just let me shake a few more hands,
and then we'll be out of here... Whoa.

13
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,442
Easy, tiger. I want you on your A game.

14
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,236
A game?

15
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,820
You know, I like the sound of that.

16
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,949
Merry Christmas.

18
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,285
Becca.

19
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,830
New senior director, digital marketing.

20
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,833
- Yeah. How did you know?
- I have my sources.

21
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,628
And your nametag.

22
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,589
Yes, that, too.

23
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:30,800
- This is my husband, Billy.
- Great to meet you.

24
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,843
Billy Butcher.

25
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,763
Becca, you handled my takeover, right?

26
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,181
Yes, I did.

27
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,933
- You saw it?
- I loved it.

28
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,269
- Wow, thank you.
- No, thank you.

29
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,896
- What'd you take over?
- Vought's Twitter account.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,565
- Yeah.
- Your brilliant wife here did all the work.

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,235
She posted my photos,
she wrote my messages.

32
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,361
It was exceptional.

33
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,740
All right, so they thought it was you up there,
but it was really Becca.

34
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,242
Bit deceptive, isn't it?

35
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,578
No, Billy, that's what we do
because Homelander's busy saving lives.

36
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,081
It's okay, it's okay. It... You're right.

37
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,291
It's a little dishonest,

38
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:07,962
but I'm all thumbs when it comes to that kind of stuff,
so leave it to the experts.

39
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,423
Listen, I would love to talk to you

40
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,092
about maybe quarterbacking
the rest of my social media.

41
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,136
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

42
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,804
My dad, he always said,

43
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,516
"Surround yourself with people smarter than you."

44
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,312
Oh, my better half

45
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,856
is wanting my attention,
but maybe we could chat tomorrow.

46
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,817
- That sounds wonderful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,152
Great to meet you, pal.

48
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,362
Good to meet you.

49
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,197
Love that accent.

50
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,327
- Hello, beautiful.
- Ready to go?

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,078
How the fuck does he walk around

52
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,205
in that sweaty fucking wetsuit all day long,

53
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,583
balls mashed up against his leg like pancakes?

54
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,126
- What?
- You promised to behave.

55
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,420
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah?

56
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,963
Yeah.

57
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,809
Hi.

58
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:17,091
I didn't realise you were
such a cigar aficionado.

59
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,510
I really, I just...

60
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,722
I can't get enough of huge gross logs

61
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,516
of filterless tobacco.

62
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,947
This is all really nice.

63
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,368
But...

64
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,621
There is a "but" coming.

65
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,915
Okay.

66
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:54,253
But why did you bring me to a hotel?

67
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,088
And not your place?

68
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:59,341
Well, you know. I mean, yeah, sure,

69
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:03,179
my Dad could make you
some post-coital pizza rolls.

70
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:07,766
I just figured this would be
slightly less humiliating.

71
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,351
Yeah, all right.

72
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,855
Yeah.

73
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,816
Yeah, very convincing.

74
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,943
You okay? What's going on?

75
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,946
It's just...

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,118
I've never seen your place, or your job.

77
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,746
You're kind of a mystery to me.

78
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,624
That's hot, right?

79
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,585
Look, you got to understand that my dad

80
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:39,632
was nothing but corny jokes and expensive gifts,

81
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:44,094
until he was gone,
and all the money along with him.

82
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,015
I know that that's not you, but...

83
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:54,563
I need to know that the hotel is a nice thing

84
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,107
and not a red-flag thing.

85
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,197
I quit my job.

86
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,368
I'm sorry, I...

87
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,370
I really should've told you.

88
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,669
After Robin,
programming other people's remotes,

89
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,338
it felt kind of pointless.

90
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,885
And yeah, I mean, you can meet my dad,

91
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,012
but you're gonna regret asking that.

92
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,852
So everything's okay?

93
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,942
It's great.

94
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,321
No red flags.

95
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,184
Now, I know this is not
as swanky as New York City,

96
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,729
but to have a hero like you
in a place like Sandusky, I mean,

97
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,815
everyone down at the local branch
is just tickled pink.

98
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,610
- Yeah.
- Now, we got Cedar Point,

99
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,572
biggest roller-coaster park
in the whole U.S. of A.

100
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,909
We're just a couple short hours
from Cleveland or Toledo.

101
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,329
And Lake Erie? Right here,

102
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,373
- if you want to swim.
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,793
There it is.

104
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,503
- What's this?
- That's your per diem.

105
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,421
You get $75 a day.

106
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,799
Grocery store, right down the street.

107
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,009
To make my own food?

108
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,552
There's a Dairy Queen, too.

109
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,720
Like Blizzards and stuff?

110
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:33,138
You betcha.

111
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,682
Well...

112
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,309
I mean, what about my crime itinerary?

113
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:40,729
I think the best thing's just to get out there
and put some points on the board.

114
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,523
Not much crime in Sandusky.

115
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,734
I mean, we're not a shithole like Akron.

116
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,530
But if something comes up, we'll call.

117
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:51,240
You'll call?

118
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,575
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

119
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,528
- Oh, this is killing me.
- Come on.

120
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,783
Damn.

121
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,243
Oh, no fucking way.

122
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:40,414
You need 3,000 calories an hour,
or you're gonna pass out.

123
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,708
I can't do this shit, man.

124
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,419
Tough shit.

125
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,920
You heard the doc.

126
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,882
Your heart is getting bigger,
balls are getting smaller,

127
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,383
your bone density's for shit.

128
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,218
That Compound V shit is killing you.

129
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,220
Hey. Don't even say it out loud, all right?

130
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:58,557
- You don't know shit about it.
- I don't want to know.

131
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,435
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

132
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,604
Did you see my last time out there?

133
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,356
Sioux City's got a fucking faster runner than me.

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,901
Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

135
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,986
Okay? None of that shit. We train.

136
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,070
Back to the basics.

137
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:15,824
Nobody gets it back at my age.

138
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:20,287
I'm gonna be a freak show like Ben Johnson
racing against horses.

139
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,540
At least you'll still be breathing.

140
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,129
Shit.

141
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:32,382
- I got to go.
- Where?

142
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,977
- What's going on?
- I missed you guys.

143
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,855
Just wanted to see your smiling faces.

144
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,566
Take a seat, buddy.

145
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,324
And, truth be known,
I felt like we were overdue

146
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,618
a little heart-to-heart.

147
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,664
A rap session, maybe a little tough love.

148
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,041
What's that supposed to mean?

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,045
It means that lately,

150
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,508
some of you have been a little out of sorts.

151
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,303
Erratic.

152
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,013
Unreliable.

153
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,100
Downright sloppy.

154
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,812
Not you, Noir. You've been great.

155
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,939
But the rest of you...

156
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:34,945
It is fair to say that I am disappointed.

157
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,032
Got to keep your eye on the ball, guys.

158
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,326
The enemies are storming the gates.

159
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,622
I mean, we're not even the Seven anymore,
we're down to five.

160
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,457
We're dropping like fucking flies,

161
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,837
but at least now I know why.

162
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,218
Why...?

163
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,014
Is this a joke?
Why is Hughie up there?

164
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,765
I don't understand. Who is this guy?

165
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,101
This guy is Hugh Campbell.

166
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,438
He and Starlight are going steady.

167
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,692
He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

168
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,402
Wait, what?

169
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:20,908
As well as blackmailing
Mesmer, Ezekiel, Popclaw

170
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,701
- and God knows who else.
- Popclaw?

171
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,038
No. No, no, no.
You... That is insane.

172
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,958
Starlight, sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

173
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,127
- but words...
- No, sir.

174
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,298
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

175
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,884
It's just, he's not...

176
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,427
I mean, why would he do that?

177
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,138
Good question. A-Train, over to you.

178
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,141
- What?
- Oh, boy.

179
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,227
That little egg of yours is still scrambled, huh?

180
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:52,898
How about now?

181
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,860
Oh, shit.

182
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,320
I know this guy.

183
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,698
You did smash through his girlfriend,
so I should hope so.

184
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:05,035
Robin something or other.

185
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,831
I remember now, I've seen him
outside of Popclaw's place.

186
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,000
He was all in my face.

187
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,088
- You're fucking this guy?
- Okay, slow down.

188
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,632
I don't know what's going on,

189
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,885
but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

190
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,554
Well, that is true, actually. That's very true.

191
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:29,059
He is just a man and, by the looks of it,
not much of one.

192
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,520
But... But hear me out.

193
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,605
What if he was helped?

194
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,859
Say someone,

195
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,486
I don't know,

196
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,571
got him in to see Ezekiel

197
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,116
and got rid of the Deep.

198
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,702
No. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

199
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,913
Keep those hands down by your sides, missy.

200
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,544
Sit down.

201
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,929
Now... I know

202
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,557
that you want to make this whole Deep thing

203
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,267
an "All the single ladies" moment.

204
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,352
Power, right?

205
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:18,191
But really, what you've done is pulled off
every criminal's wet dream.

206
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,903
I mean, the Seven is down by two.

207
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,698
I just can't help noticing that it all started

208
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,617
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

209
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,745
which one of us is next?

210
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,039
You bitch.

211
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,208
- I didn't do anything.
- Enough!

212
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,753
We're a different fucking breed.

213
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,421
We shine with the golden light

214
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:43,258
of providence, but you,
you've been helping these

215
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,927
fucking mud people

216
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,929
- to go against us.
- No.

217
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,183
Shut your fucking mouth, young lady.

218
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,395
If you were in my position...

219
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,400
what would you do to you?

220
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,862
Homelander, that's enough.

221
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,156
You got something to add, Maeve?

222
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,035
She didn't know.

223
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,080
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

224
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,290
and her heart's beating like a little rabbit.

225
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,293
The only thing she's guilty of
is being fucking stupid.

226
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,546
She obviously fell for this Hugh Campbell guy

227
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,673
and he's pumping her for information,

228
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,218
so back off, leave her alone.

229
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,478
Starlight,

230
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,855
you must be something special.

231
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,152
I can't remember the last time
Maeve gave a shit...

232
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,779
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

233
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,614
really.

234
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,210
And if I say no?

235
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,296
Come on.

236
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,758
I got this.

237
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,636
It's you and me,

238
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,304
remember?

239
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,063
Don't say I never do anything for you.

240
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,443
All right.

241
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:29,197
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

242
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,742
I just hope you're right about her,
for both your sakes.

243
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,371
Class dismissed.

244
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,343
Look at this.

245
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,470
Oh, no. You don't stir,

246
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,015
you fold. Like this.

247
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,186
Now, that's what makes them spongy.

248
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,479
Here you go.

249
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,406
She wants to know where you were.

250
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,617
That's a compelling fucking question.

251
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,080
- Hey, can we talk?
- That's what we're doing, isn't it?

252
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,874
No, I mean...

253
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,127
There ain't no secrets here, son. Spit it out.

254
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,504
Stop being an asshole, just talk to the guy.

255
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,424
Hughie doesn't mind. Do you, Hughie?

256
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,765
Okay, fine. I don't think I can do this anymore.

257
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,894
- Do what?
- This.

258
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,813
I mean, Vought, whatever with Kimiko,

259
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,649
it's awful, and you got to stop it,

260
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,360
- but I can't.
- Right.

261
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:52,822
You just want to kick back, drink a few Mai Tais,
and let us do all the work, is that it?

262
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,784
I managed to go my whole life
without seeing someone die horribly,

263
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,370
and now I'm up to about a half dozen,
so I think I'm good.

264
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,373
Please. You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

265
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,500
just like the rest of us.

266
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,628
Now, why don't you stop pissing around

267
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,339
and tell everybody what this is really all about?

268
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,925
- Yeah?
- Fine.

269
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,594
- Annie. Okay?
- Fuck.

270
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,554
It's about Annie.

271
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,435
Fucking finally.

272
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,772
He's been sneaking off to give her one
at Lincoln Grand.

273
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,149
- You've been following me?
- Like you gave me a choice.

274
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,694
She doesn't know anything.
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

275
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,070
- We'll just...
- Just what?

276
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,155
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

277
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,367
- Maybe pump out a few flying babies?
- No. I... I don't know.

278
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,536
No, you don't know because you ain't thinking,

279
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,081
- except with your dick.
- You're wrong about her.

280
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,542
That bitch is fucking playing you,

281
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,419
and you're too fucking blind to see it.

282
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,505
So better to be loyal to a dead woman
who doesn't know and doesn't care?

283
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,799
How's that working out for you?

284
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,738
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Hughie.

285
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,281
Long time no talk.

286
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,742
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

287
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,661
- Who's this?
- I thought you would recognise my voice.

288
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,873
You spend so much time obsessing
about me, am I right?

289
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,751
- Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
- Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

290
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,128
Why is he here? He says you're
in some kind of trouble.

291
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,297
Dad, are you okay?

292
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,506
Oh, okay.

293
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,093
He's fine.
Remington Steele's almost on.

294
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,470
A-Train, listen to me.

295
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,931
Oh, shit, if he's burned, then I'm fucked.

296
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,060
He's on fucking Medicaid.
He's harmless. Let him go.

297
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,772
- My place is burned. They've got me.
- Oh, my God.

298
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,024
Get your ass over here in 20 minutes,

299
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,318
or I'm gonna burst through him
like a fucking piñata,

300
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,653
do you understand me?
Just like I did your girlfriend.

301
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,988
- Yeah. Got it.
- And, Hughie,

302
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:01,951
alone. If I catch a whiff,
a whiff of one of your little asshole friends...

303
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,370
I got it.

304
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,623
All my bank accounts are frozen and flagged.

305
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,501
Monique, listen, when you get this,

306
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,087
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

307
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,757
- Well, I hope she was fucking worth it.
- It's not Annie. She doesn't know.

308
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,134
- I'm gonna fucking do her in.
- The hell you will!

309
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,846
Hey, hold on. She doesn't know. It wasn't her.
She's never seen me before.

310
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,974
Not once, not ever.
So how did I get burned?

311
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:32,649
Mesmer. You fucking idiots had to go to Mesmer.

312
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,567
Fuck me.

313
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,614
Thank you.

314
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,409
That was not smart, to sleep with her.

315
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,462
- Hughie.
- Dad.

316
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,299
He's acting strange.

317
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,301
You know, real jumpy.

318
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,387
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he...

319
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,139
Right here, sport.

320
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,976
Look what I got.

321
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,939
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

322
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,941
What, they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

323
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,444
Watch out, A-Train's coming.

324
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,904
You were a fan!

325
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,615
You were a fan, and not, like, a dabbler, no,

326
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,826
you were Super Fan 99.

327
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,329
- Excuse me, sir. What is this about?
- Shut the fuck up.

328
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,748
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

329
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,958
I came alone.

330
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,878
You let him go.

331
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,922
Alone, huh?

332
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,593
You really did come alone.

333
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,262
Next time... There's not gonna be a next time,
but next time,

334
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:48,183
have at least a few cards up your sleeve.

335
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,478
Okay. You mean... You mean, like this?

336
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,817
- Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
- What is that?

337
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,778
- I don't know what that shit is.
- Oh, you don't?

338
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,531
So you don't mind if I do this.

339
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:04,657
- No, fuck!
- What?

340
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,076
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I have a bigger dose.

341
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,246
I have a real dose hidden somewhere outside.
Let him go, I hand it over,

342
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,707
then you can do whatever you want with me.

343
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,418
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

344
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,171
as long as you take it, you'll be the fastest?

345
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,431
If you try anything,

346
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,100
I can catch up to dear old Daddy in a millisecond.

347
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,977
- Dad, time to go.
- Not without you.

348
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,022
- I'll be right behind you.
- I am not leaving you with him, all right.

349
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,858
- You're just a kid. You're my kid.
- Dad.

350
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:44,113
I'll be all right. I got this.

351
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,409
Go.

352
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,001
All right, where is it?

353
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:01,714
You know, this shit must be pretty good

354
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,800
if it's worth running through
a human being for.

355
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,052
Oh, my God, man, that was an accident.

356
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,138
- Where the fuck is the V?
- That accident had a name.

357
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,099
And what about Popclaw?

358
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,101
She had a name, too.

359
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,769
Charlotte!

360
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,774
The only good thing
in my life is gone now.

361
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,610
What is this, man?
I kill your girlfriend and you kill mine?

362
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,947
- I didn't kill your girlfriend.
- You used her.

363
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,907
You put her in danger,

364
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,743
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

365
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,497
How does this not all start with you, Hughie?

366
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,875
The only difference between you and me
is that I made a mistake.

367
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:41,421
The shit that you did was on purpose.

368
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,006
So who's worse?

369
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,260
You bitch!

370
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,638
You know, you're right.
It would've been stupid to come alone.

371
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,980
Monique, it's not safe here anymore.
We got to go.

372
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:04,319
You swore to me and to Jesus Christ
that you were done with Billy Butcher.

373
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,112
I get it. Everything Butcher touches

374
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,281
- turns to flaming hot shit.
- I ain't blaming him.

375
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,908
Last I checked, you're a grown-ass man.

376
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:14,704
It's my fault, okay?

377
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,122
But we can't do this right now.

378
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,583
- You put us in danger without thinking twice.
- Monique...

379
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,834
Daddy!

380
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:23,546
Hey, baby, come here. Give me a hug.

381
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,842
- What have you been up to?
- I was drawing you a picture.

382
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,719
You were? Can I see?

383
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,722
Oh, my goodness, this is beautiful.

384
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,557
Thank you, baby.

385
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:38,144
Janine, honey, Daddy's gonna
take us on a sleepover.

386
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,771
Can you help Mommy pack your toys?

387
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,689
- Good girl.
- Baby, we're running late.

388
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,067
We don't have time to pack toys.

389
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,027
We got to go.

390
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,489
I knew you'd vote your conscience, senator.

391
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,948
Thank you.

392
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,368
Goodbye.

393
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,705
Three votes to go.

394
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,085
And the B.A. guys

395
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,337
said that the Pentagon is shelling out

396
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,382
$35 billion on the low end.

397
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,927
- That puts us ahead of Lockheed.
- Amazing.

398
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,931
That's incredible. Edgar must be thrilled.

399
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,891
Fuck Edgar.

400
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:21,771
We did this, you and me. This is about us.

401
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,652
Hey, do you remember that marketing girl?

402
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,237
Ashley?

403
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,281
I'm sorry, I had to fire her, she...

404
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,827
No. No, no, no.
Seven, eight years ago.

405
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,828
Becca.

406
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,874
- Becca? Becca Butcher.
- Yes. That's it.

407
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,961
Yeah, her.

408
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,672
What about her?

409
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,299
Well, she's missing.

410
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,261
What do you mean, missing?

411
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:57,807
I mean missing, as in missing,
presumed dead.

412
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,353
Yeah. I looked at her file,
and the cops think it was suicide.

413
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,940
Yeah, it seems her husband...

414
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,900
Well, he got pretty riled up.

415
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,570
William Butcher.

416
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,033
Am I supposed to know his name?

417
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:19,078
No. Not specifically, but...

418
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:24,083
I was just wondering if you knew
what happened to her.

419
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,335
No, I just assumed that she quit.

420
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,546
Quit?

421
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,507
Is there any particular reason

422
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,135
why you are asking all of these questions?

423
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,221
No, no. I'm just... curious.

424
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,891
It's interesting, right? I mean, it's...

425
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,852
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely sad.

426
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,229
Yeah. Yes, very.

427
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,609
You know, I was thinking that maybe

428
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,863
I could get Maria to stay
late with the baby and...

429
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:58,868
maybe we could order in...

430
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:03,414
and catch up. Just me and you.

431
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,753
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

432
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:14,133
But you go be a mommy.

433
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,146
I'm telling you, you're gonna love it here.

434
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,232
You like roller coasters?

435
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,067
I'm more of a water park guy.

436
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,445
Well, Cedar Point's got both.

437
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,457
You first.

438
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,547
Well, most girls like the suit.

439
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,590
Well, I'm not most girls.

440
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,803
Is it true what they say?

441
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,222
Come on, baby.

442
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,432
I got you here in the flesh.

443
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,809
I gotta see it.

444
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,227
Please?

445
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:12,358
I don't... I don't look like everyone else.

446
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,360
That's what I'm counting on.

447
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:19,824
All right.

448
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,879
Oh, look at those gills.

449
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,590
Oh, my God, that's so fucked up.

450
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:40,177
Hey, can... Can we just...

451
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,929
Be gentle, be gentle.

452
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:44,557
It's tender. Oh, God.

453
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,603
Okay. That hurts. Stop, stop, stop.

454
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,022
- Stop, stop. Stop..
- Come on, it's just my pinkie.

455
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,815
No, I said it hurt.

456
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,113
All right, look,
I think maybe you should go.

457
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:03,367
I'm not going anywhere,
you little fucking freak.

458
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,370
Lay back.

459
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,374
I said, lay back.

460
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,500
God.

461
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,712
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

462
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,255
Oh, yeah. You like that?

463
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,591
Oh, you little fucking freak.

464
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:22,136
Oh, you like getting
your fucking gills fingered?

465
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,805
Oh, God.

466
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,142
Oh, God.

467
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,581
Having a good growler, are we?

468
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:37,753
How did you...?

469
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:41,507
I stuck a little bug on you
back at that shithole of yours.

470
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,510
Because, you know, fuck you.

471
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,470
No...

472
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:47,972
What did you expect me to do?

473
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,974
It was Homelander.

474
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,894
You got to talk to me.

475
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,734
Wait, wait. No. I can help you.

476
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,194
Becca?

477
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,287
Your wife.

478
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,289
She's missing?

479
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,541
I can help you find her.

480
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,739
Please, I have a daughter! No!

481
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,889
Don't want none, fuck off.

482
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,766
I'm here about your wife.

483
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,104
I believe this was a few days

484
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:21,023
after you met Homelander
at that Christmas party?

485
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,411
She was alone with him for three hours.

486
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:56,392
Not long after that, Rebecca went missing
and has remained so ever since.

487
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,271
One way or another, Mr Butcher,
I believe Homelander was involved.

488
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,940
Homelander?

489
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,777
But he's a fucking superhero.

490
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,781
You wouldn't believe
what they get up to.

491
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,580
Who the fuck are you?

492
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,917
My name is Mallory.

493
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,547
I'm the person who can get you payback.

494
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,896
Who's calling?

495
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,108
Nobody.

496
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,325
Listen, if you...

497
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:59,538
If you want to talk, I suppose we...

498
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:00,915
No.

499
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,420
But would it kill you
to make me one of those?

500
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,304
You know, I had someone once.

501
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,808
We were gonna get away, start a family.

502
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,895
So what happened?

503
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,442
Well...

504
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,904
Everyone always asks,

505
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,115
what's our special weakness?

506
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,992
Gamma rays?

507
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,953
Iron daggers?

508
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:42,081
Some ridiculous, stupid thing?

509
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,167
The truth is...

510
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,921
our weakness is the same as anyone's.

511
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,299
It's people.

512
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,344
The people we care about.

513
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,057
So I say, cut them loose.

514
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,560
For your good and for theirs.

515
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,314
That way you're really bullet-proof.

516
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,630
What's up, man?

517
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,883
How'd you end up here?

518
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,344
Oh, tell me about it.

519
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,930
Me, too.

520
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,726
What's that?

521
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,690
Wait, you can't get
in your head about that.

522
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,192
It's really not that big of a deal.

523
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,153
I'm gonna get you out of here.

524
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,863
Just hang tight.

525
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,578
Excuse me, sir.

526
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,539
Oh, hey. Can I take one of these
lobsters back with me?

527
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,791
- You got it.
- Thanks.

528
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,674
Oh, wait, no, no, no. Not that one.

529
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:16,717
This one.

530
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,969
Yeah, that's my guy.

531
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,063
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

532
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,858
Larry, please.

533
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,861
I just need a secure place
for a few nights.

534
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,696
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

535
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,703
Hi, you've reached Annie.

536
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,872
- I can't come to the phone...
- Oh, damn it.

537
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,502
That's Hughie, baby.

538
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,671
- She looks like you.
- Nah.

539
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,299
She's good-looking, man.

540
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,093
Right, baby?

541
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,025
Mr Campbell.

542
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,610
Oh, yeah.

543
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,655
Pleasure to meet you. Billy Butcher.

544
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,824
Oh, Hugh Campbell.

545
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,701
- You got a hell of a lad there.
- Well, yeah.

546
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,578
He's all mine.

547
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,624
Hello, hello, hello.

548
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,335
What have we got here, then, eh?

549
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,087
What's your name, sweetheart?

550
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,922
You can call me Uncle Billy.

551
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,174
He ain't your uncle, honey.

552
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,263
- He ain't nothing to you.
- Monique.

553
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:47,850
Good to see you.

554
00:37:56,442 --> 00:38:00,195
Hi, you've reached Annie.
I can't come to the phone right now...

555
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,243
What's she doing?

556
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:10,038
Okay. It's okay.

557
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:11,915
It's okay.

558
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,461
Does the Oriental girl not talk?

559
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:16,378
Asian.

560
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,754
- Yeah.
- You're right. Asian.

561
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,798
And no, I don't think she does.

562
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,261
Dad, I'm really sorry.

563
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,721
I'm sorry about everything.

564
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,724
No, no, no. Don't say sorry. No.

565
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,478
Look at you, standing up for yourself.

566
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,146
Jings.

567
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,821
Cold feet, huh?

568
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:45,199
- What?
- You said Raynor got cold feet.

569
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,867
Yeah, that's what I said.

570
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,411
You know what I think it is?

571
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:52,247
I think Raynor's plenty interested,

572
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:55,834
only she didn't bring you
Homelander's head on a plate,

573
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,628
and you blew the whole fucking thing up.

574
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,087
How am I doing so far?

575
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,423
No, mate. Way off.

576
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,550
Bullshit, Butcher.

577
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,804
You're so hot for Homelander
right now, Butcher,

578
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:12,184
you're not gonna let anything get in your way,
even if it's your own fucking friends, man.

579
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:17,439
You promised me things would be different.
Matter of fact, you swore it.

580
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,358
But this is worse, man.

581
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:24,571
This is gonna be Mallory's family all over again,
only this time it's gonna be my family.

582
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,949
And if something happens to them, Butcher...

583
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,168
I don't know what happened
with you and Raynor

584
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,128
or how that situation got fucked up,

585
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,339
but just please call her.

586
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:44,925
Please.

587
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,354
Yeah.

588
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,772
There you go.

589
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,151
Dr Vogelbaum.

590
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,242
Surprise.

591
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,328
Thought I'd drop in on you.

592
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,248
You look well.

593
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,292
How long's it been, John?

594
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,254
Long enough that no one calls me John anymore.

595
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,846
So, what are these? Pets?

596
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,472
No, just breeding them.

597
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:33,599
German retrievers.

598
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,185
I try not to get too attached to my subjects.

599
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,189
Well, that's true.

600
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,027
Seems retirement suits you.

601
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,532
Between this and 80-hour weeks at the lab,

602
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,576
I'll take the lab. No contest.

603
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,331
So, you ever...

604
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,625
catch up with any of the old gang from Vought?

605
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,462
Look, do you mind if we don't do this?

606
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:06,089
- Do what?
- This cat and mouse bullshit.

607
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,008
You want to know about Rebecca Butcher.

608
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:12,095
You went to Stillwell about it because you knew
that'd tip over the first domino.

609
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,348
Well, it led to me.

610
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,019
So just ask.

611
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,687
I'll be honest.

612
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,193
Well, that would be a first.

613
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,864
Eight years ago...

614
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,660
Stillwell called me
with quite an interesting challenge.

615
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,789
Rebecca Butcher had come to her with...

616
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,667
a completely unprecedented medical condition.

617
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,670
What condition?

618
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:52,052
She was pregnant.

619
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,387
With your child.

620
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,183
Pregnant?

621
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:07,734
But I thought I couldn't.

622
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:09,528
So did I.

623
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,447
Apparently, nature is tenacious.

624
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,867
The foetus was developing unnaturally fast.

625
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:19,579
We told her we'd deliver the baby safely
at a secure location,

626
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,623
but she had to sign an NDA.

627
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,375
Couldn't tell anyone.

628
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,919
Not even her husband.

629
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,839
You can imagine the size of the potential scandal.

630
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:35,220
No! No! Pull it out... Oh, my...

631
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,313
The birth was difficult.

632
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,151
The baby clawed its way out of her.

633
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,863
The blood loss...
No one could have survived.

634
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,158
She died on the table.

635
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,035
And the baby?

636
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,580
Lived all of ten seconds.

637
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,832
Drowned in its mother's blood.

638
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:08,920
Was it a boy?

639
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,882
Does it matter?

640
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,010
Why didn't you tell me?

641
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,721
To protect you.

642
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,724
That's always job one at Vought, isn't it?

643
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,769
Protect our most profitable asset?

644
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,315
So why are you telling me now?

645
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,275
You don't understand.

646
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:34,863
The thing about cross-breeding dogs,

647
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,865
you get the right genes,

648
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,326
you can get a perfect creation.

649
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,828
But it doesn't matter how perfect they are.

650
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,497
It's not enough.

651
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,625
When I raise subjects without their mothers,

652
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,876
they become violent.

653
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,753
Aggressive.

654
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:52,714
Downright hateful.

655
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,054
You should have been raised
in a home with a family who loved you.

656
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,973
Not in a cold lab with doctors.

657
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,268
And yet, I turned out great.

658
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,814
When I think what it's done to you,

659
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:12,150
and what you can now do to everyone else...

660
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:18,990
I'm sorry.

661
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:22,953
I don't want your fucking apology.

662
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,621
All this is my fault.

663
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,581
What do you want?

664
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,417
What?

665
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,505
What do you want? Forgiveness?

666
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:35,882
Now?

667
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:40,846
After you raised me like a fucking lab rat?

668
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,226
No.

669
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,939
Too little, too late.

670
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,235
I don't want anything from you, John.

671
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:59,990
I'm just an old man thinking about his mistakes.

672
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,581
I'm the world's greatest superhero.

673
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,085
You're my greatest failure.

674
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:24,848
Hi. You've reached Annie.
I can't come to the phone right now, but...

675
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:35,609
Butcher.

676
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:38,862
- Yeah, yeah, here's a gun.
- Fucking hell. Calm down.

677
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,000
All right, easy, lads. Easy.

678
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,378
M.M.

679
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:56,880
Deputy director.

680
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,215
Your family's gonna be okay,
you have my word.

681
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:00,300
Thank you.

682
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,848
You called?

683
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,475
You are a human after all.

684
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,894
Well, let's not get too carried away.

685
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,354
Thanks, man.

686
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,439
Come right this way, ma'am.

687
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:23,490
- Monique, I'm sorry.
- I never want to see you again, Marvin.

688
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,869
Come here, baby.

689
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,624
Daddy loves you, okay?

690
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,167
You're gonna be safe with Mommy.

691
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,419
All right? All right.

692
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,138
Take care of yourself.

693
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,683
All right. All right.

694
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,734
- No Homelander.
- No Homelander.

695
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:02,696
We had a deal.
Everyone else is fair game.

696
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,447
Do you want this or not?

697
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,188
Annie, are you okay?

698
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,568
I have to see you.

699
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,904
I...

700
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,157
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

701
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,409
You have to explain, Hughie.

702
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,286
You have to make this make sense.

703
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,662
Just you and me.

704
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,416
You owe me that much.

705
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,630
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm not following.

706
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:05,508
You and your corporation are fucked.

707
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:09,721
Unequivocally, unilaterally fucked.

708
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,599
How was that? Is that clearer for you?

709
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,812
For the last half century,

710
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:20,899
you have been feeding
the American people the line

711
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:24,235
that your superheroes are chosen by God.

712
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:32,243
I mean, I get it.

713
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,537
Jamming illegal drugs into babies' arms,

714
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,748
I mean, that doesn't quite have the same ring,

715
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,000
and that's not even the worst.

716
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,088
What did you do to this one, and why?

717
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,173
I've never seen her in my entire life.

718
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,052
- What do you want?
- For starters,

719
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,930
there are no superheroes
in the U.S. Armed Forces.

720
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,349
The bill's already gone down to the floor.

721
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,101
They're gonna vote on it any day now.

722
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:58,144
And you're pulling it.

723
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:00,438
Retooling the concept for internal development.

724
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,649
I don't give a shit, but the deal is dead.

725
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,984
And we're gonna go back to status quo,

726
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,612
where we're the government and the military,

727
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,615
and you're just assholes
running around in your capes.

728
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,159
- And if we refuse?
- Everything goes public.

729
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:15,036
Corruption story of the century.

730
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,663
Vought shares go to zero.

731
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:20,834
The civil suits, criminal prosecution,
and you go bankrupt,

732
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:26,005
and your cute little suit goes to
a lovely shade of orange for 15 to 30.

733
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,634
Ms Raynor?

734
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,761
Thank you, Michaela.

735
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:37,976
We're done here.

736
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,688
Everything okay, I hope?

737
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,985
Someone tell me what the hell is going on.

738
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,696
About 12 minutes ago,
Navy SEALs took out Abu Ressam

739
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,364
about 15 miles outside of Damascus.

740
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,242
Right, as planned. So what's the problem?

741
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,578
Watch.

742
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,331
We got two.

743
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,543
- Eyes on.
- Stop.

744
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,880
That's our guy. Light him up.

745
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,423
Great.

746
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,718
The prick behind Flight 37 is dead.
What am I missing?

747
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:12,802
Just wait.

748
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:19,392
- Step inside.
- Watch this.

749
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:25,648
- We got movement!
- Hey! Hey! Get down!

750
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:27,192
- Hey!
- Get down!

751
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,152
- Get down, motherfucker!
- Don't fucking move!

752
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,529
I said get down!

753
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:33,198
What the fuck does that say?

754
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:35,158
"Naqib."

755
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,784
Hey!

756
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,620
Freeze, motherfucker!

757
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,456
Kill him!

758
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,638
That's not all.

759
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,945
How is that son of a bitch still alive?

760
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,241
"Naqib" means "captain."

761
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,493
We believe it's his...

762
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,370
Supe name.

763
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,964
Are you telling me...

764
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:34,884
they have a Supe terrorist?

765
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:57,156
Look, Annie, I...

766
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,075
Did you kill Translucent?

767
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:02,954
It's... It's not that simple.

768
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,792
And you haven't been using me
to get back at A-Train?

769
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,225
You're a murderer.

770
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:25,643
We didn't have a choice.

771
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,021
- There is always a choice.
- Wait.

772
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,564
What are you doing?

773
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,524
- I'm taking you in.
- No. Annie, hold on.

774
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,943
To the cops! At least they'll treat you better

775
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:36,195
- than the Seven would.
- Just listen to me.

776
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,907
- I know this is so fucked.
- You were the only thing, Hughie.

777
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:43,494
- You were the only thing that I could count on.
- I'm still me, Annie.

778
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:45,830
Please. You know me.

779
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,498
I don't know you.

780
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,543
- Never did.
- If you bring me in,

781
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,295
- I'm dead before sunrise.
- No.

782
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,423
Vought will want to string
you up for a long trial.

783
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:59,052
- Lots of press. The guy who killed Translucent.
- This isn't about Translucent.

784
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:01,512
Okay? This is about Compound V.

785
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,225
Compound V?

786
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,104
It's this drug.

787
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,648
It...

788
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,818
It gives the Supes their powers.

789
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,113
Vought will do anything to cover it up.

790
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:22,450
No... No. What...?

791
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,369
What are you talking about?

792
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,830
We're born like this.

793
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,584
I'm so sorry.

794
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:37,757
Annie. Annie. Annie, watch out!

795
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,675
Fucking run, Hughie.

796
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:49,435
I'm so sorry.

797
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,189
Get the fuck away from her!

798
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,902
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

799
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,153
I didn't ask for your help.

800
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:01,280
Yeah. Looked like you had it all under control.
