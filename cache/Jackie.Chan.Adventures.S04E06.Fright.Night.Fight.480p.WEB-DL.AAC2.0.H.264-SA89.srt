1
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,640
Ohh.

2
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,176
The lengths to which
I will go for...

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,813
An <i> oni</i> mask.

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,223
Grr!

5
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,657
Ooh.

6
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,327
I know what I'm wearing
for Halloween.

7
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,130
(Muffled yell)

8
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,932
Uhh!

9
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:37,169
Waah!

10
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,604
Ohh! Hyah!

11
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,738
Uhh!

12
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,643
Happy Halloween.
Looking for a mask?

13
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,849
That one!

14
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,387
Uhh!

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,958
Whoa! Ooh!

16
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,830
All: Ohh.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,008
Heh. <i> Oni?</i>

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,843
Nice try.

19
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,344
Ohh!

20
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,412
Uhh!

21
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,882
Chow:
It's in here somewhere.

22
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,689
Trick for you,
treat for me.

23
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,178
Jackie: I have the mask
right here,

24
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,480
safe inside section 13.

25
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,315
Uncle: So there is
no need to make

26
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,417
mask removal potion?

27
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,186
Not this time, uncle.

28
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,655
The only masks
you will see tonight

29
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,859
will be on the faces
of trick-or-treating children.

30
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,063
Aaaaah!
Oh, Jade!

31
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:48,500
Who is Jade?
I am oni boo-boo,

32
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,402
mistress
of the dark.

33
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,204
Ooh. Makeup?

34
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,438
Ohh.

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,675
Jade, you shouldn't
scare people like that.

36
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,343
Tch. Scaring's
the whole point

37
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,678
of Halloween, Jackie,

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,647
and I have to win
the scariest
costume award

39
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,848
at school tonight.

40
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,251
But of all things,
you had to choose--

41
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,287
I don't know anything
scarier-looking

42
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,355
than an <i> oni</i> demon.
Do you?

43
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,593
Now, come on.
Time's a-wastin'.

44
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,295
We have to get
at least an hour

45
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,063
of trick-or-treating
before the fright fair.

46
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,264
Whoa!

47
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,500
Jade: Captain black.

48
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,936
Nice chicken suit.

49
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:27,039
Actually,
bald eagle.

50
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,740
And it seems
you're the only one

51
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,210
who read my "dress
for the day" memo.

52
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,212
<i>Buenos noches,</i>
<i>mis amigos.</i>

53
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,514
You and
El toro fuerte.

54
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,583
This is no costume,
captain black.

55
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,518
This is a way of life.

56
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,988
<i>Pollo?</i>

57
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,756
(Sighs)
Bald e--

58
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,358
oh, never mind.

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,261
El toro, I'm so glad
you could join us

60
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,495
for Halloween.

61
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,965
And next year,
you and Jade
must join us

62
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,834
in Mexico for <i> El</i>
<i>da de los muertos,</i>

63
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,169
the day of the dead.

64
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,571
Where is
the boy wonder paco?

65
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,939
Paco: I think
you mean...

66
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,774
El paco fuerte!

67
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,476
Are you prepared
to face wrestling's

68
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,579
second-mightiest champion
next to El toro?

69
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,582
Let's rumble,
tumbelina.

70
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,017
No, paco.

71
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,552
Someone
could get hurt.

72
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,020
Someone?

73
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,455
Meaning me?

74
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,591
Uh, no. Um...

75
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,028
What I meant
to say is, uh...

76
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,764
Never forget
the first rule
of <i> lucha libre.</i>

77
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,966
No wrestling
outside the ring.

78
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,136
You think wrestling's
second-mightiest champion

79
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:35,207
can be defeated
by a girl?

80
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,376
Oh, no!
- Of course not, paco.

81
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:41,146
Hands down, you're
king of the ring.

82
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,749
But the queen of scream is
gonna beat the pants off you

83
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,817
in tonight's
costume contest.

84
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,820
You do not think
my mask is worthy?

85
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,022
Sure...

86
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,890
If you're going
as a skier.

87
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,660
First prize goes
to the scariest
costume.

88
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,597
Heh heh.
Look at the time.

89
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,532
We had better get
trick-or-treating

90
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,502
before the witching
hour strikes.

91
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,337
Yes! Come, children.

92
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,243
Perhaps I am not cut out
for this "Halloween."

93
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,849
Ooh.

94
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,218
A face even scarier
than Jade's.

95
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,821
Chow: No.

96
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,923
Not it.
Nuh-uh.

97
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,358
No.

98
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,759
Aw!

99
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,763
We're missin' out on all
the trick-or-treatin'.

100
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,699
Gentlemen.

101
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,201
Whoa!
Tarakudo!

102
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,269
Pop quiz.

103
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,471
Why is Jackie chan
not also here,

104
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,006
searching for the mask?

105
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,407
Uh...

106
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,510
Answer--because Mr. chan
already has the mask.

107
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,611
Ohh!
I knew that.

108
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,779
End of quiz.

109
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,881
Now for the pop.

110
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,949
Aah!
- Aah!

111
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,351
Ohh!
- Ohh!

112
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,119
Can we knock on
uncle's door first?

113
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,254
My demon duds'll
blow his mind.

114
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,956
Oh! The <i> oni</i> mask!

115
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,992
Where is paco?

116
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,562
Where is the mask?!

117
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,865
Do you think
I am scary now?

118
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,270
Ohh!
- Copycat!

119
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,907
Jade, I do not think
paco is wearing makeup.

120
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,008
Oh.

121
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,710
Oh.

122
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,545
Uh-oh.

123
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,482
Paco,
your face?

124
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,718
Uh, paco is
wearing a mask

125
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,155
which we must have
magically removed.

126
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,656
Immediately.

127
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,924
I am sorry,

128
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,994
but we <i> luchadores</i>
never remove our masks.

129
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,562
That is my paco.

130
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,832
El toro, that is
no ordinary mask.

131
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,100
Jade: Paco...

132
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,202
Just stay calm
till uncle gets here.

133
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,371
Then we can put
this whole thing behind us

134
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,939
and get on with
our trick-or-treating.

135
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,875
Trick-or-treating?

136
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,343
A fine idea.

137
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,211
Paco!

138
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,312
No!

139
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,217
(Rings)

140
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,553
Hello?

141
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,157
Jackie, uncle is
very busy right now.

142
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,491
(Doorbell rings)

143
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,193
Tohru!
Candy!

144
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,595
Coming, <i> sensei.</i>

145
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,030
Bzzz! Bzzz!

146
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,802
Arrr, Matey!

147
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,203
Raaagh!

148
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:21,440
Why must uncle devise
removal potion now?

149
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,276
Very nice Japanese
<i>oni</i> demon costume.

150
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:28,513
Happy Halloween.
Thank you, good-bye.

151
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,649
Nice?
Nice?!

152
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,717
I am scary!

153
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,852
Grr!

154
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,054
Who put new <i> oni</i> mask
on face?

155
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,523
How could you
not see him

156
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,792
when he was right
under your nose!

157
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,094
Uh, <i> sensei?</i>

158
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,233
Aiyaaa!

159
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,236
Quickly, tohru.

160
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,805
We must prepare
mask removal potion.

161
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,278
I have <i> mucho</i> competition
in the scary department.

162
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,413
Believe me,

163
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,381
you have
no competition.

164
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,087
Ohh! Are you
the great pumpkin?

165
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,423
Uh...Indeed.

166
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:15,861
And I'm here
to show all ghoulies,
goblins, and demons

167
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:19,498
how to be as scary
as they can be.

168
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,433
Teach me, great one.

169
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,236
All you need to do
is feel the power,

170
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,439
call upon the darkness
within...

171
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,108
So, this mask is stuck
to paco's face?

172
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,846
And we need to unstick it
before paco figures out

173
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,615
how to summon
his shadowkhan.

174
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,283
(Doorbell rings)

175
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,087
Whoa! Those are
some crazy...

176
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,923
Costumes?

177
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,326
Trick or treat.

178
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,395
Grr!

179
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,303
Paco:
If you offer no treat,

180
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,105
then we must trick!

181
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,878
No!

182
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,548
No! No! No!
Go away!

183
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,755
(Whimpers)

184
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,062
Mmm. <i> Delicioso.</i>

185
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,232
You passed
your first test
with flying colors.

186
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,833
Next on the to-do list:

187
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,403
Bathing the earth
in darkness.

188
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,571
El toro: You there!

189
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,573
Step away from
<i>mi paquito.</i>

190
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,043
This little devil
bows to a new
master,

192
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,678
masked man.

193
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,413
Indeed, El toro.

194
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,182
I am no longer your
little towel boy.

195
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,419
I am El paco diablo!

196
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,055
Who is this
<i>cabeza gigante?</i>

197
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,556
Taraku--oh.

198
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,626
Yes, that is
a very lovely costume,

199
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,661
but I am busy right now.

200
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,497
Do not touch
the mask, children.

201
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,866
Jade: Uh, guys?

202
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,703
I don't think these
are trick-or-treaters.

203
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,404
Shadowkhan.

204
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,906
Slimy, slithering,

205
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,175
made-for-Halloween
shadowkhan.

206
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,151
Yaaah!

207
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,721
Uhh!

208
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,159
I hope uncle's almost ready
with that potion.

209
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,463
Twick or tweat.

210
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,498
Bzzz. Bzzz.

211
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Happy Halloween.

212
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,769
Uncle: Tohru,
scale of lizard!

213
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,107
(Doorbell rings)
Tohru, door!

214
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,744
Bzzz.
- Happy Halloween.

215
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,812
Uncle: Tohru, wolfbane!

216
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,614
(Doorbell rings)
Door!

217
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,483
Uncle: Sulfur root!

218
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,551
(Doorbell rings)
Door!

219
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,620
Eye of newt!
No, left eye of newt!

220
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,788
(Doorbell rings)
Door!

221
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,123
Special ingredient.

222
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,059
Tentacle
of Japanese octopus.

223
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,927
(Doorbell rings)
Door!

224
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,196
(Gasping)

225
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,998
Trick or treat.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,704
Tohru, uncle needs
octopus tentacle now!

227
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,406
Uncle: Candy?

228
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,741
Oh, no.

229
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,711
Aiyaaa!

230
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,383
Gnarly, dude!

231
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,387
Uhh!

232
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,722
Uhh! Uhh!

233
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,359
Ohh! Aah!

234
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,263
Uhh!

235
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,600
Sorry.

236
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,739
The shadowkhan are
excellent minions
of darkness,

237
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,274
are they not, Jade?

238
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,443
Tarakudo:
Spiffy costume,
little lady.

239
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,478
Rehearsing your
inevitable return

240
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,581
to the dark side?

241
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,684
Maybe so, tarakudo.

242
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,220
Jade: Stop!

243
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,589
I, oni boo-boo,

244
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,591
call upon
the darkness within me

245
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:10,261
to command you ninjas
to stand down!

246
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,299
Heh heh.
Worth a try.

247
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:17,135
Still you attempt
to outdo me?

248
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:20,638
Ha ha! We shall see,
once and for all,

249
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,141
who is truly
the scariest.

250
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,576
Shadowkhan!

251
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,079
Jackieee!

252
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,681
No!

253
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,884
Uhh!
- Aah!

254
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,020
(Together)
Ohh.

255
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,856
Jackie,
how is it possible

256
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,225
to defeat
a floating head?

257
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,693
Hmm.

258
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,829
(Doorbell rings)

259
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,233
Uh, trick or treat?

260
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,472
<i>Gracias,</i> but I am
on a special diet.

261
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,274
Do you have onions?

262
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,942
Uhh!

263
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,311
Let go of me,
you slugs!

264
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,713
Jade! Uhh!

265
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,551
Jackieeeeee--

266
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,123
uhh!

267
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,258
Aah!

268
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,793
Tsk, tsk, tsk,
Mr. chan.

269
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,094
No mask?

270
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,065
Tarakudo: Much better.

271
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,034
Jackie o'lantern.

272
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:26,704
And now it's time
to send you to
the pumpkin patch.

273
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,573
(Sniffs)

274
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,275
I would prefer...

275
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,610
The onion field!

276
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,012
Aah!

277
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,080
Aah! My eyes!

278
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,183
My eyes!

279
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,353
But where are
paco and Jade?

280
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,191
Paco wants to prove
he is scariest.

281
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,359
Tohru...

282
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,727
Jackie: Meet us
at Jade's school

283
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,196
with the mask
removal potion.

284
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,198
Uh, we will
be there,

285
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,233
uh, shortly, Jackie.

286
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,101
Do not worry, tohru.

287
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,437
How hard can it be
to find boy

288
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,439
in ghost costume?

289
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,707
(Gasps)

290
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,096
Hey, come on.

291
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,999
You kids need a ticket
like everybody else.

292
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,035
What are you?

293
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,074
Eww!

294
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,110
This job don't pay enough!

295
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,946
(Roars)

296
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,482
(Excited yelling)

297
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,821
Ha ha.

298
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,155
No contest.

299
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,893
I am the scariest,
which means you

300
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,162
no longer need
to wear a mask.

301
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,531
Heh. But I'm not
wearing a mask.

302
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,600
I know.

303
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,944
I am the winner.

304
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,913
And second place...

305
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,347
Loses face!

306
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,216
(Gulps)

307
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,517
(Weakly)
Let's rumble.

308
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,785
Rrahhr!

309
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,290
Halt!

310
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,126
El toro: There will be
no fighting here.

311
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,227
Grr!

312
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,895
And why not?

313
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,163
Uh...

314
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,632
Because you know
the first rule

315
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,733
of <i> lucha libre.</i>

316
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,436
No wrestling
outside the ring.

317
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,973
I would not want
to break any rules.

318
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,114
Now, El toro,

319
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,283
prepare to surrender
your title

320
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,187
to El paco diablo!

321
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,756
I will simply keep
the little one pinned

322
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:02,093
until your uncle arrives
with the magic potion.

323
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,896
Do not let paco's size
fool you, El toro.

324
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,701
Cabo cannonball!

325
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,169
Hrrahh!

326
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,639
Ooh, that's gonna
leave a mark.

327
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,375
Where is uncle?

328
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,578
Dude, check out what
this big Bumblebee
guy gave me.

329
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,881
It's like some kinda
suction cup candy.

330
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,251
(Together)
Ooh, cool!

331
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:31,022
Please, you do not want
to eat that.

332
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,491
Hands off, dude.
It's mine!

333
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,127
Trade you.

334
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,401
Natchez knee-dropper.
- Ohh!

335
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,306
Ohh.

336
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,475
I will pin paco

337
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,343
after a brief siesta.

338
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,278
We gonna wait for
El toro to tag us,

339
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,380
or are we gonna--

340
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,182
Jade! Uhh!

341
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,188
Palenque pile-driver!

342
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,324
Jalisco hammer-down!

343
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:09,060
Tijuana twister!

344
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,596
Ohh!

345
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,433
Smash him,
El toro!

346
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,802
Jade, it is still paco.

347
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,037
Heh heh.
Sorry.

348
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,772
I was
in the moment.

349
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,140
Ohh.

350
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,508
You know the second rule

351
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,277
of <i> lucha libre,</i>
don't you, El toro?

352
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,548
The winner may remove
the loser's mask!

353
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,217
Uncle: Speaking
of mask removal,

354
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:37,121
¶ uncle has
a treat for you ¶

355
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,690
float like a buccaneer,
sting like a bee.

356
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,958
Aiyaaa!

357
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,630
You did not tell uncle

358
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,299
new shadowkhan can
stretch like Taffy!

359
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,401
Jackie!

360
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,441
Uhh!

361
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,976
(Gasping together)

362
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,578
Uhh! Aah!

363
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,313
Aah!

364
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,649
Well, there goes
our last pair
of free hands.

365
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,217
Unless you count
demon boy.

366
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,455
Paco, you must
remove your mask.

367
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,758
Why would I want
to do that, loser?

368
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,827
I am not talking
to you, demon.

369
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,696
I am talking to the paco
behind your mask.

370
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,134
But, El toro,
you know the <i> luchador</i>

371
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,370
must never remove
his own mask.

372
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,108
That rule must
now be broken

373
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,976
by both of us.

374
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,878
(Gasps)
El toro...

375
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,446
Why?!

376
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,281
Now, paco,

377
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,950
it is your turn.

378
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,853
El toro: Use the potion
to remove the mask!

379
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,255
Do not listen!

380
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,657
¶ La la la la
la la la la ¶

381
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,859
no!

382
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:51,462
I must remove
the mask.

383
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,764
Uhh!

384
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,733
Jade: Do it, paco!

385
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,335
Go for the potion!

386
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,438
Magic must
defeat magic!

387
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,206
Remove the mask.

388
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,010
No, remain a demon!

389
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,245
Remove the mask.

390
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,513
Remain a demon!

391
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,549
Remove.
Remain!

392
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,718
Uhh! Remove!

393
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,219
Remain!

394
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,421
Remove the mask.

395
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,090
Yes, paco!

396
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,658
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

397
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,729
Nooo!

398
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,065
Waaah! Waaah! Waaah!

399
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,571
Buh-bye.

400
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,743
No more Halloween
horror from you.

401
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,180
El toro,

402
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,783
I think I have been
a very bad little <i> luchador.</i>

403
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,187
Paquito, you may be
small of stature,

404
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,088
but your
inner strength

405
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,391
knows no bounds.

406
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,458
Jade: Here, paco.

407
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,294
I think this
belongs to you.

408
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,229
Because I was
the scariest?

409
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,597
Puh-leeze!

410
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,465
That honor would
belong to <i> moi.</i>

411
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:05,102
But tonight,
you're the champ.

412
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,337
You should have
seen yourself

413
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,572
smacking your
bad self down.

414
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,640
The palenque piledriver!
Hunh!

415
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,609
The jalisco hammerdown
huwah!

416
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,111
The fuerte face-puller!
Yaah!

417
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,280
Paco, you were in the zone.

418
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,020
Hey, Jackie,

419
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,488
do you like scary movies?

420
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,158
Scary movies, yes.
Actually...

421
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,659
Because I'm a filmmaker,

422
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,562
I like scary movies,
drama, comedy, action.

423
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,334
But when I watch
a scary movie,

424
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,535
not nighttime.

425
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,537
You know, really,
after you are watching

426
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,339
you fall asleep,
you can't sleep.

427
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:45,876
So, comedy at night.
Daytime, scary.
