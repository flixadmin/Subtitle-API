1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:04,870
(Breathing hard)

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:08,173
A Chinese talisman
in the tip of Mexico.

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,541
Uncle wasn't kidding

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,244
about the 4 corners
of the globe thing.

5
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,585
Finn: He's
in the pyramid.

6
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:20,919
Let's move.

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,623
Uh, don't pyramids have
mummies inside them, sir?

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,492
Only in Egypt.

9
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:29,995
Why don't we just let chan
find the talisman?

10
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,297
Just take it from him
when he climbs out.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,799
Listen, new guy,

12
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,402
we don't know what power
this ox talisman has.

13
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,971
Chan might come bustin' out
of there 50 feet tall

14
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,305
with laser eyes.

15
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,741
I don't want to fight
giant laser eyes!

16
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,210
Everyone after him!
Now, now, now!

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,029
Huh?

18
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,565
Where is it?

19
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,633
Arrghh!

20
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:08,801
Augh!

21
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,570
Finn: Thanks for all
your hard work, chan.

22
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,373
Hey, where is it?

23
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,341
I don't know!
Finn:
Liar.

24
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,821
Where is the talisman?

25
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,489
Someone else
must've found it.

26
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,391
Years--centuries ago!

27
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,259
I do not believe you.

28
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,529
(Spooky voice)
Ooh-h-h-h-h!

29
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,567
Ooh-h-h-h!

30
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,103
Mummy!

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,605
Mummy: Oooh-h-h!

32
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,623
Oooh-h-h-h!

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,358
Mummy! Run!

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,692
Oooh-h-h!

35
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,538
Jade?!

36
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,239
<i>Qu pasa, Jackie?</i>

37
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,407
Chan!

38
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,476
Run!

39
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,213
(All panting)

40
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,652
After them!

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,661
Why are you here?

42
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,729
You are supposed to be
back at the hotel

43
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,264
doing your homework!

44
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,200
Lucky for you
I breezed through.

45
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:24,503
Tohru was gonna bust you
like a piata.

46
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,072
Thank you, but don't finish
your homework early again.

47
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,874
It's too dangerous.

48
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,350
Whoa, dude!

49
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,591
I'm sorry! I'll bring it
back! Thank you!

50
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,192
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

51
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,095
Jade: Oh, yeah!

52
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,563
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!

53
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,603
(Sputtering)

54
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,805
Think--think there's sharks?

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,181
The ancient pyramids,

56
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,482
the hang-gliders,

57
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,583
the churros!

58
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,553
Mexico is
mondo-coolio, Jackie!

59
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,356
The talisman could be
a million miles away.

60
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,359
Let's ask around,
see what the locals know.

61
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,294
Ooh, mariachis.

62
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,396
Ok, but don't go anywhere.

63
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,231
Uh-huh.

64
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,370
<i>:Hola!</i> I am paco.

65
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,639
What might a charming
seorita such as yourself

66
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,207
be doing this evening?

67
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,809
Eeyeew! Are you
asking me on a date?

68
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,044
Oh, no, no, no.

69
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:42,114
I am gathering an audience
for El toro fuerte.

70
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,815
El who-o what-e?

71
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,652
El toro fuerte,
Mexico's mightiest wrestler.

72
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,154
He has never lost a match.

73
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,157
I want to grow up to be
just like him.

74
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,560
Wrestling? Tsst!
Everyone knows
it's all fake.

75
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,662
(Gasps)

76
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,463
El toro fuerte is no fake.

77
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,699
El toro fuerte's
undefeatable,

78
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,502
because El toro fuerte
is the best!

79
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,670
Oh, really?

80
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,738
See that guy over there?

81
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,708
<i>He's</i> the best wrestler
in the world.

82
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,310
The mouse man?

83
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,111
He can smack
your boy down.

84
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,179
Cannot.

85
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,247
Can too.

86
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,782
Cannot.
- Can too.

87
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,483
Cannot.
- Can too.

88
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,852
Then the 2 best should meet,
don't you think?

89
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,356
I will see you <i> and</i> your
mouse man tonight, seorita...

90
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,424
Jade.

91
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,892
<i>Adios, Jade.</i>

92
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,130
Jackie, we <i> have</i> to go
to the wrestling match.

93
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,865
Nice 'brero.

94
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,367
I'm glad you like it.

95
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,169
They had your size.

96
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,572
<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

97
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,107
Anyway, I told this boy

98
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,709
that you're the best
wrestler in the world.

99
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,410
You have to prove it.

100
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,947
Jade, one should not fight
for the sake of fighting,

101
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,616
but only when one has
no other choice.

102
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,552
Makes sense.

103
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,053
When you get in the ring

104
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,722
and this El toro guy
starts wailing on you,

105
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,523
you'll have
no other choice.

106
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,594
Uh, you have an interesting
mind, young Jade.

107
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,231
Jackie! You've nothing
better to do tonight.

108
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,733
Oh, I don't?

109
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,001
How about search
for the ox talisman?

110
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:13,505
But you said yourself
it could be a million
miles away.

111
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,343
Or right under our noses.

112
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,019
Humph! Didn't peg chan
as a sports fan.

113
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,187
What sport?

114
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,890
Wrestling's fake.
Everybody knows that.

115
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,927
You came all the way here,

116
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,229
and you're <i> not</i> going to
get in the ring?

117
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,397
Jackie!

118
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,232
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Jade.

119
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,733
Paco! Hi.

120
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,669
I see you have
brought a challenger
for El toro fuerte.

121
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,937
Not exactly.

122
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,107
Paco, can you tell me
what this is?

123
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,110
Of course.
It is the sign
of El toro fuerte,

124
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,080
for he is strong
like the ox.

125
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:59,217
(Whispering)
I would fear him, too,
if I were you.

126
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,020
Come, Jade. We have seats
right in front.

127
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,496
Um, El toro fuerte?

128
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,564
<i>Si.</i>

129
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,766
Uh, I'm from housekeeping.

130
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,234
There's been a mix-up.

131
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,703
Your mask has not been
properly cleaned.

132
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,807
What? El toro fuerte
<i>never</i> removes his mask.

133
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,243
Uh, that's what
I told my boss,
but he won't listen.

134
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,212
He insists you cannot fight
with a dirty mask.

135
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,280
You--

136
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,115
hello, chan.

137
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,650
The talisman?

138
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,060
Huh?!

139
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,667
Get him!

140
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,116
Where'd he go?

141
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,025
Whoa!
- Seor!

142
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,460
It is time.

143
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,134
<i>Amigos,</i> welcome
to <i> lucha libre!</i>

144
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,240
Tonight 2 titans will clash
here in this very ring.

145
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,208
El pollo enmascarado...

146
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,948
And the undefeated
champion...

147
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,785
El toro fuerte!

148
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:59,070
Tonight one shall drink deep
from the cup of victory,

149
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,274
and the loser
shall be unmasked!

150
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,711
Where'd they get
<i>this</i> mouse man?

151
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,979
Jackie?

152
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,349
Awesome!
You're gonna do it!

153
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,885
Only because I have
no other choice.

154
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,788
If I win, El toro
will be unmasked,

155
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,625
and I can take the talisman
before valmont's thugs do.

156
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,793
Grrr!

157
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,229
Ooh!

158
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,601
(Chanting)
Tor-o! Tor-o! Tor-o!

159
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,538
Ok then.

160
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,409
Hyiii--oh!

161
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,217
(Groans)

162
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,761
<i>Uno...Dos...Tres!</i>

163
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,766
The winner!

164
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,870
Jade, do not watch.

165
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,673
This is the part where
Jackie must lose his mask

166
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,942
and, regrettably,
his dignity.

167
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,947
It's chan! Get him!

168
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,182
No.

169
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,317
He does not have
the talisman.

170
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,426
Remember, Jackie,

171
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,930
each talisman possesses
a different magic.

172
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,298
Yes, yes, uncle.

173
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,467
12 animals, Chinese zodiac.

174
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,636
One more thing.

175
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,137
What happened
to you?

176
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,639
You lost that match
so fast,

177
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,974
and he gave you
such a whupping!

178
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,276
I know.
He was strong.

179
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,079
Hmm. Perhaps the power
of the ox talisman

180
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,282
is strength.

181
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,686
Oh, of course!
Strength!

182
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,287
One more thing.

183
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,657
Ow!

184
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,759
Jackie! Jackie!

185
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,293
Wake up!

186
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,796
Where is El toro?

187
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,198
He left.
Everyone left!

188
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,833
The match is over.

189
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,136
How could you not win?

190
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,671
Jade, the ox talisman

191
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,508
gives El toro
superhuman strength!

192
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,844
Knew it!
Wrestling is so fake!

193
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,146
Ha ha ha.

194
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,681
Another autograph, paco?

195
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,517
One for your every victory,
seor fuerte.

196
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,018
<i>Gracias.</i>

197
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,319
Finn: El toro.

198
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,754
Meet tohru.

199
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,190
Tohru, toro.

200
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,125
Toro, tohru.

201
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,994
Tohru--

202
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,129
the mask.

203
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,633
El toro fuerte
never removes his mask.

204
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,902
Then I will remove it
for you.

205
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,037
Arrhh!

206
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,443
Aah!

207
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,079
Unnh!

208
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,382
That's it.
New guy quits.

209
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,883
He nailed tohru.

210
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,685
Nobody nails tohru!

211
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,061
(Whistles)

212
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,896
El toro's been
eating his spinach.

213
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,065
The dark hand
will send more.

214
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,533
Paco: More?

215
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,402
This is too exciting!

216
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,607
Aww!
- Aww!

217
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,842
El toro, sir!

218
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,543
Uh, seor.

219
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,712
Ahh, I trust you had
a pleasant siesta.

220
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,814
Listen, bad men
are after you.

221
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,550
They want the talisman.
They know it is magic.

222
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,818
What talisman?

223
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,953
<i>That</i> one.

224
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,121
I don't know what
you're talking about.

225
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,323
On your head. <i> There.</i> Ow!

226
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,191
<i>Never</i> touch the mask.

227
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,832
You are in danger.

228
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,434
Jade, sing-song:
¶ oh, Jackie ¶

229
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,035
¶ they're here ¶

230
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,106
wrestlers?

231
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,541
Shadowkhan.

232
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,281
Hyah!

233
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,284
Unh!

234
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,831
Told ya Jackie rocks.

235
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,400
Indeed, but El toro
is better.

236
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,568
Is not.
- Is too.

237
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,669
Is not.
- Is too.

238
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,770
Is not.
- Is too.

239
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,038
Arrggh!

240
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,508
Hoowah!

241
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,843
Unh! Ohh!

242
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,645
Sorry.

243
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,180
Ha ha! Again?

244
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,683
Unnh!

245
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,589
(Gasps) The mask!

246
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,258
El toro fuerte never
removes his mask!

247
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,629
No!

248
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,876
Jackie!

249
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,912
Put him down!
Put him down!
Put him down!

250
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,348
Put him down
put him down!
Pu--ack!

251
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,683
Oh!

252
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,651
A souvenir for valmont.

253
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,392
Jade was right.

254
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,994
You <i> are</i> a fake!

255
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,300
Jackie.

256
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,442
Mr. toro, we've <i> got</i>
to help Jackie.

257
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,743
Paco is right.

258
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,578
I <i> am</i> a fake.

259
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,847
Come on, come on, come on!

260
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,116
Up we go!

261
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,119
With the power of the ox,
I was undefeatable.

262
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,921
Hah!

263
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,723
I think I hear Jackie
screaming.

264
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,759
You know? The nice guy
you knocked out twice!

265
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,295
He's in big trouble,
and you owe him!

266
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,064
But without the mask,
I can help no one.

267
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,102
Hey, lookee here!
You're golden!

268
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,171
And without the talisman,
the mask is useless.

269
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,475
Forget about the magic!

270
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,077
Look, Mr. toro,
Jackie once told me

271
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,114
the wise seek power
within themselves.

272
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,283
The foolish seek it
within others.

273
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,784
<i>Que?</i>

274
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,253
Yeah, I don't know where
Jackie gets this stuff either,

275
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,188
but what I think it means is

276
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,924
you're not gonna
let a little girl

277
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,160
go fight those bad boys
all by herself, are you?!

278
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,674
Now his legs.

279
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,709
Jackie?

280
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,111
I'll teach that kid
some manners.

281
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,916
Psych!

282
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,118
Auut!

283
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,288
Unh!
- Unh!

284
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,392
<i>Hola, Jackie!</i>

285
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,662
No, no, no! The talisman
is onboard in a box!

286
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,332
Don't let them take off
with it!

287
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,499
Jade!

288
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,836
Huh?

289
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:12,971
Wha?

290
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,941
(Huffing)

291
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,510
(Gasping)

292
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,045
Aa-aa-aa-aah!

293
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,184
Situation.

294
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,998
(Both grunting)

295
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,902
Jackie: Help!

296
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,877
(Gasps)

297
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,045
Whoa!

298
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,681
Pull me in!
Pull me in!

299
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,385
Unh!

300
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,719
I'm not strong enough!

301
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,388
Unh!

302
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,189
Not strong enough?!

303
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,325
The talisman, duh!

304
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,926
(Both grunting)

305
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,500
Huh? Hey!

306
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,768
Hyah!

307
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,902
Unh!

308
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,671
Well, look at me!

309
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,340
I'm Jackie chan!

310
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,011
And...You're the pilot.

311
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,814
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

312
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:35,820
Aah!

313
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,935
(Gasping for breath)

314
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,304
Oh! Ahh.

315
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,906
(Both grunting)

316
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,478
If that is the pilot...

317
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,447
Who's flying
the plane?!

318
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,017
Unhhh!

319
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,719
Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!

320
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,755
Tsst!
A little help here?

321
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,428
El toro fuerte,
you are no longer my hero.

322
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,385
Mr. toro!

323
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,657
<i>Gracias, Jade,</i>

324
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,993
but I would rather
lose with dignity

325
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,862
than win
by deception.

326
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,030
El toro?

327
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,334
Whatever.

328
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,342
Unh!
- Unh!

329
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,643
Ohh!
- Ohh!

330
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,812
Now tell me...

331
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,715
Who is the mightiest?

332
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,583
Jade:
Give you a clue.

333
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,590
Hyah!

334
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,725
Ohh!

335
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,744
Can I keep it, Jackie?

336
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:40,878
No.

337
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,946
Aww!

338
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,814
Paco: El toro fuerte!

339
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,856
Will you teach me
the ways of the wrestler?

340
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,895
With all the wisdom
of my experience.

341
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,501
You are the greatest!

342
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,803
Jade: No.

343
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,572
Jackie's the greatest.

344
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:08,873
No. El toro.

345
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,474
Jackie.
- El toro.

346
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,619
Hey, Jackie,

347
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,654
how do you keep
in shape?

348
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,858
Most important
is the training and
training and training.

349
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,594
All kinds of exercise--

350
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,229
like swimming, boxing,

351
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,599
badminton, tennis, jogging
is good for shape.

352
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,701
Remember,
it's the exercise.

353
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,803
Exercise.
Then you keep in shape.
