MM! Soldier Boy is gonna kill more people.

10
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,282
- [Mindstorm] It wasn't my idea.
- Oh, I know. It was Noir's.

You're Homelander. Button your shit up.

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,711
I'm proposing a strictly
transactional relationship.

Where's Ryan? I'm gonna find him
sooner or later.

18

Everything all right?

00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:06,234
You, me and granny fucker
are gonna finish this fucking job.

I knew your fastball
would come in sooner or later.

34
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,055
- Stay away from him!
- It's okay.

35
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,516
I'm not here to cause trouble,
hurt anyone.

36
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,017
Just want to see my son.

37
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,854
And I had a heck of a time
trying to find you, buddy, I...

38
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,860
Even had to get a big,
important congresswoman to help me.

Yeah, she's nice.

00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:00,746
Okay.

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,502
You know, she may be nice, Ryan,
but she's not your aunt.

45
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,005
She's not even your real family.

46
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:14,010
I can hear those clumsy fingers of yours
slipping around on that screen.

47
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,428
Get rid of it now.

48
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,061
Listen, Ryan.

49
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,107
Your mom, she wanted what's best for you.

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,692
And so do I.

51
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,944
You have a real family.

52
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,156
But aren't you mad at me?

53
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,701
For what I did?

54
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,746
You know it wasn't your fault, right?

55
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,298
Son, when you're as strong as we are,

56
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,301
accidents happen, uh, things break,

57
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:59,388
and sometimes they are the things
that you love the most.

58
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:03,017
But-But that's all it is: an accident.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,312
And nobody on this earth
knows that better than me.

60
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,939
Nobody.

61
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,401
That why I'm always gonna love you.

62

No matter what happens,
no matter... what you do.

63
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,328
I'm not going anywhere.
I will always be here.

Well, great news!

67
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,352
We just heard
the attorney general's office

68
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,895
has a search warrant,

69
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,815
and they're coming here to free Maeve!

Well, I don't know where he is. Do you?

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,330
But I do know the attorney general
is an attention whore

77
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,790
who loves to be on Don Lemon.

78
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,585
And she's on her way here right now

Where's Soldier Boy?

You mean, ever since he told us
he was supposed to kill his own son?

84
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,877
He locked himself in the bathroom
with a bottle of Old Granddad.

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,754
Well, Homelander ain't really his son,
and he knows it.

86
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,468
All right, let's be off then, eh?

87
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,512
We'll swing by the office
and grab some more V.

88

And then Hughie will jump us
to where the cunts are.

89

Oh, this is it.

Cost three Bugattis-worth
of Starlight's money, but...

99
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,919
A dose of Novichok.

Our weapon against Soldier Boy.

101
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:21,298
And the only fucking dose
on the eastern seaboard.

102
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:24,385
You put the world's deadliest nerve agent

in a ten-dollar bottle
of Starlight's Wish?

I must say, the smell has improved.

Great.

00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,986

Oh, this is nothing.

for jabbering at a screening
of <i>27 Dresses...</i>

110
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,161
Frenchie, my whole point has always been

111
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,414
to keep my fucked-up shit

112
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,541
away from Janine.

113
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,711
I lost control for one second,

114
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,629
and for the rest of her life,

115
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,632
she's gonna have an image of her daddy

116
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,843
beating up her stepfather.

117
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,886
I got to lock my shit down.

118
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,847
I got to be stronger.

119
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,976
Out of all man's miseries,
the most bitter is this.

120
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,020
To know so much...

121
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,939
And to control so little.
I've read a fucking book, all right?

122
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,025
You cannot keep the truth
from your daughter that...

123
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,320
that you are... a deeply...

124
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,032
broken and fucked-up man.

125

So am I.

So are we all, no?

127
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,416
But you're also, perhaps,
the best man I ever known.

128
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,629
Let Janine see all of it.

129
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,303
And get back on the fucking Lexapro.

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,162
I turn around, the little git
had done a runner.

164
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,830
We needed him to get near Noir.

165
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,999
Ah, don't you worry about that, guv.

166
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,542
I got it all worked out.

167
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,884
Wake me when we get to New York.

More in the market for some legs.

172
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,290
- What happened to you?
- You'll never believe it.

173
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,959
They gave me a new ticker.

174
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm gonna be able to run again.

175
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,800
All the races and the endorsements.

176
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,262
I'm about to get it all back.

177
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,103
But it don't mean shit without you.

178
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,981
I need you.

179
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,235
Come coach me and you can still work
with the kids at the broke-ass school.

180
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,445
Hell, you'll make enough
to fix the damn place up.

181
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,410
I'm really fucking sorry, Nate.

182
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,580
I'll spend the rest of my life
making it up to you.

183
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,961
- Did you kill Blue Hawk?
- What?

184
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,216
No, that was... Soldier Boy.

185
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,052
Hmm.

186
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,888
You did.

187
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,890
- No, Nate...
- I didn't want that!

188
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,893
I wanted my kids
to see his mug shot on the TV.

189
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,102
And now he's...

190
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,229
- Fuck!
- I stopped him.

191
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,232
For you.

192
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,026
Don't say you did that for me.

193
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,904
You've only ever been about yourself.

194
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,239
- I'm sorry. I'll make it right.
- How?

195
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,325
Every time you try, you make it worse.

196
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,913
Reggie, just-just go, man.

197
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,706
Just go, just get out, okay?

198
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,791
Go sell your menthol vapes

199
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,377
and your fast cash shops and all of that.

200
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,212
But just stay out of my life!

201
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,297
Nate.

202
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:36,965
Come on, man.

203
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,885
I said, get the fuck out of my house!

204
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,679
I don't want a murderer
in the same house with my kids!

205
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,389
- Shit!
- Nate, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,642
- Shit, Nate...
- Don't touch me!

207
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,978
Don't come back here.

208

[vehicle approaching]

210
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,925
Thanks for picking me up.

211
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,553
Sure you want to tell me
to go fuck myself.

212
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,097
I'm not saying anything.

213
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,475
'Cause if you did want to say that,
I mean, you could.

214
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,438
What happened?

215
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,107
Uh... Butcher.

216
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,317
Just out of nowhere, knocked me out.

217
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,610
Did he tell you?

218
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,405
Tell me what?

219
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,865
That Temp V is fatal.

220
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,161
If you shot up any more,
you'd probably be dead right now.

221
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,622
Oh, my fucking God, he didn't tell you!

222
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,541
- That asshole!
- Saved my life.

223
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,501
Saved your life?

224
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,461
It looks like he gave you a concussion.

225
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,131
He stopped me from taking more V.

226
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,845
H-Have you ever had Pizza Rolls?

227
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,226
Like middle school sleepover Pizza Rolls?

228
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,938
Yeah, Dad bought them in bulk
after Mom left.

229
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,899
Every night, we'd have Pizza Rolls,

230
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,776
watch <i>Remington Steele,</i>

231
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,112
try not to touch her spot on the couch.

232
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,407
And he never fought back
for her or anything.

233
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,076
Just sat there eating Pizza Rolls.

234
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,787
I spent so much time thinking he was...

235
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,331
sad and-and weak.

236
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,167
Just a loser.

237
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,879
But you know what? Dad... was there.

238
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,216
Taking care of me
during-during the worst days of his life,

239
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,178
just trying to keep the lights on
and a... [scoffs]

240
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,888
...and a roof above our heads.

241
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,059
He wasn't weak.

242
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,939
I just, I-I didn't know what strength was.

243
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,944
Annie, I'm-I'm so sorry.

244
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,405
I've been an asshole.

245
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,698
I never should have...

246
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,701
I-I never should've put
any of this onto you.

247
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,623
Thank you for saying that.

248
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,755
Literally every neuron in your brain
is screaming "I told you so,"

249
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,799
so why don't you just say it
before your head explodes.

250
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,635
Oh, my God! I fucking told you so.

251
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,303
Feel good to get that out?

252
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,097
- So satisfying. Oh, my God.

Hey.

[Hughie] Hey, Maeve.
Good to see you again.

260
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,705
Glad you're okay.

261
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,501
It's like you wear a neon sign
that says, "Raw dog me, I'm a bottom."

262
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,753
- I'm gonna let you two catch up.
- Me, too.

263
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,925
Where were you?

264
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,221
About 12 floors below you in the Tower
this whole time.

265
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,973
How did you get out?

266
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,850
Your #FreeMaeve shit

267
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,728
had every LGB-teen in the world
up Vought's ass.

268
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,690
You got me my chance.

269
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,651
You know what would've
been better, though?

270
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,570
Actually busting me out.

271
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,363
I think that would've been way harder.

<i>Merde!</i> That hurt!

274
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,128
I have done my part.

275
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,256
Yeah, I am.

276
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,843
Nina was right.

277
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,053
My papa, he put a chain around my neck.

278
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,307
And all that fucking changes
is who holds the other end.

00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,921
What do you see?

280
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,097
Soldier Boy is Homelander's fucking what?

281
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,265
Homelander's father.

282
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,392
Biologically, at least.

283
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,436
[sighs] So put them in a room together,

284
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,105
- are they gonna fight or fucking hug?
- We don't know.

285
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,025
Soldier Boy's been, uh, weird.
But Butcher...

286
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,819
If there's a snowball's chance
that Butcher can take down Homelander,

287
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,071
he's gonna take it.

288
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,573
I don't care what your orders are,
I'm Starlight,

289
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:57,202
and I'm telling you that you need
to evacuate the Tower now.

290
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,163
Because Soldier Boy
is alive and he's real,

- and he's gonna f...

Fuck.

294
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,171
There are a couple thousand people
in that building.

295
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,299
I mean, if he pulls a Herogasm,

296
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,134
he's gonna take
the whole fucking place down.

297
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,471
Then we take down Soldier Boy
before he gets to Homelander.

298
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,890
And save Butcher.

299
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,894
Y'all two fuck us over,

300
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:25,105
and now you want to be
Motherfucking Teresa?

- I know. And-And I'm sorry...
- [Starlight] Hughie.

302
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,985
Some people are just past saving.

303
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,194
He don't want to be saved.

304
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,071
[Hughie] He could've dragged me
down with him, but he didn't.

305
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,447
There's still something good.

306
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,075
Deep, deep...

307
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,120
deep inside.

308
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,496
[Frenchie] Balls deep.

309
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,790
Perhaps.

310
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,500
Bonjour, Petit Hughie.

311
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,918
We save everyone.

312
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,296
Even if they don't deserve it.

313
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,048
Especially if they don't deserve it.

314
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,684
Whoa, that brings me back.

315
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,814
Used to sneak my dad's Manhattans
when I was a kid.

316
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,899
I didn't have to nick nothin'
from my old man.

317
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,861
He used to get me and me little brother
lagered just for the hell of it.

318
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,364
Well, I got to admit,
that does sound funny.

319
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,490
[chuckles]

320
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,618
- The old man still around?
- Arse cancer.

[phone buzzing]

322
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,081
Shitting his guts out
as we speak, one hopes.

00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,879
You ever see <i>The Soldier Boy Story?</i>

324
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,048
- Must've missed it.
- It's a classic.

325
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,967
We lost Best Picture
to <i>An American in Paris</i> that year.

326
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,637
At least I got to ass-fuck Jane Wyman
in the coat check.

327
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,725
About a poor kid
from the streets of South Philly.

328
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,065
Discovers he's got incredible powers
to match his heart of gold.

329
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,443
It's all bullshit.

330
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,612
Blimey, you don't say?

331
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,448
Actually my father owned half
the steel mills in the state.

332
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,617
I went to boarding school.

333
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,119
Got kicked out of boarding school.

334
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,705
Because I was a fuck-up.

335
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,459
But he made sure I knew it.

336
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,627
Use the belt, did he?

337
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,379
Never laid a hand on me.

338
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,713
He couldn't be bothered.

339
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,301
Said I was a disappointment.

340
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,554
Not good enough to carry his name.

341
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,519
So I went to his golf buddies
in the War Department,

342
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:31,106
and they get me into Dr. Vought's
Compound V trials.

343
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,857
I became a superhero.

344
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,109
Strongest man alive.

345
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,694
Fucking ticker tape parades
when I came home.

346
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,488
And what did the old man say then?

347
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,656
Ah.

348
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,496
He said I took a shortcut.

349
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,711
That a real man wouldn't have cheated.

350
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,846
Mmm. [clears throat]

351
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,973
What about you, you got kids?

352
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,975
It's complicated.

353
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,269
I always assumed I had a few out there.

354
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,896
Somewhere.

355
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,025
I always wanted 'em.

356
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,697
'Cause I thought I could do it
better than my father did.

357
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,742
Homelander ain't yours. Not really.

358
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,662
- He's the only blood I've got left.
- It don't matter.

359
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,081
You didn't name him, didn't raise him.

360
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,294
Vought grew him in a fucking test tube
to take your place.

361
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,839
He's the fucking reason
they left you to rot with the Ivans.

362
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,591
Look, mate.

363
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,554
We had a deal.

364
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,024
[clicks tongue]

365
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,819
I'm gonna get some air.

366
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,785
[metal clanging]

367
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,503
[Homelander] Sharpen it
for a thousand hours,

368
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,671
still won't cut Soldier Boy's skin.

369
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:29,349
So... you were on his team. You knew him.

370
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,477
What was he like?

371
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,984
[exhales] Come on.

372
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,694
Nobody's all bad.

373
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,198
[marker clatters]

374
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,161
He's my father.

375
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,331
I didn't believe him at first.

376
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:57,627
I ripped apart the company archives,
and... it's true. [laughs]

377
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,047
It's true.

378
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,385
They lied to me my whole life.

379
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,555
Surprise.

380
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,726
Thing I needed most as a kid
and they kept it from me.

381
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,773
Now, well, I...

382
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,611
I'm not sure I want to.

383
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,866
It's funny, you know,
everyone thinks of you as this, uh...

384
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,702
unreadable sphinx.

385
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,496
A mystery. [laughs]

386
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,000
Not me. I see through that mask.

387
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,170
I mean, literally, I can see your face.

388
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,964
Your battle scars.

389
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,342
The crooked old smile of yours.

390
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,719
I know when you're happy,

391
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,930
sad, telling the truth.

392
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,349
Lying.

393
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,145
Did you know?

394
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,815
That I had a father out there?

395
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,193
Alive this whole time?

396
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,212
Fuck.

397
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,842
Why didn't you tell me?

398
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,637
[stammers]

399
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,976
- [grunts]
- [squishing]

400
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,271
[whimpering]

401
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,606
[gurgling]

402
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,073
[gasps]

403
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,661
[Black Noir gurgling]

404
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:06,964
You should've told me.

405
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,553
[gulps, gasps]

406
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,265
Oh...

407
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,018
[all crying]

408
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,605
D-D-Don't worry, Earving.

409
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,941
We are so proud of you.

410
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,859
[all crying]

411
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,779
Soon you'll be in the sweet embrace

412
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,532
of C-C-C... [stammering]

413
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,242
Christ the Lord!

414
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,097
[knocking]

415
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,227
Fuck me. I figured you was dead.

416
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,356
You didn't think I knew
where the blind spots were, motherfucker?

417
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,524
Back up.

418
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:10,987
Where's Soldier Boy?

419
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,239
You on that Temp V shit, Butcher, huh?

420
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,992
What happens if I pull this trigger?

421
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,702
Go on, do it.

422
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,036
Hey, MM, MM, stop.

423
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,121
MM!

424
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,875
If Soldier Boy goes through with this,
thousands will die.

425
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,501
Help us stop him.

426
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,879
This ain't a bloody kinder care
we're on about, son.

427
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,173
Its Vought fucking Tower.

428
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,591
Becca worked in the Tower.

429
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,302
You shut your fucking cake hole, Frenchie.

430
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,639
No. No!

431
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:43,936
No, my cake hole will remain open!

432
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,190
You will never command me again.

433
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,400
- I am done with your cruelty.
- [Hughie] Okay, Frenchie...

434
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,818
I deserve respect!

435
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:54,155
And we all deserve paid vacation days,
and a dental plan!

436
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,531
We-We-We heard you.

437
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,411
You could've let me die from the V,
but you saved me.

438
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,623
In the shittiest way possible, but still.

439
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,376
I don't think you want to do this.

440
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,087
I think you want me to pull you back.

441
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,381
Like Lenny used to.

442
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,472
- Maeve, no!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

443
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,308
[grunts]

444
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,602
Butcher's right. Homelander needs to die.

445
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,979
That's it. Whatever it takes.

446
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,608
I really thought
that deep down you were a hero.

447
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,320
Well, you were wrong.
There's no such thing.

448
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,114
This is not gonna happen.

449
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,368
Annie, I don't want to hurt you.

450
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,328
[Soldier Boy] But I will.

451
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,375
[Butcher] All right, you lot.

452
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,668
In the safe.

453
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

454
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,007
[Butcher] In the safe.

455
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,223
Let's go.

456
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,266
[scoffs]

457
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,602
Hey, not now. Not like this.

458
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,535
Hang about.

459
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,746
Tinker Bell needs power for her powers.

460
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:31,502
<i>I'm Starlight and I'm telling you
that you need to evacuate the Tower now.</i>

461
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:32,587
[guard] <i>Why?</i>

462
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,505
<i>Because Soldier Boy is alive and he...</i>

463
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,507
We ran it through
the voice thing-a-ma-bob.

464
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,802
It's really her, so, you know,
I think we should probably evacuate.

465
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,429
[Homelander] Nobody's evacuating anything.

466
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,264
We have to project strength.

467
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,684
Right. No, that's smart. Strength.

468
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,353
Okay, so my Angel Fish...
that's what I call Analytics...

469
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:53,316
we think Soldier Boy's coming for Noir,
last member of Payback, right?

470
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,984
So we should use Noir as bait.

471
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,069
And that way it draws
Soldier Boy directly to the...

472
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,913
Hey, is everything...
is everything okay with Noir?

473
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,165
He was keeping secrets from me.

474
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,377
You know, when the company first
rolled me out in front of the cameras,

475
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:17,173
they told me...
I was gonna get my very own team.

476
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,719
I wanted so badly for that team
to be the family that I never got.

477
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,680
And then I got you.

478
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,476
I've-I've always tried to help, sir.

479
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,853
What, like when you ran away
from Herogasm?

480
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,772
Or maybe when you fucked an octopus?

481
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,192
You really want to help?

482
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,829
[Homelander whispers indistinctly]

483
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:55,586
Sir... [chuckles]

484
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,713
