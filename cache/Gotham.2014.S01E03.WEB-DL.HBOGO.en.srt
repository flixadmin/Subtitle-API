1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,840
Excuse me!

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,480
- Hey! Yo!
- Lay it on me.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,560
Come on.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,440
Come on, move your...

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,440
- Thank you.
- Hey, somebody took my...

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,600
Stop him!

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
You need some...

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
Home.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,400
<i>And let's go live
for some breaking news.</i>

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,160
<i>Thank you, Jason. I'm coming to you
with the latest wrinkle in a story</i>

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,880
<i>that has sent shockwaves through
the financial world of Gotham.</i>

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,920
I'm standing before the home
of Ronald Danzer,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,280
the man who bilked investors

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,680
out of a reported half a billion
dollars in a vast Ponzi-scheme.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,200
Danzer is currently out on bail
and awaiting trial.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,600
All of them, the judge, the jury,
the DA,

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,000
pay them whatever it takes.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,560
I am not going to prison just
because a few dumb bus drivers

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,920
and stupid old ladies
lost their damn pensions.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,080
I gotta sneak out,
villagers are here with pitchforks.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,080
You're my lawyer, fix this.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,800
Balloon.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,160
Balloon?

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,880
Air balloon.

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,920
- Want a balloon?
- What?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,320
No, no. No, thank you, no.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Ronald Danzer?

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Who are you?

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,960
Help me.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,360
That's Ronald Danzer!
Roll the camera! Roll the camera!

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,080
Help me!

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,040
In a bizarre turn of event,
a man appearing to be Ronald Danzer

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,320
is rising into the air above Gotham
attached to a weather balloon.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,520
{\an5}Cart was loaded with bricks
for balance.

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,440
{\an5}So Ronald Danzer cheats half
of Gotham out of their savings,

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
{\an5}but before he can stand trial,

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,440
{\an5}an unknown man
clips him to a balloon?

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
No body?

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,800
{\an5}- We're calling this a murder?
- We call it a public service.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,600
{\an5}Danzer was a bum
he got what he deserve.

41
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,000
{\an5}I'm gonna go get a Danish,
that's what I deserve.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,680
Damn it.

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,160
{\an5}Somebody find me O'Brian!

44
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
{\an5}Get me some ice!

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who the hell are you?

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
- Jim Gordon.
- Jim Gordon.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,400
{\an5}Bullock's new partner. Yeah.

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,000
Lieutenant Bill Cranston.

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
Bullock tells me
you're a real Boy Scout.

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,320
{\an5}Don't think we shouldn't
roughing up the skels.

51
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,480
{\an5}Well, I do have that rights.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,480
{\an5}I'm gonna have to remember that.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
{\an5}Maybe I get that tattooed on my ass.

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
Let me show you something, Gordon.

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,320
This was a gift from the Gotham
Chamber of Commerce

56
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,480
{\an5}for my years of service.

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I call him O'Brian.

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,120
{\an5}It also happens to be the best
interrogator on the force.

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
Nice meeting you, Gordon.

60
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,160
{\an5}Oh, Luke,
say hello to Sergeant O'Brian.

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,240
{\an5}No, no!

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,040
I just met Lieutenant Cranston.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,600
The man, the myth, the legend.

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
He's a thug.

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,680
{\an5}So no fingerprints

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,160
{\an5}and those carts are too easy
to buy or steal to trace.

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,480
{\an5}How are you coming
on the death threats?

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,520
{\an5}I thought we talked about this.

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,760
{\an5}Ronald Danzer was murdered

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,240
{\an5}- it's our job to catch murderers.
- The guy was a crook.

71
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,040
Who had not been convicted
of any crime.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,240
Tell that to the two guys
who killed themselves

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,520
because he lost their life savings.

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,720
{\an5}This guys was living high
for 30 years

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,560
{\an5}while the city kissed his ass
and gave him awards

76
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,120
{\an5}for being such a philanthropist.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
So we just let his killer go free?

78
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,720
{\an5}The guy walks in here
holds out his hands,

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,920
{\an5}I'll arrest him.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,120
{\an5}Otherwise, I'm content
justice was served.

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
Like with the Waynes,
is that what you mean?

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,880
{\an5}Mario Pepper killed the Waynes.

83
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,240
{\an5}We killed Pepper.
That case is closed.

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
{\an5}Detective Gordon?

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,520
{\an5}Davis Lamond from Juvenile Services?
You asked to see Selina Kyle.

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
Could you sign for custody?

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
When you're finished
you can bring her

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
to our new facility on Water Street.

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,320
She's scheduled to be transferred
upstate tomorrow.

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
Yeah, that's gonna be delayed.

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
She has information
about an investigation.

92
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,400
Would you mind stepping back
a bit please?

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,200
Wait a minute. Is that one
of those kids that was snatched?

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,400
Another closed case.

95
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,080
What is it about the word closed
you don't understand?

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,240
This is something else.

97
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,840
Just read the letters,
track the balloons.

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I'll be back in an hour.

99
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,120
Yeah, boss. Get right on it.

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,120
Where's my pen?

101
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,920
So why do you care
who really killed the Waynes?

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Because I wanna see the person
responsible brought to justice.

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
Did you read that in a book
or something?

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
And...

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,800
I made a promise to the boy.

106
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
So?

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
The killer came from there.

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,440
He took the man's wallet
and the woman's necklace.

109
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,000
Then shot them both.

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,680
He left the boy alive.
I was up there.

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,960
Everyone knows that much.

112
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
Plus, the killer's face was covered.

113
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Not at first.

114
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
He pulled up his scarf
when he walked toward them.

115
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
I saw him for a second.

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,920
- You saw him, here, in the dark?
- I can see in the dark.

117
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
You don't believe me.

118
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,760
There's the question of whether
you're lying about what you saw

119
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,040
and there's the question
of whether you were even here.

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
You're not giving me proof.

121
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,200
I told you I stole some chump's
wallet just before it happened.

122
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,440
That was like two blocks from here.
Didn't he report it?

123
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,920
Yes, a man did report
his wallet stolen by a thief

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,680
that matches your description
and, yes, the timing does work out

125
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,320
just before the Waynes'
were murdered.

126
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,640
But that doesn't place you here.

127
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I dumped the wallet.

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
There.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
The sewer. Great.

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,440
It isn't that I don't trust you
not to run away,

131
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,200
But, well, I don't.

132
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,520
You find the wallet,
you'll let me go, right?

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,760
- That's the deal.
- No.

134
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,800
I find the wallet,
that places you here.

135
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
- We still have to find the guy.
- That's bull!

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
That's the deal.

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Great.

138
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,480
Son of a bitch,
she was telling the truth.

139
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,800
Oh, Detective.

140
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,680
You're gonna need these.

141
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,600
Hey. Hey, wait a minute.

142
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,960
Lazlo, honey, take a rest.

143
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Poor thing.

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Well, well, well.
Detectives Montoya and Allen.

145
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,440
To what do I owe the honor?

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
Thought we'd pay our respects.

147
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,400
Maybe ask if you'd seen
your friend Cobblepot around.

148
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Oswald?

149
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,160
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him.

150
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,360
Isn't that funny?

151
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,560
Almost as funny as two detectives
from Major Crimes

152
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,160
looking for a nobody like Oswald.

153
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Can we stop the dance?

154
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,520
He's dead, isn't he?

155
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,600
He was killed because he told us
about Pepper being framed

156
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,920
for the Wayne murders.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He's dead.

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
But I didn't kill the little snitch.

159
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Where it is, Jim Gordon
pulled the trigger.

160
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
You have proof?

161
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,200
What do I look like, a cop?

162
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,480
I only heard that James Gordon
spread poor Oswald's brains

163
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,880
all over the Gotham river.

164
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,600
Why would Gordon wanna
murder Cobblepot?

165
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,960
Just to keep him quiet
about the frame?

166
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,080
Wrong question, gorgeous.

167
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
Jim Gordon pulled the trigger,
but who gave the order?

168
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,680
Who could make a cop commit
cold-blooded murder?

169
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Falcone.

170
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,320
Your deductive powers astonish me.

171
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,560
Honestly, I just got a chill.

172
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,920
You know, there's a rumor
going around

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,600
that Falcone gave your latest
boy-toy a nasty beating.

174
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,520
You wouldn't be looking for
little revenge now, would you?

175
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,480
I just want justice
for little Oswald.

176
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,520
Hey, Cobblepot.

177
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,720
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.

178
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,880
I'm afraid you have me confused.
My name is Dimitri from Odessa.

179
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,040
I heard you got whacked for ratting.

180
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,520
Fish is gonna pay serious cash
for your skinny ass.

181
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,080
No, no, no. No, please!
Please! She'll kill me!

182
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Why'd you even come back?

183
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,360
I could not stay away.
Gotham is my home! It is my destiny!

184
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,600
You don't see what's coming! I do!

185
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
Gotham needs me! I am its future!

186
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,920
If you're its future,
then Gotham's in big trouble.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,880
Yes. Yes, it is.

188
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,800
Can I have a tuna sandwich please.

189
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Alfred, I don't wanna do this.

190
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,880
Stop, I don't wanna do this. Stop.

191
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
<i>En garde.</i>

192
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,320
There you go, son. What, what?
Is that all you got?

193
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I don't wanna do this.

194
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
What?

195
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,960
There she blows.

196
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,440
The eye of the tiger feel the wind
in your nostrils, Sir Bruce,

197
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,720
the blood in his face.

198
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Sick, mind your head.

199
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,520
Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir,
I sometimes...

200
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,960
Oh, you little bastard. Blood's up.

201
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
That's gotta hurt not a bit.

202
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,320
I said stop!

203
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,720
Stop. Down swords, I surrender.

204
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
See.

205
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,640
Nice.

206
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,880
So if I smell blood up, isn't it?

207
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,400
Reading these dusty old files.

208
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
What is this anyway?

209
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Police file.

210
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,640
Your mum and dad,
how do you get these?

211
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
It wasn't hard.

212
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,200
Why do you wanna look at these?
They're horrible.

213
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
That will gonna give you nightmares.

214
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,280
I, I have those anyway
and I'm looking for clues.

215
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,720
Well, so you're a detective now,
are you?

216
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
- If I found a clue, I am.
- Have you found a clue?

217
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,200
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

218
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,440
That Detective Gordon
has promised you

219
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,440
that he will find the person
that killed your parents.

220
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
You really believe he will?

221
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
He will try.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
Of that I am certain.

223
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,760
Yeah, Detective James Gordon,

224
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,600
one of your counselors
brought me a girl this morning

225
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
and I signed for custody.

226
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,120
But... That's what I'm saying

227
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,760
I can't bring her back, she got away.

228
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,080
Yeah, well, I'm not happy
about it either.

229
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
On edge, Gordon?

230
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
I'm fine. How can I help you?

231
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,080
We're just wondering.

232
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,160
When you shot Cobblepot in the head
and dumped his body in the river,

233
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,520
did Falcone pay you?

234
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,520
Or was that more of a favor
to the Don type thing?

235
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
Whatever you heard, it's not true.

236
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,640
Oh, so you mean
you didn't kill Cobblepot

237
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
or you didn't do it for Falcone?

238
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
We thought we'd give you a chance
to tell us the truth.

239
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,800
- Cop to cop.
- You're not listening.

240
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
I didn't kill him.

241
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,360
So where were you
on the night of September 17th?

242
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,560
Are you're really asking me this?

243
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,320
Since when did Major Crimes
become IA?

244
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,360
When cops started doing hits
for the mob.

245
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,480
Yeah?

246
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,360
Come back to me
when you have actual proof.

247
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,560
Until then, don't waste my time.

248
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,240
Hey, Gordon, piece of advice?
Take a shower.

249
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
Because you stink like a sewer.

250
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,400
- Any job at all. Even dishwasher.
- We're staffed up.

251
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,280
I only ask a chance to prove myself.

252
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,080
- You ever work in a restaurant?
- Not exactly.

253
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,800
Here, you're on your feet all day.

254
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,000
You don't even have the right shoes.

255
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,120
There you are.

256
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
I got the owner of a weather
balloon factory down stairs.

257
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,440
Says he's got something for us.

258
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,280
Montoya and Allen came by.

259
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,600
Accused me of killing Cobblepot.

260
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,240
- Damn.
- Somebody must have talked.

261
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,280
Doesn't matter. The fact they're here
means they've got nothing

262
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,960
and they're gonna get nothing.

263
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,120
End of the day,
no one cares about Cobblepot.

264
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,120
Because he deserved it.
Like Ronald Danzer.

265
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
Don't make this
into some bigger thing.

266
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,240
You did what you had to do.

267
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
And, yes, he probably did deserve it.

268
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,320
He worked for Fish,
she doesn't employ altar boys.

269
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
What about Mario Pepper?

270
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,160
- He deserve what he got?
- Hell, yes.

271
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,600
He was a dirt bag
who tried to shoot you, remember?

272
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,080
And I thought we were done
talking about this.

273
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,880
We're done talking about this

274
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,760
when the person who actually murdered
Thomas and Martha Wayne is in jail,

275
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,560
not the person we killed for it.

276
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,320
For the last time, Gordon,
let it go.

277
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,560
Or what?

278
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,680
I'm gonna be the next person
taken out to the pier

279
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
to get a bullet in the head?

280
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
The interview's waiting.

281
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,720
Pardon me.

282
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,640
You work at the Italian restaurant
across the way, don't you?

283
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Yeah.

284
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,920
And what size are your shoes?

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
- Nines.
- What a coincidence.

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,760
When I saw that balloon go up on TV,
I knew it was one of mine,

287
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,080
and I said to myself, Jimmy-boy,
you better call the cops right away,

288
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,680
or they'll try and pin this on you.

289
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,680
So it was you who called us.

290
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,280
And here I thought my partner
had gone to the trouble

291
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,800
of tracking you down.

292
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,640
And how exactly was one of your
balloons used to kill Ronald Danzer?

293
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,040
It was stole by my bum
of an ex-employee a month ago.

294
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,560
Carl Smikers.

295
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,320
That's what I get for hiring a kid.

296
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,960
- Did he ever mention Danzer?
- Hell, no.

297
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,280
I'm surprised
he even knew who Danzer was.

298
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,320
We ain't talking about one of those
intellectually superior types here.

299
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,720
You got an address?

300
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,440
Yeah, but you find him,
see you can get back the others.

301
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,400
- The other what?
- The other balloons.

302
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,200
A grand a pop those things are.

303
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,440
He stole four!

304
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,680
Forty-seven dollars?

305
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,160
Frankie, I'm coming back next week,

306
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,880
try to show some initiative,
all right?

307
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Okay.

308
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,480
You're a disgrace to drugs dealers.

309
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,800
- Hotdog.
- Get lost.

310
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,040
- Hotdog.
- I said get lost.

311
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Lieutenant Cranston...

312
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
All right.

313
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Let's see.

314
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,880
Let's see what we got here.

315
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
What the hell?

316
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Who are you?

317
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Oh, no.

318
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Right.

319
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
So no breakfast then?

320
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,720
And no dinner last night?

321
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
What's the new program?

322
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,960
Trying to see how long you can go
without eating anything?

323
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,280
If that's the case, I should save
myself the trouble of making it.

324
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,160
Have you seen this?

325
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The nutter going around

326
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,040
offing people with balloons?

327
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,560
I can think of easier ways
to kill someone.

328
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,680
Master Bruce, forgive me
for uttering the tired old words,

329
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,720
in times like these,
but in times like these,

330
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,120
you really need
to keep your strength up.

331
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I'm just not hungry.

332
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Morning.

333
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Hey. Thank you.

334
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,720
- I tried not to wake you.
- It's fine. I have a meeting.

335
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
You okay?

336
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,960
You hardly slept last night.

337
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,360
- Just work.
- This Balloonman thing?

338
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,280
That's what the paper's calling him.

339
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,200
And it says he killed a cop.

340
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,480
You're not in danger, are you?

341
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
You don't have to worry about me.

342
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Well, what is it then?

343
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
I can see something's bothering you.

344
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Yesterday...

345
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,200
the first victim, Danzer,
was a con man.

346
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
And nobody cared.

347
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,920
Now that a cop's been targeted,

348
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,400
the investigation will get
all the support it needs.

349
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
It's not right.

350
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,320
Everyone has to matter
or no one matters.

351
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,360
Otherwise, people lose faith.

352
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,800
That's when you get vigilantes.

353
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
But that's isn't your fault.

354
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,040
I mean, if anything,
you're giving people faith.

355
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,920
Am I? How?

356
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,040
Your first case
you caught the Wayne killer!

357
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,120
Do you have any idea
what that meant for the city?

358
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
You're a hero.

359
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I've gotta go.

360
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,040
<i>Don't matter if you a cop.</i>

361
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,320
<i>You dirty, the Balloonman
gonna get you.</i>

362
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,440
<i>It's time the people of Gotham
realize</i>

363
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,680
<i>that they have to stand up
for themselves.</i>

364
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,800
<i>Hey, Balloonman ought
to get to my landlord next.</i>

365
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,560
<i>He's a crook.
And his name is Harold...</i>

366
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
This is wonderful.

367
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,040
This is like my dream
of how today was going to go.

368
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,720
Besides the black eye
to the department,

369
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,400
now we have a vigilante
who kills bad cops.

370
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
Cranston wasn't that bad.

371
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,160
But whatever he was
or wasn't guilty of,

372
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
Cranston was a lieutenant
in the GCPD.

373
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,000
You don't get to go around
killing cops.

374
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
So where are you on this
and the Danzer murder?

375
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,080
We're looking for a man
named Carl Smikers.

376
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,680
He was an employee at the factory
where the balloons were stolen.

377
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,000
We have got uniforms
staking out his apartment,

378
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
but he hasn't been back there
since last night.

379
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,920
- And you like him for this?
- Oh, he's guilty.

380
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,480
Leave me in a room with him
he'll be guilty.

381
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,840
He's definitely connected,
but I'm not sure he's the one.

382
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
He have weather balloons.

383
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,000
Cranston and Danzer were killed
with weather balloons!

384
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,160
He's the guy.

385
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,320
Smikers never graduated high school.

386
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,960
He's never held a job
for more than a year.

387
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,600
He's got busts for soliciting.
Possession.

388
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,280
Tell her about the other balloons.

389
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,760
What other balloons?

390
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,520
Smiker's boss mentioned
that four balloons are missing.

391
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,080
There're two still out there.

392
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,640
So two more targets.

393
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,840
We have any sense who they might be?

394
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,600
Danzer and Cranston
were both known figures

395
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
and known to be dirty.

396
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,760
The killer didn't need any special
knowledge to target them.

397
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,120
So it's likely the next target
is public

398
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,320
and known to be corrupt.

399
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,440
Basically every elected official
in Gotham should stay indoors.

400
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,520
- Find him. Now.
- We will.

401
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
"We will?"

402
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,080
What happened to the killer
doing the city a favor?

403
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,880
You're gonna make me think
you actually care.

404
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,680
Listen, smartass, you wanna kill
a corrupt financiers, be my guest.

405
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,680
You kill a cop,
it's a job safety issue.

406
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,560
-We need a plan.
-Relax.

407
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,800
One thing do know
is how to find someone.

408
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Hey.

409
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,000
Hey. Yo.

410
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
What'd he tell you?

411
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,320
Nothing. I was just hungry.

412
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,040
Here's the deal.

413
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,440
You wash dishes, mop the floor,
take out the trash,

414
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,520
otherwise, you're deaf,
dumb, and blind.

415
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,320
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

416
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,800
But you will.

417
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,120
This ain't like other places.
And you'll either get it...

418
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,880
Or I'll be fired?

419
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,320
You could say that.

420
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,080
Oh, you have nothing to worry about.

421
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,840
I know that this is
a great opportunity...

422
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Don Maroni!

423
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Good to see you.

424
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,800
A great opportunity, indeed.

425
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,280
So our suspect had a prior
for soliciting two years ago, right?

426
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,120
So one of my girls thought
he looked familiar.

427
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,000
Remembered he liked big brawny types,
so she pointed me to a pimp,

428
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
that guy who specialized in that.
He remembered...

429
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,000
After you rough him up a little.

430
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,520
That used to do deliveries
for this dry cleaner, Mr. Chang.

431
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
He remembered on top
of everything else,

432
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,040
our guy was a mah-jong nut,

433
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,640
and into these Chinese bookies
for like five grand.

434
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,920
- And they sent you here.
- By way of some bike messengers,

435
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
the guy who runs pickpockets
on the south side

436
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,760
and this pot sticker joint
the guy apparently loves.

437
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Dragon Palace.

438
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,800
- We didn't order any...
- Carl Smikers?

439
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Run!

440
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,880
G.C.P.D! You're under arrest!

441
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,960
Stop, or I'll...

442
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Don't move.

443
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
Jim, a little help!

444
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,400
Put it down! Put it down now!

445
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,640
You put the MCU
onto that cop killing Oswald.

446
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,600
Falcone finds out it came from you

447
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,840
I mean, I don't mind
what he did to me, it's...

448
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,040
Lazlo, honey.

449
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,280
You're worried about me, aren't you?

450
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,600
But you must remember,

451
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,960
it wasn't you Falcone wanted to hurt.

452
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
It was me.

453
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Understand?

454
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Good.

455
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,360
The boy's lost his spine.

456
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,160
Not everyone's built
for beating like that.

457
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,080
What's that new piece
the Roman's been seeing,

458
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,120
what's her name? Natalia, Nadia?

459
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Yeah.

460
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,920
Tell Butch she's going
to have an accident.

461
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Such a shame.

462
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
She was a pretty girl.

463
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,440
And get rid of Lazlo
while you're at it.

464
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,240
He's bringing down the mood.

465
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
With pleasure.

466
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,560
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry. I knocked.

467
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
But I could hear someone in here...

468
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,280
- How did you get in?
- I still have a key, remember?

469
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,800
And you just let yourself in?
Give it to me.

470
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,440
I could have you arrested.

471
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,840
Or I could arrest you?

472
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,800
Anyway, kind of early to get high,
isn't it?

473
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,480
It's been a stressful day.

474
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
- And is that all you're doing?
- I'm afraid so.

475
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,440
Disappointed?

476
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
Don't play with me, Barbara.
I was there, remember?

477
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,440
- Through all of it.
- You mean you were part of it.

478
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Fine.

479
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,240
- Answer the question.
- Yes, this is it.

480
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,760
And now that you've broken
into my home

481
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,480
and accused me
of being a drug addict,

482
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
- you can leave.
- Not until we talk about Gordon.

483
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,720
- He's killed a man.
- You told me. It's not true.

484
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,760
Not Mario Pepper. Another man.

485
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,200
And he killed him on the orders
of Carmine Falcone.

486
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,760
The biggest crime boss in Gotham.

487
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
You're lying.

488
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,880
But, you know,
I guess I should be used to that.

489
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
True.

490
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,840
When we were together,
I did lie to you.

491
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
A lot.

492
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,800
But you always knew.

493
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,720
You looked in my eyes
and knew when I was lying to you.

494
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Am I lying now?

495
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Is it just because I love him?

496
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,560
Is that why you're so determined
to destroy him?

497
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,560
I've been sober for a year, look,

498
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,280
and I know that doesn't erase
the things that I did.

499
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,720
But I still care about you.

500
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
I can't stand you
being with this man.

501
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
You deserve better.

502
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Leave.

503
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Now.

504
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,000
Ask him where he was the night
that Oswald Cobblepot disappeared.

505
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,000
That's the name of the man he killed.

506
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I'm telling the truth,
I didn't kill those guys.

507
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,920
I mean, a cop?
Why would I kill a cop?

508
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,280
Maybe because you're a thieving,
and cop-murdering pile of crap?

509
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,080
But mind you, that's just a theory.

510
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,440
You admit stealing the balloons.

511
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,400
Yeah, but I owed these loan sharks

512
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
and if I didn't pay them
they were gonna cut off stuff.

513
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,120
So if you didn't kill Danzer
and Cranston, who did?

514
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Who'd you sell the balloons to?

515
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,120
I never saw his face.

516
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,560
We had a drop off point
to exchange the balloons and money.

517
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
You know what we got here, Jim,
we got us a criminal mastermind.

518
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Not only has the murder weapon
into the stratosphere,

519
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,120
but so are the bodies.
It's a perfect crime!

520
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,480
The bodies will come back.

521
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
What're you talking about?

522
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,840
Do you guys not know
how weather balloons work?

523
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,200
Tell us, genius,
or I can beat it out of you.

524
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,240
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, they rise up,
and it gets colder and colder,

525
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,360
and the balloon gets brittle,
the helium expands.

526
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Then what?

527
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
It pops.

528
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,840
I'm starting to really
dislike this case.

529
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,200
Where you think
they find shovels that big?

530
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,720
We only have to worry
about one more balloon.

531
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,280
- Who?
- Cardinal Quinn.

532
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,880
He was meditating in his garden.

533
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,200
Alvarez is on his way to the scene.

534
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Now we're gonna have the church
on our back. Great.

535
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,880
Forget the fact that Quinn
was known as the diddling priest.

536
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,200
Here's what we found
in Cranston's pockets.

537
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,760
What wasn't smashed to bits.

538
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,520
Why's your name on this, Jim?

539
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,520
I know who the Balloonman is.

540
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,360
You see, Falcone's
only the boss of Gotham

541
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,680
because people believe he's the boss.

542
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,000
That's what this Arkham thing
is gonna change.

543
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,920
People are gonna see that
the emperor's got no clothes.

544
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,480
I am wasting my breath.
You're an idiot. Get out of here.

545
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Who the hell are you?

546
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,840
I'm sorry, sir.

547
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,400
Hold on. Put that down.

548
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,320
You are listening, huh? You're new.

549
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,120
- What's your name?
- Paolo, sir.

550
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,640
Italian. You don't look Italian.

551
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,560
On my mother's side.

552
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,920
- It's the side I claim.
- A boy who loves his mother.

553
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Here you go.

554
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,080
I was a lot like you.
Started from nothing.

555
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,280
But I kept my head down,
I worked hard. Now look at me.

556
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,320
- Gotham is the city of opportunity.
- Yes, sir. I believe that too.

557
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,560
You hear what I was saying
back there?

558
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,760
Those names, Falcone, Arkham,
mean anything to you?

559
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
Honestly, sir,
I didn't hear anything at all.

560
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Attaboy.

561
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,080
<i>The Balloonman has struck
once again.</i>

562
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,200
<i>Cardinal Quinn, accused
of multiple counts of sexual abuse</i>

563
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,800
<i>is the latest victim
of the vigilante.</i>

564
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,280
See this, this is not good.

565
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,440
You don't go around killing priests.

566
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Least not in public.

567
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,800
Go take care of your mother, Paolo.

568
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,480
His name is Davis Lamond, 48.

569
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,720
He's worked at Juvenile Services
for 15 years. No priors.

570
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
He didn't show up for work today

571
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,160
and hasn't been back
to his apartment.

572
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,680
We have uniforms at both.

573
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,840
And you're positive he's the killer?

574
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,040
We found a form on Cranston's body

575
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,640
that I'd given Lamond
yesterday morning.

576
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,040
Also keys that opened
Lamond's apartment.

577
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
I'm guessing they had a scuffle,

578
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,080
Cranston went through his pockets,

579
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,080
but Lamond managed
to attach him to the balloon.

580
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,840
What caused Lamond to snap?

581
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Not sure.

582
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,760
Lamond's co-workers described him
as thoughtful,

583
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,400
dedicated, sweet, a few said that.

584
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,520
Oh, great, one of those sweet
cop-killing vigilantes.

585
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
And what about his last target?

586
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,560
Same profile as all the rest.

587
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,400
Well-known. Seemingly respectable.

588
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,680
- Actually corrupt.
- This is Gotham.

589
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,120
That doesn't exactly narrow it down.

590
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,480
Meanwhile, I have the mayor,
city council,

591
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,160
half the city's judges
and clergy hiding indoors

592
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
screaming at the Commissioner
to find the guy.

593
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,960
And guess who he screams at?

594
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,320
We've got his photo out there.
It's just a matter of time.

595
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,680
- Nothing.
- Really?

596
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,280
Your network of Chinese loan sharks
and hookers came up empty?

597
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,880
Gloat later. Let's think about it.

598
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,320
He had destroyed the balloons,

599
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,880
the helium canister,
the carts he was using.

600
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,800
Maybe a storage facility.
A warehouse.

601
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Or an abandoned building.

602
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
That's it?

603
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,160
How'd you come up with that?
It's the same thing I just said.

604
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,200
What made you figure this place?

605
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,960
That girl yesterday, Selina,

606
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,280
she told me
she was in a new juvie building.

607
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,000
Lamond, the counselor,
said the same thing

608
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,960
So I'm thinking, what happened
to the old juvie building?

609
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,520
Turns out the city's getting
ready to demo it.

610
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,000
Look, even if he was here,
he's probably gone.

611
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,480
He's only got one balloon left.
He knows we're closing in.

612
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Oh, that's him right there.

613
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Bullock!

614
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,600
Drop the gun now!

615
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,880
I can't do that, Detective.
I'm not done yet.

616
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,400
- One more time, drop it.
- You should be helping me.

617
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,640
You're wasting your breath.

618
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,360
My partner thinks you're as bad
as the scum you kill.

619
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,200
Me, I can see how you're doing us
a favor.

620
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,000
So don't shoot me, all right?

621
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
You believe as I do.

622
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,440
I know you're the one
who caught those child snatchers.

623
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,200
- You risked your life.
- So did I.

624
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,240
- You want to protect the innocent?
- Yes. And we have laws for that.

625
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
And what good are laws

626
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,280
when they require men like you
Lieutenant Cranston

627
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
to implement them?

628
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,600
And you think Ronald Danzer,
you really think

629
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,480
you would ever seen
the inside of a jail?

630
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,480
Or that priest,
why didn't the law punish him?

631
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,880
You know, I have given my life
to the lost children of Gotham

632
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,560
because I wanted
to make a difference.

633
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,840
You know what difference I made?
None.

634
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
Because the people running this city

635
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,880
feed off the weak
and the law protects them.

636
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
And when the Mayor
rounded up all those children

637
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,000
to send to that prison upstate...

638
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,240
I decided no more.

639
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,320
I would teach them
there are consequences.

640
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,320
So why don't you ask yourself,
Detective

641
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
who are you fighting for?

642
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,480
A mayor in the mob's pocket?
Cops on the take?

643
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,840
Or for the weak and the innocent?

644
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Who are you finally?

645
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Oh, forget it.

646
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,160
- What are you doing?
- How do you like that?

647
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,680
- Grab him!
- How does it feel

648
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,640
you hoisted by your own petard!

649
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,120
No, Jim. Jim, what are you doing?

650
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,080
Jim, let go!

651
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,560
Shoot it! Shoot the balloon!

652
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,520
Jim!

653
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,640
Let go!

654
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,680
- Shoot it!
- Just let go!

655
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,160
Shoot it now!

656
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Carmine, what a lovely surprise.

657
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
We're not quite open, but for you...

658
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,720
Hello, Fish.

659
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,440
Just stop by on my way to dinner.

660
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,600
I wanted to make sure
there were no hard feelings.

661
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Never.

662
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,880
That's my girl.

663
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,080
Speaking of your girl,

664
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,720
that better be the reason
why you're ditching me tonight.

665
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,480
What's her name again?

666
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,040
- Nadia?
- Natalia.

667
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,560
And no, she had an accident.

668
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,440
I hope nothing serious.

669
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
- A mugging.
- Mugging?

670
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,160
Ever since the Waynes were killed
the city has gone crazy.

671
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,440
I hope the punk who did it
paid with his life.

672
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,880
He will when we find him.

673
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,600
Along with anyone who helped him.

674
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,960
Are you hearing any rumblings
from Maroni's camp?

675
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,040
You don't actually believe that

676
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,120
Maroni had something to do
with it, do you?

677
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,040
Like you say, people are acting crazy
and crazy's bad for business,

678
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,400
especially with everything
on the horizon.

679
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
You're talking about Arkham.

680
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,120
I thought you had that locked up.

681
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Keep your eyes open.

682
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,280
Hold on. Hold on.

683
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Give me a second.

684
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,840
There will be more like me,
Detective.

685
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,960
- You know that, don't you?
- Not if we do our job.

686
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
We will, I will.

687
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,720
You had your chance. All of you.

688
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Who was your last target?

689
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,640
The crusade of the vigilante
known as the Balloonman

690
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,320
ended tonight when
he was apprehended by police,

691
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,280
<i>He was one man who stood up
to the corruption</i>

692
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,520
<i>eating at the heart of Gotham,</i>

693
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,680
<i>willing to break the law
in order to save it.</i>

694
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,120
Well, I imagine criminals of Gotham
are sleeping well tonight.

695
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
He killed people.

696
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,040
- That made him a criminal too.
- That's very true.

697
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Can I get you anything else?

698
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
No thank you, Alfred.

699
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Right, well, you know,

700
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,440
do try and eat a bit, would you?

701
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,680
Be a shame to have you floating away.

702
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,400
<i>G.C.P.D. claims a win</i>

703
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,600
<i>but this journalist
is left to wonder,</i>

704
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,200
<i>now that the Balloonman's gone,</i>

705
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,480
<i>who will defend the people of Gotham?</i>

706
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,840
<i>This is Channel 7 at 7.00
reporting live</i>

707
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,040
<i>from the former Gotham Juvenile
Facility Center in downtown.</i>

708
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,400
<i>with your minute to minute updates.</i>

709
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,600
<i>Back to the newsroom, John.</i>

710
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
You're okay.

711
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
Are you okay?

712
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,320
Yeah, I fell, that's all. I'm fine.

713
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
What's wrong?

714
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,200
I want you to know that
you can tell me anything.

715
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
This city's sick.

716
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,360
Sick in a way I hadn't realized.

717
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,960
They were taking him away
plus Balloonman killer

718
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,720
I asked him who his last target was

719
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
and you know what he said?

720
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
It doesn't matter.

721
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,120
He meant the mayor, judges,
anyone in the position of power.

722
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
They're all guilty.

723
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,280
But that's not true.

724
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,760
That's how he feels,
that's how they all feel,

725
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,000
everyone.

726
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,440
That's why the city embraced him

727
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
because we let them down.

728
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,440
But if people take the law
into their own hands,

729
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
then there is no law.

730
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
And we're lost.

731
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
There are cops who do it.

732
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
The same thing he did.

733
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
But you never would.

734
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Do you think I could?

735
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
No.

736
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,800
I know you, Jim Gordon.

737
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
And I love you.

738
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,120
And I'm gonna get you a drink.

739
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
I'll get it.

740
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
Jim.

741
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Hello, James.

742
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Old friend.
