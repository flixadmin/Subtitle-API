1
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:05,255
What is it?

2
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:07,156
It's satellite

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,152
It wasn't just me who took it down.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,098
Who was it?

5
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:12,747
Another Speedster.

6
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:19,784
Hi.

7
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:20,954
We Need to Talk.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,692
Who are you?

9
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:24,411
I'm your daughter,Nora

10
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,424
From the future.

11
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:29,221
Anybody need a refill

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,295
Just me!

13
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:33,958
Hmm.

14
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:38,039
People call me excess.

15
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,714
it's a nickname you gave me when I was a kid.

16
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:43,138
and kind of stuck here now.

17
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:46,396
so

18
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:48,167
Anybody know what to do?

19
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,859
This is so weird.

20
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:53,305
God,I love this place.

21
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,329
I can't believe that's our daughter up there.

22
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:56,672
Nora shouldn't be here.

23
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:59,230
She could Marty McFly herself out of existence.

24
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:00,588
she needs to be with her parents

25
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:01,715
30 years from now

26
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:02,999
Not us,now

27
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:04,273
Nora

28
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:06,297
I need to know

29
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:08,823
My poker face is that bad.

30
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:10,489
Please.

31
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,392
Why you keep this from us?

32
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:13,933
I think,

33
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:17,321
I made a big big mistake.

34
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:19,623
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,283
and we can't let this get any worse.

36
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:23,512
Here we go

37
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:28,392
Now,let's do this

38
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:33,953
I don't have a suit.

39
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:35,560
Actually I have a backup.

40
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:37,707
Totally fan favorite.

41
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:42,316
