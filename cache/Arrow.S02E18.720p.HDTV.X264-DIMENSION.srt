1
00:00:01,306 --> 00:00:02,573
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:07,089
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,642
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:11,978
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,298
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,570
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:24,824
I must be something else.

8
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:26,387
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:27,906
Slade!

10
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:29,912
I need someone qualified
to fix this boat.

11
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:32,331
I sure hope a Mr. Hendrik
is there with you.

12
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,000
There's no way
in hell I'm going back there.

13
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,919
Please, put the gun down!

14
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:39,505
You cannot die
until you have known

15
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,924
complete despair.

16
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:44,760
And you will,
I promise.

17
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:47,630
Stay away from Thea.
No...I can't!

18
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:48,954
She's not safe when
she's around you.

19
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:49,633
You love her,

20
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,585
and that's why you're going to do
what I'm asking.

21
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,353
It's
a dangerous city.

22
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,806
Mr. Wilson?

23
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,058
Call me Slade.

24
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,282
Your mascara
is running.

25
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,870
Thank you.

26
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:13,022
Are you
all right?

27
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:16,692
I don't know.

28
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:18,544
It's my boyfriend.

29
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,163
Ex-boyfriend now.

30
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:25,301
He just completely out of nowhere
decides to end things.

31
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:29,371
Heartbreak is something
I know all too well.

32
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:32,925
It's not an easy thing
to recover from.

33
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,928
Sometimes you never do.

34
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:44,020
Um, we're not at--

35
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,238
this isn't my home.

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,457
You're not
going home, Thea.

37
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:53,663
Get out.

38
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,085
Get out!

39
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,681
Hello, Thea.

40
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,850
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

41

43

No time.

44
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,366
You letting
the bad guys

45
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:31,600
stay alive
this year

46
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:33,119
has filled the jails up
to capacity.

47
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,121
Yeah.

48
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,456
Ready?

49
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,575
Well, I've been
working with Sara,

50
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,826
but I'm not exactly
a natural.

51
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,495
Neither was I.

52
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,802
Ok. We have
some work to do.

53
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:52,535
Sorry, I'm just having
a hard time keeping

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,590
my head in the game today.

55
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,757
Thea?

56
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,125
I just can't
stop thinking

57
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,143
what's the worst
that can happen

58
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:58,627
if I just told
her the truth?

59
00:02:58,629 --> 00:02:59,962
Well, I told a guy
the truth and he got

60
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,931
struck by lightning.
To be fair,

61
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:05,851
probably won't happen again,
statistically.

62
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,105
Telling Thea the truth
won't make her safer.

63
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,907
Just the opposite.

64
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,310
What we're doing, Roy,
it's dangerous.

65
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:18,030
And anyone that is
even in our orbit

66
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,749
can get hurt.

67
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:23,786
Try again.

68
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:25,871
This time...

69
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,207
Aim.

70
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,192
What are those?

71
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,827
About a month's worth
of phone messages

72
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,846
from Queen Consolidated.
Toss them.

73
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:36,348
That's what I did with last month's
phone messages.

74
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,768
With Slade out there,
I don't have time for the company.

75
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,603
Well, you have to
make time, Oliver.

76
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,337
At least
three hours.

77
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,856
The annual board meeting.

78
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,558
There's absolutely
zero way that

79
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,509
the CEO can avoid
being there.

80
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:49,028
And I know
it's been a while,

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,113
so in case you've forgotten,
that's you.

82
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:56,068
Do you remember where
you put your business suit?

83
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,538
Or do you keep it
in a cool glass case, too?

84
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,832
I'm going to kill
all of you!

85
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,084
This is not personal.

86
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,703
Well, maybe a little.

87
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,038
It's not.

88
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,757
This is about
survival.

89
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,559
Survival.
What a noble word for murder.

90
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,429
Slade gave us no option.

91
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,216
Hendrik for Oliver.

92
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:28,901
And what gives any of us
the right to decide

93
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,270
one's life is more valuable
than another?

94
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,023
He is tied up.
We are not.

95
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,326
Once he gets the boat working,
Slade will have no more need for him.

96
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:40,229
So let's not kid
ourselves. Doing this

97
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:43,065
is effectively sentencing
Hendrik to death.

98
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,784
He would do the same
thing to any of us!

99
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:47,086
In heartbeat!

100
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,088
This is only option.

101
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,591
What if it's also
an opportunity?

102
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,593
To do what?

103
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,962
To kill Slade.

104
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,274
I know that I haven't been
here in a while,

105
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:10,109
but you don't look
like the entire Board of Directors.

106
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,311
The meeting doesn't start
for another half hour.

107
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,596
Really?

108
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,483
I routinely bump all
appointments 30 minutes

109
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,318
in anticipation
of you being late.

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,703
It's good policy.

111
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,204
But, thank you
for coming out

112
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,290
of hibernation for this.

113
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:27,293
Whether you recognize it
or not, it's your name on the building,

114
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:29,044
and no matter how many
meetings you miss,

115
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:31,163
you're still the public face
of this company.

116
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,082
Isabel, I realize
I have been distracted.

117
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:36,168
Thank you
for picking up the slack.

118
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,337
Ours is an unconventional
partnership,

119
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,889
but it's a partnership.

120
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:41,557
And it's working.

121
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,892
Indeed it is.

122
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,894
Oliver...

123
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:46,345
Your mother's here.

124
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,067
Family squabble?

125
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,473
And how is Ms. Rochev
these days?

126
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,860
Still angry that Dorothy
dropped a house on her sister?

127
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,644
Ahem. What are you
doing here?

128
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:05,614
Have you heard from Thea?
No.

129
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,167
You haven't returned
any of my phone calls,

130
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,985
so I'm left to resort
to checking in person

131
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,837
as to whether you're attending
the debate tonight.

132
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,090
I told you that I would publicly
support your campaign.

133
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,493
Anything else?

134
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:19,595
It would be
embarrassing for us both

135
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:22,331
if you couldn't at least
appear to be my son tonight.

136
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:26,602
I have gotten pretty good at
pretending to be someone I'm not.

137
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,471
I learned it from you.

138
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,066
Oh, excuse me,
have you seen Thea Queen?

139
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,953
Ok.

140
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:47,356
Speedy, it's Ollie,
and I'm at the debate,

141
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,524
where I thought
you would be.

142
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,961
Listen, I know that
you're upset about Roy,

143
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,545
but mom needs
both of us here.

144
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,547
So please,
just call me back.

145
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,533
You do not look happy.
Is everything all right?

146
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,637
Yes. My sister's
just a little late.

147
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,390
I'm afraid that's my fault.

148
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,380
SCPD insisted that I arrive
with a motorcade.

149
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:13,315
We tied up traffic
all over the city.

150
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:15,184
I'm sure Thea's
probably just fallen victim

151
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,436
to gridlock.

152
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,021
Well, I should
probably try her again.

153
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,023
Good luck tonight, Sebastian.

154
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,775
Thank you, sir.

155
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,115
I thought backstage was supposed
to be restricted access.

156
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,168
The benefits of having
a district attorney's badge, I guess.

157
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,070
You stop by to wish
Moira good luck?

158
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:38,007
I did. But I'm really glad
I ran into you.

159
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,426
I owe you an apology.

160
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:43,295
I accused you
of really terrible things.

161
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,382
You were going
through a very difficult time.

162
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,600
I'm just happy
you're on the mend.

163
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,803
Good luck tonight.

164
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,771
I'm not the one
who's going to need it.

165
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:56,442
Sebastian Blood is not
the man you think he is.

166
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,228
He's not going to revive the city
with social services.

167
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,680
He's going to bankrupt it
with unfunded mandates.

168
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,199
Mrs. Queen's problem
with my proposals

169
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:07,002
is that they will be paid
for by the one percent.

170
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,405
It's time that the wealthiest people
stop avoiding their responsibility.

171
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,957
But it will limit
their abilities to hire people.

172
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,660
All right, that's time,
and I will remind the candidates

173
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,578
to please refrain
from interrupting.

174
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,647
Now we have the next
in our series of video questions

175
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:19,999
submitted by
Starling City voters.

176
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,552
This one comes from...
Thea Queen.

177
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:25,754
Ok, there must be
some mistake.

178
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,560
Help!

179
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:35,431
Help! Somebody
help me, please!

180
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,466
He--sla--

181
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:41,020
Oh, my God!

182
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:55,663
We're going to find her, Roy.
We're going to get her back.

183
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,698
She's a tough girl.

184
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,317
Is she going to be alive
when we find her?

185
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,853
You can't think like that.

186
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:06,674
I can't stop
thinking like that.

187
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:14,882
Mr. Diggle.

188
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:17,167
Mr. Diggle!

189
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:20,437
I think I might have found
something. I'm working on it.

190
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,107
I am suspending my campaign
and devoting its resources

191
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:26,026
to the safe return
of Thea Queen.

192
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:30,264
Well, the video referenced
a demand, but no ransom.

193
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:33,234
Which means this might not
be about money.

194
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,952
We're going to get her
back, Moira.

195
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,975
I promise you.
Thea's coming home.

196
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:37,693
Now, can you think of anyone

197
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:39,499
who might want to get
to you through Thea?

198
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:45,049
No one except
for the families

199
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,168
of the 503 people
that died last year.

200
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,937
This isn't about the quake.

201
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,505
Well, how can you
be so sure?

202
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,440
You just need
to find the man in the mask!

203
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:54,775
Look, we're working on it.

204
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,527
We're running down every lead.

205
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,028
What are those leads?

206
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,513
Oh, God!

207
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,383
Oh, God, how could I
have let this happen?

208
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,956
Excuse me for a minute.

209
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,541
If I hear
about one more

210
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,910
invasive press inquiry being
sent to Mr. Queen

211
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,695
or to any member
of the Queen family,

212
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,380
I will hold you
personally responsible.

213
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,866
You're very scary.
Thank you.

214
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,385
My job is to take things off your plate,
now more than ever.

215
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,255
To that end, you remember how
at today's meeting,

216
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,373
the board nominated
new officers?

217
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,259
Voting has to take place
within 24 hours.

218
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,977
It cannot be suspended.
It's an SEC thing.

219
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,729
I can't think
about this right now.

220
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,347
I know, and I'm sorry,
but you have to.

221
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,932
You're the CEO and you
have responsibilities--

222
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,934
Which you handle
for me all the time.

223
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,887
A board vote is several orders of
magnitude different

224
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,438
from covering
a missed meeting.

225
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,192
You could appoint
someone CEO pro tempore.

226
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,528
That's not a good idea.
I'm appointing you.

227
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,413
What?

228
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,685
Congratulations.

229
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,453
You are the temporary CEO.

230
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,372
I can't.

231
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:01,175
Please.

232
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,043
Thank you.

233
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,795
Have Thea thank me,

234
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,247
when she's back
safe at home.

235
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,500
Mr. Queen? I need to talk
to you, it's about Mr. Wilson.

236
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,040
Since the last place
Thea was seen was Verdant

237
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:13,722
I used credit card receipts,
compiled a list

238
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,856
of customers last night,
pinged all their cell phones

239
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:17,725
and hacked into their
photos. The NSA is right;

240
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,777
it's a lot easier when
you don't need a warrant.

241
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,929
I eyeballed every photo.
There must have been thousands.

242
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,548
It's Thea.
I found this.

243
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,400
Partial plate
three blocks from the club.

244
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,736
Car's registered
to a Slade Wilson,

245
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,037
and it has GPS.

246
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,605
Where is it
right now?

247
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,774
Parked outside
a defunct bar on Roosevelt.

248
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,493
Ok, this doesn't
seem easy to you?

249
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,104
Slade using a car
registered in his name?

250
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,547
The whole thing smells rotten.

251
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,999
Either Thea's there or he is.
Either way, we have to go.

252
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,469
Yeah, I figured you'd say that,
which is why I worked up these.

253
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,653
Tibetan pit viper venom.

254
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,678
The League of Assassins'
poison of choice.

255
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,258
And the most powerful sedative
that I've ever worked with.

256
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,061
That'll give us an advantage.
But you are going to give us another.

257
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,829
Are you sure
you want me to go?

258
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:58,732
Are you angry?
Use that rage.

259
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,401
Well, you're just
always telling me to hold back.

260
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,436
Not tonight.

261
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:07,408
Landmines?

262
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,410
What kind of island
is this?

263
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,412
Can you remove the explosive?

264
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,664
Certainly.

265
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,532
Without it going off, eh.

266
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,502
Less certain.

267
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,756
Ah, KGB.

268
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,292
You taught me
many, many things.

269
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:27,628
Russian bomb,

270
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,215
Japanese bomb;

271
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:35,436
they both go...boom.

272
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:41,341
Congratulations, we are not dead.
Now what?

273
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,344
Well, Slade takes Hendrik
as we agreed.

274
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,479
And then once
they're far enough away...

275
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:46,947
What--

276
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,366
you want to rig
Hendrik into bomb?

277
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,402
Well, Peter was right.
Handing Hendrik over to Slade

278
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,371
is the same thing as killing him.
And you're right, too.

279
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,907
We don't have a choice.
I mean, at least this way,

280
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,626
he can take out Slade,
and then we can take the ship.

281
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,380
What?

282
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,416
Just...wondering.

283
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,836
When did you
become so scary?

284
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:24,018
Where is she, Slade?

285
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:33,744
The man
asked you a question.

286
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:42,002
Where is she?

287
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:47,708
What are you going
to do, kid? Kill me?

288
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:53,213
But then who would tell you...

289
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:56,133
Where your beloved Thea is?

290
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:03,807
Call detective Lance.

291
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,526
Tell him
to come down here.

292
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,694
Wh--what? Why?

293
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,730
To arrest
Slade Wilson.

294
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,893
Any idea what this son of a bitch
wants with Thea Queen?

295
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:38,465
No. We just need to make sure that
Slade gives up where he's holding her.

296
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,210
Does Oliver know?

297
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,212
That you're working
with the Arrow on this?

298
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,114
Oliver doesn't know
anything about the Arrow.

299
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:48,017
Hey, are you ok?

300
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,386
Yeah. It's just
that look in Moira's eyes.

301
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,921
Terrified she's lost
her daughter.

302
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:56,675
I couldn't go
through that again, Sara.

303
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:01,397
Officer Lance?

304
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,216
The Queen
family's here.

305
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:07,569
Mr. Lance, did he tell
you where Thea is?

306
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:09,554
Mrs. Queen,
thank you for coming.

307
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,490
This doesn't
make any sense.

308
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,692
Slade Wilson
is a friend.

309
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:16,245
And he's been in Costa Rica
for the past 72 hours.

310
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,231
He can provide flight manifests,
phone records,

311
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,618
even some videos, so he couldn't have
taken your daughter.

312
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,453
If he didn't,
then why did you arrest him?

313
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:27,456
We didn't.
He was apprehended by the Vigilante.

314
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,508
Who then contacted
officer Lance.

315
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,343
Lieutenant,
I can explain--

316
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:33,012
No, I think I got
a pretty clear picture.

317
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:34,630
God, you're a special
kind of stupid.

318
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:37,016
The whole reason
you're wearing that uniform

319
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,251
instead of a detective's shield is 'cause
you were working with the Vigilante.

320
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:41,553
A young girl is missing,
and you just--

321
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:42,647
And now you arrest someone
on his say-so?

322
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,441
You'll be lucky if the next uniform

323
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,059
that puts you in
isn't prison gray.

324
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:59,271
They're calling you
Deathstroke.

325
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,707
It's a bit flamboyant.

326
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,093
I like it.

327
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,328
How did you
get off the island?

328
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,464
That is your first question?

329
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,299
Well, you've made it
pretty clear

330
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,284
that you're not going to tell me
where my sister is,

331
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:15,554
so, yeah. That's
my first question.

332
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:18,724
I swam.

333
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:20,993
But it wasn't
without its obstacles.

334
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,195
The rip current
dragged me under.

335
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:26,148
The rocks on the reef
cut up my flesh to the bone.

336
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,168
But the Mirakuru...

337
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,020
It regenerated everything.

338
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,992
Except this.

339
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,697
You know, it's
just the two of us in here,

340
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,667
so why don't we try
being honest?

341
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:48,370
Why are you
doing this?

342
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,457
You know why.

343
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:56,261
It was five years ago.

344
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:57,546
It was yesterday.

345
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:01,967
Oh, I tried to let go
of the island...

346
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:04,837
But it's still got
a hold on me.

347
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,840
And if that hood that you wear
every night is any indication,

348
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:12,227
it's still got
a hold of you, kid.

349
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:16,532
She never did anything to you.
I did.

350
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:19,201
Shado is dead because
of a choice that I made.

351
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:21,620
So punish me.
Blame me.

352
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:23,372
But...

353
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:25,290
Thea.

354
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,212
You want me to beg?

355
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:36,168
Is that what this all about?
Because I'm begging.

356
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:39,171
You win.

357
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:42,141
Just, please...

358
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,377
Please tell me
where she is.

359
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:49,181
Hmm, that must have been
hard for you to say.

360
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:54,236
Thea...

361
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:58,073
Well, Thea's--

362
00:17:58,075 --> 00:17:59,891
Mr. Queen.

363
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:02,161
Who the hell
let you in here?

364
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,496
Mr. Wilson...

365
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:07,783
You are free to go,

366
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:09,952
with the department's
deepest apologies.

367
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,120
No need, Lieutenant.

368
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,072
An innocent girl's life
hangs in the balance.

369
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,308
You need to follow
every lead possible.

370
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,010
Well, still, you should
know that officer Lance

371
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,828
is facing some very
serious charges.

372
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,881
Well, don't pursue them
on my behalf.

373
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:25,050
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

374
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:33,775
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson, have
the police cleared you of all charges?

375
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:36,361
I was in Costa Rica,
but returned to Starling City

376
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:38,480
as soon as I heard
the terrible news.

377
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,898
What did you tell them about
Thea Queen's disappearance?

378
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,984
I'm offering every resource
at my disposal,

379
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,819
plus a $5 million reward

380
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:47,289
for any information that leads
to Thea Queen's captors.

381
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,140
This is Dig,
I've got the follow.

382
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,009
Tracker
on his car is active.

383
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,511
Roy, he's coming up
on your position.

384
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:12,231
Got him. He's
turning up Warner.

385
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,816
I see him. Heading north.

386
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,156
Damn it, I lost him!

387
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:22,974
It's all right.
I still have eyes on him.

388
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:26,028
- Sara, cut right onto Downey.
- Got 'em.

389
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,923
Negative.
Negative, it's not him!

390
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,041
What?!

391
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,992
Oh, my God.

392
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:42,761
He's cloned
the tracker's signal.

393
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:43,995
Roy, you've got to move!

394
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,181
Roy, you got
to pick him up on Fuller.

395
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:56,058
Roy, do you
still have eyes on him?

396
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,559
Roy?

397
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,194
Roy!

398
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,709
Leave us.

399
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:19,081
Sorry I was gone
for so long.

400
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,583
Screw you.

401
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:23,418
I saw Oliver
and your mother.

402
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,555
They're all quite
worried about you.

403
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:30,225
If you hurt them,
I swear I--

404
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:32,644
Please. Go on.

405
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:34,229
Finish that sentence.

406
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,947
I'm curious to know
what kind of threat

407
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:38,517
a 19-year-old girl
can make.

408
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:43,422
What do you want with me?

409
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:46,274
Well, that, Thea...

410
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,443
is a very long story.

411
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:51,446
Looks like I've got time.

412
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:52,948
Not at all.

413
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,335
You're free to go.

414
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:58,120
What?

415
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:01,273
I had to make a point,

416
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:03,125
and I made it.

417
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,010
The door
is unlocked,

418
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:07,629
so you can leave
any time you'd like.

419
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:12,634
But those guys
who work for you

420
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:14,519
will shoot me
the second I walk out.

421
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:16,605
No, they won't.

422
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,524
Their instructions were to keep
you here until I returned.

423
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:22,811
And I have. So...

424
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,946
You're free to go.

425
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:28,233
But, if you do,
you may never know about

426
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,118
your brother's secret.

427
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,536
What?

428
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:34,873
Your brother
has a secret, Thea.

429
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,959
Would you like
to know what it is?

430
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:48,292
So...

431
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:50,877
What now?

432
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,996
Wait for Oliver.

433
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:55,048
Figure out what our next
move will be.

434
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,166
Wait for him
to tell us, you mean.

435
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:59,669
We can't do anything
without King Queen's permission.

436
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,137
You're out of line, Roy.

437
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,506
All right, let's all
just calm down here.

438
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:05,008
Slade outplayed us.
It happens.

439
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,612
No, it only happened because
the police let Slade go--

440
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:11,531
after we turned him in,
because Oliver told us to.

441
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,283
What were we
supposed to do?

442
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,318
You're Special Forces.

443
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,153
She's an international
assassin. You would think

444
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:19,322
between the three
of us, we could have gotten answers

445
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:21,875
out of Slade ourselves
instead of turning him into the police.

446
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:24,193
Here's what's really sick;
Is we didn't even question him

447
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:26,195
because he said it was
the right thing to do.

448
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,905
Just like he said  that I needed to
break up with Thea.

449
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,585
One week after telling me that it wasn't
safe for me to leave her alone.

450
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:32,552
Wait!

451
00:22:32,554 --> 00:22:35,038
You think it's Oliver's fault
that Slade took Thea?

452
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,440
I think it was his fault that
I wasn't there to stop Slade.

453
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:41,411
And I think you're just
blaming Oliver because you lost Slade.

454
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:43,654
Well, of course you'd take his side,
you're screwing him.

455
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:56,526
Can you guys give us
a minute, please?

456
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:07,087
Do you remember how
she loved to color?

457
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:11,207
Your father would buy
her boxes of crayons by the truckload.

458
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:14,010
She could never get enough.

459
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:18,481
She'd draw on the walls.

460
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:23,553
And I could never get angry,
because it was just so adorable.

461
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:30,360
You should try
to get some sleep.

462
00:23:30,362 --> 00:23:33,396
Is my baby still alive?

463
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:34,781
What?

464
00:23:34,783 --> 00:23:38,952
Is my baby
still alive?

465
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,443
Yes.

466
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:49,796
I woke up every day
for five years

467
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:52,165
the mother
who lost her son.

468
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,050
I--

469
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:56,002
I can't...

470
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,641
I can't
endure it again.

471
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:05,512
And now you hate me,

472
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:07,464
and you have every
justification.

473
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:09,516
Now is not the time.
Yes, it is.

474
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:12,852
It is exactly
the time.

475
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,374
I've told you
that these lies

476
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,075
were to keep
our family safe;

477
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:20,860
to keep us all
together,

478
00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:23,646
but that was
the biggest lie of all.

479
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:27,033
And I told it
to you, to Thea,

480
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:30,203
to myself.

481
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:33,322
Because I was too weak

482
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:36,576
to face
any kind of truth.

483
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:41,931
What's happening now
isn't your fault.

484
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:53,526
From the moment
your children are born,

485
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:58,148
you worry what the world
might do to them.

486
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:04,738
But you never stop to think what
you might do to them.

487
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,126
That we could be
our own worst enemy.

488
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,818
Ollie!

489
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,102
What did you do to him?

490
00:25:36,104 --> 00:25:38,488
Not enough.

491
00:25:42,893 --> 00:25:44,911
And what did you
do to him?

492
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:47,080
We just knocked him.
It's better that way.

493
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:49,165
He wasn't exactly a fan
of the arrangement.

494
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,451
I would imagine.

495
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:52,752
Hendrik's all yours.

496
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:55,288
I know.

497
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:03,797
Wait.

498
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,266
It's an incredible thing,

499
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:08,935
this Mirakuru.

500
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:10,854
Not only does it
give you strength,

501
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:13,223
it also heightens
all of your senses.

502
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:19,229
TNT has
a particular smell.

503
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:26,236
How long before
it goes off?

504
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:28,121
90 seconds?

505
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:30,290
60 seconds?

506
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:32,909
You're thinking that
the blast would kill me,

507
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:35,211
but I disagree.

508
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:39,466
Not that I could say
the same for you lot.

509
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:41,801
I am tempted

510
00:26:41,803 --> 00:26:44,921
to see this
blow you to pieces.

511
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,226
But then again, maybe
I'll just shoot you

512
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:52,479
the same way
that he shot Shado.

513
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:57,233
No.

514
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:02,605
Slade...

515
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:08,411
Hey, where are you going?

516
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:10,479
Well, sitting around
here isn't helping Thea, now is it?

517
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:13,082
Neither is you running off
half-cocked, Roy.

518
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:15,418
I know
that you think

519
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,587
that this is the Mirakuru,
but it's not.

520
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:19,873
I'm right,
and you know that I am.

521
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,841
So you better get the hell
out of my way.

522
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:23,960
Roy, just calm down.

523
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:25,762
It's what Thea
would want us to do.

524
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:28,664
She's right, Roy.
Come on, let's throttle back.

525
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,966
Aah!
Roy!

526
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:37,090
Next one goes
into your chest.

527
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:38,525
Let him go.

528
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:40,476
You would honestly kill me
because I dare

529
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:42,328
to criticize the almighty
Oliver Queen?

530
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,480
No, I'd kill you because you're
hurting my friend.

531
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:46,282
Let him go.

532
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,120
Let him go!

533
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,909
What the hell's
going on down here?

534
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:57,293
I'm done.

535
00:27:57,295 --> 00:27:59,028
That's what's
going on.

536
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,581
Thea, she's out there, hurt or worse,
because of one person.

537
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,833
And that is not
Slade Wilson.

538
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:06,219
Roy...

539
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:07,971
I believed in you.

540
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,508
There's nothing
left for me here.

541
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:16,813
Oh, my God. Oliver...
Now what?

542
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,549
Publicity has drafted

543
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:22,151
a rather compelling
statement,

544
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,987
and I will be doing
the talk show rounds

545
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:27,223
to control the spin.

546
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:30,076
I'm sorry, Ms. Rochev,
but he was very...

547
00:28:31,362 --> 00:28:32,662
Insistent.

548
00:28:32,664 --> 00:28:35,448
Can you give us
the room, please?

549
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:48,595
Isabel, what have you done?

550
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:51,431
Me? Very little.

551
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,600
You're the one who
made this possible

552
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:56,419
when you made me CEO.

553
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:58,137
I know it was
only temporary,

554
00:28:58,139 --> 00:28:59,439
but it gave me
the authority I needed

555
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:01,024
to call an emergency
board meeting.

556
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:03,526
As of 30 minutes ago,

557
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,695
your company
belongs to me.

558
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:06,980
The directors
unanimously made

559
00:29:06,982 --> 00:29:08,648
my appointment
permanent.

560
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,534
I'd say they lost faith
in your leadership,

561
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:14,237
but that would imply
there was any.

562
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,105
Maybe you should
have focused a little less on

563
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:19,742
your...evening
activities.

564
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,447
Slade...

565
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:26,215
You're working for him.

566
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:28,635
With.

567
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:30,803
He knew planting me
in your family's business

568
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,755
would draw you back
to Starling City.

569
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:36,643
Truth be told, I was
skeptical, but...

570
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:39,762
Why are you doing this?!

571
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:42,632
I think it's sad
you don't know.

572
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:46,402
The sins of the father
are the sins of the son.

573
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,005
You are going to tell me
where my sister is,

574
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,791
or I am going to kill you.

575
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:14,405
Where is she?!

576
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:16,920
He's holding her
at a storage depot

577
00:30:16,922 --> 00:30:19,973
just outside the city
limits. Tosca Cartage.

578
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:21,558
How do I know
you're not lying?!

579
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:26,697
It's cute how you think
this isn't all playing out

580
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,866
exactly how he wants it to.

581
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,702
And he wants you
to come alone.

582
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,770
If he even smells
your partners,

583
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:37,040
he will gut sweet little
Thea like a trout.

584
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:43,446
It was a pleasure
doing business with you, Oliver.

585
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:46,083
At least let us
surround the perimeter.

586
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:48,618
No, Isabel was very clear.
I come alone or Thea dies.

587
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,921
Ollie, this is another one
of Slade's games, and unless--

588
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:53,306
no, what I can't do,
Sara, is nothing!

589
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,309
What would you do if it were Laurel,
or your father, or your mother?

590
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:59,846
I will not get dragged into the
same debate over and over again!

591
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:01,898
Go.

592
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,017
Go get Thea.

593
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,269
Stop Slade.

594
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:08,688
Do whatever it takes.

595
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,409
End this once and for all.

596
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:44,000
Holy...Stop!

597
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:45,535
Stop, stop!

598
00:33:13,614 --> 00:33:16,900
Halloween was six months
ago, ass hat.

599
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:21,121
Now get off the road
or get put down. You hear me?

600
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:46,263
I have
a proposal for you men.

601
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:53,636
Go!
Oliver, are you ok?

602
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:55,138
Yeah, I'm fine,
but Thea's not here.

603
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,824
You did it.
Did what?

604
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:59,192
Thea's fine. She's fine.

605
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:01,661
She walked into the precinct
five minutes ago.

606
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:03,663
Safe and sound.

607
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:06,600
What...

608
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:09,202
Oliver, did you hear me?

609
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,600
Thea?
She's fine, no injuries.

610
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,117
He didn't touch her.
He wasn't there.

611
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,652
He had a lot of men,
hired guns. He wasn't there.

612
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:24,120
Because he was
busy elsewhere.

613
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:27,291
Iron Heights reopened a wing
damaged in the quake.

614
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:30,326
There was a prisoner transfer.
Slade hijacked it.

615
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:31,711
Soldiers for his army.

616
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:33,880
Abducting Thea
was all a diversion.

617
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:35,715
Oliver!

618
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:41,137
Oh, thank God.

619
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,755
Oh, my baby!

620
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:47,226
Ohh! My baby.

621
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,315
What?

622
00:34:52,317 --> 00:34:55,034
He told me.

623
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,688
Mr. Wilson...

624
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:04,643
He told me your secret.

625
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:10,700
How you've been
lying to me

626
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:12,668
for years.

627
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,340
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!

628
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:24,597
I believed in you.

629
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,367
We were trying
to keep you safe.

630
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:32,722
Do you have any idea
who you sound like?

631
00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:35,758
You sound like her.

632
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:41,214
Slade...

633
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:43,950
Death's too good
for them.

634
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:46,569
This island should be their
punishment.

635
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,371
Death is
too good for you.

636
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:51,741
This island should be
your punishment.

637
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:53,492
Their prison

638
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:55,694
for the rest
of their days.

639
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:59,081
Your prison for the rest
of your days.

640
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,750
Get him out of here.

641
00:36:00,752 --> 00:36:02,868
Slade...

642
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,053
Get back!

643
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:06,923
I can help you.

644
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,758
You can live,
or you can die.

645
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,810
You choose.

646
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:16,816
Would you like to send a message
to your family?

647
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:20,937
'Cause as soon as this boat is fixed,
I'm paying them a visit.

648
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:56,939
Hell of a night.

649
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:59,925
Quentin Lance, master
of the understatement.

650
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,593
A word, officer?

651
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:02,862
Hold on, sweetheart.

652
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,864
Yeah?

653
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:08,484
I've spoken to DA Spencer
about your...situation.

654
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:10,620
She doesn't want
to press charges--

655
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:13,272
if you cooperate.

656
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,308
Tell us where
the vigilante is.

657
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,877
Well, I'd love
to, but I don't know.

658
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:20,830
Well, that's unfortunate.

659
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:22,214
Yeah, it looks like.

660
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:25,584
Quentin Larry Lance,
you're under arrest

661
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:28,337
for conspiracy and aiding
in multiple felonies.

662
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:30,456
What? Are you out
of your mind?!

663
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,341
What are you doing?
Wilson--Wilson did it!

664
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:34,644
I collared the right
guy. What are you--

665
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:36,762
You have the right
to remain silent.

666
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:38,264
What are you
doing?

667
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:41,250
You have the right to an attorney.
Dad!

668
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:43,769
Riding what pundits
are calling a sympathy bump,

669
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:46,489
Moira Queen pulled far ahead
of Sebastian Blood

670
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:48,474
in the latest polls
conducted in

671
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:50,026
the last 24 hours
by channel--

672
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:52,995
The whole thing just
blew up in my face!

673
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:55,781
How the hell do I
get elected now?!

674
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:58,367
I think you intended
a different tone.

675
00:37:58,369 --> 00:37:59,535
You said I'd be mayor!

676
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:01,037
And you just
delivered this election

677
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,822
for Moira Queen,
and for what?

678
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,976
What is this obsession you have
with the Queen family?

679
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,178
You haven't told him?

680
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,213
Shh.

681
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:13,099
You promised me.

682
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:14,850
I promised you this city.

683
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:18,671
I promised you an army
with which to take it.

684
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,943
What is our status?

685
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:26,195
Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences division

686
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:27,569
is now fully dedicated

687
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:30,137
to replicating a serum
based on your blood sample.

688
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:35,371
You see...

689
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:39,458
Everything
is proceeding as planned.

690
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,911
Where are you going now?

691
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:45,798
To service my obsession.

692
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,469
Oliver Queen
needs one more distraction.

693
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:07,937
What are you two doing here?

694
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:11,524
We thought this is
where you would go.

695
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,225
You're predictable.
That, and you've been

696
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,277
sleeping on
the cot at night.

697
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,582
What are you doing here?

698
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:21,500
Where else would we be?

699
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:31,877
Roy was right.

700
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:35,848
At every turn, I had made
the wrong decision.

701
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,750
With him,

702
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:40,269
with...the company,

703
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:42,438
and...

704
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,691
and with Thea.

705
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:51,430
I was so focused
on what Slade might do to me,

706
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,149
that it never...

707
00:39:53,151 --> 00:39:56,352
even occurred to me
what I could do to myself.

708
00:39:58,822 --> 00:40:02,291
I am my own worst enemy.

709
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:04,660
That's Slade talking, Oliver.
Don't let him in your head.

710
00:40:04,662 --> 00:40:06,778
I can't keep him out
of my head, Diggle!

711
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,115
I can't...I can't
stop him from doing anything.

712
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,001
Yes, you can.

713
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:15,004
What makes you so sure?

714
00:40:15,006 --> 00:40:17,006
Because you're not alone, man.

715
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,381
Now what, boss?

716
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:40,696
Now we fight back.

717
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,985
Police have issued a warrant
for Slade Wilson

718
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,767
after Thea Queen named him

719
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:51,027
as the mastermind of her
kidnapping yesterday.

720
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,543
This in the wake of Wilson's
arrest and subsequent release

721
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:58,297
by the SCPD hours before
Ms. Queen was released.

722
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:02,017
In a statement to the press,
SCPD Lieutenant Franklin Pike

723
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:04,787
reiterated his support
for his department

724
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:07,640
despite what appears
to be a serious blunder.

725
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:09,859
He went on to say,
the SCPD is committed--

726
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:13,529
To making sure any arrest
they make is a legal one,

727
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:15,865
but without sufficient--

728
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:20,019
Don't worry.

729
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:22,571
I am not here
to harm you.

730
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:25,023
Go to hell!

731
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:28,193
All in good time,
I'm sure.

732
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,329
But before then,

733
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:32,748
I have come
to Starling City

734
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,467
to see Oliver Queen
suffer.

735
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:37,136
Oliver...What?

736
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:38,904
Why?

737
00:41:38,906 --> 00:41:41,640
Because he's
not the man you think he is.

738
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:43,259
And how would you know that?

739
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:47,429
Because I know
Oliver Queen is...

740
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:50,266
The Arrow.

741
