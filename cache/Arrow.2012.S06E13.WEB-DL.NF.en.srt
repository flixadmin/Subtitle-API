[Oliver] <i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:05,964
You would be remiss in forgetting
the thermobaric explosive that remains

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,132
in my possession.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,342
What do you want?

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,844
Vengeance for my son.

6
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,097
-What'd you find?
-[Alena] Video of his son's murder.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,099
This is fabricated. It didn't happen.

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,352
Whoever planned this
knew exactly how Cayden would react.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,146
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

10
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,397
Do you trust me?

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,735
I need you here for a
rather important assignment.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,820
-What's that?
-Rooting out a traitor.

13
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,280
[taser buzzing]

00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,158
[whimpering]

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,162
-Baby, please wake up.
-He's gone, D.

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,667
[Spartan] We're clear.

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,795
All right. Keep moving.

18
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,221
I guess Cayden James and friends
knew we were coming.

19
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,476
<i>Once I learned of Mr. Sobel's treachery,</i>

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>I had to assume
this location was compromised.</i>

22
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,273
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

23
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>I didn't appreciate
your alliance with him.</i>

24
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,739
<i>Made me think we no longer have
an understanding.</i>

25
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,159
-You need to know something.
<i>-Many things, I'm sure.</i>

26
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,246
<i>But I doubt very much that
you're the man to teach them to me.</i>

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,124
We almost have proof
that I didn't kill your son.

28
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,126
<i>A desperate gambit.</i>

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,253
Cayden, give me more time.

30
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,048
<i>Time, I'm afraid,</i>

31
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>is a commodity you and your city</i>

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,344
<i>have run out of.</i>

33
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:38,014
<i>Mr. Sobel's betrayal convinced me
that there's little good</i>

34
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,849
<i>in delaying matters further.</i>

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,518
<i>Accordingly,</i>

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>I will be detonating the thermobaric bomb</i>

37
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,898
<i>over Star City at midnight.</i>

38
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,861
<i>My son will find justice in the ashes
of your beloved city.</i>

39
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,876
{\an8}Cayden is going to detonate the bomb
in four hours.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,128
{\an8}Where are we with the video?

41
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,547
{\an8}Well, we're running
a photographic analysis algorithm

42
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,923
{\an8}to reveal the original footage.

43
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,134
{\an8}-How long will that take?
-As long as it takes.

44
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,510
{\an8}The algorithm Felicity and Curtis wrote

45
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,594
{\an8}works wonders on a still image,

46
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,304
{\an8}but this is 24 fps video
we're talking about here.

47
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,682
{\an8}Right. Cayden just told us that
we're running out of time.

48
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,350
{\an8}There's something you should consider.

49
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,812
{\an8}You're putting all of your chips down
on a bet that he'll spare this city

50
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,689
{\an8}if he thinks you're not responsible
for his son's death.

51
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,358
{\an8}That's because that's
the only play we have, Alena.

52
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,278
{\an8}I'm just saying you might be
trying to reason with a man

53
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,404
{\an8}who's beyond reason.

54
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,493
{\an8}[Cayden] As you are well aware,
Arclight is now in its final phase.

55
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,621
{\an8}And now it's time for us
to take our leave.

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,000
{\an8}Words much appreciated.
But how are we to get out of city?

57
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,669
{\an8}Stay close to your phones.

58
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,590
{\an8}You'll be airlifted from the city
before the bomb goes off.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,341
{\an8}After it does,

60
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,053
{\an8}your individual shares of the ransom
will be wired into offshore accounts

61
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,847
{\an8}that have been set up for each of you.

62
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,181
{\an8}Sounds fair.

63
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,559
{\an8}Lucrative.

64
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,685
{\an8}[Cayden] Indeed.

65
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,606
{\an8}Thank you for helping
to see this project to fruition.

66
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,151
{\an8}I don't think I need to stress

67
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,946
{\an8}how personally important

68
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,865
{\an8}this has been for me.

69
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,452
Thank you for all you've done

70
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,621

{\an8}Just as Alexander reigned destruction
on Persepolis,

{\an8}See you guys tomorrow.

93
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,497
{\an8}-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, that was quite a game.

94
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,708
{\an8}Please don't lie, okay?

95
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,251
{\an8}I could see you weren't in the stands.

96
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,503
{\an8}Mom told me you didn't show.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,131
{\an8}Where's your mother now?

98
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,426
{\an8}She and Jim went to have dinner
at some fancy French restaurant.

99
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,429
{\an8}Jim got a promotion.
He said he wanted to treat her.

{\an8}That's considerate of him.

101
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,894
{\an8}So sorry I missed the game, Owen.

102

I do want to be

You can't have it both ways, Dad.

Yeah. I'm okay. We rallied the troops
and everyone's panicking a little.

We have bigger

Besides, this is the only place

Do not worry.

Cayden James will not let

You're damn right.

00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,750
I just don't think that
that's what's on his mind right now.

158
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,127
Right.

159
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,797
Well, you know, if it comes down
to Laurel against Dinah,

160
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,258
Laurel's not the one I'm worried about.

161
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,343
[all grunting]

162
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,277
Tell me where I can find Black Siren

163
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,613
or the next bone I break is your neck.

164
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,408
Lady, if I knew
where any of those guys were going,

165
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,659
I'd be with them.

166
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,536
[grunts]

167
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,832
[Wild Dog] I guess that's one way
to not get information.

168
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,167
What are you two doing here?

169
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,627
Looking for you.

170
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,420
SCPD says you weren't in today.

171
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,422
[Wild Dog] We were wondering if you were
gonna do something stupid.

172
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,507
Guess we were wrong.

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,383
I'm looking for her

174
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,844
to get justice for Vincent.

175
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,597
Why do you say justice
like it's cold-blooded murder?

176
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,643
I know you're hurting, D.

177
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,478
But Felicity called.

178
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,065
We've got till midnight before James
lets his bomb do its thing.

179
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,483
As much as we feel for you,

180
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,777
that seems like the priority.

181
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,072
He's right. Now's not the time
to go off the deep end.

182
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,658
[Black Canary] I can't let this go.
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,076
[Wild Dog] D.

184
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,246
I love you both,

185
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,623
but stay the hell out of my way.

186
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,215
We need to consider
the A.R.G.U.S. airlift option.

187
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,717
Oliver, we've already talked about this.
James will see it coming.

188
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,803
We need to consider something.

189
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,763
-Got it.
-What?

190
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,018
[Oliver] I've seen this. It's bogus.

191
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,311
You said you had something.

192
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,689
Yeah. The whole thing was
a massive deception.

193
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,316
Owen was never collateral damage
like Cayden was made to think.

194
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,193
He was the real target the whole time.

195
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,238
[computer beeps]

196
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,364
Who is that?

197
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,616
Facial recognition
just picked him up as Carl Iskoff.

198
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,701
Paid assassin.

199
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,870
-With a bow and arrow?
-Bow and arrow is not his usual MO.

200
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,872
I'm guessing it was a special request
by whoever hired him

201
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,958
-to kill Cayden's son.
-All to set you up.

202
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,003
We need to have a conversation
with this Iskoff.

203
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,087
Find out who hired him.

204
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,338
He's dead.

205
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,715
What?

206
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The assassin was assassinated

207
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,635
not long after Owen Post.

208
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,140
We need to know
where Cayden James is right now.

209
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,308
Got him.

210
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,978
I'm guessing Cayden doesn't care
about people knowing his location

211
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,813
now that his bomb is about to go off.

212
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,065
He's almost on the I-86.

213
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,442
He's psycho, but he's smart.

214
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,735
I mean, he doesn't wanna
be anywhere near the boom

215
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,194
when the bomb goes boom.

216
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,279
We'll never catch him.

217
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,031
I have an idea.

218
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,289
[Green Arrow] We need to talk.

219
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,464
Questionable judgment, Mr. Queen.

220
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,508
If you wanted the bomb to go off
before midnight,

221
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,594
you'd be hard-pressed to come up
with a better way

222
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,554
than taking me into custody.

223
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,640
Watch this.

224
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,809
Would that be the proof
that you alluded to earlier?

225
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,061
Just play the video.

226
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,067
[beeps]

227
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,443
No. I'm not watching this again.

228
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,694
No, Cayden.

229
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,321
You're not.

230
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,699
You're watching the real video

231
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,493
for the very first time.

232
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,871
[beeps]

233
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,165
Oliver didn't kill your son.

234
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,042
Which means someone else did.

235
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,252
[Green Arrow]
The assassin's name is Carl Iskoff.

236
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,755
He was instructed to use a bow and arrow,

237
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,759
so the video could be manipulated,
and they could make it look like me.

238
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,347
It's the same tech used to out Oliver
as the Green Arrow, four months ago.

239
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,935
Someone's gone through a lot of work
to put you two on a collision course.

240
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,771
Oh, yes.

241
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,776
Someone within my organization.

242
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,111
How do you know?

243
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,239
The metadata on the forged video file

244
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,033
confirms it as the work of the same person

245
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,452
who manipulated that photo in October.

246
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,995
You lost a man a month ago.

247
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,624
Killed by the traitorous Mr. Sobel,
but I highly doubt it was Mr. Sheck.

248
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,503
-That leaves Laurel? Diaz?
-And Anatoly?

249
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,464
I'd like to speak to my former colleagues.

250
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,592
And that's where the two of you come in.

251
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,803
[Green Arrow] No.

252
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,305
We're not rounding them up to be executed.

253
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,308
No, I just want a pointed conversation.

254
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,936
Bring them to me. All three. Alive.

255
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,522
Otherwise, I'll have no choice
but to stay the course.

256
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,066
I still have a very powerful bomb.

257
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,861
And I'd be perfectly happy
to take out Star City

258
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,448
right along with whoever orchestrated
the death of my son.

259
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,041
You gotta be kidding me.

260
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,585
Please tell me you're kidding me.

261
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,378
The only way to stop James
from destroying the city

262
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,838
is by delivering him these people.

263
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,298
Lead them to the slaughter, you mean.

264
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,134
-We won't let that happen.
-Right now, that's our only option.

265
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,802
You don't even know for sure
that one of them did it.

266
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,220
I mean, none of them
were working for Cayden

267
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,305
when he received the video.

268
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,057
They were working for him
when he received the doctored photo.

269
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,767
It has to be one of those people, Alena.

270
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,188
It is either Diaz, Anatoly or Black Siren.

271
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,356
You hope. What if Cayden is lying?

272
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,566
We've got bigger problems then that.

273
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,319
I mean, what makes you think that
we can find Cayden's BFFs,

274
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,403
if he can't?

275
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,280
If they're smart,
they're out of the city by now.

276
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,240
They're smart, but so is he.

277
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,910
He grouped them together by promising
to fly them out before the blast.

278
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,038
[Felicity] Thank goodness for small
favors and gullible bad guys.

279
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,124
By now, they're worried that James
might not make good on that promise.

280
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,376
Raisa wanted to go
to one of the city shelters,

281
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,337
so she could be with her family.

282
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,672
What's going on? Why do we have
to leave the safe house?

283
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,716
We'll talk about it later, buddy.

284
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,718
You promised you won't lie to me anymore.

285
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,932
Cayden James is threatening
to detonate a large bomb

286
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,183
in Star City,

287
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,935
and this is the safest place for you.

288
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,812
That is the truth.

289
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,815
-Alena.
-[Alena] Yeah. We're running facial recog

290
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,192
and Cayden gave us back satellite control.

291
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,818
Our usual tricks aren't working.

292
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,821
Oliver, we need the rest of the team.

293
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,032
Agreed.

294
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,620
-Where are you going?
-Need to go look for a few people.

295
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,955
Let me come with you.

296
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,208
I need you to stay here.

297
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,918
I wanna stay with you.

298
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,878
It is too dangerous out there.

299
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,255
Bottom line.

300
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,840
I'll be back as soon as I can be.

301
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,974
You have any luck?

302
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,308
Did you think I would?

303
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,019
She was pretty clear about
where she stood, hoss.

304
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,313
So, basically the city
is gonna get destroyed

305
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,690
and our friend is gonna commit murder

306
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,191
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about either?

307
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,568
[cell phone vibrates]

308
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,904
-Well timed, D.
-Different kinda D, Hoss.

309
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,658
Sorry, John.

310
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,451
We've gotten some place with Cayden James.

311
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,122
He won't detonate his bomb, if we
bring back Anatoly, Diaz and Laurel.

312
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,248
Alive.

313
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,166
So, no honor amongst thieves?

Well, let's just say he has a good reason

315
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,588
to think at least one of those
is responsible for his son's death.

We can use your help finding them.

If we do it,
we should go after Laurel first.

00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,304
Dinah's after her.
If she gets to her before we do...

319
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388
D's gonna kill her.

320
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,932
And if she does that,

321
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,475
she might be killing the whole city.

[Wild Dog] It's not like that, D.

-Alive.
-Or boom goes the city.

343

a pretty good reason to not kill her,

Anatoly and Diaz are still in the wind.

Correction. Ricardo Diaz was in the wind.

We have Black Siren. Where do we take her?

it took more than one songbird

Cayden, we don't have time for games.

-Yes, Alena.

somebody would have told you.

on your hacked A.R.G.U.S. responder

386
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,530
My point being, it's just...
If A.R.G.U.S. has your scent,

387
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,491
maybe going out right now
isn't the best idea.

Probably not. But I'll take precautions.

00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,439
Hello, William.

476
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,942
My name is Cayden James.

477
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,361
You're the guy who wants
to blow up the city.

478
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,737
I suppose.

479
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,030
It's a long story.

480
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,991
And it concerns my own son.

481
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,493
Where is he?

482
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,787
Passed away, I'm afraid.

483
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,883
[man] <i>Cayden James.</i>

484
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,764
I was told to expect you.

485
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,809
Warned, in fact.

486
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,894
Mr. James, we're here
to remand you into custody

487
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,980
for multiple violations of federal law.

488
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,898
I strongly advise you not to resist.

489
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,653
My only son is playing in this game.

490
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,657
Could I perhaps watch it
before you take me in?

491
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,159
That's not how it works.

492
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,829
Just asking for few moments.
Little compassion here.

493
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,041
I strongly suggest surrendering peacefully

494
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,334
to avoid a scene.

495
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,170
There's no need for that.

496
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,987
I'm gonna get a lay of the land.

497
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,781
She better be here when I get back.

498
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,411
I don't think she likes me.

499
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,122
Well, you haven't given her
much reason to, have you?

500
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,291
Fair.

501
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,921
[Black Siren grunts]

502
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,132
She's right, you know.

503
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,552
-[clears throat] About what?
-I'm not like Sobel.

504
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
I'm not gonna change.

505
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,058
I'm not gonna just wake up one day
and... And be your Laurel.

506
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,060
No, no. You'll always be you.

507
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,396
But you can be better.

508
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,565
[scoffs] Why would I?

509
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,151
We live in an ugly world

510
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,863
and the only way to survive it is...
Is to be ugly right back.

511
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,949
-You're wrong, okay?
-Hey.

512
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,868
Has it ever occurred to you
that I like who I am?

513
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,080
That when I killed Sobel,
I actually enjoyed it?

514
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,919
And all those pictures that you
showed me of your daughter, this...

515
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,880
This... This woman
that I don't even recognize,

516
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,924
they made me sick.

517
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,387
She was soft and naive.

518
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,555
And that's why she's the one who's dead.

519
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,391
Why are you telling me this?

520
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,228
Because I don't ever wanna
find myself enjoying killing you.

521
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,190
Perimeter's secure.

522
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,859
-Let's move.
-Yeah.

523
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,658
Quite a brave young fellow
you have here, Mr. Queen.

524
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,495
Brave and foolish.

525
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,707
-Much like his father.
-Wait, wait. What's he doing here?

526
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,834
None of your concern, Mr. Lance.

527
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,169
Ah. And the rest of our guests
have arrived.

528
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:33,341
These two freaks say that you think
one of us killed your boy?

529
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,218
In point of fact, Mr. Diaz,

530
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,679
I know that one of you killed my boy.

531
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,014
I intend to find out who.

532
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,141
You believe people in masks,

533
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,935
over people you do business with?

534
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,270
[Diaz] I'm with the Russian.

535
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,441
I think these guys would do anything
to save their precious city.

536
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,485
I don't trust anyone's word, Mr. Diaz.

537
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,612
I put my faith in data.

538
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,239
Information.

539
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,616
Ones and zeros never lie.

540
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,829
This is digital proof that
one of you has betrayed me.

541
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,335
Come on, William.
Please just get out of there.

542
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,045
None of you know

543
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,465
what it feels like to lose a son.

544
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,634
A piece of yourself, gone.

545
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,263
It's like a phantom limb.
No. It's worse than that.

546
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,099
It's like a piece of your soul, lost.

547
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,685
As if it had never been there. No. Stop.

548
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,937
I keep reminding myself that...

549
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,607
I have not lost my son.

550
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,526
He's been taken from me.

551
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,611
[Diaz] Hey.

552
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,864
You're losing it.

553
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,741
Your grief,

554
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,118
it's making you crazy.

555
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,500
What if it has?

556
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,461
Just look at him. He wants to kill
everyone in this room.

557
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,881
-Just be ready to move.
-Okay. Screw this.

558
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,174
It was me.

559
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,802
I did it.

560
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,595
Surprise.

561
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,556
I'm the one who did it.

562
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,351
I killed your stupid kid.

563
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,063
-Oh, my God.
-What?

564
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,606
For the past three minutes,

565
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:14,109
Cayden's detonator has been emitting
a 76 GHz field.

566
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,778
-Now it's spiking.
-Okay. What does this mean?

567
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,280
It means there's something wrong
with the bomb.

568
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,119
It's a shame really. He was very cute.

569
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,037
[groans]

570
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,957
Signal's fritzing again.
Closer Cayden gets to Laurel,

571
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,458
the bigger the frequency spikes
on the detonator.

572
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,543
No, it's not the detonator.

573
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,298
Aren't you gonna ask me why I did it?

574
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,675
No.

575
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,552
I know you're lying.

576
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,890
You're not nearly as callous
as you portray yourself to be.

577
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,685
I saw, Miss Lance.

578
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,314
When I ordered you to execute
Mr. Sobel, I saw you hesitate.

579
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,110
You didn't wanna do it.

away from Cayden, right now.

with her power-dampening collar.</i>

-God, you're persistent.

for his death is in the vicinity.

I had an obligation to protect my son.

619

It's a father's job to protect your child.

But I failed.

621

I failed him, utterly.

622

All this time,

was me.

Don't you move.

I can't believe he was ready
to blow up the whole city.

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,648
Yeah.

628
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,192
He lost his boy.

629

I don't even wanna...

Yeah.

631

What you did was very dangerous.

I know and I'm sorry.

633
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,336
I am never gonna let
anything happen to you, William.

-You can't make that promise.
-I can make that promise.

638
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,765
I just did. I am. Right now.

639
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,605
Kiddo, I've been doing this a long time.

640
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,776
So trust me.

641
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,487
Okay?

642
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,656
Okay.

643
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,242
Thank you.

644
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,829
I gotta go talk to the others, all right?

645
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,165
Okay.

646
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,126
Where are we?

647
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,379
If by "we" you mean Anatoly,
Diaz and Laurel...

648
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,714
Completely in the wind.

649
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,841
-[Rene] Again?
-Again.

650
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,178
Well, Quentin's walking Cayden James
to booking right now.

651
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,805
Look, I know what you're all gonna say,

652
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,932
but I think finding Laurel
needs to be our first priority.

653
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,309
Don't make this personal, Dinah.

654
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,895
[Curtis] Or you know, more personal.

655
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,688
You heard her.

656
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,815
She is the one who had
Cayden James' son killed,

657
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,650
she was the one who set
all of this into motion.

658
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,819
-You don't know that.
-She confessed.

659
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,197
She was pushing James' buttons, D.

660
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,949
How did she manage
to blind all of you this much?

661
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,494
You're the one who's not seeing clearly,
if you ask me, Dinah.

662
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,828
I didn't.

663
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,414
Hey. Hey.

664
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,416
You're better than this.

665
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,842
-I guess we're leaving now.
-Yeah, we're leaving now.

666
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,930
Just to be clear, whatever happened
doesn't change anything.

667
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,724
Yeah, we're glad
we took down Cayden James,

668
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,018
but we're still doing our own thing.

669
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,397
Please try and keep Dinah in line.

670
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,358
No promises, hoss.

671
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,194
In case you haven't noticed,

672
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,321
we're not having a lot of luck
with that right now.

673
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,995
Well, we saved the city again
and got Cayden James.

674
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,791
Yeah. Why doesn't that feel like we won?

675
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,305
I must say this visit
is somewhat predictable.

676
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,810
Well, I needed
to look you in the eyes, Cayden.

677
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:53,234
I need to know that
this surrender of yours

678
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,988
isn't some sort of ploy.

679
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,450
I've had bad luck with that tactic.

680
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,121
You prevented me from doing
the unspeakable last night.

681
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,500
I'm sure Owen
would have been ashamed of me.

682
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,587
But then he always was.

683
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,424
These are my best guesses,

684
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,801
as to where you might find
my former allies,

685
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,263
along with the account number
to a bank in Corto Maltese

686
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,641
where I placed all the money
I embezzled from the city.

687
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,977
Thank you.

688
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,397
I would ask one thing in return,

689
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,943
permission to visit my son's grave.

690
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,822
I can arrange that.

691
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,873
Be a better father than I was, Oliver.

692
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:05,181
If this is another feeble attempt
to extract information from me,

693
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,434
I warn you, I will continue to invoke

694
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,938
my Fifth Amendment protections.

695
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,233
I'm very sorry
to have to tell you this, Mr. James,

696
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,070
but your son Owen
was found murdered last night.

697
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,158
No.

698
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,369
He's 18!

699
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,995
No!

700
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,498
[sobbing] Who would wanna hurt my boy?

701
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,124
I'm afraid we don't know.

702
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,757
I am truly very sorry, Cayden.

703
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,440
[exhales]

704
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,735
Hey.

705
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,821
What's your story, morning glory?

706
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,489
[grunts]

707
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,618
I used to say that to you
when you're a little girl, you know?

708
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,870
The other you.

709
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,373
-I already told you.
-I know what you told me.

710
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,792
What you told me was a lie.

711
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,211
[stammers] James said it.

712
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,798
You hesitated when you killed Sobel.

713
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,675
So what if I did?

714
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,094
It means there's a piece,
maybe just a small piece,

715
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:29,181
but it means that there is a piece
of my daughter in you, somewhere.

716
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,102
And I'm gonna get it out,
whatever it takes.

717
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,690
[engine starting]

718
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,819
[door unlocks]

719
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,929
Didn't think we'd end up here.

720
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,809
SCPD custody.

721
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,564
You know, I saw this playing out
in a lot of ways.

722
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,275
But I gotta tell you...

723
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,820
[chuckles]

724
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,947
I wasn't expecting this.

725
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:31,285
I assume it would be foolish to think
that this is a rescue operation.

726
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,997
You're always the smartest guy
in the room.

727
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,627
You thought you always had
everybody pegged.

728
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,214
You've put everyone in your little boxes,

729
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,426
you always understood
what they were thinking,

730
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,969
how they'd react.

731
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,930
But you're realizing now,

732
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,265
you didn't really know anything.

733
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,939
I'm afraid
I don't take your meaning, Mr. Diaz.

734
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,232
Is that so?

735
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,444
You're supposed to be the smart one.

736
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,493
You made some moves,

737
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,662
then I made some moves,

738
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,248
Queen is under indictment now.

739
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,876
His team is fractured into million pieces.

740
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,920
And this city,

741
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,548
oh, this city,

742
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,344
it's prime for a takeover.

743
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,808
You see, guys like you
never understand these things.

744
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,520
Why destroy a city

745
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,023
when you could take it over?

746
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,737
I suppose this accounts
for your presence here.

747
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,322
Hmm.

748
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:55,453
The new police captain,
she's on my payroll,

749
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,331
along with a few other city officials.

750
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,419
Arclight

751
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,298
was a big help in thinning
the herd for me.

752
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,177
I suspect you're not done
thinning the herd.

753
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,643
You were always talking about
how much you missed your son.

754
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,856
I guess you didn't know
I'm the one who had him killed.

755
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,940
[chokes]

756
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,901
[thuds]

757
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,618
Tell your boy

758
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,537
I said hello.
