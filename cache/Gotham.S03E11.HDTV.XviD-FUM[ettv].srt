1
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:03,785
- Previously on Gotham...
- My name is Volk. My brother Jacob.

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:05,216
We are called the Whisper Gang.

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:06,617
Those men were willing
to kill for this key,

4
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:08,119
- but what does it open?
- A safe.

5
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:10,821
Inside, there is a device that
we believe can destroy them.

6
00:00:10,857 --> 00:00:12,356
They call themselves

7
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,191
the Court of Owls.

8
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:16,327
Isabella was murdered.
Her brake lines were cut!

9
00:00:16,362 --> 00:00:17,361
And I know who did it.

10
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:19,597
You can stop the blade
from being released.

11
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:21,499
If you click this button, it will send

12
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,100
a fatal jolt to Butch.

13
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:24,902
Hey, Butch, you're sweet.

14
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:28,672
- You really didn't kill her?
- No!

15
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,941
- Guilty!
- The lab analyzing

16
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:33,010
Alice Tetch's blood
has developed a test.

17
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,879
- You're kidding.
- Don Falcone, please.

18
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:37,481
We'll pull your car around.

19
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,749
Carmine's not the target.

20
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,451
You are. Get down!

21
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:47,057
Why are you coming
after me?! You know why.

22
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:48,626
Why are you trying to kill my son?

23
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:51,328
We will expect your
assistance when called on.

24
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:54,899
Until then, your son is
safe... At least from us.

25
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:57,501
Why does it feel like
we keep saying good-bye?

26
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:58,644
Maybe it's all we have left.

27
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,729
Or we just haven't done it properly yet.

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,706
Bye, James Gordon.

29
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,708
She loves him, she loves him...

30
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:07,511
You lost?

31
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:11,415
She loves me...!

32
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:27,831
Hey.

33
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:48,986
I'm getting married tomorrow.

34
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,221
Congratulations.

35
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:53,557
People always talk about
love at first sight.

36
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,593
I never believed it.

37
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:59,363
But the moment I saw her, I knew.

38
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:00,831
Yeah.

39
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:03,834
So, what do you do?

40
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,536
I'm a hematologist.

41
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:06,937
At Gotham Bio-Lab.

42
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,140
You aren't working on that blood virus,

43
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:11,742
are you, from, um...

44
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:14,011
what's her name? Tetch?

45
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,847
Alice Tetch?

46
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:20,251
Uh, my fiancée is with
the police department.

47
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,119
She's the medical examiner on the case.

48
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:23,621
Oh. Yes.

49
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:24,955
She said

50
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,891
you had come up with
a test for the virus.

51
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,728
I really can't talk about it.

52
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,194
She almost married someone else.

53
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:40,271
I think her ex still hopes she'll come

54
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:42,606
running back.

55
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,642
Not gonna happen.

56
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:52,149
She loves him.

57
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:55,119
She loves him. She loves him.

58
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:56,220
Do you hear me, Jim?

59
00:02:57,223 --> 00:02:59,623
I won't let you have her!

60
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:11,569

61
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:16,974
Volk is dead?

62
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,375
We found his and Dmitry's bodies

63
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,044
early this morning.

64
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,112
They were killed Talon,
the Court's assassin.

65
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:24,281
Well, that certainly changes
things a bit, doesn't it?

66
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:27,451
How? You possess the key.
The key opens the safe.

67
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:28,819
Inside the safe is an object

68
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,454
that can bring down the Court of Owls.

69
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:31,822
None of this has changed.

70
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,329
If this assassin saw us with Volk...

71
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:39,563
That means the Court already knows

72
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,613
that you're breaking
your deal, Master Bruce.

73
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,300
I wish we knew for certain.

74
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,369
Yeah, well, I wish we knew
for certain what was in

75
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:47,371
that blinking safe or how
far we can trust this little

76
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,306
Whisper Gang front.

77
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:51,575
Ask yourself this:

78
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,845
Is bringing down the Court
really worth the risk?

79
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,853
The Court of Owls has
taken over my company,

80
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:04,855
threatened people I care about,

81
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,957
and is likely responsible
for my parents' deaths.

82
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:10,094
What's our next step?

83
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:19,570
I'm giving this one to Alvarez.

84
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:20,671
No.

85
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:22,239
I told you to take the day off.

86
00:04:22,274 --> 00:04:23,674
I know.

87
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,876
You do know I'm acting
captain now, right?

88
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:27,444
Yeah.

89
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,946
Jim, there will be another
dead body tomorrow.

90
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,515
Seriously, take the day.
Go fishing, get drunk.

91
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,016
Harvey, this is my job.

92
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:35,219
Lee getting married doesn't change that.

93
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:37,121
Take a look at this guy's head.

94
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:40,023
Whoa. What's that coming out of his ear?

95
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,192
His skull was crushed.

96
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,928
Like someone squeezed
it from either side.

97
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:47,064
Can you imagine the
strength needed to do that?

98
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,733
I got to tell you, my first thought...

99
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:50,768
- Oh, no.
- Barnes.

100
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:51,869
Stop it!

101
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:53,871
Barnes had the virus. He's at Arkham.

102
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:56,140
That story's over. This
is what I was afraid of.

103
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,409
Wallet's here, but the killer
took a badge or something

104
00:04:58,444 --> 00:04:59,810
from around his neck.

105
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,044
Your emotions are all stirred.

106
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,379
You're seeing things
that aren't really there.

107
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:05,382
This is just a classic case
of wrong place, wrong time.

108
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:06,950
One man takes another man's skull

109
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:08,385
in his bare hands and crushes it.

110
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:09,953
I see it all the time.

111
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:12,423
Receipt... from the cafeteria

112
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,391
at Gotham Bio-Lab, where
Alice Tetch's blood

113
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:15,959
is being tested.

114
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,061
- Crap.
- I'm gonna swing by.

115
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:19,263
Finish up here, will you?

116
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:22,266
Sure, Jim. Happy to oblige.

117
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:26,194
No rest for the wicked.

118
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,572
Relax.

119
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:31,074
I'm not here to get revenge

120
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,110
for you lopping off Tabby's paw.

121
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:34,678
Though I am surprised to find you

122
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:37,347
back at work and not
tracking down who really did

123
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,849
kill your lady love.

124
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,118
That's because you don't
see the full picture.

125
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,854
The mayor has many enemies.

126
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,022
These enemies understand that I am

127
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:46,423
a fundamental part of this operation.

128
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,425
They weaken me, they weaken him.

129
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:51,128
That was clearly the
intent of killing Isabella.

130
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:53,530
Also, I have spies

131
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,299
all over this city.

132
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:57,000
Soon enough, whoever killed Isabella

133
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:58,802
will reveal themselves,

134
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,205
and I will strike.

135
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,224
Poor blind baby.

136
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:09,872
It's always hardest to see
what's right under our noses.

137
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,851
Penguin!

138
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:20,280
Did you just fake cough "Penguin"?

139
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:23,193
Needless to say,

140
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,196
that is... absurd on a number of levels.

141
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:28,065
Really?

142
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,535
All a crime requires is
means, motive and opportunity.

143
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,003
And your beaky little buddy

144
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:35,706
certainly has the means and opportunity.

145
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,341
But no motive.

146
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:40,977
Oh, I would say he had the
oldest motive in the book.

147
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:43,046
"Rich men want it,

148
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:45,816
wise men know it, the
poor all need it..."

149
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:48,552
Love. What does that have to do...

150
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:55,025
And the penny... drops.

151
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,300
You are suggesting...

152
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,470
that Oswald...

153
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:08,372
is in love with me?

154
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:12,075
- That is ridiculous.
- I know. I mean,

155
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:15,012
personally, I find you a
bit of a cold fish, but...

156
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:19,016
Ozzie saw you being taken away
from him by that bookish vixen,

157
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,517
and...

158
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:26,557
Aah... oh, no!

159
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:29,960
Hmm.

160
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,129
No.

161
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:35,866
In fact, I'm beginning to wonder
what your motive is in all this.

162
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:38,435
That's for later.

163
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,003
Right now,

164
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,942
I... just want to see
justice for that poor,

165
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,910
sweet girl.

166
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,545
Ms. Kean,

167
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:51,615
I need you to understand two things.

168
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,083
One,

169
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:55,786
Oswald did not kill Isabella;

170
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:59,222
and two, he's not in love with me.

171
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,191
Are you so certain?

172
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:08,765
Don't you owe it to her to find out?

173
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,402
Let me know how it goes.

174
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,775
The Court of Owls maintains a
number of buildings in Gotham.

175
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,777
This one is rarely occupied

176
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:24,055
and always well guarded,
and there are two alarms.

177
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:25,749
The first covers points of entry.

178
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:27,985
Last week, we managed to
disarm one of the windows.

179
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,153
Once inside, the front door
can be opened using a code

180
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,555
that we possess.

181
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,091
The second alarm is in the basement.

182
00:08:34,126 --> 00:08:35,792
In the room with the safe.

183
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,495
The floor is fitted
with infrared sensors.

184
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,097
You must cross it on a rope.

185
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,367
I have trained for this.

186
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:44,501
You will give me the key you found,

187
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:45,802
and I will retrieve the object.

188
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:48,605
But you still don't know
what the object is, right?

189
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,742
Only that the Court
protects it, fears it.

190
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:54,678
And that with Talon hunting
us, we have no time.

191
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,452
Right, so...

192
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:03,754
let's go through this again.

193
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:04,855
What'd you decide?

194
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,391
We're gonna break in today.

195
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:09,026
We can't wait any longer.

196
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,196
- You okay?
- Fine.

197
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:14,965
Just hungry.

198
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,470
GCPD.

199
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,141
Guy named Ryan Pfeffer work here?

200
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:26,810
Uh, yeah.

201
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,111
It's, uh, sublevel three.

202
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:30,180
- What, he in trouble?
- He was killed last night.

203
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:32,115
I need to talk to his colleagues.

204
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,850
You guys keep track of
when key cards are used?

205
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,085
Uh, yeah.

206
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,319
All right.

207
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,488
If anybody uses his, call me.

208
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,391
Sure, but... his was
used 20 minutes ago.

209
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,027
He hasn't logged out.

210
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:45,829
Call the police. Now.

211
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:16,727
Jim, Jim.

212
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,228
You're ahead of schedule.

213
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:21,698
Our paths weren't meant
to cross just yet.

214
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,771
But I'm not gonna kill you yet.

215
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:29,206
I do that,

216
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,741
you become the martyr,

217
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:33,243
and she'll carry you
in her heart forever.

218
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:35,445
No. Before I kill you,

219
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:38,582
she has to hate you.

220
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:39,916
And she will.

221
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:45,956
Come find me, Jim.

222
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:55,552
So you didn't get a look
at the guy, and he's not

223
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,637
on the cameras. We might get
something off the prints, but...

224
00:10:57,674 --> 00:11:00,809
Doubtful, if he was smart enough
to avoid the cameras. I'm good.

225
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:02,577
He seems to have been
interested in the research

226
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:04,079
into Alice Tetch's blood.

227
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,748
Pfeffer's office was ransacked,
and the files were missing.

228
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:09,417
So someone else is infected with
the virus? That's just great.

229
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:10,518
It isn't you, is it?

230
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:12,654
Because that sure
would make things easy.

231
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:15,601
No, it's not me. What's
that on your hand?

232
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:17,425
"Arkham."

233
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,227
I didn't write it.

234
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,428
Okay, let's all just calm down.

235
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,697
So the virus-infected
killer wrote on your hand.

236
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,933
He wants you to go to Arkham.

237
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,067
Barnes is in Arkham.

238
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,335
No.

239
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,937
It's not about Barnes.

240
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,274
- Jim, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

241
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:41,283
Hello, Jervis.

242
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:43,151
James.

243
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,186
What an unexpected pleasure.

244
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,225
Someone else is infected
with your sister's blood.

245
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,626
You don't say.

246
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:54,562
And I've been thinking it's possible

247
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:56,464
she infected them accidentally.

248
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,201
Yes, possible. Possible.

249
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:03,138
But your reaction tells
me you knew. So...

250
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,140
you infected them after you stole

251
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:09,086
your sister's blood,
but you stayed quiet,

252
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:11,332
waiting for them to show symptoms.

253
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,050
Well, that would be darn
sneaky of me, wouldn't it?

254
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,418
I need the name.

255
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,652
Oh.

256
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:21,523
You need the name.

257
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:24,526
So... I've been quiet
about it all this time,

258
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:28,730
and now I'm going to help you
because we're such good friends?

259
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:31,833
Because I can make your life
here very uncomfortable.

260
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:34,235
More uncomfortable than having
Captain Barnes next door

261
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:37,301
screaming "Guilty!"
all hours of the night?

262
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:38,673
Give me the name!

263
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,508
Oh, James,

264
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:44,346
I would love to see what
Alice's virus would do to you.

265
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:47,782
The beast in you is right there.

266
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:49,884
So desperate to get out.

267
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,756
And I know of whom you speak.

268
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,825
Oh, yes, indeed.

269
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,828
I stabbed him and pricked
him and caused him to bleed.

270
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,530
But nothing you can say,
no words you might possess,

271
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,766
can pry from me the smallest guess,

272
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,502
for this game is my game!

273
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,437
I say when it's done.

274
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:12,574
And right now I'm having too much fun.

275
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:16,611
You want to play a game, Jervis?

276
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:19,180
Fine. Let's play a game.

277
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,284
Whoever you infected...

278
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,287
has some sort of plan.

279
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:29,441
I want you to tell me
the name of this man.

280
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,527
Wow, James, I...

281
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,663
have to give that effort an "F."

282
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,565
And can you really imagine that...

283
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,534
Two are dead.

284
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,336
More may die soon.

285
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,905
This isn't a game. Give me his name.

286
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,807
You will only know his
name when it's too late!

287
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,876
When the one you love has
been murdered by hate!

288
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:51,079
Guard! Take me to my cell!

289
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:52,881
- What do you mean the one that I love?
- Guard!

290
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,149
Give me his name, Tetch.

291
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,984
Give me his name or
you'll share the blame!

292
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,552
Nothing! Nothing! I'll tell you naught!

293
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,020
His name shall be neither
spoken nor taught.

294
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,055
He'll cut and he'll crush

295
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,356
and the blood will run thick.

296
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:03,591
Though from healer to
killer is no easy trick.

297
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:07,762
"Healer to killer."

298
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:10,131
He's a doctor.

299
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:11,699
My God.

300
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:12,901
You'll never stop him, James.

301
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,803
He'll kill and he'll kill

302
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:16,171
- and he'll kill!
- This is Gordon.

303
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,039
Give me Dr. Mario Calvi immediately.

304
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,441
On my damn authority!

305
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:22,110
Just do it!

306
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:36,091
I take it you're off?

307
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:40,428
When we were casing that place,

308
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,464
I got a feeling we were being watched.

309
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,867
And if this Court of
Owls is all you say,

310
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,736
they're not gonna be too cool
with Bruce breaking their deal.

311
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,306
That's very true.

312
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,908
And Master Bruce knows the Court

313
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:56,478
will catch up with him sooner or later.

314
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,246
And if he has the
opportunity to take them out,

315
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,247
then he'll take them out.

316
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:00,548
That's a big if.

317
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,217
Especially when your stupid job

318
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,485
is supposed to be protecting him.

319
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,254
My stupid job, miss, is to
make sure that he grows up

320
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,990
to be the man he's meant to be.

321
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:11,559
Still...

322
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,328
kind of a punk move for him

323
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:15,930
to make a deal with the
people who killed his parents.

324
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,198
Yeah, well, you understand this, then.

325
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:20,468
He only did what he did

326
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,537
to protect the people he cares about.

327
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:24,572
For you.

328
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,443
And it cost him dearly.

329
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:37,252
Are you serious? Arresting
Don Falcone's son

330
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,420
- on his wedding day?
- I had no choice.

331
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:40,455
He's got the virus.

332
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,923
Do you really think Lee Thompkins...

333
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,358
Dr. Lee Thompkins...

334
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:45,293
Wouldn't know if her own
fiancé had the virus?

335
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:47,762
How long did Barnes have it and hide it?

336
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:49,931
Tetch must have infected him
that night in the hospital

337
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,499
when he dosed me; it
would explain things.

338
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,534
Like what?

339
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,536
Mario hitting me at
the engagement party.

340
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,437
You know what also would explain that?

341
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:58,806
You telling Tetch to shoot his fiancée.

342
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,008
You should've seen his face

343
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,643
when those assassins
attacked us... his rage.

344
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,044
He was being attacked by assassins!

345
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,646
What was I supposed to do, Harvey,

346
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,648
wait until he kills
again, till he hurts Lee?

347
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:09,050
You were supposed to wait
until you had enough proof.

348
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,286
And why would Tetch infect
Mario in the first place?

349
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,121
To hurt me.

350
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:14,489
Okay, let's say you're right.

351
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:16,357
Let's say that Mario is infected.

352
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,327
So he crushes some guy's
skull, he breaks into the lab,

353
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,697
he attacks you, and then he
writes "Arkham" on your hand?

354
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,700
Why would he want you to find him?

355
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,335
I don't know.

356
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,039
He doesn't have the virus.

357
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,907
What? No, no, no, no. Run it again.

358
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:33,908
I ran it three times.

359
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:35,243
He's clean.

360
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,011
I could've told you that.

361
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:38,413
But, hey, I'm glad it's official.

362
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:40,848
Dr. Calvi, on behalf of the GCPD,

363
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:43,251
I just want to apologize for any...

364
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,853
inconvenience or embarrassment
this may have caused you.

365
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,155
No need.

366
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,990
Living with Lee, I
understand the pressures

367
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,092
you're all under. But
if you'll excuse me,

368
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:52,860
I have a wedding to attend.

369
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:55,263
Jim, I understand

370
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:59,033
this is a tough day for you,
but... no hard feelings.

371
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,169
The test. That's why
you broke into the lab.

372
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,737
To find out how to beat it.

373
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,038
- But why?
- Jim...

374
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:05,607
I know you have the virus.

375
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:06,741
I'm gonna prove it.

376
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,776
And I promise, you will never marry Lee.

377
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:15,971
But she didn't say anything?

378
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:19,042
She said she thought
we were being watched.

379
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:22,079
Personally, I think sh-she's
just got the jitters.

380
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,704
She can't still be mad I told
Ivy she was my girlfriend.

381
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,239
Oh.

382
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:28,607
It just slipped out.

383
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:30,175
She can call herself whatever she wants.

384
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,877
Fascinating as I find this tale of young

385
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:33,278
unrequited love is, Master Bruce,

386
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:36,815
please can we just concentrate
on the task at hand?

387
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,216
Do you have the key?

388
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,585
Excellent.

389
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,654
Alfred, you know when we get this thing,

390
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,122
whatever it is...

391
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:46,358
the Whispers are gonna
try to take it from us.

392
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:49,461
Well, to be honest, Master Bruce,

393
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,229
it's not the Whispers I'm worried about.

394
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:10,816
And have we made any headway

395
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,117
on the waterfront negotiations?

396
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,219
I have spoken with the union leader.

397
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,620
He agreed to our offer.

398
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:18,390
So those photos can
go back in the vault.

399
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,492
They were quite saucy, weren't they?

400
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:21,994
And how about the...

401
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,730
Your approval for the new casino
should come through tomorrow.

402
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:26,665
Demolition can begin right away.

403
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,334
Ed, I cannot tell you
how good it is to see you

404
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,736
back to your old self.

405
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:34,239
Just one last signature.

406
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,379
This is your resignation.

407
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:43,548
Isabella's death has altered things,

408
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,250
and I can't continue... No!

409
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:47,444
Ed, I will not let you leave.

410
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,557
It is not in your best interest.

411
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:54,526
You have to stay busy.

412
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:00,198
How can I say this? Um...

413
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,702
We're friends.

414
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,439
Aren't we, Oswald?

415
00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:09,608
Of course!

416
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:12,210
Since the accident...

417
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:15,380
And-and I never thought
that this could happen...

418
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,018
I've had the desire to

419
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,921
become more than employer-employee.

420
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:26,725
More than friends.

421
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:32,898
I have been feeling the same.

422
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,233
I didn't want to mention it,

423
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,602
because of all the
awfulness about Isabelle.

424
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,371
Isabella!

425
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:40,572
But...

426
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,911
one cannot deny love.

427
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:50,816
Wh-What is it? Wh-What's wrong?

428
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:55,120
There...

429
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,922
there's been a misunderstanding.

430
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:59,157
I was going to...

431
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:02,094
propose that we become partners.

432
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,297
Business partners.

433
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:08,467
Partners?

434
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:09,801
Then...

435
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:11,603
Excuse me.

436
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:20,779
Lee? You here? It's Jim!

437
00:20:20,814 --> 00:20:22,414
Hello, Jim.

438
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:24,616
I saw you left Lee a message.

439
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:27,452
I, uh, accidentally took
her phone this morning.

440
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:29,921
She's not here, by the way.

441
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:30,989
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

442
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:33,492
How'd you pass the test?

443
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:38,430
Because I don't have the virus.

444
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:40,332
Or do I?

445
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:45,537
You gonna arrest me, Jim?

446
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:48,206
Do you want to look even more
like the paranoid ex-lover?

447
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:50,609
I'll only pass the test again.

448
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,210
We'll find out how you beat it.

449
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,157
Only a matter of time.

450
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:56,715
Let's say I do have tirus

451
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,150
How would I have gotten it?

452
00:20:58,185 --> 00:20:59,618
From Tet.

453
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:05,557
Dr. Calvi, I'd like
you to meet my sister,

454
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:06,992
Alice.

455
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,194
With Barnes...

456
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:12,564
the virus stoked his
anger at the guilty.

457
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,799
What dark part of me
has it brought to life?

458
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:17,235
Jealousy.

459
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:19,404
You're afraid of losing Lee.

460
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,773
If that's true...

461
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:25,410
that means the woman we
both know you still love

462
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:29,748
is gonna marry a lunatic
who'll do anything to keep her.

463
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:32,050
Are you sure you don't want that drink?

464
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:34,152
What I want to know is why you put me

465
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:35,554
on your trail.

466
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:37,155
What are you after?

467
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:38,823
Let me give you a hint.

468
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:41,760
You see, what keeps me up at night

469
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:45,096
is not the thought that you love her.

470
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,898
It's the thought...

471
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:49,301
that a part of her still loves you.

472
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,471
Well, in that case, let's find her.

473
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:56,007
Let her decide if she's gonna marry you.

474
00:21:57,711 --> 00:22:00,145
Yeah, I don't think so.

475
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:06,151
Virus made you strong, not bulletproof.

476
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,385
Let's go.

477
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:08,820
You know what, Jim, with
all this virus talk,

478
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:10,388
you keep forgetting one thing.

479
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:13,391
I'm still Carmine Falcone's son.

480
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:16,453
You know Victor.

481
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,532
Hi-ho.

482
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,312
Victor, were you listening to him?

483
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,095
He has the same virus as Barnes had.

484
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:32,463
What's that?

485
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:34,932
Oh, no. I wasn't listening.

486
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:36,634
- You have to let me go.
- Uh-huh.

487
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:39,470
- Does Falcone know you're here?
- Wait.

488
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:41,906
Wait.

489
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,844
You're free to go, Jim.

490
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:50,748
I'll keep this.

491
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:53,518
I don't understand.

492
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:54,852
I was only supposed to keep you

493
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:57,655
until the big hand was on
nine and the little hand...

494
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,257
My mag... now.

495
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,660
Sorry, Jim. But, hey, give
the bride a kiss for me.

496
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:06,164
I asked.

497
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:12,804
And it is with great pleasure

498
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,873
that I present this
award to Mr. Kyle Davis

499
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,010
for his magnificent book,

500
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,879
an Oral History.

501
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:24,482
Looks just fascinating.

502
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:27,485
Thank you.

503
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,153
Oh, you're too kind.

504
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:31,222
I love sewers.

505
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,939
Ed.

506
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:50,441
I was worried when you ran off

507
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:52,777
that I might have upset you.

508
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:57,081
Can't we just pretend
that nothing happened?

509
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:59,116
Go back to the way things were?

510
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,992
You are the best friend I've ever had.

511
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:10,127
I don't want to lose you.

512
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:13,764
Please?

513
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:18,669
You're my best friend as well, Oswald.

514
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:23,608
Remember that.

515
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,860
Jim, what are you doing here?

516
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,373
Are you okay?

517
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:46,264
Where's Mario?

518
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,138
He's out at the church.
We're about to get married.

519
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:51,402
You can't marry him.

520
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:53,504
Oh, my God.

521
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,440
- Just give us a minute.
- Yeah.

522
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:06,717
Listen to me,

523
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:08,486
and I know how this is gonna sound...

524
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:11,255
You think that he has
Alice Tetch's virus.

525
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,624
- He told you.
- Yes.

526
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,826
And he told me that you
had him arrested today,

527
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,528
on our wedding day.

528
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:20,264
And you had Lucius give him the
test three times, and he passed.

529
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,365
What's wrong with you?

530
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,534
He cheated the test, Lee.

531
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,136
I don't know how, but he did.

532
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:27,405
Tetch infected him that
night in the hospital.

533
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,940
You went to see Tetch, didn't you?

534
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:30,474
- Yes.
- Jim,

535
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,676
don't you see?

536
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:33,644
Tetch is planting ideas in your head.

537
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,779
- No.
- Don't you remember?

538
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:35,680
He's done this before.

539
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:37,181
No, this isn't like that.

540
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,884
Okay, what is more likely,
that Tetch is planting ideas

541
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,086
in your head to screw
with you or that Mario

542
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:43,421
has Alice's virus?

543
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:45,589
Lee, you cannot marry him!

544
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:49,961
Mario said that you would
never let us be happy.

545
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:52,863
I thought he was
overreacting, but he's right.

546
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:57,068
Tetch or not, you are obsessed.

547
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:58,602
Let it go.

548
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:02,173
This is what he wanted.

549
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,841
- What are you talking about?
- This.

550
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,410
Me coming here.

551
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:08,379
That's why he put me on his trail.

552
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:12,683
He got the test so he could
find out how to beat it.

553
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:16,787
He had me arrest him so
I'd look like a jealous ex.

554
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:20,057
That's why Zsasz let me
go, so I'd race here...

555
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,494
finally push you away.

556
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:25,229
Oh, Jim.

557
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,298
I say this as someone

558
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,700
who cares about you.

559
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:31,969
Get help.

560
00:26:37,477 --> 00:26:39,677
I love you.

561
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,917
I love you.

562
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,185
I've never stopped.

563
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:52,256
I should've come to see you as
soon as I got out of prison,

564
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,325
but I couldn't.

565
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,860
I was ashamed.

566
00:26:57,096 --> 00:26:59,663
I thought I had to set things right.

567
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:01,766
But I did finally come,

568
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,200
Lee.

569
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:07,171
I saw you,

570
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:10,241
through the window, with him.

571
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,243
You were smiling.

572
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:13,778
You looked happy.

573
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,716
I couldn't bring myself to go in.

574
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:22,186
I've regretted it every day since.

575
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:24,221
Please.

576
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,093
Don't marry him.

577
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,136
After the wedding...

578
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,274
Mario and I are leaving Gotham.

579
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:46,410
I'll never see you again.

580
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,946
- Lee...
- Damn you...

581
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:52,750
for telling me this now.

582
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:54,985
You come in here with
these crazy accusations,

583
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,321
and when I don't believe
you, you pull this?

584
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:00,591
How dare you?!

585
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,430
Don't you see?

586
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:09,733
- He wants you to hate me.
- Well, he succeeded.

587
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:12,470
- Get the hell out of here!
- No!

588
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:13,771
Fine.

589
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:15,924
Carmine.

590
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,610
Can you please help Detective
Gordon find the exit?

591
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:21,445
Certainly.

592
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:25,516
And if you're ready, my dear.

593
00:28:27,787 --> 00:28:29,787
I am.

594
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:20,671
Do you, Leslie,

595
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:21,972
take Mario to be your husband?

596
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,741
I do.

597
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:29,213
And do you,

598
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:31,515
Mario, take Leslie to be your wife?

599
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:33,417
I do.

600
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:38,155
I now pronounce you

601
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:39,857
husband and wife.

602
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,592
You may kiss the bride.

603
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,584
Ladies and gentlemen,

604
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,385
Mr. and Mrs. Calvi.

605
00:30:34,887 --> 00:30:36,086
Well, I think it's safe to admit

606
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:39,023
that our foreign friends
are no-show, Master Bruce.

607
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:40,891
It was a right dodgy plan, anyway.

608
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:42,293
Where are you going?

609
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:43,594
That would be home.

610
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:46,297
Alfred, this is our only
shot to take down the Court.

611
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:47,598
You don't know that, do you?

612
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:49,200
I mean, it was a moot point, anyway.

613
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:50,734
I mean, walking across the
entire length of a room

614
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,735
on a bloody tightrope?

615
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:53,537
I can do it. I... I did it.

616
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:55,973
Yeah, three times out of 20. I counted.

617
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:56,974
No, thank you very much.

618
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:58,609
I can do it.

619
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:02,012
Oh, that's bloody marvelous, isn't it?

620
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:03,113
Hey?

621
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:07,718
Right.

622
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,987
you stay on comms

623
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:11,422
at all times.

624
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:14,625
If I order abort, you
abort. Is that clear?

625
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,227
I need my head examined.

626
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:17,528
Really do.

627
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:22,666
What?

628
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,802
Just wondering.

629
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:28,572
Does this mean you are my girlfriend?

630
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:31,108
Shut up.

631
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:41,452
So, I thought, if I were Mario,

632
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:42,753
how would I beat the test?

633
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:44,355
Well, the test looks for
this one marker in the blood,

634
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,757
but that marker can be
masked by an abundance

635
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:47,791
of certain other drugs.

636
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:49,293
The two most easily available,

637
00:31:49,328 --> 00:31:50,494
Cloracinamine and...

638
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,296
Lucius, just-just get to the point.

639
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:55,199
Mario's blood came back off
the charts for Cloracinamine.

640
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:57,568
Alvarez!

641
00:31:57,603 --> 00:31:59,904
Get a unit on Lee Thompkins
and Dr. Mario Calvi,

642
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:01,639
and don't let them out of your sight!

643
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:02,940
This isn't proof that Mario

644
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:04,041
killed those men.

645
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:06,377
No, but it's enough
for a search warrant.

646
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:08,145
Now I got to go find Jim Gordon.

647
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,448
Don't mess with Falcone!

648
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:40,945
Hey.

649
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:12,009
All right, straight to the safe room.

650
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:13,510
I'm gonna check the rest of the house.

651
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:15,379
Go on. This way.

652
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,591
Not exactly hiding it.

653
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:28,892
There's no point.

654
00:33:28,928 --> 00:33:30,661
The floor is alarmed.

655
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,478
Don't... let... go.

656
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:21,238
Come on!

657
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:28,078
Out the way you came!

658
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:34,419
- Let's go!
- No!

659
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:41,593
No!

660
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:17,127
We have to leave.

661
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:18,695
And who exactly are you?

662
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:20,030
You're the one who's been

663
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:21,331
following us.

664
00:36:27,673 --> 00:36:29,540
Hey.

665
00:36:31,243 --> 00:36:33,610
You know her?

666
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:36,013
That's my mom.

667
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,750
Now can we get out of here?

668
00:36:39,785 --> 00:36:41,285
You're bloody right.

669
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:52,860
Found it! In his trash.

670
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:53,888
Cloracinamine.

671
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:56,524
Oh, yes.

672
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,592
We got him.

673
00:36:57,627 --> 00:36:58,593
Tell Alvarez.

674
00:36:58,628 --> 00:37:00,061
That was Alvarez.

675
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:02,063
Lee and Mario snuck
out of the reception.

676
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,765
He lost them.

677
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,741
I can't even hold a knife.

678
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:14,609
I swear, when I see Nygma...

679
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:16,911
We'll kill him together. Real slow.

680
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,713
How sweet.

681
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:26,489
Son of a bitch!

682
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,623
Hear him out.

683
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:30,058
Please.

684
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:43,872
I don't want to kill him.

685
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:51,679
I want to destroy him.

686
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:54,749
I want to take...

687
00:37:54,785 --> 00:37:56,818
away...

688
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,787
everything that he loves.

689
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,024
I want to make him...

690
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:04,526
despised.

691
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,027
What are you talking about?

692
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,228
Penguin.

693
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,334
- He killed the librarian.
- What?

694
00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:16,004
And you cut off my hand?!

695
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,906
I assume you want something.

696
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:19,707
With Penguin gone,

697
00:38:19,743 --> 00:38:21,576
the underworld will need a new leader.

698
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,581
I think it's time Gotham
had a woman's touch.

699
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:28,416
The crime families
will never follow you.

700
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:29,717
Well, that's where you come in.

701
00:38:29,753 --> 00:38:31,886
You know the families in and out.

702
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:33,655
Not to mention, you're a whiz

703
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,657
at strategy.

704
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:39,027
Think about it, Ed.

705
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:42,897
Your brains, their brawn,

706
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:45,533
my...

707
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:47,101
me.

708
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:49,170
We could make quite a team.

709
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:55,910
We destroy Penguin first.

710
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:58,213
Of course.

711
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:00,715
But there is one thing you need to do.

712
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,922
Okay.

713
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:16,397
I'm sorry about your hand.

714
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:17,866
Apology not accepted!

715
00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:20,068
Well, we'll work on that.

716
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:21,103
Drinks!

717
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:49,063
Hey.

718
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:54,035
Thank you.

719
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,771
Thank you for letting us
leave that party early.

720
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:57,939
Hmm, of course.

721
00:39:57,974 --> 00:39:59,274
I wanted to.

722
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,742
I love this house.

723
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:02,210
It's my father's refuge.

724
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:04,512
Not many people know about it.

725
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:08,950
I know Gordon came to the church.

726
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,852
Talked to you.

727
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,553
It was just like you said.

728
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:14,022
He said you had the virus.

729
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:15,390
He was obsessed.

730
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:19,127
And what did you say?

731
00:40:19,162 --> 00:40:22,030
That after the wedding, we
would be leaving Gotham.

732
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:23,698
That I would never see him again.

733
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:26,301
Is that it?

734
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,535
What are you asking me?

735
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,705
I'm asking...

736
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,542
if there's any part
of you, however small,

737
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:37,245
that still has feelings for him.

738
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,713
And I swear,

739
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:41,416
I will never ask you again.

740
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:45,787
A part of me will always care for him.

741
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:50,024
But I married you.

742
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,993
I love you.

743
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:01,602
That's all I needed to know.

744
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:10,244
Where are they?

745
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,479
Don Falcone, he just...

746
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:12,780
Where are they?!

747
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:15,984
You don't give up, do you?

748
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:18,152
Your son has Alice Tetch's virus.

749
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:19,854
He's killed two people we know of.

750
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:21,789
Every cop in this city is after him.

751
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:22,991
Where is he?

752
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:31,532
You knew?

753
00:41:31,568 --> 00:41:34,235
That Mario had the same virus as Barnes?

754
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,436
No.

755
00:41:35,472 --> 00:41:37,672
I knew he was in danger,
but I didn't know why.

756
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:40,842
I never suspected this.

757
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:43,611
You're saying the attacks
on Mario... the car bomb...

758
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:45,013
It's because of the virus?

759
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:48,016
How is that possible?
Who knew he had it?

760
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:49,250
I can't tell you that.

761
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:54,251
I'll send my men to bring Mario in.

762
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:57,959
You think I'd trust Lee's
life with these two goons?

763
00:41:57,994 --> 00:41:59,994
Tell me where they are.

764
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,763
If I do that, you'll kill him.

765
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:02,964
I know you, James.

766
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,900
Mario is my son.

767
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:09,570
There is nothing and no
one more valuable to me.

768
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:12,740
And if he does have this
sickness, he needs help.

769
00:42:12,776 --> 00:42:14,208
And if he kills Lee, he'll cross a line

770
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:15,576
he'll never come back from.

771
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:19,881
Even if he's cured, knowing
that will destroy him.

772
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,449
I'm your only hope.

773
00:42:23,353 --> 00:42:25,453
Still, I'll send my men.

774
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:26,521
You mean these two?

775
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,527
Anyone else you want to send?

776
00:42:33,696 --> 00:42:35,997
Swear that you'll brg him in alive.

777
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:37,598
I swear.

778
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:39,067
Now, where are they?

779
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,274
She loves him.

780
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:47,508
Loves him!

781
00:42:47,544 --> 00:42:49,410
She loves him. Loves him.

782
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:52,113
She loves him. She loves him.

783
00:42:52,148 --> 00:42:53,581
She loves him. Loves him.

784
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:55,516
She loves him. She loves him.

785
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:03,424
She loves him.

786
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,359
She loves him. Loves him.

787
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:07,261
She loves him. She loves him.

788
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:08,496
Lee!

789
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:10,398
Jim?
