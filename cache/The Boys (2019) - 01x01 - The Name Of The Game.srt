1
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:20,191
Yo, I am so psyched
for Invisible Force 2.

2
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:22,886
Please. Invisible Force 1 was lame.

3
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:24,496
I'm all about Rising Tide.

4
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:26,832
Rising Tide? The Deep?

5
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:28,842
- Uh-huh.
- Translucent could kick the Deep's ass.

6
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:30,394
How? He's invisible.

7
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,004
That's, like, all he's got. That's it.

8
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:34,256
Exactly. He sneaks up on the Deep,

9
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,008
and then boom, motherfucker!

10
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,689
- Sit down.
- Until the Deep makes a shark

11
00:00:37,718 --> 00:00:39,594
bite Translucent's dick off.

12
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,596
How's he gonna find his
dick? It's invisible.

13
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,748
Holy shit.

14
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:00,032
Benjy!

15
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:08,925
Get up. Get up, get up, get up.

16
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,784
Come on, Benjy. Come on, come on.

17
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,574
Stay back.

18
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:44,117
Just stay the fuck back.

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,522
What are you smiling at?

20
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:09,351
Homelander?

21
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:12,062
You boys okay?

22
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:17,234
Can I... can I get a selfie?

23
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,653
'Course you can.

24
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,615
The Seven's Queen Maeve and Homelander

25
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,325
made another heroic save today,

26
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,769
stopping a hijacked armored truck

27
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:28,129
on the streets of Brooklyn,

28
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,704
then staying behind for a photo op

29
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:31,182
- with some very lucky fans.
- Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:32,791
- Jean?
- Thanks, Jennifer. And now...

31
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,417
So, this is pretty much

32
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,529
everything in one. Bluetooth speakers.

33
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:38,939
It's in stereo, so you can put it

34
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:40,525
all around your living
room, have some fun with it.

35
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,425
You said you have a
standard cable box, right?

36
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,181
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, then I need to get you

37
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,680
an audio transmitter, aptX Low Latency.

38
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,348
It makes it so there's less audio lag,

39
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,100
and it's got a standard optical in.

40
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:52,853
And let's hook you up
with thousand-meg HDMI.

41
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:53,979
Let's go with this one.

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,564
Uh, it costs a little bit more,

43
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:57,315
but the carbon's way more conductive.

44
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,998
Hey, Gary. Um...

45
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,017
- I really need to talk to you about something.
- Later, kid.

46
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,877
Okay. Cool.

47
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:20,046
Later... you want, like...
want, like, 30-30 minutes?

48
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,506
Like, a solid 45?

49
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,262
Excuse me, sir?

50
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,723
Hi. I'd like to make an appointment

51
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:31,766
for you to come over and...

52
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:34,603
lay some cable.

53
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:37,439
Okay. Uh... oh, Robin.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,107
Oh, dear, dear, Robin.

55
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:42,360
Um, that doesn't mean
what you think it means.

56
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,280
Um, "laying cable" means sex.

57
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:47,199
No, "laying pipe" means sex.

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,575
"Laying cable" means

59
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:50,327
you want me to come over to your house

60
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,013
and just take a big, old shit.

61
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:54,080
- That's disgusting.
- Well, okay.

62
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,516
But you... Who-who said it, though?

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,043
Okay. Are you ready?
Despite your best efforts,

64
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,128
I'm actually still hungry.

65
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,464
I'm actually more hungry now.

66
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:05,926
- Where are we gonna go after all this hot talk?
- I don't know.

67
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,361
- You know?
- More importantly, where are we gonna go

68
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,095
to lay some cable afterwards?

69
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:10,430
Geez.

70
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,098
So, did you ask him?

71
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,643
- Who?
- Gary.

72
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:17,854
Did you ask Gary for the raise?

73
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,898
Yeah. Yeah. It was... it was a...

74
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,317
Look, it was a crazy day,
and-and he was super busy,

75
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,028
but tomorrow for sure. Yes.

76
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,030
Okay.

77
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,616
What was I supposed to
do, kick his door down?

78
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,618
Like Homelander?

79
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,994
I said "okay".

80
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:34,579
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

81
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,206
Hey, I see the look.

82
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:38,124
I see it. Come on.

83
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,380
This is like when we started dating.

84
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,840
I don't think that's...
I don't think that's true.

85
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:48,260
Dude, I had to ask you out.

86
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,679
Well, excuse me for waiting.

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,555
You ever hear of chivalry?

88
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:55,517
Listen, this is about you
getting what you deserve.

89
00:04:55,558 --> 00:04:57,227
I'm killing myself at school

90
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:00,438
because I think it's gonna
be worth it for both of us.

91
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,233
You know, if we move in together.

92
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:05,235
Wait, what? What?
W-W-Wait. Hey, hey, hey.

93
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:06,528
Hey, hey. What was that?

94
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:08,488
What'd you just say?

95
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,323
Well, I mean, we can't
keep, you know, laying pipe

96
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,076
at your dad's place.

97
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:14,744
Trying to be all quiet.

98
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,580
Staring up at that
dumb Billy Joel post...

99
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:26,047
- ... poster.
- Hey.

100
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,301
Don't you ever besmirch Billy Jo...

101
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,378
I can't stop. I can't stop.
I can't stop. I can't stop.

102
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,714
Can't stop. Can't stop.

103
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,761
Robin?

104
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,267
Robin?

105
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:23,313
Robin!

106
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,867
Robin!

107
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,917
♪ You lying so low into the weeds ♪

108
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:48,213
♪ I bet you gonna ambush me ♪

109
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,965
♪ You'd have me down, down, down ♪

110
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,927
♪ Down on my knees... ♪

111
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:56,388
Let the energy go through the wall.

112
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,273
I am Starlight.

113
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:10,443
I'm 110 pounds, and I'm five foot six.

114
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,487
Turn around, please.

115
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:21,162
Okay. Let's see it, dear.

116
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:23,998
- You should look away.
- Sorry?

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,667
You should turn away from the camera,

118
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,837
and you should close your
eyes, or else I'll blind you.

119
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:30,755
All right.

120
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:32,799
Okay, go ahead.

121
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,435
I am so sorry.

122
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:45,728
Are you all right?

123
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:50,066
I was born Super-Abled.

124
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:52,444
Uh, my mom was thrilled.

125
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:56,364
She took me to all the
little miss hero pageants,

126
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:57,991
but I hated it.

127
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:00,410
Ugh, I mean, I can still...

128
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:03,037
smell the hairspray.

129
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,374
Uh, but...

130
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,879
... at the Q and A, they always
asked me what my wish was,

131
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,216
and I always said, "to save the world."

132
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:18,136
And the judges just chuckled

133
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,472
like it was cute.

134
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:24,517
But it wasn't a joke to me.

135
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:30,523
Since when did "hopeful" and "naive"

136
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,859
become the same thing?

137
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,653
I mean, why would you
get into this business

138
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:38,615
if not to save the world?

139
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:42,327
That's all I have ever wanted.

140
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:48,082
And that's why I've always wanted

141
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:51,252
to be in The Seven.

142
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,641
Thanks, Jennifer.

143
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:07,352
Thought Robin's service was nice.

144
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,438
Did you see how many people came?

145
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,482
Wow.

146
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,527
Lot of respect for that girl.

147
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:18,029
Lot of love in the room.

148
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:20,698
And the spread. What a spread.

149
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,242
Just really nice.

150
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:25,161
That does not begin to convey

151
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:26,579
the terrible regret...

152
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:27,932
Aw, geez. Maybe there's a movie on.

153
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:29,350
- No, keep it.
- No, we can switch it.

154
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:31,000
Keep it.

155
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,753
... awful, tragic loss.

156
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:38,174
My deepest condolences
to Robin Ward's family.

157
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:40,969
I was chasing these bank robbers.

158
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,596
She just stepped in the
middle of the street,

159
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:45,765
and I-I couldn't...

160
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,225
Middle of the...

161
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,811
She was a half step
off the fucking curb.

162
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:51,145
Oh, now, come on, Hughie.

163
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:52,981
Just, uh, don't get upset, okay? Just...

164
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:54,774
He knows.

165
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,335
... swift, thoughtful attention...

166
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:01,864
Now I think that A-Train
would like to get back to work.

167
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:03,616
Everyone at Vought is just...

168
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,828
just wrecked about Robin.

169
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:10,873
Now, you two weren't married, and look,

170
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:13,668
technically, there's no legal claim.

171
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,961
But...

172
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:17,505
Vought wants to do the right thing:

173
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:20,883
offer you $45,000 in restitution.

174
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:24,262
All you have to do is sign

175
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,471
right here,

176
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:27,515
and I'll offer you the check.

177
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,520
This is a confidentiality agreement.

178
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,397
It's a boilerplate NDA.

179
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:37,400
I sign this, and...

180
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:40,194
I can't talk about it?

181
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,196
Have to pretend like it didn't happen,

182
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:45,366
like I wasn't holding
Robin's arms in my hands?

183
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,327
Look, I know you're upset,

184
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:49,329
but we're just trying to help.

185
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,831
Then say you're sorry.

186
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:53,291
Excuse me?

187
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,960
I mean, you people say "our condolences"

188
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:58,004
and "my sympathies" and "our regrets",

189
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,048
but nobody can look
me in the fucking eye

190
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,884
and say "I'm sorry."

191
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:06,179
I'm not signing anything. Get out.

192
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,932
I said get the hell out!

193
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,898
You okay?

194
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:22,987
As I said, boilerplate NDA, really.

195
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,989
Pretty standard stuff.

196
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,659
Can I think about it?

197
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:32,914
If you have any questions at all,

198
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,749
just, uh...

199
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,676
Unit 44, code 20.

200
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,720
Address is 1420 63rd Street...

201
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,723
Any maniacs out there?

202
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,433
Mm-mm. Quiet night.

203
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:53,976
Like every night.

204
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,853
That's too bad.

205
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,898
We could really use the press right now.

206
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,151
Oh, Annie.

207
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:04,112
I'm hungry.

208
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,114
Don't worry. I didn't get the job.

209
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:08,449
You don't know that.

210
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:11,452
They're auditioning girls nationwide.

211
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:13,162
Besides, Countess probably got it.

212
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:15,164
She's so good in a room.

213
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:18,251
If you're negative, negative
things happen to you.

214
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:21,045
Hello?

215
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:24,048
Yes, I'm her mother.

216
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,759
Uh, yes. Uh...

217
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,386
uh, one moment.

218
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,012
It's them.

219
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,264
It's them.

220
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:32,515
Hello?

221
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:35,518
Yes, this is she.

222
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,064
I got it?

223
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,607
You got it!

224
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:42,650
You got it!

225
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,569
Shh.

226
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,280
Oh, my God.

227
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,906
Uh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

228
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,867
It's a weird connection.

229
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:52,386
I don't know what that was, actually.

230
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,579
Uh... Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,373
Oh, shit.

232
00:12:57,415 --> 00:12:58,583
Yeah?

233
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:00,251
I think she was an addict.

234
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:01,627
Needle tracks?

235
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,963
12 marks on one arm.

236
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:05,631
More dope coming in.

237
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:07,759
More pushers at work.

238
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,510
What you doing?

239
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:10,970
Can't file a criminal case

240
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,364
against A-Train. Supes are like cops.

241
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:13,890
They can't be charged

242
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,892
- for damages while they're on the job.
- Okay.

243
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,643
But maybe we can file a wrongful death.

244
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,605
I just got to get Robin's
parents to sign off on it.

245
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,649
- Hughie, come sit with me.
- Dad, I'm not...

246
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:25,777
I'm right...

247
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:27,820
Okay.

248
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:36,245
Good for you.

249
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:39,290
You want to make this right,
what happened to Robin.

250
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,461
But you can't.

251
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:45,963
So sign this.

252
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,926
What?

253
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,886
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

254
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,930
We could really use it.

255
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:58,351
I can't... Dad, they killed her.

256
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:00,061
Be realistic, okay?

257
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:01,604
Even if we could pay for a lawyer...

258
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:03,940
and that's a big if... there's no case.

259
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,358
She was in the street.

260
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,985
- Be like if a bus hit her.
- Dad, she was one step

261
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,195
- off the curb.
- I...

262
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:10,696
- I saw it!
- Hughie, look. Look.

263
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:13,741
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

264
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,385
- Dad, I have...
- You don't have the fight.

265
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,411
You never have.

266
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:22,959
I'm sorry, but it's-it's true.

267
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:27,004
Neither do I.

268
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,091
Now...

269
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,927
come and... come and sit with me, okay?

270
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:36,430
Remington Steele's on.

271
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,933
Hughie! Where you going?

272
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:48,526
... the red carpet
outside of Vought headquarters,

273
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,611
here for the annual
shareholders presentation...

274
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:54,407
There she is.

275
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,117
Welcome to New York.

276
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,244
I'm Ashley Barrett,
director of talent relations.

277
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,913
So, uh, are all these
people here for me?

278
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:02,331
Oh, honey.

279
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:05,042
Who else would they be here for?

280
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,252
Come on.

281
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:07,795
We're running late.

282
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:09,088
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,472
Ladies and gentlemen,

284
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:20,766
it is without a doubt a good time

285
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:24,020
to be in the Superhero business.

286
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:27,106
Our net income is up 14%.

287
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:30,234
Our latest film, G-MEN: World War,

288
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,361
just grossed shy

289
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:35,948
of $1.7 billion world-wide.

290
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,575
And this fall, we break ground

291
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,827
on our newest theme
park outside of Paris.

292
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:43,289
The branding opportunities
are limitless.

293
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,920
But, you know, none
of that really matters.

294
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:53,674
Because job one is managing, supporting,

295
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:57,053
and advising the brave heroes

296
00:15:57,094 --> 00:16:01,557
who put themselves in
harm's way each and every day

297
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:04,143
for us.

298
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:06,812
Let's take a look.

299
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:14,228
A world without crime,

300
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,131
with liberty and justice for all,

301
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:19,533
that's within our reach,

302
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,522
thanks to the 200-plus Superheroes

303
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,472
in the Vought Family.

304
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,499
We see a bright future ahead,

305
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,252
where there is a Vought
Hero in every town.

306
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:33,839
You're doing really
well, by the way, so far.

307
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,967
I-I haven't done anything yet.

308
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,551
Yeah, exactly. You're already up

309
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:39,154
two-and-a-half points with Midwesterners

310
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,222
and conservative Christians in 18 to 49.

311
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:43,724
That speech, by the
way, your audition...

312
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:46,602
It was modest; it was humble.

313
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:49,230
Really fucking smart choice.

314
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:51,315
Uh, I-I meant it.

315
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,776
Yeah, that's why we love you.

316
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:56,696
So you ready for your life to change?

317
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,342
... including the jewel

318
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,492
in Vought's crown,

319
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,869
the greatest superhero team

320
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:05,162
the world's ever seen:

321
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:06,956
The Seven.

322
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,625
That is our job, our honor.

323
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,252
We are Vought.

324
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:13,671
We make heroes super.

325
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,097
I have a very exciting surprise for you.

326
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,933
Both a member of The Seven,

327
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:28,936
and Lord of the Seven Seas,

328
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:31,564
live and in person, the Deep.

329
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:49,331
Thank you.

330
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,252
Thank you, everybody.

331
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:57,089
After a long,

332
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:00,885
distinguished career with The Seven,

333
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:05,306
my good friend, the
Lamplighter, has retired.

334
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:07,516
Let's give him a big "thank you".

335
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:09,018
What do you say?

336
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,454
Thank you, Lamplighter!

337
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,982
But now,

338
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:18,944
as we turn towards the future,

339
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:22,698
I'd like to introduce
someone very special.

340
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,576
And I, for one, can't
wait to work with her.

341
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,329
Please welcome Starlight.

342
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,164
Go. Go. That's you.

343
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:43,111
- Ooh, look at that.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

344
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:45,679
Starlight and the Deep.

345
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,895
Oh. Hi.

346
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,647
I love you, Starlight!

347
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,400
We love you!

348
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,235
Hey, buddy, you okay?

349
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,118
Hey, buddy!

350
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:07,136
Wow.

351
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:09,638
Pretty cool, huh?

352
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,973
Oh, hey, check this out.

353
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:13,058
We have two World View-4 satellites

354
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,060
in geocentric orbit.

355
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:17,396
We can essentially read a
getaway car's license plate

356
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:19,315
from 380 miles up.

357
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:21,734
That is just...

358
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:23,360
I mean...

359
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,279
G... I was working with a police scanner

360
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:27,114
that I bought on eBay.

361
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,658
Yeah, well, not anymore you're not.

362
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,536
Oh, and wait till you
check out the dining room.

363
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:35,164
We, uh, may or may not have stolen Miro

364
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,208
from Gramercy Tavern.

365
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,168
Yeah, he's fan-fucking-tastic.

366
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,464
That's his, isn't it?

367
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:46,133
Homelander's? Yeah.

368
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,177
But you'll have your own soon.

369
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,637
Here. Come on.

370
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:50,971
Give it a test drive.

371
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:53,933
Come on.

372
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:56,060
O-Oh, you-you okay?

373
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,479
It's just...

374
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:04,610
I used to stand in the mirror,

375
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:08,781
pretending to be where I am right now.

376
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,283
You know something?

377
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:14,828
On my first day, I, uh...

378
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,457
Well, I-I felt like a fraud.

379
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:22,920
Yeah. But the good news is,
everybody feels that way.

380
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:27,091
Thank you.

381
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:32,596
And, hey, we're a team now.

382
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,974
We'll help each other out.

383
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:36,392
I bet growing up you had

384
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,978
a poster of Homelander
on your wall, huh?

385
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,856
No, actually, I...

386
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:45,693
I don't know, Homelander's so...

387
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:49,738
He's like Jesus or something.

388
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,241
If you want to know the truth,

389
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:55,077
I actually had a poster of you.

390
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,204
Really?

391
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:59,415
- Yeah. Yeah. I kind of...
- Oh.

392
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:03,043
I kind of had a schoolgirl crush on you.

393
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:05,462
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

394
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,007
I hope that's not inappropriate to say.

395
00:22:08,048 --> 00:22:09,818
No, no, no, no, no. It's
not inappropriate at all.

396
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:12,636
It's just, it's kind of wild.

397
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,062
What?

398
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:23,540
I mean, you said you had a crush on me.

399
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:25,024
I figured that, you know...

400
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:26,942
- That is...
- Whoa, whoa, wh-wh-whoa, hey.

401
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:28,527
Look, you're gorgeous.

402
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,362
I'm not... I'm not talking about sex,

403
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:32,323
just a little bit of pole-smoking.

404
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

405
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,369
It's just a question of how
bad you want to be in The Seven.

406
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:48,339
Excuse me?

407
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,590
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

408
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:50,817
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

409
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:53,969
Take it easy.

410
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:56,347
Settle down. We're
just, we're just talking.

411
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:59,350
And look, I know that you're powerful.

412
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:02,686
I get it. Your powers are no joke.

413
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:05,189
The thing is...

414
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,608
I am number two around here.

415
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,651
So, like, if I say so,

416
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,320
you know, you'd be out of here.

417
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:14,406
Especially since you attacked me.

418
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:16,408
I what?

419
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,869
Yeah. Look.

420
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:22,998
I mean, Iowa's sweetheart,
the Defender of Des Moines,

421
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,626
just went psycho on the Deep.

422
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,337
I mean, that...

423
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:30,089
that could put you out of the business.

424
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,633
Yeah.

425
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:35,969
I mean, home to Mommy, tail
tucked between your legs.

426
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:37,805
Just think of all those kids.

427
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,807
I mean, the kids.

428
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:42,017
Those kids who look up to you,

429
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,770
they'd just be shattered.

430
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:50,401
I mean, th-that's not what
you really want, right?

431
00:23:50,442 --> 00:23:53,612
Or we come together as a team.

432
00:23:53,654 --> 00:23:57,282
You and me, we just
roll with the punches,

433
00:23:57,324 --> 00:24:00,285
for, like, three minutes, maybe.

434
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:02,287
It's not a big deal.

435
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:05,582
And then you know what happens?

436
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:08,001
All your dreams come true.

437
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,133
I-I'm sure you guys have all heard

438
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:17,428
that Translucent stopped a home invasion

439
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:18,988
in Yonkers last night,
a young, single mother

440
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:20,573
and her two kids.

441
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:23,058
Just incredible. Just...

442
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,019
So tell us, how are
you able to-to vanish?

443
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,521
No, I don't actually vanish.

444
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:31,475
My skin turns into this
carbon meta-material

445
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,776
that bends the light.

446
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:34,528
Like an invisibility cloak.

447
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,155
All right, but just to be clear,

448
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:38,198
you have to be completely naked, right?

449
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,786
I appreciate you coming on
the show, my man. I love you.

450
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,913
You guys stay tuned for
a behind-the-scenes look

451
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:47,249
at Invisible Force 2, and
later, Translucent himself...

452
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,712
You interested in a nanny cam?

453
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:53,314
'Cause we're actually
running a special on that.

454
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:54,673
Um, it's a pretty popular bear.

455
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,258
There's cameras in the eyes.

456
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,759
Tell me,

457
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,387
how many nannies shake their babies?

458
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,806
Uh, I'm sorry?

459
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:07,019
You know, a good... hard shake, like...

460
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,272
like tryin' to get
ketchup out of a bottle.

461
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:12,733
One percent? Less?

462
00:25:12,774 --> 00:25:14,735
I-I don't really know.

463
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,612
Funny, that.

464
00:25:16,653 --> 00:25:20,324
They sell a billion dollars
worth of that shit worldwide.

465
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:22,576
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

466
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:25,078
The bollocks people will believe

467
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,080
if you get them scared enough.

468
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:29,958
Cool.

469
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,919
Cool, cool.

470
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,504
Um...

471
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,964
Is there anything I can
help you with today, or... ?

472
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:38,759
I'm not gonna piss you about, Hughie.

473
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,178
I heard what happened to Robin.

474
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,322
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, who are you?

475
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,680
She wasn't in the street.

476
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:45,557
She was one step off the fucking curb.

477
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,768
And you didn't take the pay-off.

478
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:49,078
Yeah. I said, who the hell are you?

479
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:50,145
How do you know that?

480
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:51,897
Name's Butcher.

481
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:53,565
Billy Butcher.

482
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:56,902
Listen, I was thinking that, uh,

483
00:25:56,944 --> 00:26:00,822
you and me should have
a little bit of a chat.

484
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,326
Y-You're a Fed?

485
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:06,161
You don't sound like a Fed.

486
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:07,996
What, I can't immigrate?

487
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:09,516
There's a giant green slapper
with her ass in the harbor

488
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,999
that says different.

489
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,227
You don't really look like one, either.

490
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:14,086
No? What do I look like?

491
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:17,381
Like you're starring in a
porn version of The Matrix.

492
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,466
Well, it's all right
there in black and white.

493
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:22,302
Okay. Uh, what exactly can I do for you?

494
00:26:22,344 --> 00:26:24,096
No, you got it all wrong, Hughie.

495
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:26,014
It's what I can do for you.

496
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,933
You see, you ain't alone, son.

497
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:30,185
It happens a lot more than you think.

498
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:33,480
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

499
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,607
No. Come on, that'd
be all over the news.

500
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,276
People would be screaming bloody murder.

501
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:38,795
Yeah, look, there
might be the odd mention

502
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,320
of it now and again, like with Robin,

503
00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:41,923
but there's a fuck-sight
more that happens

504
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:44,116
that just gets swept
right under the rug.

505
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:46,577
Why?

506
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,455
Ain't it obvious?

507
00:26:50,497 --> 00:26:53,166
Movie tickets, merchandising,

508
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,669
theme parks, video games.

509
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:58,422
A multi-billion dollar
global industry supported

510
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,424
by corporate lobbyists

511
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:03,218
and politicians on both sides.

512
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,388
But the main reason that
you won't hear about it

513
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,558
is 'cause the public don't
want to know about it.

514
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,312
See, people love that cozy
feeling that Supes give them.

515
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:14,855
Some golden cunt

516
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:17,441
to swoop out of the sky and save the day

517
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,027
so you don't got to do it yourself.

518
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:23,113
But if you knew half the
shit they get up to...

519
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:25,782
Ooh...

520
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,868
Fuckin' diabolical.

521
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:32,039
But then... that's where I come in.

522
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,916
Come in to... to do what?

523
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:38,462
Spank the bastards when
they get out of line.

524
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:40,756
How do you spank a Supe?

525
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:42,799
Come on, son.

526
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,885
Uh, where?

527
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:46,303
You'll love it.

528
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:47,512
Uh, not likely.

529
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:48,680
Uh, listen.

530
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:51,183
I think this is good; I'm good.

531
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:54,186
Uh, thank you for an
extremely weird conversation,

532
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:56,938
but, uh, I don't want to go
to a second location with you.

533
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,274
So, I'm gonna get back to work.

534
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:00,734
Thank you.

535
00:28:00,776 --> 00:28:04,905
Hughie! Hughie.

536
00:28:07,157 --> 00:28:09,242
This is your one and only, mate.

537
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:12,329
Once I go, I'm gone.

538
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:15,290
I'm offering you the opportunity

539
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:18,251
to get them that got your girl.

540
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:21,963
What have you got to lose

541
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:25,550
that you ain't already lost?

542
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:47,698
Where are we?

543
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:50,033
Keep your mouth shut.

544
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:52,953
Harry.

545
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:54,538
Got your message.

546
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,040
Thank you for being
an upstanding citizen.

547
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:59,042
You know this is fucking
police brutality, man.

548
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:02,170
You know what they'll do to me,
they catch me letting you in?

549
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:06,091
Not half of what I'll do if you don't.

550
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:10,804
Did he just say you were police?

551
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:13,765
Yeah, you know, cop, Fed, all
the same to twats like that.

552
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:27,612
Holy shit.

553
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:29,489
Pick your jaw up off the floor

554
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,158
and try to blend in.

555
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,993
This is the only place

556
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:36,455
where the Supes can scratch
their filthy little itch

557
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:38,749
without the paps taking snaps.

558

♪ I did a bad, bad thing ♪

559

♪ I did a bad, bad thing. ♪

562
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:50,677
The "Capes for Christ" guy...

563
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,053
preaches all that...

564
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:54,890
"pray the gay away" shit.

565
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,142
And now he's the meat in the Manwich.

566
00:29:57,184 --> 00:30:00,020

570
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,697
That's it. Further.

571
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,866
Further.

572
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:14,117
There. There.

573
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,077
- Stop.
- Wait, wait, wait.

574
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,413
A-Train's... A-Train's here right now?

575
00:30:18,455 --> 00:30:20,749
Was. This is from last night.

576
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,417
Turn it up.

577
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,046
I cannot believe you
ran through a bitch.

578
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:28,673
You want to hear something crazy?

579
00:30:28,715 --> 00:30:31,551
I ran so fast through this bitch

580
00:30:31,593 --> 00:30:33,804
that I swallowed one of her molars.

581
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:37,098
Like a bug on the fucking freeway.

582
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,476
Dude, that's nasty.

583
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:44,773
They're laughing.

584
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:48,068
Just... Like she's a joke.

585
00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:52,364
They're fucking laughing.

586
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:00,831
So what are you gonna do about it?

587
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,454
Oh, for Chrissakes.

588
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:44,040
Clean yourself up.

589
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:46,668
Never let them see you like this.

590
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:50,505
Translucent,

591
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:52,549
you're a goddamn pervert.

592
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:56,511
Ah...

593
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:00,849
Oh, uh...

594
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:03,018
I'll just go.

595
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:07,063
They're all like that?

596
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:09,566
All of them? Even Homelander?

597
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,986
Homelander's the exception.

598
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:15,030
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

599
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:17,157
Man's a saint.

600
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:18,867
But the rest of 'em, yeah.

601
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:21,286
Pardon my French, fuck those fuckers.

602
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:22,871
Here.

603
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:25,290
Have a shufti of that.

604
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:27,292
- What are these?
- That's the police log

605
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,794
the day that Robin got murdered.

606
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:33,089
Couple of bar fights.
A few cars got nicked.

607
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,592
But you know what's not in there?

608
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:38,345
No bank alarms going off.

609
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:40,639
No one charged at Central Booking.

610
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,974
A-Train stopped two
bank robbers, my arse.

611
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:45,352
Someone's fucking hiding something.

612
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:47,479
- Hiding what?
- Well, I don't know,

613
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,357
whatever dodgy shit he
was up to that night.

614
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,734
Why couldn't he stop? I
mean, what was in that bag?

615
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,778
You know? Who was he running from?

616
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:57,364
- Or where was he running to?
- Bingo.

617
00:32:57,405 --> 00:33:01,159
Work that out, and we'll have
the fucker, I can smell it.

618
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:03,036
Okay.

619
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,748
Okay, so, um...

620
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,833
what can I do to help?

621
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,169
Here's what you do.

622
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:14,172
Ring Vought, tell 'em you'll
take the money, sign the NDA,

623
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:17,258
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

624
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,653
Why does A-Train need to be there?

625
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:19,946
Then they'll take you
into The Seven Tower,

626
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,179
through security, mate,

627
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:23,181
- and then you're gonna plant a bug.
- A bug?

628
00:33:23,223 --> 00:33:25,392
A bug. And we'll have a little listen.

629
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,644
See what's really going on.

630
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,313
Okay, let me just... sorry,
let me just get this straight.

631
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:33,817
You want me to... you want me
to go to Seven Tower by myself,

632
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:36,152
and-and you want me to plant a bug,

633
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:38,780
like I'm... what, like
I'm fuckin' James Bond?

634
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:41,408
- Yeah, exactly. You got it.
- You're FBI.

635
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:43,118
If you're FBI, then get a warrant.

636
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,429
- Why do you... why do you even need me?
- Hughie, Hughie,

637
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:47,914
look, mate, I got a warrant, all right?

638
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:50,625
But that place is
firewalled, untappable,

639
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,387
and locked up tighter
than a nun's knickers.

640
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,546
I couldn't get myself in
there in a million years.

641
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,214
But you, son, you could do it.

642
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:58,008
- No, no, I can't, okay?
- Yeah.

643
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,135
I can't. No. You didn't
see A-Train covered in...

644
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,345
And-and I'm, what, I'm just
supposed to go in there,

645
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,723
and I'm supposed to... I'm
supposed to shake his hand?

646
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:06,766
- And smile?
- Yeah.

647
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:09,185
I'm not... Do you know who
my favorite musician is?

648
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,979
- Who?
- James Taylor.

649
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:13,940
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

650
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:16,609
Any of those guys,
they don't infiltrate.

651
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:18,945
Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.

652
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:20,423
Hughie, Hughie, fucking grow a pair.

653
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:21,924
You heard that cunt
laughing at your girl.

654
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:23,575
No. No. No.

655
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,869
No, I can't. I can't do that.

656
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,038
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna fuck it up,

657
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,040
and you're not gonna have your bug...

658
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,083
... and I'll be dead.

659
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,628
I'm not... I'm not like you.

660
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:43,762
This is amazing, Madelyn.

661
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:46,056
Thank you for this. My
kid is gonna lose his mind.

662
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,183
Ah, it is our pleasure.

663
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,143
Just do not sell it online.

664
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:53,897
All right. What are you thinking?

665
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,607
Baltimore is a beautiful town.

666
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:58,359
But you've got a problem.

667
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:02,322
Your homicide rates are up, what, 62%?

668
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:04,074
The police are not closing cases.

669
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:05,968
You're on the verge of
needing a federal lifeline.

670
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:07,786
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

671
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:09,621
Who are you proposing?

672
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:12,248
Nubian Prince.

673
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,209
Fits your population's demo,

674
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,044
but not too militant.

675
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:18,213
Caucasians love him, too, with a...

676
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:20,340
59% approval rate.

677
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:24,594
I am willing to give you a
three-year exclusive contract

678
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:26,638
with full PR support,

679
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,307
and I'm gonna give you
nine and a half points

680
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:31,434
of the merchandising.

681
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:33,311
I thought he was in Detroit.

682
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:35,396
Well, we're thinking
about making a move.

683
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:37,232
How much?

684
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,776
$300 million a year.

685
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,907
I know, I know, it's a tough swallow.

686
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:48,660
But we both know that
your city needs a hero.

687
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:53,790
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

688
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:56,209
- I can sell that.
- Mm.

689
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,795
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

690
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,339
We've got Atlanta waiting in the wings.

691
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,925
I think maybe you can.

692
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,593
And why is that?

693
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:11,057
I happen to know about Compound V.

694
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,979
What is Compound V?

695
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,897
It's the type of rumor

696
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:20,150
that could really tarnish
those heroes of yours.

697
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:21,776
Nobody wants that.

698
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:23,486
People need heroes.

699
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,322
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumor,

700
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,324
because I'm a friend.

701
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:31,619
But friendship does cut both ways.

702
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:35,540
I'm sorry, Steve, I don't
know what you're talking about.

703
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:38,459
$300 million is the price,

704
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:41,087
or we go to Atlanta.

705
00:36:42,797 --> 00:36:44,841
So, how amazing is it?

706
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,426
What's Homelander like?

707
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,344
Uh... he's busy.

708
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,805
I haven't really met him yet, but...

709
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:54,767
Mom, I got to tell you what happened.

710
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,603
Oh, I forgot.

711
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:58,521
I was playing mah-jongg
with Patty and Trish,

712
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,773
and Patty is going on and
on about how her daughter

713
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:03,484
got into med school, and
I'm thinking, so what?

714
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:05,445
My daughter got into The Seven!

715
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:09,157
Anyway, so-so, what
did you want to tell me?

716
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:13,369
Everything's great.

717
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,455
Just how we dreamed.

718
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:16,956
Um...

719
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:19,584
Mom, actually, you
know what? I have to go.

720
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:21,544
All right. Bye, honey.

721
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:44,359
Um...

722
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,902
excuse me.

723
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,946
I'm sorry, a-are you okay?

724
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:49,781
Just seemed like a...

725
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:51,950
tough call.

726
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:53,785
Sorry. I don't mean to bother you.

727
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:55,203
No, no, it's okay.

728
00:37:55,245 --> 00:37:56,412
Uh...

729
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:58,998
I'm fine. I'm just...

730
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,459
I'm just having a bad day.

731
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:04,379
Yeah, me, too.

732
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,423
Uh... is it, like, a-a work thing, or...

733
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:10,301
a-a life thing?

734
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:13,304
It's a work thing.

735
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:16,099
You?

736
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,227
Uh... life thing.

737
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:25,650
You know how you have this...

738
00:38:25,692 --> 00:38:28,111
image of yourself?

739
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:31,864
Like, I thought I was strong.

740
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,866
You know? Like, made of steel.

741
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:35,201
A fighter.

742
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:36,661
And...

743
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:39,372
then I was faced with
this horrible situation

744
00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:41,666
with this asshole...

745
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:44,460
and...

746
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:48,631
I just heard my mom's voice in my head,

747
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:50,550
"Keep smiling,

748
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,177
the show must go on,"

749
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,389
and... I didn't fight.

750
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:59,726
And now I just feel sick.

751
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:02,770
Partly because I did it, but...

752
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:04,814
mostly because...

753
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:11,487
... turns out I'm not
who I thought I was.

754
00:39:15,408 --> 00:39:18,411
- Oh. Oh, I'm, um, sorry.
- Uh...

755
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:21,886
I-I didn't mean to just dump
all of that onto you.

756
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:25,108
No, no, it's totally fine
that you dumped. Um...

757
00:39:27,628 --> 00:39:30,631
Listen, d-do you like your job?

758
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:32,175
Oh.

759
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:34,719
It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

760
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:36,471
And it's a good job?

761
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:39,390
Like, you're not selling kids smack?

762
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:41,809
No, it's a great job.

763
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:44,562
I could help a lot of people.

764
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:47,398
Thing is, I, um...

765
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,360
used to know this girl,

766
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,571
and we used to go
skating at Rockefeller,

767
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:55,490
and I'd be on the side

768
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:57,492
with this death grip on the rails.

769
00:39:57,533 --> 00:40:01,037
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

770
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,415
And she wasn't... good.

771
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:06,501
Like, she fell...

772
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,878
a lot...

773
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,381
but she was never scared.

774
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:17,720
And she always used to say:

775
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:20,348
"Just 'cause you fall
on your ass doesn't mean

776
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,309
you have to stay there."

777
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,645
So you fell on your ass, you know?

778
00:40:25,686 --> 00:40:28,106
That's not who you are.

779
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:32,026
So who are you?

780
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:40,159
I'm a fighter.

781
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:43,871
I'm gonna fight.

782
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:46,707
Yeah.

783
00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:50,044
I'm gonna take that
son of a bitch's head

784
00:40:50,086 --> 00:40:53,589
- clean off his body.
- Okay. Wow, that was...

785
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:55,299
Okay.

786
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:57,301
Cool.

787
00:40:57,343 --> 00:40:58,636
Little scary, but...

788
00:40:58,678 --> 00:41:00,680
but-but cool.

789
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:04,809
I'm-I'm Hughie, by the way.

790
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:06,644
Annie.

791
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:24,454
Okay, man. I'm in.

792
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,334
Okay, it's ringing.

793
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:33,880
Yeah, hello?

794
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,214
Hi. Hi.

795
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,258
Yes, hello. Hello, Mr. Friedman.

796
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,260
It's Hughie Campbell.
I got your message,

797
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:41,095
and-and $45K, it's just...

798
00:41:41,137 --> 00:41:44,265
it's just... it's bingo,
like, life-changing.

799
00:41:44,307 --> 00:41:48,227
Um, but I just need one thing
before I-I sign anything.

800
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:49,770
I need an apology

801
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:52,106
- from A-Train.
- Uh, he already apologized.

802
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:54,066
Well, no, no, no.

803
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:55,693
No, he hasn't. Yes, he sent his...

804
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:58,779
he sent his regrets
and his sympathies on...

805
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:01,115
On TV, but I-I...

806
00:42:01,157 --> 00:42:04,785
if I could just get an
apology face-to-face,

807
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:06,454
that would be fantastic.

808
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:07,955
Just to... just for closure,

809
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:10,249
just to put... just to
put a b-button on it.

810
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,210
Okay, yeah. But, uh...

811
00:42:12,251 --> 00:42:14,212
Hugh, I'm telling you,
the answer's gonna be no.

812
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:16,005
All right, in that...
in that case, can you

813
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:17,590
just give me... Uh, hello?

814
00:42:17,632 --> 00:42:19,342
I think... They hung up.

815
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,302
I don't think they're gonna go for it.

816
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:24,555
Hmm. Oh, yes, they will.

817
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:43,658
Starlight.

818
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:46,702
Don't want to be late to
your first official meeting.

819
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:50,540
I had a whole welcome speech planned.

820
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,041
Sorry, sir.

821
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,834
Please, Homelander's fine.

822
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:56,170
Beginning to wonder
if you'd even show up.

823
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:57,838
I mean, all that pressure,

824
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,675
it's a lot for anyone to swallow.

825
00:43:00,716 --> 00:43:03,052
Yeah. Don't worry, I'll be fine.

826
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:04,554
I'm here,

827
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:07,723
and I'm not going anywhere.

828
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:12,496
Can we get back to this, please?

829
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,399
This is a serious crime.
These assholes pirated my movie

830
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,733
three weeks before release,

831
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:19,735
and you can't walk down 5th Avenue

832
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:22,530
without bumping into a table
of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

833
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:24,907
Copyright infringement is costing Vought

834
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,617
$1.2 billion per year.

835
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:28,369
That's money out of our pockets.

836
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:30,246
We've all got, what, four points each?

837
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:31,914
What the fuck?

838
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:34,458
You got four points?

839
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,586
And clearly better lawyers.

840
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:39,255
Hey, hey, hey, guys, come on.

841
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:40,881
Stop.

842
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:42,758
What's Starlight gonna think?

843
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,761
Listening to us haggling over nickels.

844
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,848
We're The Seven, for God's sake.

845
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:51,934
Whether we're out
there or we're in here.

846
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:54,604
Now, what I do want to hear

847
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:57,356
is who you saved this week.

848
00:43:57,398 --> 00:43:58,774
Huh?

849
00:43:58,816 --> 00:44:00,026
Who's up for that?

850
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:03,688
Black Noir.

851
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:06,198
Let's start with you, man.

852
00:44:12,747 --> 00:44:14,081
Do you have a dog?

853
00:44:14,123 --> 00:44:15,499
No.

854
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:17,668
All right, give us your phone.

855
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,420
There's fuck-all
security to worry about.

856
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:21,422
In fact, they're a bunch of muppets.

857
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:23,466
And the metal detector
won't pick this up.

858
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:25,926
Right? And what they'll
probably do is take you

859
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:28,429
through the security and
then up into the boardroom.

860
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:31,057
Sit down. Be nice, congenial.

861
00:44:31,098 --> 00:44:34,393
Then, real polite-like, tell 'em
you're gonna take a fake shit.

862
00:44:34,435 --> 00:44:36,520
Go into the bog, take the bug out.

863
00:44:36,562 --> 00:44:38,773
Peel back the plastic bit
to reveal the sticky side.

864
00:44:38,814 --> 00:44:41,901
Put the plastic bit
in the bog. Flush it.

865
00:44:41,942 --> 00:44:44,320
Then go back into the boardroom,

866
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:46,238
sit down... big smiles...

867
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,240
plant the bug underneath the table.

868
00:44:48,282 --> 00:44:50,076
Easy peasy Japanesey.

869
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:52,328
Bob's your uncle. That's that.

870
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,830
- That's that? That was... that was a lot.
- Yeah.

871
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:57,184
Th... I've... Hold on, can you
just... can you repeat it again?

872
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,435
Just a little bit slower? Because I...

873
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:00,294
Shh. Listen.

874
00:45:00,336 --> 00:45:02,922
- Fuck.
- Hughie, calm down, all right?

875
00:45:02,963 --> 00:45:05,591
This is like that scene in The Matrix.

876
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:09,220
Now, you could take the
fucking red pill, right?

877
00:45:09,261 --> 00:45:11,305
Spend the rest of your life jacking off,

878
00:45:11,347 --> 00:45:14,058
crying into your chai tea

879
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,435
green latte, what the fuck. Or...

880
00:45:16,477 --> 00:45:19,188
you could take the blue pill.

881
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,941
Or is it the red pill?
Anyway, take the other pill

882
00:45:21,982 --> 00:45:24,169
- and quit being a cunt.
- Which pill do you want me to take?

883
00:45:24,193 --> 00:45:26,112
Just quit being a cunt.
That's what I'm saying.

884
00:45:28,114 --> 00:45:29,824
Fuck me. Okay.

885
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:16,370
Sir, could you empty
your pockets, please?

886
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,400
Thank you.

887
00:47:13,636 --> 00:47:14,845
Um...

888
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:17,097
excuse me, can-can I, uh...

889
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:19,350
can I use your bathroom?

890
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,853
Just to be clear, A-Train's apology

891
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:25,506
isn't an admission of any
sort of culpability whatsoever.

892
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:26,607
Do you understand?

893
00:47:31,403 --> 00:47:32,464
I'm sorry about what
happened to your girlfriend,

894
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:33,581
all right?

895
00:47:37,868 --> 00:47:39,453
Hey, dude, are you okay?

896
00:47:52,174 --> 00:47:53,551
Fine.

897
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:57,555
I appreciate the apology.

898
00:47:57,596 --> 00:47:59,890
Accidents happen, right?

899
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:01,559
After all,

900
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,477
I mean, you were saving the world.

901
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:05,896
Okay, great. Thank you
so much. As you know,

902
00:48:05,938 --> 00:48:07,666
a crimefighter's work is never
done. Douglas here will handle

903
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,109
the rest of the paperwork
for you, okay? Thank you.

904
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:17,366
Can I use your bathroom?

905
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:15,591
What the fuck?

906
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:34,443
And I look him right
in the eye, and I smile.

907
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:36,612
And that was awesome, man,

908
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,489
just getting to stare that asshole down.

909
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,366
I get why you dig this job.

910
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:42,618
Yeah, you know, it has
its moments, doesn't it?

911
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,621
You were right. Fuck A-Train.

912
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:49,208
Fuck A-Train. Fuck-fuck The Seven.

913
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:53,045
Fuck all... Seven.

914
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:54,964
What are we, uh...

915
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:56,966
what are we doing here?

916
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:59,969
Well, you got to go to work, don't you?

917
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,305
Yeah, but, um, I don't, uh...

918
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:07,768
Well, I mean, that's all I
need you for right now, yeah?

919
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:10,437
Yeah, I mean, but I-I can...

920
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:12,231
I can help with other stuff, you know?

921
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:13,917
I could... I could be,
like, your tech guy.

922
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:16,443
You know? Like, I could be
in the van with the thing

923
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:18,380
and, like, you know, "He's
down the hall to the left."

924
00:50:18,404 --> 00:50:19,446
Like, I can...

925
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:21,115
Yeah, look, son, I, uh...

926
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:22,866
I think it's best that
I take it from here.

927
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:24,708
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, but I-I can...

928
00:50:24,743 --> 00:50:26,286
I can really help.

929
00:50:26,328 --> 00:50:29,289
I know you can help. I got it.

930
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:43,053
Oh, w... Oh, hey, wait.

931
00:50:45,097 --> 00:50:48,726
You ever see an asshole tear up $45K?

932
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,814
Hughie.

933
00:50:55,357 --> 00:50:58,444
You're a good lad.

934
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:16,336
Ms. Stillwell, I wasn't sure you'd call.

935
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:19,381
This fucking chafes, but, um...

936
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,469
I'm willing to come down to
$230 million for Nubian Prince.

937
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,262
That's very reasonable,
Maddie. Thank you.

938
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:29,725
And, Steve, this, um, Compound V,

939
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:32,227
any rumors you may have
heard about my heroes...

940
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:35,439
libelous and completely untrue.

941
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:37,274
But we all know how rumors spread,

942
00:51:37,316 --> 00:51:40,527
so... I'd appreciate your discretion.

943
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:41,862
Of course.

944
00:51:41,904 --> 00:51:43,030
You have my word.

945
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:45,115
Thank you.

946
00:51:45,157 --> 00:51:48,368
Have a safe flight home.

947
00:51:50,454 --> 00:51:53,082
Policing cities is a thorny
enough issue as it is,

948
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:55,834
but allowing superheroes
into national defense?

949
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:58,754
We'd basically be privatizing war.

950
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,091
Good night, Hughie.

951
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:03,759
You'll lock up?

952
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,094
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

953
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:07,304
Thanks, Gary.

954
00:52:18,232 --> 00:52:20,526
Sorry, we're closing up.

955
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:29,159
Hello?

956
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,372
Who are you?

957
00:52:33,413 --> 00:52:34,832
The fuck?

958
00:52:34,873 --> 00:52:37,251
Right in front of you, prick.

959
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:41,338
You think I wouldn't find this thing?

960
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,470
Hughie.

961
00:52:52,057 --> 00:52:54,643
You pussy, I followed you
from the fucking Tower.

962
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:57,146
No, no, no!

963
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:02,442
Who's that guy you
were with, in the car?

964
00:53:02,484 --> 00:53:03,861
- Who was he?!
- I don't...

965
00:53:03,902 --> 00:53:05,213
- He put you up to this?
- I don't know!

966
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:06,697
He was just some Uber driver, okay?

967
00:53:06,738 --> 00:53:09,158
Don't give me some
bullshit! Uber driver!

968
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,869
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?

969
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,038
- Why'd you plant the bug?
- Please.

970
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,290
Please, please, please.

971
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:17,624
No, please.

972
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:19,251
We're The Seven,

973
00:53:19,293 --> 00:53:21,211
Earth's most mighty,

974
00:53:21,253 --> 00:53:24,131
champions of the innocent,

975
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:25,799
motherfucker!

976
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:36,143
Sorry about the mess.

977
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:40,272
You should fuck off, Hughie.

978
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:49,031
Hughie, run!

979
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:51,366
Well, well, well,

980
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:54,203
if it ain't the invisible cunt.

981
00:54:22,814 --> 00:54:24,691
There you are.

982
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:55,264
So who are you?

983
00:54:55,305 --> 00:54:58,100
Fucking spy?

984
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:00,686
For who? Huh?

985
00:55:00,727 --> 00:55:03,522
You're gonna fucking tell me,

986
00:55:03,563 --> 00:55:06,358
or I'm gonna smash
your fucking scalp off!

987
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,193
Who the fuck are you?!

988
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:10,237
I'll tell you who you are.

989
00:55:10,279 --> 00:55:12,739
A fucking moron.

990
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:16,702
"Translucent" doesn't
even mean "invisible".

991
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:19,496
It means "semi-transparent".

992
00:55:43,645 --> 00:55:46,565
Is he... is he dead?

993
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:48,567
Is he...

994
00:55:50,027 --> 00:55:51,737
Well, he ain't moving.

995
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:54,072
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

996
00:55:54,114 --> 00:55:56,033
How'd you know the
electric could do the job?

997
00:55:56,074 --> 00:55:57,868
Skin's carbon.

998
00:55:57,909 --> 00:55:59,703
Highly conductive.

999
00:55:59,745 --> 00:56:02,789
Saw it on, uh, Jimmy Fallon.

1000
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:07,586
Would've taken me forever
to work that one out.

1001
00:56:07,627 --> 00:56:08,962
Good job.

1002
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:10,297
Let's get him in the boot.

1003
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:12,549
Wait, wait, what? Wait, what? What?

1004
00:56:12,591 --> 00:56:14,593
The trunk.

1005
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:15,903
No, no, I mean, what
are we... what are we...

1006
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:17,471
what are we doing with him?

1007
00:56:17,512 --> 00:56:19,931
Well, Hughie, you just
offed one of The Seven, mate.

1008
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:21,350
Me? I...

1009
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:24,227
You-you hit him with a fucking car!

1010
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:26,605
Look, potato, fucking po-tah-to.

1011
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:28,398
We're both in a shitload of trouble.

1012
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,025
No, no, no, we're not! It's... It...

1013
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:32,527
He-he attacked us, okay?

1014
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:34,988
And you're-you're a
federal officer, you know?

1015
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,657
Just-just call the fucking FBI.

1016
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:39,493
Yeah, o-okay, so, look,

1017
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:42,329
technically, I'm not a Fed.

1018
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,832
What?!

1019
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,920
Then who the fuck are you?!

1020
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,807
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
It's just a little turbulence.

1021
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:04,267
It'll be okay.
