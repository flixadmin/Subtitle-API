I love Miriam, but I love living too.

638
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,527
You can have Bullock's
file, but not the rest.

639
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,529
Fine.

640
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,045
And Miriam stays where she is.

641
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,524
Is that all?

642
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,047
There's one more thing.

643
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,764
It's become something of a habit
to stand up here with Detective Gordon.

644
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,721
But with the coming election
for president of the P0licemen's Union...

645
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,327
there's no man I'd rather support.

646
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,165
Thank you, Commissioner Loeb.

647
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,404
It's a new day in the G.C.P.D.

648
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,763
Sorry I missed your big moment.

649
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,247
I figured I'd catch the next one.

650
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,890
Your file.

651
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,200
It's everything Loeb has on you.

652
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,887
Always hated that picture.

653
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,241
You know, you tell yourself:

654
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,925
<i>"I'll</i> just do this one bad thing...

655
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,887
but all the good things I'll do later
will make up for it."

656
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,529
But they don't.

657
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,760
There's still that bad thing.

658
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,763
Penguin's gonna come asking
for that favor.

659
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,283
Be careful.

660
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,609
I know we had a deal.

661
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,048
I let you go
and you escape the inevitable punishment...

662
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,524
that will descend on your heads when
Commissioner Loeb hears of your failure.

663
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,403
Unfortunately, I was only able
to acquire one ticket to Arizona.

664
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,882
So who's it gonna be?

665
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,290
Marge and I have been
together for 20 years.

666
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,646
We're not splitting up.

667
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,482
Life can be cruel sometimes.

668
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,167
How do we decide who goes?

669
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,762
I leave that in your hands.

670
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,761
JUDE:
Wait a minute.

671
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,161
Margie. Margie.

672
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,486
Whoa. Whoa.

673
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,520
MARGE:
Here we... Here we go.

674
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,443
What time is the train?

675
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,080
Oh, there's no train.

676
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,288
- I just needed your help.
- What?

677
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,161
I was down to one shell.

678
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,802
I've been thinking
of introducing salsa night.

679
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,645
You think our guests would like that?

680
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,240
No.

681
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,085
Honest. Good.

682
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,090
But I like salsa.

683
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,288
Tuesday it is.

684
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:12,049
So you've completed your task and the
lines of supply are open once again.

685
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,680
I am duly impressed.

686
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,569
Hope is a carrot, easily dangled
in front of the desperate, doctor.

687
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,164
And you have earned your carrot.

688
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,251
Welcome to upper management.

689
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,441
I think you'll find the view better
than in the basement.

690
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,761
In fact...

691
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,047
You see why I can trust you?

692
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,446
Why I'm not worried
about you betraying me and escaping?

693
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,763
Yes, I see.
