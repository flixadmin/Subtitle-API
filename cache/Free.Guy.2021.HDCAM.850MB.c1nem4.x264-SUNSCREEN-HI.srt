get rid of my skin?

- What?
- Seriously.

330
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,771
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?

331

Impressive.

780
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:34,187
Why are you
doing all of this?

781
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,354
You know, I guess
I felt... trapped.

782
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,120
You know, in my life.

783
00:42:41,154 --> 00:42:43,187
I just felt so...

784
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:45,020
Stuck.

785
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,536
Yeah. And then I saw you.

786
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,737
Then I saw you.

787
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:54,803
Who are you?

788
00:42:55,403 --> 00:42:56,637
I'm Guy.

789
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,937
No, who are you really?

790
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,803
Still Guy.

791
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:04,637
All of this,
leveling up so fast.

792
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,236
Giving this whole
world the finger.

793
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,570
How are you pulling this off?

794
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:11,603
I've never given anyone
any of my fingers.

795
00:43:11,637 --> 00:43:13,470
(CLICKS TONGUE,
WHISPERS) You work at Soonami, don't you?

796
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,304
- No.
- You've got an inside track.

797
00:43:15,337 --> 00:43:17,037
- I work at the bank.
- Right. The bank.

798
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:21,403
So, you're just this incredible hacker
who happens to work at the bank.

799
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:23,004
Yes, I work at the bank.

800
00:43:23,037 --> 00:43:25,169
Where did you get that skin?

801
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:27,945
It's always
sort of been there.

802
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:30,378
Why do people keep
asking me that question?

803
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,411
I don't know, why do they?

804
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,328
No, no.
Not doing that. I...

805
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:40,794
What's happening right now?

806
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,762
I don't know,
but I don't buy it.

807
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,128
No.

808
00:43:44,161 --> 00:43:46,095
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it.
- Fine. Good.

809
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:47,562
- I'll let it go.
- Yes.

810
00:43:47,996 --> 00:43:49,228
Great.

811
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:50,828
We all have
our secrets, I guess.

812
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,529
Yes, we do.

813
00:43:55,137 --> 00:43:56,137
Hey.

814
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:59,537
Do you like ice cream?

815
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,804
MOLOTOVGIRL: I can't believe
I've never been here.

816
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,736
Well, it's sort of a secret.

817
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:08,537
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy,
always come here. It's quiet and safe.

818
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,270
Yeah, it makes sense.

819
00:44:11,312 --> 00:44:13,911
No missions here.

820
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:17,245
Oh, you gotta try this.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

821
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,878
This is my favorite flavor
in the whole world.

822
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:20,045
We'll take two
of the usual, please.

823
00:44:20,078 --> 00:44:21,379
ICE CREAM VENDOR:
You got it, Guy.

824
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:23,479
It's bubble gum flavor.

825
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:25,312
You think I'm
crazy, don't you?

826
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:26,412
Guy...

827
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:29,578
Get out of my brain hole!
I love bubble gum ice cream.

828
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:31,578
No, you don't.
Are you making fun of me right now?

829
00:44:31,612 --> 00:44:33,772
No! Nobody likes
bubble gum ice cream.

830
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:34,928
No, I do.

831
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:36,362
I had a relationship end
over bubble gum ice cream.

832
00:44:36,396 --> 00:44:37,628
- No way. Here.
- Yeah.

833
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,105
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

834
00:44:39,203 --> 00:44:40,470
Mmm.

835
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:41,870
How good is that?

836
00:44:41,904 --> 00:44:43,037
You can taste it?

837
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,737
Taste it? It's like my tongue
had a baby with a sunrise.

838
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,070
- MOLOTOVGIRL: Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

839
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:51,079
Coffee used to be
my favorite food,

840
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:53,678
but compared to this,
it tastes like liquid suffering.

841
00:44:53,712 --> 00:44:55,779
- (LAUGHS)
- What?

842
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:56,845
(LAUGHING)

843
00:44:58,512 --> 00:45:01,411
Nothing. You're funny.

844
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,954
- I am?
- Yeah.

845
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:06,420
Weird funny. (CHUCKLES)

846
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,054
But that's kind of my speed.

847
00:45:09,087 --> 00:45:11,220
Weird funny, that's
totally my speed, too.

848
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:13,253
- Great.
- Yeah. I know a joke.

849
00:45:13,286 --> 00:45:14,886
A weird funny joke.
You wanna hear it?

850
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:16,654
- Please.
- Okay.

851
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:21,387
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair
are trying to murder a very small child...

852
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,954
- The cripple says to the homosexual...
- Whoa. Stop, stop.

853
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,032
Stop! Where did you hear that?

854
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:28,562
A robbery. The gunman
told it to the driver

855
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,929
who thought it was hilarious,
so I memorized it and told everyone.

856
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,728
Word of advice?

857
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:37,028
Don't crib your jokes
from the trolls of <i>Free City.</i>

858
00:45:37,061 --> 00:45:38,161
Trolls?

859
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:39,661
Is that a swing set?

860
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:05,920
Holy...

861
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,154
MOLOTOVGIRL: Okay,
this is too weird.

862
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:19,253
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice
cream, and now swings?

863
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:21,720
- This is too weird.
- I thought the same thing, too.

864
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,035
I thought the same thing.

865
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:26,257
When I was younger,
I was obsessed with swings.

866
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,470
<i>Growing up in
my family, it was...</i>

867
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:32,237
(SIGHS) You don't
wanna hear this. No.

868
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:34,403
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

869
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:36,069
(HESITATES) Oh.

870
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:39,436
Growing up in my family,
it wasn't good enough to be great.

871
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,304
You had to win,
and that pressure, you know,

872
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,837
<i>it was just constant.</i>

873
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,045
But when I was in the backyard
on that little swing...

874
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:50,420
You know that moment,

875
00:46:50,453 --> 00:46:54,387
<i>that split second between
rising and falling,</i>

876
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,620
when you're totally weightless,
it feels like you're free.

877
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:57,454
In love.

878
00:46:57,594 --> 00:46:59,762
Free. What you said. Yeah.

879
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,729
I really wanna kiss you.
Is that weird?

880
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:07,428
You want to kiss me?

881
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:11,128
I wanna kiss you so badly.

882
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,628
You want to kiss me badly?

883
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,061
- No!
- No?

884
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:15,996
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna kiss you well.

885
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:17,561
I mean, I'm an idiot,

886
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:19,262
so I say things
like an idiot sometimes.

887
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,829
No, you're not. You're not.

888
00:47:20,862 --> 00:47:22,295
I mean, um,

889
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:25,762
uh, if you know
how to, go for it.

890
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:27,128
I know how.

891
00:47:27,953 --> 00:47:28,953
Okay.

892
00:47:31,087 --> 00:47:32,686
Here it goes.

893

better than ice cream.

I think someone's
at the door.

898
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:03,195
I'll say.

899
00:48:03,229 --> 00:48:04,962
Well, this was great.

900
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:08,008
- Yeah, it was.
- Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

901
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:10,070
Yes. Definitely.

902
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:11,703
Maybe in the real world.

903
00:48:11,737 --> 00:48:13,137
What?

904
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,570
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

905
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:16,104
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

906
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:19,337
Bye, Molotov.

907
00:48:19,371 --> 00:48:23,436
Hey... my real name is Millie.

908
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:28,186
My real name
continues to be Guy.

909

(CONTINUES KNOCKING)
Millie! It's me, open up!

912
00:49:11,012 --> 00:49:13,378
- What?
- You were right.

913
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:15,411
- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

914
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:17,862
You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i>

915
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,653
and, Millie, it works.

916
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:22,387
Yeah, I know.
But we don't have proof.

917

KEYS: Just forget about
that for one second.

918
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:26,595
I'm saying that
our game, <i>Life Itself,</i>

919
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:29,762
where characters would grow
and change and feel real...

920
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:30,962
- Yeah?
- ...worked.

921
00:49:30,996 --> 00:49:32,729
- Keys.
- The AI worked.

922
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:36,195
It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is so
realistic and people love it so much.

923
00:49:36,228 --> 00:49:37,933
And of course it doesn't
look the same.

924
00:49:38,137 --> 00:49:41,070
There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

925
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,837
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

926
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:48,602
But the underlying code in the
game is the same. Our code.

927
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,244
And Guy, I mean,
he has evolved way further

928
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,679
than we thought
was even possible.

929
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:53,978
Wait, are you talking about
the hacker in the NPC skin?

930
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:57,646
Millie, I'm talking about the
fact that Blue Shirt Guy...

931
00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:58,600
MILLIE: Yeah?

932
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:00,521
...is not a player.

933
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:03,521
He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.

934
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:05,753
I mean, hell,
technically, he is alive.

935
00:50:05,786 --> 00:50:10,052
He is the first real
artificial intelligence.

00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:14,503
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

938
00:50:14,536 --> 00:50:16,137
- Guy? My Guy?
- KEYS: Guy.

939
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,403
- One who has been...
- Your Guy?

940
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:18,836
- Holy...
- KEYS: This is a good thing.

941
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:20,237
No, it's really bad.

942
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:23,836
Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.

943
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:26,004
We did it, Mills.

944
00:50:26,037 --> 00:50:30,070
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

945
00:50:30,104 --> 00:50:33,652
Okay? Did you know that the
NPCs have private lives?

946
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,029
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

947
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,411
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

948
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:40,677
I can't even froth my own
oat milk in the morning.

949
00:50:40,711 --> 00:50:43,212
And the Bombshell
character in the game

950
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:46,112
wrote a memoir that's
a searing indictment

951
00:50:46,146 --> 00:50:47,812
of gender roles,
the patriarchy...

952
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,979
It's a little preachy in parts,
but overall, it's pretty good.

953
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:51,345
Millie, we have
to celebrate!

954
00:50:51,378 --> 00:50:52,845
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

955
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:55,677
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

956
00:50:56,704 --> 00:50:58,269
So, yeah.

957
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:01,370
(CHUCKLES)

958
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:03,302
I'm sorry, wait,
you let who kiss you?

959
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:04,370
MILLIE: Guy.

960
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,670
Guy?

961
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:11,203
The first time I kiss a
non-toxic guy in like forever

962
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,036
and of course
he's not even real!

963
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,537
Uh, there's not
a button for that.

964
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:17,903
Oh, he found the button.

965
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:19,101
- Okay.
- MILLIE: Yeah.

966
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:21,778
- I am... I'm so confused.
- Why is it so hot?

967
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:23,646
KEYS: And surprisingly
curious.

968
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,279
(CHUCKLES) You let
an artificially intelligent

969
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:28,945
- video game character kiss you?
- Oh, okay,

970
00:51:28,978 --> 00:51:30,012
can you just stop
saying it like that?

971
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,111
And then you
thought that would be...

972
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:32,911
Because you have
got to meet him, Keys.

973
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:36,012
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

974
00:51:36,045 --> 00:51:38,345
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

975
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:42,119
Also, Millie, food for
thought, he's like four.

976
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,271
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

977
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:44,937
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

978
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,870
Wow, you just made
that really creepy.

979
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,337
(BOTH LAUGHING)

980
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,470
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or
not, when people find out about this,

981
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:53,271
you could win a Nobel Prize.
Oh, God.

982
00:51:53,304 --> 00:51:54,094
What?

983
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,271
Oh, my God,
if they see this...

984
00:51:56,304 --> 00:51:57,536
- MILLIE: What? What is it?
- Oh!

985
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,536
KEYS: Antwan. What else?

986
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,004
He's lying.
He lied about using our code,

987
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:04,403
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

988
00:52:04,436 --> 00:52:05,937
I think he's lying
about <i>Free City 1.</i>

989
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,237
What are you talking about?

990
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:10,402
KEYS: Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location...

991
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,896
I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.

992
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,361
<i>Free City 2</i>
is not an update...

993
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:15,929
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

994
00:52:15,962 --> 00:52:17,595
So when <i>Free City 2</i>
launches on Monday...

995
00:52:17,629 --> 00:52:20,948
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our
code, everything will be deleted.

996
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:22,737
He can't do that.

997
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:25,903
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

998
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:30,162
We're screwed.

999
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:32,728
Maybe not.

1000
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:34,995
If we can find our
original build in the game,

1001
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:37,861
it'll prove that Antwan used our
code without properly licensing it.

1002
00:52:37,895 --> 00:52:40,171
And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.

1003
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,536
We have 48 hours.

1004
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,204
I've looked, Keys.
You know I have.

1005
00:52:43,237 --> 00:52:44,470
I know you have.

1006
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:47,070
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

1007
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:48,325
maybe he can help?

1008
00:52:48,386 --> 00:52:50,720
That would mean
I'd have to tell him.

1009
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:53,820
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

1010
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,837
His whole world's
about to end.

1011
00:52:56,871 --> 00:52:59,169
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

1012
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:03,470
- ICE CREAM VENDOR: Here you go.
- Thank you.

1013
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:05,604
- You got it.
- MILLIE: Guy?

1014
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:06,936
Hey! Hi!

1015
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,504
Guy, we need to talk.

1016
00:53:08,537 --> 00:53:11,303
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

1017
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:11,937
British.

1018
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:14,970
I think I know an Australian
accent when I see one.

1019
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:16,570
I turned off
the accent filter.

1020
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:19,077
This is me.

1021
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:20,512
Good.

1022
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:22,712
Look, I have to tell you
something really important.

1023
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,044
- Are you married?
- (GASPS)

1024
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:24,911
No.

1025
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:28,279
- Oh, God.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1026
00:53:28,312 --> 00:53:30,379
That would have been like
the worst thing ever.

1027
00:53:30,412 --> 00:53:32,312
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Maybe not the worst thing.

1028
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:33,686
Huh.

1029
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,420
I have to show you something.

1030
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:37,661
Okay.

1031
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:40,794
(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

1032
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:43,770
Wow!

1033
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,870
I always wondered
what was in here.

And there's Joe! He's
my friend, I know that guy.

1040
00:54:03,612 --> 00:54:05,612
I don't get it.
What is this place?

1041
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:10,245
There is no easy way to say
this, but this city is a game.

1042
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,778
There's no easy way to say
this, I know it's a game.

1043
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:14,712
You taught me how to play it.
(PLAYFULLY) Boop-boop.

1044
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:16,145
MILLIE: Yes,
you're right, I did.

1045
00:54:16,178 --> 00:54:19,610
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

1046
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:22,714
It's a video game.
And that's all it is.

1047
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,854
So the entire world is a game?

1048
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,987
Yes.

1049
00:54:27,021 --> 00:54:28,987
And we're all just
players in the game?

1050
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:31,285
Not exactly.

1051

I'm a player.

All these people here are players.
We live in the real world.

But you only exist here.

It's why you can
never leave Free City.

Just stop for a second.

I wanna make sure
I'm getting this straight.

1070

I just wanna fully
understand here.

So, I'm fake?

I'm not even a main character,

I'm just this idiot

Millie, why are you even saying this?
I love you.

You only think that because
it's in your programming.

you to listen to me.

In two days,
the game is gonna shut down. For good.

you, all the people in it
who aren't players,

1080
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,579
they'll be gone forever.
You need to listen.

1081
00:55:45,612 --> 00:55:48,679
My whole life, I felt like
there had to be something more.

1082
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,603
And then I saw you.

1083
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,828
And I knew I was right.
I was right!

1084

And for a second,
I felt amazing.
