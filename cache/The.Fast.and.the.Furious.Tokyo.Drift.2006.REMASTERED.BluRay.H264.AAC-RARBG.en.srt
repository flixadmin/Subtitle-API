My mom died when I was 10.

She came out here from Australia
when she finished high school.

But I realize now, outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

Look, DK wants your head.

648
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:11,161
All right?

649
01:19:11,578 --> 01:19:15,875
And the trouble you just made for Kamata?
You're done here, bro.

650
01:19:18,419 --> 01:19:21,839
- Maybe I should talk to Kamata.
- What?

651
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:25,051
DK answers to him.

652
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,140
I know I just didn't hear that.

653
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:35,520
I gotta end this. I'm gonna go talk to him.

654
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,606
What, are you crazy, huh?

655
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:39,399
Han is dead, all right!

656
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,487
Plus, you can't just walk into Kamata's place, man!

657
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:47,158
It's all I got.

658
01:19:53,749 --> 01:19:56,919
Something I think Han would've wanted you to have.

659
01:20:11,518 --> 01:20:12,936
What's this?

660
01:20:14,562 --> 01:20:18,984
You're gonna need it if you're gonna
make it out of Kamata's place alive.

661
01:20:22,071 --> 01:20:23,739
Don't you need it?

662
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:28,953
No, it's cool. Look, I'll figure it out.

663
01:21:02,656 --> 01:21:05,951
I'd like to see Mr. Kamata, please.

664
01:21:38,862 --> 01:21:39,946
Sean.

665
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:46,369
You need to leave.

666
01:21:46,703 --> 01:21:48,831
You came to the wrong place.

667
01:21:48,998 --> 01:21:51,209
I didn't come here to see you.

668
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:52,877
Takashi.

669
01:21:53,711 --> 01:21:55,421
Who's your friend?

670
01:21:57,048 --> 01:21:58,049
Nobody.

671
01:21:59,091 --> 01:22:00,510
I can handle this.

672
01:22:01,303 --> 01:22:04,598
I have something which belongs to you, sir.

673
01:22:21,491 --> 01:22:22,742
You think

674
01:22:23,826 --> 01:22:28,374
you can walk in here, dump some cash and walk out?

675
01:22:30,501 --> 01:22:34,546
I know I'm only returning what belonged
to you in the first place, sir.

676
01:22:36,048 --> 01:22:38,260
But that's not why I really came.

677
01:22:38,927 --> 01:22:40,929
I came here to apologize.

678
01:22:43,181 --> 01:22:46,810
I know your nephew and I have embarrassed ourselves badly.

679
01:22:46,935 --> 01:22:48,937
Don't listen to this gaijin.

680
01:22:50,273 --> 01:22:51,315
Takashi...

681
01:22:52,817 --> 01:22:55,695
after everything you've done, you're giving me orders?

682
01:22:55,778 --> 01:22:56,946
I apologize.

683
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:02,576
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.

684
01:23:05,205 --> 01:23:07,666
How do you plan to accomplish that?

685
01:23:09,126 --> 01:23:10,294
A race.

686
01:23:11,837 --> 01:23:13,005
(LAUGHING)

687
01:23:15,507 --> 01:23:19,637
DK and I have caused nothing but problems for you, for us.

688
01:23:21,389 --> 01:23:25,351
And I'm asking you to allow us to settle this,
once and for all.

689
01:23:27,186 --> 01:23:28,397
We race

690
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:32,234
and the loser leaves town for good.

691
01:23:32,318 --> 01:23:35,154
I've already beat this piece of shit once!

692
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:36,447
Good.

693
01:23:37,406 --> 01:23:39,825
Then it should be easy.

694

695
01:24:20,745 --> 01:24:21,829
Hey!

That's why she's spitting.

697
01:26:03,481 --> 01:26:07,026
We almost there, Twink.
Couple more tweaks.

698
01:26:08,569 --> 01:26:10,946
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.

699
01:26:12,323 --> 01:26:15,827
DK picked this road for a reason.
This is his mountain.

700
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:21,458
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.

Said Han was family.
