1
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,143
Whoa.

2
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,645
Not even a scratch,
big v--

3
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,714
I mean, uh,
shendu, sir.

4
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,383
Try harder.

5
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:20,619
The pan ku box
must be opened.

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,920
(Kung fu yell)

7
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,989
Charging rhino
cracks walnut!

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,297
Uh, open sesame?

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,402
What a absurd
waste of time.

10
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,404
Cheerio.

11
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,671
Unh!

12
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:43,509
Need I remind you,
valmont...

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,616
That it is I who holds
controlling interest
in this partnership,

14
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,352
and the sooner
we find the portals

15
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,521
and release
my demon brethren,

16
00:00:55,523 --> 00:01:00,192
the sooner you will have
your pathetic body
to yourself.

17
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,930
Aah! Go! Open already!

18
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,298
Aah!

19
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:13,672
Remember, I cannot touch
good magic.

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,980
Uh, shen-dude.

21
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,386
Hey, it
ain't no box.

22
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,221
It's a puzzle.

23
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,495
Ah. A map
- to the first portal.

24
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,930
Uh, it says

25
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:43,402
we gotta find
"that which runs,
but never walks

26
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:47,406
to the mouth
which never talks."

27
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,174
A puzzle
with a riddle.

28
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,709
Shendu: At last.

29
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,947
The demon sorcerers
will return
and walk the earth,

30
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,951
casting their shadow
upon all human--

31
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,160
ah. Tell me
- someone wrote that down.

32
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,461
Anyone?

33
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,854
Uncle, please
slow down.

34
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,989
You so need
to chill.

35
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,427
If I chill, demons will be
dancing upon all our graves.

36
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:19,064
I must research
the proper chi spells
to seal the 7 portals.

37
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,033
All required ingredients
must be on hand and ready.

38
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,134
Uh, uh, uncle.

39
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,735
Hmm?
At least let me help.

40
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,405
What do you know
about magic?

41
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:30,576
I was apprentice
to chi master fong
for 15 years!

42
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,125
(Sighs)
Perhaps it is time

43
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,495
for me to train
an apprentice of my own.

44
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,332
Someone of sound judgment

45
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,867
whom I can trust
with my chi knowledge.

46
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:56,935
Me--me--me!

47
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,037
I'll put some focus
in your hocus.

48
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,405
Tohru.

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,180
It won't budge.

50
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,749
Clearly the box's way
of telling us

51
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,584
we must find
the first portal

52
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,587
before proceeding
to the next.

53
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,923
Well, if our recollection

54
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,092
of the directions
are accurate,

55
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,929
the portal which
imprisons po Kong,
the mountain demon,

56
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:29,401
will be found in
what is now Tokyo, Japan.

57
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:33,005
(Snores)

58
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,078
Hey, t.
Whatcha workin' on?

59
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,948
(Snores)

60
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,485
"Duplication spell
for beginners." Huh.

61
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,935
Uncle always says

62
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,005
this is
his most valuable vase.

63
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,107
Time to double his money.

64
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,783
Whoa. Uncle is gonna
beg me to be his apprentice.

65
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:18,850
Jackie: Uncle.

66
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:19,918
Uncle.

67
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,389
Pack your things.

68
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,891
Captain black
just informed me

69
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,160
that shendu
is headed for Tokyo.

70
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,394
Do not move.

71
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,463
What? What is it? Ow!

72
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:36,501
Do you expect me to seal
the demon door with
salt and pepper, no?

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,838
Then you go to Tokyo
and find out which demon
we are dealing with

74
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,343
so I can research
a proper chi spell.
Good night.

75
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,912
(Sighs)
Yes, uncle.

76
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,247
Sounds like you could use
my help, Jackie-o,

77
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,016
and I've never been
to Tokyo--

78
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,618
Jade,
- it's a school night.

79
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,753
Oh.

80
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,854
Now promise me

81
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,756
that you will stay here
and do your homework.

82
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,024
Promise.

83
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,303
I can do my homework
<i>and</i> go with Jackie.

84
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,415
Both: Whoa. Freaky.

85
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:27,219
Jinx! (Laughs)

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,554
Shendu: The map indicated

87
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,891
that we proceed
300 paces southeast

88
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,160
from the cherry
blossom grove,

89
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:39,197
where we will follow that
which runs but never walks

90
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,634
to the mouth
which never talks.

91
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,907
Chow: I don't see
any cherry blossoms.

92
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,244
That wretched box
is thousands of years old.

93
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,479
There have clearly been
some developments

94
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,914
in the landscape since then.

95
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,350
Ooh. Ooh, looky-
looky-looky-looky.

96
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,719
No, ratso.
You can't have one.

97
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:05,590
Don't you see?
It runs on batteries
but doesn't walk,

98
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,527
and it's got a mouth.
No way it talks.

99
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,962
I suppose
it's worth a look.

100
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,968
That which runs
but never walks.

101
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,873
I've got your back, Jack.

102
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,910
Tokyo is mondo coolio,
don't ya think?

103
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,612
(Gasps)
- What are you doing here?

104
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,347
Tch. Like I was
gonna miss this.

105
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,050
But my homework--
we promised Jackie.

106
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,219
No. You promised Jackie.

107
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,057
Uncle: Aiyeeya!

108
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,560
(Grunts)
Uncle? Ow!

109
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,895
You cast a lousy spell.

110
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,963
I did?

111
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,765
My one-of-a-kind vase

112
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,800
is no longer
one-of-a-kind.

113
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,471
(Uncle gasps)

114
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,739
One more thing.

115
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,360
You can tag along,

116
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,529
but no more
surprises, <i> capisce?</i>

117
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,303
Both: Uh, surprise?

118
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,245
Jade: Uh...

119
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,813
What just happened here?

120
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,314
Talk later.
Let's roll.

121
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,117
Wait!

122
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,157
No portals
to demon worlds here.

123
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,197
Unh!

124
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,832
Hey!

125
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,127
Jade: Jackie!

126
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,495
I'm open!

127
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,297
Jade, what
are you doing--

128
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,198
why do I
bother to ask?

129
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,702
Got it!

130
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,203
Get her!

131
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,643
I got her!
(Pants)

132
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,845
No, I got her!

133
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,115
What do you mean?
I got her...

134
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,217
But she don't
got the box.

135
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,489
Ooh!
Unh!

136
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,459
Jade, where's the box?

137
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,528
Uh...
(Growls)

138
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,796
Gazelle pounce!

139
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,733
Good.

140
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,369
Go hide.

141
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,509
Jade, please,
I told you to hide.

142
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,111
Did not.

143
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,902
Oh, bad day,
bad day, bad day.

144
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,807
All: Unh!

145
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,148
(Growls)
- Angry crow takes flight!

146
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,483
No, no, no!

147
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,856
All: Aah!

148
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,028
All: Aah!

149
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,864
All: Jackie!

150
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,976
I'll teach you
to take things

151
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,611
that don't belong
to you, chan!

152
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,147
I have a better idea.

153
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,319
Hello.

154
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,721
Three's a crowd.

155
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,559
Jackie, are you ok?

156
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,660
Oh...

157
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,662
I landed on the box.

158
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,930
Whoa.

159
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:39,998
Belly flop.

160
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,905
Uncle: Full line
atop 2 broken lines.

161
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,208
Jackie, that is a trigram
of the mountain demon.

162
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,745
I will gather
chi ingredients
and come at once.

163
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,814
Allow me to assist
you, master.

164
00:11:55,816 --> 00:12:00,218
Why? You are
a lousy apprentice.

165
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,654
But I did not cast
the duplicator spell.

166
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:06,558
Blah. If you did not,
then who did?

167
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,565
Can't you guys just
pull yourselves together?

168
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,366
Hey, don't look at us,
Copperfield.

169
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,302
You're the one
who cast the spell.

170
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,670
Jackie: Jade...

171
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,005
Have you been
contemplating
the riddle?

172
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,143
Sure. What riddle
was that, uncle Jackie?

173
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:29,514
(Sighs)
- The riddle we must solve
before shendu does.

174
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,549
Runs but never walks.

175
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,085
Mouth but never talks.

176
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,555
Where were you two?

177
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,491
Hello. Ice.

178
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,760
So maybe you can,
like, chill.

179
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,266
Quick! Hide!

180
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,505
Mouth but doesn't talk.

181
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,906
Runs but never--

182
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,242
waa! Quick, Jackie.
Look out the window.

183
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,252
Window? What are
you talking--
(Gasps)

184
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,927
Jackie: Jade,
you are a genius.

185
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,029
I am?

186
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,498
A river runs
but never walks.

187
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,668
Has a mouth
which never talks.

188
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,905
The sumiya river
must lead to the portal.

189
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,874
Waa!

190
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,113
Jackie, don't worry.
I can explain everything.

191
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,018
(All chuckle)
Hi, Jackie.

192
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,757
All: Mmm.
Boy, this is good.

193
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,993
Uh, uh,
when uncle arrives,

194
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,962
tell him
where to find me.

195
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,964
Can't I come, Jackie?

196
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,599
They're getting
on my nerves.

197
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:58,002
(Chuckles)
But you have
so much in common.

198
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,206
You will have
to stay here.
All of you.

199
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,209
All: Oh, Jackie.
Do we have to?

200
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,484
Valmont: When in doubt...

201
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,821
Allow Jackie chan
to do the grunt work.

202
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,757
Heave, ho!

203
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,709
How do we know
chan's even warm?

204
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,177
I don't see
any portals.

205
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,046
Yeah, just
- a souvenir stand, and...

206
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,398
Many thanks for
leading us here, chan.

207
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,667
So, how are we
gonna open the portal?

208
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,203
Whoa.

209
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,968
Behold! The triumphant
return of my sister,

210
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,439
po Kong,
the mountain demon.

211
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,975
Must be
his big sister.

212
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,912
Enough fanfare.
What's for supper?

213
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,582
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

214
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:55,320
(Slurps)
Mmm, an hors d'oeuvre.

215
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,923
Oh, no! Unh!

216
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,793
Aah! Come back here, you!

217
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,564
(Gasps)
Hurry, uncle.

218
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,802
Aah!

219
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,004
Aah! Ooh!

220
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,440
Unh!

221
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,507
Hut!

222
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,576
Unh! Aah!

223
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,816
(Roars)

224
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,551
(Inhales)

225
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,685
Aah!

226
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,754
Ow!

227
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,823
Aah!

228
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,325
Mmm.
(Slurps)

229
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,627
Jade: Hey, big Bertha.

230
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,531
Mmm.
It's not polite
to play with your food.

231
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,801
Hmm, another
tiny portion.

232
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:47,238
All: Tch.

233
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,807
All: Whoa.

234
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,977
(Laughs)

235
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,679
Whoa!

236
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,549
Finger food.

237
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,352
All: You mean
knuckle sandwich.

238
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,187
Yaa!
Po: Unh!

239
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,290
Waa!

240
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,693
Aah!
Aah!

241
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,927
(All grunt)

242
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,996
The chi spell,
tohru.

243
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,566
(Jades roar)

244
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,634
Jades: Get her!
Keep her pinned down

245
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,436
till uncle casts
the chi spell!

246
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,706
Jades! Be careful!

247
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,308
(Thugs grunt)

248
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:30,281
Unh! Nice try, girls.

249
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,018
Unh! Unh!

250
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,255
Now the drum.

251
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,556
Uh, drum?

252
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,258
The symbol
of the immortal

253
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,527
who originally
imprisoned po Kong.

254
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,763
(Gulps)
I--I thought
you had it.

255
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:50,601
Aiyeeeya! What kind
of apprentice are you?

256
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,837
A lousy one.

257
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,846
Uncle!

258
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,917
(Speaking Chinese)

259
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:20,298
Jackie! Drum must
be struck 3 times!

260
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,467
No!

261
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,238
Enough.

262
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,540
(Grunts)

263
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,824
All: Look out! Whoa!

264
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,393
Aaaah!

265
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,934
All: Whoa!

266
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,469
All: Aah!

267
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,541
No!

268
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,378
All: Unh! Oh.

269
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,381
Oh!

270
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,123
Uncle...

271
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,925
Jackie: The pan ku box.

272
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:24,996
I think there is
a bigger problem
to solve.

273
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:30,067
(Sighs)
I must do research.

274
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,636
Uh, no need, master.

275
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:32,970
I believe
no finishing charm

276
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,640
was applied to the original
duplication spell.

277
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,975
That is why
it continues to repeat.

278
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,544
Huh?

279
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:43,581
Uh, I did some reading
during the long flight.

280
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,984
Tohru will be
a good apprentice.

281
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,086
Did you bring
the finishing charm?

282
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:52,857
Mmm, but it will only work
on the original Jade.

283
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,292
Jade!

284
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,093
All: Pick me! Over here!

285
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,930
(Grunts) I--ok.

286
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,300
Whoever cast the spell
in the first place
is grounded

287
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,669
with no TV for a year.

288
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,772
(All gasp)
She did it!

289
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,643
Tch. Tattletales.

290
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,148
-Hey, Jackie.
-Yes?

291
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,050
Have you ever refused
to do a stunt?

292
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,554
Yes. When I design
a stunt,

293
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,057
I'm thinking,
"yes, I can do it."

294
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,692
Suppose I go out
the window

295
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,260
on the roof--boom!

296
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,395
Land on the car
with all the luggage,

297
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,631
then I slide down,
then open the door,

298
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,466
go to the car
in one shot.

299
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,236
Then you can see
tod--tod--chu-chu--
chu--chu!

300
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,238
I like to do
these kind of things.

301
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,672
It was something
I cannot do

302
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,908
is fly over
the--the Grand Canyon.

303
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,843
No, I'm not gonna do that.
