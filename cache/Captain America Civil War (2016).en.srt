<i>Rusted</i>

3
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,367
<i>Seventeen</i>

00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:17,994
<i>Daybreak</i>

<i>Furnace</i>

<i>Nine</i>

00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,498
<i>Benign</i>

8
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,327
<i>Homecoming</i>

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,374
<i>One</i>

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,383
<i>Freight car</i>

11
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,018
Good morning, Soldier.

12
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,811
Ready to comply.

13
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,564
I have a mission for you.

14
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,063
Sanction and extract.

15
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,270
No witnesses.

16
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,655
Well done Soldier.

17
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,618
<i>All right, what do you see?</i>

18
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,779
Standard beat cops.

19
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,497
Small station.

20
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,785
Quiet street.

21
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,786
<i>It's a good target.</i>

22
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,081
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?

23
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,294
Cameras.

24
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,129
<i>Both cross streets are one-way.</i>

25
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,838
So, compromised escape routes.

26
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,425
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.

27
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,598
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.

28
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,734
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?

29
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,719
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.

30
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,929
<i>It's also bulletproof,</i>

31
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,263
<i>which means private security...</i>

32
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,768
<i>which means more guns...</i>

33
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,442
<i>which means more headaches
for somebody. Probably us.</i>

34
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,020
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?

35
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,898
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

36
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,818
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

37
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,198
<i>Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?</i>

38
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,491
<i>Eyes on target, folks.</i>

39
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,307
This is the best lead
we've had on Rumlow

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,769
in six months. I don't want to lose him.

41
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,080
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

42
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,503
He kind of hates us.

43
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,257
Sam...

44
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,838
see that garbage truck?

45
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,219
Tag it.

46
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,863
Give me X-ray.

47
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,700
That truck's loaded for max weight.

48
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:50,915
And the driver's armed.

49
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,041
It's a battering ram.

50
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,209
<i>- Go now.</i>
- What?

51
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,580
He's not hitting the police.

52
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,730
Body Armour, AR-15s.

53
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,481
<i>I make seven hostiles.</i>

54
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,655
I make five.

55
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,165
Sam.

56
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,798
Four.

57
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,717
Rumlow's on the third floor.

58
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,173
Wanda, just like we practiced.

59
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,350
What about the gas?

60
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,512
Get it out.

61
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,531
Pack it up.

62
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,115
He's here.

63
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,367
Rumlow has a biological weapon.

64
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,872
<i>I'm on it.</i>

65
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,909
I don't work like that no more.

66
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,082
Fire in the hole.

67
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,624
No!

68
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,607
Sam.

69
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,939
<i>He's in an AFV heading north.</i>

70
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,612
Take this to the airstrip.

71
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,781
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

72
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,443
Where are you going to meet us?

73
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,958
I'm not.

74
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,016
I've got four, they're splitting up.

75
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,485
I got the two on the left.

76
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,203
They ditched their gear.

77
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,372
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

78
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,087
There you are, you son of a bitch.

79
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,419
I've been waiting for this.

80
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,021
He doesn't have it.

81
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,487
I'm empty!

82
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,937
Out of the way!

83
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,565
Drop it.

84
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,947
Or I'll drop this.

85
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,528
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!

86
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,746
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.

87
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,961
Don't thank me.

88
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,669
I'm not thanking that thing.

89
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,922
His name is Redwing.

90
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,251
<i>I'm still not thanking it.</i>

91
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,501
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

92
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,266
Come on!

93
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,566
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

94
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,873
Ahh!

95
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,777
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

96
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,801
Who's your buyer?

97
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,965
You know, he knew you.

98
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,175
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.

99
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,808
What did you say?

100
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,642
He remembered you.

101
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,683
I was there. He got all weepy about it.

102
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,978
Till they put his brain back in a blender.

103
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,643
He wanted you to know something.

104
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,773
He said to me...

105
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,359
"Please tell Rogers.

106
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,232
"When you gotta go...

107
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,158
"you gotta go."

108
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,613
And you're coming with me.

109
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,260
Oh, my...

110
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,351
Sam...

111
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,475
we need Fire and Rescue

112
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,181
on the south side of the building.

113
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,270
We gotta get up there.

114
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,781
<i>Try to remember the kind of September</i>

115
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,618
<i>When grass was green</i>

116
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,042
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.

117
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,831
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

118
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,385
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...

119
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,795
right before you leave town.

120
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,214
Be nice, dear,
he's been studying abroad.

121
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,223
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

122
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,725
Candice.

123
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,309
Do me a favour?

124
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,040
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.

125
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,225
Okay, so it's Monday.

126
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,560
That is good to know,

127
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,562
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

128
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,401
Where you going?

129
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,652
Your father's flying us

130
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,179
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.

131
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,731
We might have to make a quick stop.

132
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,987
At the Pentagon. Right?

133
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,161
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

134
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,990
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

135
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,995
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

136
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,501
I'll get the bags.

137
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,331
He does miss you when you're not here.

138
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,427
And frankly, you're going to miss us.

139
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,846
Because this is the last time

140
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,514
we're all going to be together.

141
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,802
You know what's about to happen.

142
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,766
Say something.

143
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,939
If you don't, you'll regret it.

144
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,103
I love you, Dad.

145
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,523
And I know you did the best you could.

146
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,340
That's how I wish it happened.

147
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,387
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...

148
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,589
or BARF.

149
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,469
God, I gotta work on that acronym.

150
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,926
An extremely costly method

151
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,262
of hijacking the hippocampus...

152
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,475
to clear traumatic memories.

153
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,235
Huh.

154
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,571
It doesn't change the fact

155
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,489
that they never made it to the airport...

156
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,197
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...

157
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,499
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

158
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,212
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.

159
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,046
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?

160
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,460
"To generate, disseminate...

161
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,338
"and preserve knowledge.

162
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,594
"And work with others...

163
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,518
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."

164
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,264
Well, you are the others.

165
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,857
And, quiet as it's kept...

166
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,605
the challenges facing you

167
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,215
are the greatest mankind's ever known.

168
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,897
Plus, most of you are broke.

169
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,944
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.

170
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,359
As of this moment...

171
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,778
every student has been made
an equal recipient...

172
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,865
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.

173
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,449
As in...

174
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,460
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

175
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,299
No strings, no taxes...

176
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,631
just reframe the future!

177
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,466
Starting now.

178
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,316
Go break some eggs.

179
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,781
Wow. Wow.

180
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,573
That took my breath away.

181
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,158
Oh, Tony! So generous.

182
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,494
So much money! Wow!

183
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,408
Out of curiosity...

184
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,374
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

185
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,900
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.

186
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,166
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

187
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,403
Basically,
chemical detonator embedded...

188
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,446
Restroom's this way, yeah?

189
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,655
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.

190
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,012
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

191
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,576
I didn't know Miss Potts had canceled.

192
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,341
They didn't have time to fix it.

193
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,935
It's fine. I'll be right back.

194
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,433
We'll catch up later.

195
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,459
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.

196
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,619
Ah, they deserve it.

197
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,959
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.

198
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,136
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

199
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,805
But if you've got the money...

200
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,801
break as many eggs as you like.

201
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,928
Right?

202
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,697
Are you going up?

203
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,193
I'm right where I want to be.

204
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,074
Okay. Hey.

205
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,038
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

206
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,869
I work for the State Department.

207
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,331
Human Resources.

208
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,579
I know it's boring...

209
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,166
but it enabled me to raise a son.

210
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,924
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

211
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,515
His name was Charlie Spencer.

212
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,011
You murdered him.

213
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,272
In Sokovia.

214
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,111
Not that that matters in the least to you.

215
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,898
You think you fight for us?

216
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,360
You just fight for yourself.

217
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,031
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

218
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,209
He's dead...

219
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,545
and I blame you.

220
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,304
<i>11 Wakandans were</i>

221
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,507
<i>among those killed
during a confrontation...</i>

222
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,809
<i>between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...</i>

223
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,932
<i>in Lagos, Nigeria last month.</i>

224
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,541
<i>The traditionally reclusive Wakandans</i>

225
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,851
<i>were on an outreach mission...</i>

226
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,682
<i>in Lagos, when the attack occurred.</i>

227
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,066
<i>Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...</i>

228
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,899
<i>not only because of
the actions of criminals...</i>

229
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,911
<i>but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.</i>

230
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,955
<i>Victory at the expense of the innocent...</i>

231
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,411
<i>is no victory at all.</i>

232
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,163
<i>The Wakandan king went on to...</i>

233
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,877
<i>They are operating outside</i>

234
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,704
<i>and above the international law.</i>

235
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,006
<i>Because that's the reality,</i>

236
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,674
<i>if we don't respond to acts like these.</i>

237
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,835
<i>What legal authority does an enhanced</i>

238
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,670
<i>individual like Wanda Maximoff have...</i>

239
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,096
<i>to operate in Nigeri...?</i>

240
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,928
It's my fault.

241
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,355
That's not true.

242
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,523
Turn the TV back on.

243
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,728
They're being very specific.

244
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,353
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.

245
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,150
Rumlow said "Bucky"...

246
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,553
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,

247
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,613
in Brooklyn.

248
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,456
And people died.

249
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,503
It's on me.

250
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,958
It's on both of us.

251
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,373
This job...

252
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,215
We try to save
as many people as we can.

253
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,885
Sometimes that doesn't
mean everybody.

254
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,973
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...

255
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,056
then next time...

256
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,142
maybe nobody gets saved.

257
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,395
Vis! We talked about this.

258
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,196
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

259
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,910
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.

260
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,536
Thank you. We'll be right down.

261
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,243
I'll use the door.

262
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,584
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

263
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,461
We know who it is?

264
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,462
The Secretary of State.

265
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,176
<i>Five years ago...</i>

266
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,420
I had a heart attack...

267
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,761
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.

268
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,973
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...

269
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,263
because after 13 hours of surgery

270
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,143
and a triple bypass...

271
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,811
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.

272
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,691
Perspective.

273
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,778
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

274
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,535
You have fought for us...

275
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,830
protected us, risked your lives...

276
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,130
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...

277
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,208
there are some...

278
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,551
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."

279
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,966
What word would you use,
Mr Secretary?

280
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,347
How about "dangerous"?

281
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,808
What would you call
a group of US-based,

282
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,012
enhanced individuals...

283
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,148
who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...

284
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,936
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...

285
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,229
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned

286
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,564
about what they leave behind?

287
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,161
New York.

288
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,711
Washington, D.C.

289
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,307
Sokovia.

290
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Lagos.

291
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,160
Okay. That's enough.

292
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,462
For the past four years,

293
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,026
you've operated with unlimited power...

294
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,791
and no supervision.

295
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,905
That's an arrangement
the governments of the world

296
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,921
can no longer tolerate.

297
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,805
But I think we have a solution.

298
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,898
The Sokovia Accords.

299
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,185
Approved by 117 countries...

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,230
it states that the Avengers

301
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,782
shall no longer be a private organization.

302
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,200
Instead...

303
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,570
they'll operate under the supervision

304
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,575
of a United Nations panel...

305
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:41,084
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.

306
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,247
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

307
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,965
I feel we've done that.

308
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,132
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

309
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,923
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...

310
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,433
you can bet there'd be consequences.

311
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:02,147
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

312
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,358
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

313
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,903
So, there are contingencies.

314
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,028
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

315
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,193
to ratify the Accords.

316
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,954
Talk it over.

317
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,288
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?

318
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,837
Then you retire.

319
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,072
Hello?

320
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,033
Is this your car out front?

321
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,407
I jumped the curb.

322
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Maybe we could...

323
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,161
take care of it ourselves.

324
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,372
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...

325
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,957
- I guess.
- No.

326
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,419
No cops.

327
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,676
Thank you.

328
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,414
You have kept your looks, Colonel.

329
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,051
Congratulations.

330
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:01,133
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."

331
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,767
Who are you?

332
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,811
My name is Zemo.

333
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,190
I will repeat my question.

334
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:14,688
Mission report, December 16, 1991.

335
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,652
How did you find me?

336
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,782
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...

337
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,411
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

338
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,244
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.

339
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,041
Not easy to decipher.

340
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,246
But, I have experience.

341
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,749
And patience.

342
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,173
A man can do anything if he has those.

343
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,422
What do you want?

344
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,549
Mission report.

345
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,559
December 16.

346
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,140
1991.

347
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,312
Go... to... hell!

348
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,832
HYDRA deserves its place
on the ash heap.

349
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,918
So your death would not bother me.

350
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,504
But I'd have to use this book...

351
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,175
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

352
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,552
I don't look forward to that.

353
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,348
You'd only be dying for...

354
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,883
your pride.

355
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,196
Hail HYDRA.

356
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,005
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honor...

357
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,371
which is one more than you have.

358
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,171
So let's say we agree to this thing.

359
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,093
How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack us

360
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,500
like a bunch of common criminals?

361
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,676
117 countries want to sign this.

362
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,509
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."

363
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,746
How long are you going
to play both sides?

364
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,931
I have an equation.

365
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,971
Oh, this will clear it up.

366
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,106
In the eight years since Mr Stark

367
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,650
announced himself as Iron Man...

368
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,195
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.

369
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,194
During the same period...

370
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,484
the number of potentially
world-ending events

371
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,114
has risen at a commensurate rate.

372
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,571
Are you saying it's our fault?

373
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,456
I'm saying there may be a causality.

374
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,204
Our very strength invites challenge.

375
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,914
Challenge incites conflict.

376
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,878
And conflict...

377
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,670
breeds catastrophe.

378
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,216
Oversight...

379
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,556
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.

380
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,812
Boom.

381
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,896
Tony.

382
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,683
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.

383
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,213
It's because he's already
made up his mind.

384
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,103
Boy, you know me so well.

385
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,606
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

386
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,281
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

387
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,949
It's discomfort.

388
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,032
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

389
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,493
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?

390
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,376
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.

391
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,881
He's a great kid.

392
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,427
Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...

393
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,180
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.

394
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,769
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...

395
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,639
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.

396
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,315
Maybe be of service.

397
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,546
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or

398
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,090
Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.

399
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,822
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

400
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,949
He decided to spend his summer

401
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,596
building sustainable housing
for the poor.

402
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,111
Guess where. Sokovia.

403
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,478
He wanted to make
a difference, I suppose.

404
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,788
We won't know because we dropped

405
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,995
a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

406
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,881
There's no decision-making
process here.

407
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,762
We need to be put in check!

408
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,428
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

409
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,708
If we can't accept limitations,

410
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,768
if we're boundary-less...

411
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,975
we're no better than the bad guys.

412
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,560
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.

413
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:23,523
Who said we're giving up?

414
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,196
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.

415
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,153
This document just shifts the blame.

416
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,989
I'm sorry, Steve.

417
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,744
That is dangerously arrogant.

418
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,031
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

419
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,411
It's not the World Security Council,

420
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,895
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.

421
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,205
No, but it's run by people

422
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,662
with agendas, and agendas change.

423
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,671
That's good. That's why I'm here.

424
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,403
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

425
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,027
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

426
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,504
Tony, you chose to do that.

427
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,511
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

428
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,997
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

429
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,415
What if there is somewhere
we need to go

430
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,439
and they don't let us?

431
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,181
We may not be perfect,

432
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,982
but the safest hands are still our own.

433
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,565
If we don't do this now,

434
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,316
it's gonna be done to us later.

435
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,402
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

436
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,802
You're saying they'll come for me.

437
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,192
We would protect you.

438
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,073
Maybe Tony's right.

439
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,740
If we have one hand on the wheel,

440
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,916
we can still steer. If we take it off...

441
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,772
Aren't you the same woman
who told the government

442
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,253
to kiss her ass a few years ago?

443
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,714
I'm just reading the terrain.

444
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,172
We have made some
very public mistakes.

445
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,382
We need to win their trust back.

446
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,672
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...

447
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,952
- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.

448
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,976
No, you can't retract it.

449
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,061
Thank you. Unprecedented.

450
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,438
Okay. Case closed. I win.

451
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,979
I have to go.

452
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,733
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

453
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,405
to come up and say a few words.

454
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,297
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...

455
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,342
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

456
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,554
She had a photograph in her office.

457
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,842
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

458
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,552
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

459
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,222
But it was a lot to live up to.

460
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,728
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.

461
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,270
I asked her once how she managed

462
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,229
to master diplomacy and espionage...

463
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:16,742
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.

464
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,077
She said, compromise where you can.

465
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,207
But where you can't, don't.

466
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:29,623
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.

467
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,042
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

468
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,846
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...

469
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:41,513
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."

470
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,357
When I came out of the ice,

471
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,817
I thought everyone
I had known was gone.

472
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,695
Then I found out she was alive.

473
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,284
I was just lucky to have her.

474
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,249
She had you back, too.

475
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,169
Who else signed?

476
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,836
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

477
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Clint?

478
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,136
Says he's retired.

479
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,134
- Wanda?
- TBD.

480
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,475
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.

481
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,264
There's plenty of room on the jet.

482
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,984
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...

483
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,361
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

484
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,402
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

485
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,402
What are we giving up to do it?

486
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,865
I'm sorry, Nat.

487
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,788
I can't sign it.

488
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,212
I know.

489
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,043
Then what are you doing here?

490
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,173
I didn't want you to be alone.

491
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,144
Come here.

492
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,607
<i>At a special
United Nations conference...</i>

493
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,235
<i>117 countries have come together</i>

494
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,029
<i>to ratify the Sokovia Accords.</i>

495
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,497
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?

496
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,199
- Yes?
- These need your signature.

497
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,210
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

498
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,707
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.

499
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,050
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.

500
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,546
You seem to be doing all right so far.

501
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,055
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...

502
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,136
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.

503
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,345
Well, I'm not.

504
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,273
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.

505
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,229
Why? You don't approve of all this?

506
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,653
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

507
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,570
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.

508
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,076
Unless you need to move a piano.

509
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,659
Ms Romanoff.

510
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,868
King T'Chaka.

511
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,821
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.

512
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,456
Thank you.

513
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,838
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.

514
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,250
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.

515
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,718
Yes, so am I.

516
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,344
<i>If everyone could please be seated.</i>

517
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,171
<i>This assembly is now in session.</i>

518
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,261
That is the future calling.

519
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,219
Such a pleasure.

520
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,598
Thank you.

521
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,650
For a man
who disapproves of diplomacy,

522
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,273
you're getting quite good at it.

523
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,445
I'm happy, Father.

524
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,453
Thank you.

525
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,163
Thank you.

526
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,286
<i>When stolen Wakandan vibranium</i>

527
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,289
<i>was used to make a terrible weapon...</i>

528
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,339
<i>we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.</i>

529
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,250
Those men and women
killed in Nigeria...

530
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,340
were part of a goodwill mission

531
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,547
from a country too long in the shadows.

532
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,976
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

533
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,772
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

534
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:19,019
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.

535
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,280
Wakanda is proud

536
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,278
to extend its hand in peace.

537
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,452
Everybody get down!

538
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,356
My mom tried to
talk me out of enlisting...

539
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,943
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

540
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,109
She bought me my first thigh holster.

541
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,160
Very practical.

542
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,696
And stylish.

543
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,704
CIA has you stationed over here now?

544
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,543
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

545
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,882
Right. Right. Sounds fun.

546
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,009
I know, right?

547
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,056
I've been meaning to ask you.

548
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,139
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...

549
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,715
You mean when I was doing my job.

550
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:39,815
Did Peggy know?

551
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,360
She kept so many secrets.

552
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,564
I didn't want her to have one from you.

553
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,452
Thanks for walking me back.

554
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,204
Sure.

555
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:58,830
Steve.

556
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,703
There's something you gotta see.

557
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,754
<i>A bomb hidden in a news van...</i>

558
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,924
Who's coordinating?

559
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,069
<i>Ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.</i>

560
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,237
Good. They're solid. Forensics?

561
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,404
<i>More than 70 people have been injured.</i>

562
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,217
<i>At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.</i>

563
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,231
<i>Officials have released
a video of a suspect...</i>

564
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,764
<i>who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...</i>

565
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,348
<i>the Winter Soldier.</i>

566
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,933
<i>The infamous HYDRA agent...</i>

567
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,100
<i>linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.</i>

568
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,768
I have to go to work.

569
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,743
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.

570
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,181
We need the whole team
here in two hours

571
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,286
or it's not worth it.

572
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,711
I'm very sorry.

573
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,091
In my culture...

574
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,144
death is not the end.

575
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,019
It's more of a stepping-off point.

576
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,684
You reach out with both hands...

577
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,229
and Bast and Sekhmet,

578
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,906
they lead you into the green veldt...

579
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,863
where you can run forever.

580
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,408
That sounds very peaceful.

581
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,999
My father thought so.

582
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,003
I am not my father.

583
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,337
T'Challa...

584
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,332
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

585
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,712
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.

586
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,263
I'll kill him myself.

587
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Yeah?

588
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,265
You all right?

589
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,025
<i>Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.</i>

590
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,618
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.

591
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,615
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.

592
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,207
<i>For all of us.</i>

593
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,538
<i>Please.</i>

594
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,855
Are you saying you'll arrest me?

595
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,370
No.

596
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,376
Someone will.

597
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,757
<i>If you interfere.
That's how it works now.</i>

598
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,053
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.

599
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,386
<i>Why?</i>

600
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,886
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

601
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:20,978
Shit.

602
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,232
She tell you to stay out of it?

603
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:29,987
Might have a point.

604
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,270
He'd do it for me.

605
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,942
1945, maybe.

606
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,817
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

607
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,485
The people that shoot at you

608
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,070
usually wind up shooting at me.

609
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,249
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.

610
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,580
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.

611
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,412
Most of it's noise.

612
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,917
Except for this.

613
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,259
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...

614
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,591
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.

615
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,762
Thank you.

616
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,590
You're gonna have to hurry.

617
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,225
We have orders to shoot on sight.

618
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,311
<i>Homecoming</i>

619
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,070
<i>One</i>

620
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,615

<i>Freight car</i>

622
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,964
I have your breakfast.

623
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,799
I could smell it before I opened the door.

624
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,850
Side of bacon and black coffee.

625
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,510
Again.

626
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,062
I can make you something different,
if you like.

627
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,930
This is wonderful...

628
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,389
I will just put this on your...

629
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,399
It's okay, I can manage!

630
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,745
<i>Heads up, Cap.</i>

631
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,246
<i>German Special Forces,

632
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,248
Understood.

633
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,010
Do you know me?

634
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,551
You're Steve.

635
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,675
I read about you in a museum.

636
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,010
<i>They've set the perimeter.</i>

637
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,599
I know you're nervous,

638
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,147
and you have plenty of reason to be.

639
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,476
But you're lying.

640
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,730
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.

641
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,107
<i>They're entering the building.</i>

642
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,741
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.

643
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,656
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

644
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,278
That's smart.

645
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,579
Good strategy.

646
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,730
<i>They're on the roof. I'm compromised.</i>

647
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,518
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.

648
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,629
- It always ends in a fight.
<i>- Five seconds.</i>

649
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,176
You pulled me from the river.

650
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,808
Why?

651
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,392
- I don't know.
<i>- Three seconds.</i>

652
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,144
Yes, you do.

653
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,730
<i>Breach! Breach! Breach!</i>

654
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,295
Buck, stop!

655
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,003
You're gonna kill someone.

656
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,049
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

657
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,926
Suspect has broken containment!

658
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,827
He's headed down the east stairwell!

659
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,529
Come on, man.

660
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,552
Ahhh!

661
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,964
Sam, southwest rooftop.

662
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,424
<i>Who the hell's the other guy?</i>

663
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,756
About to find out.

664
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,232
- Sam.
<i>- Got him.</i>

665
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,230
<i>Stand down!</i>

666
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:14,868
<i>Stand down!</i>

667
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,389
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

668
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,727
Right behind you.

669
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,866
Stand down, now.

670
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,712
<i>Congratulations, Cap.</i>

671
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,623
<i>You're a criminal.</i>

672
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,571
<i>Your Highness.</i>

673
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,996
"A pinch of paprika."

674
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,124
A pinch.

675
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,786
Is that paprikash?

676
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,211
I thought it might lift your spirits.

677
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,723
Spirits lifted.

678
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,230
In my defense,

679
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,154
I haven't actually ever eaten
anything before, so...

680
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,488
May I?

681
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,574
Please.

682
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,907
- Wanda?
- Hmm.

683
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,033
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

684
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,505
Thanks.

685
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,625
Oh, you're welcome.

686
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,174
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.

687
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,377
They can't help but be afraid of you.

688
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,554
Are you?

689
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,384
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

690
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,267
I used to think of myself one way.

691
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,853
But after this...

692
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,438
I am something else.

693
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,105
I'm still me, I think, but...

694
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,906
that's not what everyone else sees.

695
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,997
Do you know, I don't know what this is?

696
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,127
Not really.

697
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,369
I know it's not of this world...

698
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,954
that it powered Loki's staff,

699
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,298
gave you your abilities, but...

700
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,969
its true nature is a mystery.

701
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,130
And yet, it is part of me.

702
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,465
Are you afraid of it?

703
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,642
I wish to understand it.

704
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,974
The more I do, the less it controls me.

705
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,061
One day... who knows?

706
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,475
I may even control it.

707
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:05,031
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

708
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,909
I'm gonna go to the store.

709
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,529
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

710
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,832
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

711
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,870
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

712
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,335
It is a question of safety.

713
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,420
I can protect myself.

714
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,256
Not yours.

715
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,507
Mr Stark would like to
avoid the possibility

716
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,471
of another public incident.

717
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:36,893
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

718
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,522
And what do you want?

719
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,145
For people to see you...

720
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,523
as I do.

721
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,691
So, you like cats?

722
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,521
- Sam.
- What?

723
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,278
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?

724
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,232
Your suit... it's vibranium?

725
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,121
The Black Panther
has been the protector

726
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,119
of Wakanda for generations.

727
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,499
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.

728
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,791
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

729
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,256
I also wear the mantle of king.

730
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,554
So, I ask you...

731
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,633
as both warrior and king...

732
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,597
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

733
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,704
What's gonna happen to him?

734
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:23,086
Same thing that ought to happen to you.

735
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,379
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

736
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,509
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.

737
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:28,968
What about a lawyer?

738
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,798
Lawyer. That's funny.

739
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,095
See their weapons are placed in lockup.

740
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,131
We'll write you a receipt.

741
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,643
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.

742
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,275
You'll be
provided with an office

743
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,727
instead of a cell.

744
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,733
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?

745
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,447
I don't intend on going anywhere.

746
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,237
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.

747
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,654
He's alive.

748
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,534
No.

749
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,999
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.

750
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,785
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.

751
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,874
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

752
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,415
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.

753
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,208
Obviously you can quote me on that,

754
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,821
because I just said it. Anything else?

755
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,881
Thank you, sir.

756
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,425
"Consequences"?

757
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,035
Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.

758
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,345
Had to give him something.

759
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,078
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?

760
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,748
Technically, it's the
government's property.

761
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:22,808
Wings, too.

762
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,188
That's cold.

763
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,765
Warmer than jail.

764
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,595
Hey, you wanna see
something cool?

765
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,552
I pulled something from Dad's archives.

766
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,384
Felt timely.

767
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:08,983
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

768
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,566
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

769
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,779
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

770
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,864
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.

771
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,989
I'm trying to... What do you call it?

772
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,248
That's an olive branch.

773
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,577
Is that what you call it?

774
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,464
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

775
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,005
We're kinda...

776
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,257
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?

777
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,214
No. Definitely not.

778
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,178
We're taking a break.

779
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,558
It's nobody's fault.

780
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,603
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

781
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,357
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

782
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,351
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

783
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,862
and then Ultron. My fault.

784
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,241
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

785
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,777
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

786
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,201
I don't wanna lose her.

787
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,991
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

788
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,792
In her defense, I'm a handful.

789
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,467
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

790
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,340
but he and Mom always made it work.

791
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,970
I'm glad Howard got married.

792
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,639
I only knew him
when he was young and single.

793
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,721
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

794
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,177
He never mentioned that.

795
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,971
Maybe only a thousand times.

796
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:30,974
God, I hated you.

797
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,602
I don't mean to make things difficult.

798
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,067
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

799
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,986
If I see a situation pointed south...

800
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,318
I can't ignore it.

801
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,778
Sometimes I wish I could.

802
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:44,991
No, you don't.

803
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,617
No, I don't.

804
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,337
Sometimes...

805
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:54,543
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

806
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,590
But I don't wanna see you gone.

807
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,835
We need you, Cap.

808
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,013
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

809
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,299
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

810
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,685
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-center...

811
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,811
instead of a Wakandan prison.

812
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,992
I'm not saying it's impossible...

813
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,195
but there would have to be safeguards.

814
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,408
Sure.

815
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,285
Once we put out the PR fire,

816
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,367
those documents can be amended.

817
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,438
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

818
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,294
Wanda? What about Wanda?

819
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,275
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

820
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,506
Vision's keeping her company.

821
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:38,676
Oh, God, Tony.

822
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,177
Every time I think you see
things the right way...

823
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,406
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

824
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,470
It's got a screening room.

825
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:44,784
There's worse ways to protect people.

826
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,844
Protection?

827
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,641
Is that how you see this?

828
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,764
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

829
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,332
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.

830
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,917
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

831
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:53,941
She's a kid!

832
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,391
Give me a break!

833
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,648
I'm doing what has to be done.

834
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,609
To stave off something worse.

835
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,526
You keep telling yourself that.

836
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,951
Hate to break up the set.

837
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,290
<i>Hello, Mr Barnes.</i>

838
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,335
<i>I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.</i>

839
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,720
<i>Do you mind if I sit?</i>

840
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,351
<i>Your first name is James?</i>

841
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,768
The receipt for your gear.

842
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,272
"Bird costume"? Come on.

843
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,152
I didn't write it.

844
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,743
<i>I'm not here to judge you.</i>

845
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,765
<i>I just want to ask you a few questions.</i>

846
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,700
<i>Do you know where you are, James?</i>

847
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,588
<i>I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.</i>

848
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,166
<i>My name is Bucky.</i>

849
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,635
Hello?

850
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,817
Hey!

851
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,001
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?

852
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,673
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?

853
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,714
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.

854
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,883
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

855
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,247
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.

856
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,103
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?

857
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,333
Steve, we looked
for the guy for two years

858
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,393
and found nothing.

859
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,517
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

860
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,942
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee

861
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,256
that whoever framed him would get him.

862
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,112
It guarantees that we would.

863
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,204
Yeah.

864
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,369
Tell me, Bucky.

865
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,077
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

866
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,546
<i>I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

867
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,833
You fear that if you open your mouth,

868
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,714
the horrors might never stop.

869
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,472
Don't worry.

870
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,890
We only have to talk about one.

871
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,087
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.

872
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,507
Friday, get me a source on that outage.

873
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,920
Sub-level five, East Wing.

874
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,808
What the hell is this?

875
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,593
Why don't we discuss your home?

876
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,809
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

877
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,351
I mean your real home.

878
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,737
<i>Longing</i>

879
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,453
No.

880
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:36,620
<i>Rusted</i>

881
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,072
Stop.

882
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,458
<i>Seventeen</i>

883
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:42,795
Stop.

884
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:46,173
<i>Daybreak</i>

885
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,430
<i>Furnace</i>

886
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:56,975
<i>Nine</i>

887
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,228
<i>Benign</i>

888
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,267
<i>Homecoming</i>

889
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,028
<i>One</i>

890
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,489
<i>Freight car</i>

891
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,164
Soldier?

892
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,377
Ready to comply.

893
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:38,592
Mission report. December 16, 1991.

894
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,611
Help me.

895
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,239
Help.

896
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,243
Get up.

897
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,538
Who are you? What do you want?

898
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,909
To see an empire fall.

899
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,076
Hey.

900
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,158
Evac all civilians.

901
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,731
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.

902
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,246
Please tell me you brought a suit.

903
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,881
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.

904
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,500
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.

905
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,502
Follow me.

906
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,321
<i>We're in position.</i>

907
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,808
You could at least recognise me.

908
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,158
Damn it.

909
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,674
<i>He asked me again
if you were going to be there.</i>

910
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,717
<i>I said I wasn't sure.</i>

911
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,638
<i>You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?</i>

912
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,048
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

913
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,637
<i>I love you.</i>

914
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:39,517
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...

915
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,143
escaped custody today.

916
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,363
Also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...

917
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,490
and Sam Wilson.

918
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,515
Hey, Cap!

919
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,402
Steve.

920
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,614
Which Bucky am I talking to?

921
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:31,326
Your mom's name was Sarah.

922
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,701
You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes.

923
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,336
Can't read that in a museum.

924
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,213
Just like that,
we're supposed to be cool?

925
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,002
What did I do?

926
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:45,874
Enough.

927
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,839
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.

928
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,299
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.

929
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,388
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.

930
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,216
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

931
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,350
People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...

932
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,895
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.

933
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,889
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."

934
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,229
He wanted to know about Siberia.

935
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,616
Where I was kept.

936
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,153
He wanted to know exactly where.

937
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,622
Why would he need to know that?

938
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,043
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.

939
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,382
It hurts!

940
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,175
Good work.

941
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,726
Get me out of here.

942
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,866
Who were they?

943
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,625
Their most elite death squad.

944
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,878
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

945
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,333
And that was before the serum.

946
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,623
They all turn out like you?

947
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,881
Worse.

948
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,297
The doctor, could he control them?

949
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,673
Enough.

950
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,679
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

951
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,549
With these guys, he could do it.

952
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,184
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

953
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,478
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize.

954
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,100
They can take a whole country down

955
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,831
in one night,
you'd never see them coming.

956
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,399
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

957
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,107
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.

958
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,200
Even if he did...

959
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,071
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.

960
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:01,538
We're on our own.

961
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:03,957
Maybe not.

962
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,412
I know a guy.

963
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:11,338
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

964
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,424
We will.

965
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,173
GSG 9's got the borders covered.

966
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,047
Recon's flying 24/7.

967
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,711
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

968
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,765
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

969
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,223
It's clear you can't be objective.

970
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:23,884
I'm putting Special Ops on this.

971
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:25,205
What happens
when the shooting starts?

972
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,515
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

973
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,937
If we're provoked.

974
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,396
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

975
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:35,358
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

976
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,281
Feel free to check my math.

977
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:39,886
All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this

978
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,151
with boys and bullets, Ross.

979
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,485
You gotta let us bring them in.

980
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,665
How would that end
any differently than last time?

981
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,790
Because this time,

982
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,553
I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.

983
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,660
72 hours, guaranteed.

984
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,670
36 hours.

985
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,502
Barnes.

986
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,343
Rogers.

987
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,138
Wilson.

988
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,968
Thank you, sir.

989
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,469
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?

990
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,022
You all right?

991
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,274
Always.

992
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,606
36 hours. Jeez.

993
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,821
We're seriously understaffed.

994
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,155
Oh, yeah.

995
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,288
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?

996
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,867
You really think he'd be on our side?

997
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,081
No.

998
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,540
I have an idea.

999
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:36,001
Me, too. Where's yours?

1000
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:38,004
Downstairs.

1001
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,338
Where's yours?

1002
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:02,691
Hey, May.

1003
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,029
Mmm. Hey.

1004
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,904
How was school today?

1005
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,323
It was okay.

1006
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,787
This crazy car parked outside.

1007
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,254
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...

1008
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,297
What are you doing...

1009
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,257
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.

1010
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,671
Tony.

1011
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,718
What are you doing here?

1012
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,178
It's about time we met.

1013
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,976
You've been getting my emails, right?

1014
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,769
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

1015
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,981
Regarding the...

1016
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,209
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

1017
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:35,877
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

1018
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:36,901
- Right.
- Yeah.

1019
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:37,984
Remember when you applied?

1020
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,106
Yeah.

1021
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,772
I approved, so now we're in business.

1022
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,488
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1023
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:45,762
You keeping secrets from me now?

1024
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,575
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1025
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:51,740
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1026
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,061
That's what I'm here to hash out.

1027
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,451
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1028
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,162
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

1029
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,581
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

1030
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,212
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

1031
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,905
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.

1032
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,718
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1033
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,133
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.

1034
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,387
Yeah? Wow.

1035
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:12,093
Look who you're talking to.

1036
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,308
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

1037
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,526
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1038
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,613
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1039
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,569
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

1040
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,850
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?

1041
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:32,955
Yeah, I was...

1042
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,499
Anyway, look, um,

1043
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,305
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1044
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,914
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.

1045
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,497
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1046
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,799
That's you, right?

1047
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,178
Um, no.

1048
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:46,803
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1049
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,422
Look at you go.

1050
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,718
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

1051
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,638
That's not easy. You got mad skills.

1052
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,730
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

1053
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,307
That's where you found that?

1054
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,587
Because you know that's all fake.

1055
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:01,811
It's all done on the computer.

1056
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,898
Mmm-hmm.

1057
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,071
It's like that video. What is it?

1058
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,121
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1059
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,201
Exactly.

1060
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,821
Oh, what have we here?

1061
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,912
Uh...

1062
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,795
You're the Spider-ling.

1063
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,831
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1064
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,260
Spider-Man.

1065
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,470
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1066
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,927
It's not a onesie.

1067
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,704
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1068
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,515
a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1069
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,853
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

1070
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,101
and Algebra test, nailed it.

1071
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,361
Who else knows? Anybody?

1072
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,065
Nobody.

1073
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,442
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1074
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,905
No. No.

1075
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,662
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1076
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,539
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1077
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,834
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1078
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,496
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1079
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:03,955
Who manufactured that?

1080
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,465
I did.

1081
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,134
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1082
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,545
Adhesive gloves?

1083
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,008
It's a long story. I was...

1084
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,848
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1085
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,018
Yes, I can.

1086
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,346
I'm blind!

1087
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,895
I can see in those.

1088
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:19,895
Okay?

1089
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,398
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1090
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,771
it's like my senses
have been dialed to 11.

1091
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:29,611
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1092
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,195
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1093
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,653
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1094
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:35,863
That's why I'm here.

1095
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:39,908
Why you doing this?

1096
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,498
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1097
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,508
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1098
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,339
Because...

1099
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,344
Because I've been me my whole life,

1100
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,093
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1101
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,719
Mmm-hmm.

1102
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,176
I read books, I build computers.

1103
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,059
Yeah, I would love to play football,

1104
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,749
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1105
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,433
Sure, because you're different.

1106
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,524
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1107
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:16,532
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1108
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,074
and then the bad things happen...

1109
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,451
they happen because of you.

1110
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,716
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1111
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,094
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1112
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:35,885
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1113
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,474
That's what it is.

1114
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,896
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1115
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,036
You got a passport?

1116
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,641
No, I don't even have a driver's license.

1117
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,122
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1118
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,208
Oh, you'll love it.

1119
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,330
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1120
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,004
I got homework.

1121
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,586
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1122
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,904
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1123
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,048
Might be a little dangerous.

1124
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,256
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1125
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,641
Don't tell Aunt May.

1126
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,559
All right, Spider-Man.

1127
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,398
Get me out of this.

1128
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,604
Sorry. I'll get the...

1129
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,781
What is it?

1130
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,369
Stay here, please.

1131
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,499
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1132
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:56,086
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1133
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,550
Disappointing my kids.

1134
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,843
I'm supposed to go water skiing.

1135
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,141
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1136
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,482
Clint!

1137
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,687
You should not be here.

1138
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,271
Really?

1139
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,865
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1140
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,326
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1141
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,496
Okay, they're considered.

1142
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,364
Okay, we gotta go.

1143
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,040
It's this way.

1144
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,418
I've caused enough problems.

1145
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:38,461
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1146
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,492
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1147
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,553
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1148
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,560
Shit.

1149
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,892
I knew I should've stretched.

1150
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,992
Clint, you can't overpower me.

1151
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,001
I know I can't.

1152
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,170
But she can.

1153
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,800
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1154
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,720
I'm leaving.

1155
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:20,962
I can't let you.

1156
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,351
I'm sorry.

1157
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,689
If you do this...

1158
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:36,144
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1159
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,948
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1160
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,412
Oh...

1161
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,799
Come on. We got one more stop.

1162
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:01,343
It's just a matter of time.

1163
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,173
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1164
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,882
and behavioral pattern scans.

1165
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,601
Move or you will be moved.

1166
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,563
As entertaining as that would be...

1167
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,899
You really think you can find him?

1168
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,068
My resources are considerable.

1169
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,608
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1170
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:26,194
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1171
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,076
You know where they are.

1172
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,332
I know someone who does.

1173
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,625
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.

1174
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:37,715
It's low profile.

1175
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:41,085
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1176
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,420
Can you move your seat up?

1177
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:45,714
No.

1178
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,010
I owe you again.

1179
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,225
Keeping a list.

1180
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,097
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.

1181
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,733
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.

1182
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:03,281
They're going to come looking for you.

1183
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,367
I know.

1184
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,528
Thank you, Sharon.

1185
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,096
That was...

1186
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:26,174
Late.

1187
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,264
Damn right.

1188
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:32,770
I should go.

1189
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:33,938
Okay.

1190
01:26:58,505 --> 01:26:59,666
Cap.

1191
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,110
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.

1192
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,534
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.

1193
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:06,010
Besides, I owe a debt.

1194
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:07,715
Thanks for having my back.

1195
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,380
It was time to get off my ass.

1196
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:11,591
How about our other recruit?

1197
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,350
He's rarin' to go.

1198
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,586
Had to put a little coffee in him...

1199
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:17,806
but he should be good.

1200
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,685
What time zone is this?

1201
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,695
Come on. Come on.

1202
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,738
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.

1203
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:31,829
It's an honor.

1204
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,079
I'm shaking your hand too long.

1205
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,490
Wow! This is awesome!

1206
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,292
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!

1207
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,048
Jeez.

1208
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,003
Ah, look, I wanna say,

1209
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,176
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1210
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:49,970
thinks for thanking of me.

1211
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:51,930
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?

1212
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,184
Uh, good to see you.

1213
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,828
Look, what happened last time when I...

1214
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,054
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

1215
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,518
They tell you what we're up against?

1216
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,901
Something about
some psycho-assassins?

1217
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,274
We're outside the law on this one.

1218
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,321
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1219
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,278
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1220
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,535
We should get moving.

1221
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,285
We got a chopper lined up.

1222
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:19,705
They're evacuating the airport.

1223
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:20,959
Stark.

1224
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:22,046
Stark?

1225
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,089
Suit up.

1226
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,882
<i>Wow, it's so weird
how you run into people at the airport.</i>

1227
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,592
- Don't you think that's weird?
<i>- Definitely weird.</i>

1228
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:50,902
Hear me out, Tony.

1229
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:54,030
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

1230
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,496
<i>Captain.</i>

1231
01:28:58,667 --> 01:28:59,667
Your Highness.

1232
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,168
Anyway...

1233
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,623
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.

1234
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:06,710
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

1235
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,299
You're after the wrong guy.

1236
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,422
Your judgment is askew.

1237
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:13,136
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

1238
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:16,094
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.

1239
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,642
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.

1240
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:19,973
Steve...

1241
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,014
you know what's about to happen.

1242
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,441
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?

1243
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,522
All right, I've run out of patience.

1244
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:32,616
Underoos!

1245
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,414
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.

1246
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,478
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

1247
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,334
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.

1248
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:45,620
It's perfect. Thank you.

1249
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,608
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.

1250
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,713
Okay. Cap. Captain.

1251
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,129
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

1252
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,405
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.

1253
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,216
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.

1254
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:55,723
You've been busy.

1255
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,928
And you've been a complete idiot.

1256
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,018
Dragging in Clint...

1257
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,601
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place

1258
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,804
she doesn't even want
to leave, a safe place.

1259
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,222
I'm trying to keep...

1260
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,518
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

1261
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:11,320
You did that when you signed.

1262
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,485
All right, we're done.

1263
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,691
You're gonna turn Barnes over,

1264
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:17,947
you're gonna come with us,
now, because it's us...

1265
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,862
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

1266
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,657
with no compunction
about being impolite.

1267
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:25,830
Come on.

1268
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,541
<i>We found it.</i>

1269
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,924
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.

1270
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,425
All right, Lang.

1271
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,257
Hey, guys, something...

1272
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:41,805
Whoa.
What the hell was that?

1273
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,845
<i>I believe this is yours, Captain America.</i>

1274
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,022
Oh, great.

1275
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,500
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.

1276
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,085
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

1277
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,520
<i>Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?</i>

1278
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,728
<i>Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.</i>

1279
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:52,905
<i>Barnes is mine.</i>

1280
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,614
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?

1281
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:56,698
What we discussed.

1282
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:57,845
Keep your distance, web them up.

1283
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:59,076
Okay, copy that.

1284
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:05,450
<i>Move, Captain.</i>

1285
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,292
<i>I won't ask a second time.</i>

1286
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,151
<i>Look, I really don't want to hurt you.</i>

1287
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,169
I wouldn't stress about it.

1288
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:26,729
What the hell is that?

1289
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,981
Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1290
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:36,898
You have a metal arm?

1291
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,611
That is awesome, dude.

1292
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,810
You have the right to remain silent!

1293
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:57,954
<i>Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...</i>

1294
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,374
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1295
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,514
<i>Wanda, I think you hurt
Vision's feelings.</i>

1296
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:08,099
You locked me in my room.

1297
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:09,754
<i>Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.</i>

1298
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:12,149
<i>Second, I did it to protect you.</i>

1299
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:13,609
<i>- Hey, Clint.</i>
- Hey, man.

1300
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,436
<i>Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.</i>

1301
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,154
<i>You got tired of shooting golf?</i>

1302
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:19,690
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1303
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:21,825
Just can't seem to miss.

1304
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,742
<i>First time for everything.</i>

1305
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:26,915
Made you look.

1306
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:39,176
<i>Multiple contusions detected.</i>

1307
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,961
Yeah, I detected that, too.

1308
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:49,891
Oh, God!

1309
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:52,807
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

1310
01:32:58,364 --> 01:32:59,525
Ahh!

1311
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:06,199
Those wings carbon fiber?

1312
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,694
Is this stuff coming out of you?

1313
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,518
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,

1314
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,062
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.

1315
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,855
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...

1316
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:14,559
but there's usually not this much talking.

1317
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:15,667
All right, sorry. My bad.

1318
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,378
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,

1319
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:24,088
but I've only got one job here today...

1320
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:27,308
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

1321
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:32,931
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1322
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:34,560
I hate you.

1323
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:42,157
<i>Great.</i>

1324
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:43,733
<i>Hey, Cap, heads-up!</i>

1325
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,819
<i>Throw it at this.</i>

1326
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:48,449
<i>Now!</i>

1327
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,246
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

1328
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:59,002
<i>Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.</i>

1329
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,049
<i>Uh, sorry.</i>

1330
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,386
<i>All right, now I'm pissed.</i>

1331
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:06,680
Is this part of the plan?

1332
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,386
<i>Well, my plan was go easy on them.</i>

1333
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,557
<i>You wanna switch it up?</i>

1334
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,021
There's our ride.

1335
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,483
Come on!

1336
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,532
Captain Rogers...

1337
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,572
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1338
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:33,206
But for the collective good...

1339
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,709
you must surrender now.

1340
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:54,428
What do we do, Cap?

1341
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,897
We fight.

1342
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:00,100
This is gonna end well.

1343
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:08,279
They're not stopping.

1344
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:09,453
Neither are we.

1345
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:41,559
We're still friends, right?

1346
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,193
Depends on how hard you hit me.

1347
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,037
You were pulling your punches.

1348
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,668
I didn't kill your father.

1349
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:01,537
<i>Then why did you run?</i>

1350
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:21,772
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1351
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,963
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.

1352
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,569
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.

1353
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,118
He also said to go for your legs.

1354
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,590
Ahhh!

1355
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,218
Clint, can you get him off me?

1356
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:51,549
Buckled in?

1357
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,134
<i>Yeah. No, I'm good.</i>

1358
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:55,345
<i>I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!</i>

1359
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,447
Stark tell you anything else?

1360
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:21,492
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1361
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,285
That makes you dangerous.

1362
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:29,712
Guess he had a point.

1363
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,924
You got heart, kid. Where you from?

1364
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:38,809
Queens.

1365
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:41,438
Brooklyn.

1366
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:48,439
<i>Friday?</i>

1367
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,798
<i>We have some
weapon systems offline.</i>

1368
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:50,822
What?

1369
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:53,399
<i>Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.</i>

1370
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,033
Who's speaking?

1371
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:58,913
<i>It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.</i>

1372
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,123
Friday?

1373
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:01,528
<i>Deploying fire
suppression system.</i>

1374
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:03,668
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1375
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:06,630
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

1376
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:10,342
<i>Whoa!</i>

1377
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:18,056
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1378
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:19,592
We gotta draw out the flyers.

1379
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:21,510
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.

1380
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:23,429
No, you get to the jet!

1381
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:24,564
<i>Both of you!</i>

1382
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,462
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1383
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:29,630
As much as I hate to admit it...

1384
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:31,111
<i>if we're gonna win this one,</i>

1385
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,779
<i>some of us might have to lose it.</i>

1386
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:34,986
<i>This isn't the real fight, Steve.</i>

1387
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,695
All right, Sam. What's the play?

1388
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,077
We need a diversion. Something big.

1389
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:42,448
<i>I got something kinda big.</i>

1390
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:43,874
<i>But I can't hold it very long.</i>

1391
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,285
<i>On my signal, run like hell.</i>

1392
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:49,087
<i>And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.</i>

1393
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,317
He's gonna tear himself in half?

1394
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,798
You sure about this, Scott?

1395
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,341
<i>I do it all the time.</i>

1396
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:55,340
<i>I mean, once. In a lab.</i>

1397
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,175
<i>Then I passed out.</i>

1398
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,180
<i>I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.</i>

1399
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,732
Holy shit!

1400
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,904
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1401
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,040
I guess that's the signal.

1402
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:27,751
Way to go, Tic Tac!

1403
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,041
Give me back my Rhodey.

1404
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:35,926
I got him.

1405
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:01,114
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking

1406
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:03,056
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...

1407
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,196
I'm open to suggestions.

1408
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,956
<i>You wanna get to them...</i>

1409
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:15,249
<i>you gotta go through me.</i>

1410
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:27,345
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1411
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,743
We haven't met yet.

1412
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:47,948
- I'm Clint.
<i>- I don't care.</i>

1413
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:03,217
Whoa!

1414
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:09,271
Ahhh!

1415
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:16,861
Get off!

1416
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,459
<i>Something just flew in me!</i>

1417
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:58,695
You're not gonna stop.

1418
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,363
You know I can't.

1419
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:02,440
I'm gonna regret this.

1420
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,406
Go.

1421
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:15,122
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,

1422
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:17,124
<i>Empire Strikes Back?</i>

1423
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:18,713
<i>Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?</i>

1424
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,027
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.

1425
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:21,051
He's on the young side.

1426
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:26,213
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...

1427
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:28,966
with the walking thingies?

1428
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:32,581
Maybe the kid's onto something.

1429
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:33,605
High now, Tony. Go high.

1430
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:43,073
Yes!

1431
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,198
That was awesome!

1432
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:02,917
Does anyone have any orange slices?

1433
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:09,474
Kid, you all right?

1434
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:10,684
Whoa!

1435
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,686
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.

1436
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:15,936
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

1437
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,314
- That was scary.
- Yeah.

1438
01:43:17,483 --> 01:43:19,099
You're done, all right?

1439
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:20,276
What? I'm good, I'm fine.

1440
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,421
You did a good job. Stay down.

1441
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:22,756
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.

1442
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,924
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!

1443
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:25,109
- Dude.
- You're done!

1444
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:26,318
Wait.

1445
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:29,485
Mr Stark, wait.
I'm not done. I'm not...

1446
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:33,951
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

1447
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:52,349
I said
I'd help you find him, not catch him.

1448
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,475
There's a difference.

1449
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:02,318
I'm sorry.

1450
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:03,984
Me, too.

1451
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:05,905
It's as I said.

1452
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,069
Catastrophe.

1453
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,837
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.

1454
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:28,595
<i>Vision! You copy?</i>

1455
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,755
<i>Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.</i>

1456
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:47,062
<i>Rhodey!</i>

1457
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:50,653
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

1458
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:00,242
Rhodes!

1459
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:14,055
Read vitals.

1460
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,466
<i>Heartbeat detected.</i>

1461
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:17,635
<i>Emergency medical is on its way.</i>

1462
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:23,817
I'm sorry.

1463
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:47,421
This is room 201...

1464
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,375
Bacon and black coffee again today?

1465
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:53,298
You know me so well...

1466
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:56,764
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

1467
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:58,768
May I let myself in?

1468
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:25,452
What's gonna happen to your friends?

1469
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:35,590
Whatever it is...

1470
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:37,797
I'll deal with it.

1471
01:46:40,895 --> 01:46:42,727
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.

1472
01:46:50,195 --> 01:46:51,811
What you did all those years...

1473
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,356
It wasn't you.

1474
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,987
You didn't have a choice.

1475
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,778
I know.

1476
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,582
But I did it.

1477
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:20,924
How did this happen?

1478
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:23,135
I became distracted.

1479
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,556
I didn't think that was possible.

1480
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:30,646
Neither did I.

1481
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:50,204
The doctors say
he shattered L4 through S1.

1482
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:53,124
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.

1483
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,917
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.

1484
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:00,800
Steve's not gonna stop.

1485
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,636
If you don't either,

1486
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,120
Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

1487
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:05,305
You let them go, Nat.

1488
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:06,515
We played this wrong.

1489
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:07,930
"We"?

1490
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:09,435
Boy, it must be hard to

1491
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:11,085
shake the whole
double agent thing, huh?

1492
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:12,817
It sticks in the DNA.

1493
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:16,821
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...

1494
01:48:17,116 --> 01:48:19,073
for one goddamn second?

1495
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:25,622
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...

1496
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:28,575
they're coming for you.

1497
01:48:29,628 --> 01:48:32,371
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.

1498
01:48:41,015 --> 01:48:42,381
What am I looking at, Friday?

1499
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:44,841
<i>Priority upload
from Berlin police.</i>

1500
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,387
Fire up the chopper.

1501
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:57,149
<i>The Task Force
called for a psychiatrist</i>

1502
01:48:57,322 --> 01:48:58,938
<i>as soon as Barnes was captured.</i>

1503
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:01,445
<i>The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard</i>

1504
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:02,909
<i>from Geneva within the hour.</i>

1505
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:04,740
<i>He was met by this man.</i>

1506
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:05,974
Did you run
facial recognition yet?

1507
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:06,998
<i>What do I look like?</i>

1508
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:09,296
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.

1509
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,996
<i>You must be thinking of someone else.</i>

1510
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:12,164
Must be.

1511
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:15,000
<i>The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.</i>

1512
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:18,420
<i>Sokovian Intelligence.</i>

1513
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:21,468
<i>Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...</i>

1514
01:49:21,638 --> 01:49:24,096
<i>a Sokovian covert kill squad.</i>

1515
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:27,801
What happened to the real Broussard?

1516
01:49:27,895 --> 01:49:29,761
<i>He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.</i>

1517
01:49:29,938 --> 01:49:32,646
<i>Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...</i>

1518
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:36,856
<i>approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.</i>

1519
01:49:37,905 --> 01:49:39,692
Son of a bitch.

1520
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,657
- Get this to Ross.
<i>- Yes, boss.</i>

1521
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:19,162
<i>This is Raft Prison Control.</i>

1522
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:21,756
<i>You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.</i>

1523
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:56,165
So? You got the files?

1524
01:51:56,418 --> 01:51:57,579
Let's reroute the satellites,

1525
01:51:57,753 --> 01:51:59,665
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.

1526
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:01,921
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

1527
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:04,131
after that fiasco in Leipzig?

1528
01:52:04,343 --> 01:52:06,630
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.

1529
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:40,076
The Futurist, gentlemen!

1530
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:42,712
The Futurist is here!

1531
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,167
He sees all!

1532
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:48,259
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1533
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:49,845
Give me a break, Barton.

1534
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:52,555
<i>I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.</i>

1535
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:55,846
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1536
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:59,179
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.

1537
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:01,723
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1538
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,186
Criminals?

1539
01:53:04,403 --> 01:53:06,190
Criminals, Tony.

1540
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:09,030
Think that's the word you're looking for.

1541
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:11,361
Right?

1542
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:14,031
That didn't used to mean me.

1543
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:15,657
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1544
01:53:15,914 --> 01:53:17,450
But here we are.

1545
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:19,286
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.

1546
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:20,459
I didn't make you.

1547
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,960
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.

1548
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:27,210
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

1549
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:28,695
I don't understand, why didn't you

1550
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,639
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?

1551
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,720
You gotta watch your back with this guy.

1552
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:37,134
There's a chance he's gonna break it.

1553
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:41,854
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1554
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:44,102
Who are you?

1555
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,522
Come on, man.

1556
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:49,066
How's Rhodes?

1557
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:52,073
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...

1558
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,320
so fingers crossed.

1559
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:56,452
What do you need? They feed you yet?

1560
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:00,156
You're the good cop, now?

1561
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:02,812
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

1562
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,418
Well, you better go get a bad cop...

1563
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,774
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...

1564
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:08,710
to get information out of me.

1565
01:54:08,967 --> 01:54:10,833
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

1566
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:13,921
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.

1567
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:15,926
What'd you do?

1568
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:17,635
Get it back up!

1569
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:19,727
Just look.

1570
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:22,140
Because that...

1571
01:54:22,314 --> 01:54:24,394
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.

1572
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:28,564
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1573
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:30,273
That's a first.

1574
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:31,980
Cap is definitely off the reservation...

1575
01:54:32,074 --> 01:54:33,914
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

1576
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,219
We don't know each other very well.

1577
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,324
You don't have to...

1578
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,619
Hey, it's all right.

1579
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,162
Look, I'll tell you...

1580
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:51,174
but you have to go alone and as a friend.

1581
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:54,005
Easy.

1582
01:54:56,973 --> 01:54:57,973
Stark?

1583
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,262
Did he give you anything on Rogers?

1584
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:01,555
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1585
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:03,435
I'm going back to the compound instead,

1586
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:05,520
but you can call me anytime.

1587
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:07,770
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.

1588
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:18,489
You remember that time
we had to ride back

1589
01:56:18,513 --> 01:56:20,721
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?

1590
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:23,049
Was that the time
we used our train money

1591
01:56:23,143 --> 01:56:24,304
to buy hot dogs?

1592
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:27,478
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1593
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,190
What was her name, again?

1594
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,106
Dolores. You called her Dot.

1595
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:33,411
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.

1596
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:34,606
So are we, pal.

1597
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:46,539
He can't have
been here more than a few hours.

1598
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,700
Long enough to wake them up.

1599
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:31,877
You ready?

1600
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,045
Yeah.

1601
01:57:46,643 --> 01:57:48,635
You seem a little defensive.

1602
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,141
It's been a long day.

1603
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,772
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

1604
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:55,149
Then why are you here?

1605
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,899
Could be your story's not so crazy.

1606
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:00,072
Maybe.

1607
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:04,488
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1608
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,571
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.

1609
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:10,553
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.

1610
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:15,498
It's good to see you, Tony.

1611
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:16,714
You too, Cap.

1612
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:20,083
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.

1613
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:22,168
There's a truce here. You can drop...

1614
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:43,447
<i>I got heat signatures.</i>

1615
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:45,074
How many?

1616
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:47,985
<i>Uh, one.</i>

1617
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,882
<i>If it's any comfort,</i>

1618
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:10,508
<i>they died in their sleep.</i>

1619
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:20,651
<i>Did you really think
I wanted more of you?</i>

1620
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,528
What the hell?

1621
01:59:24,324 --> 01:59:26,111
<i>I'm grateful to them, though.</i>

1622
01:59:27,202 --> 01:59:28,738
<i>They brought you here.</i>

1623
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,165
<i>Please, Captain.</i>

1624
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:37,122
<i>The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand</i>

1625
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:39,795
<i>the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.</i>

1626
01:59:39,964 --> 01:59:41,751
<i>I'm betting I could beat that.</i>

1627
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:43,632
<i>Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.</i>

1628
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:45,668
<i>Given time.</i>

1629
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,761
<i>But then you'd never know
why you came.</i>

1630
01:59:47,972 --> 01:59:50,430
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?

1631
01:59:57,232 --> 02:00:00,851
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

1632
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:03,269
I studied you.

1633
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,191
I followed you.

1634
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:07,611
But now that you're standing here...

1635
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:09,776
I just realised...

1636
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:14,447
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

1637
02:00:16,876 --> 02:00:19,334
How nice to find a flaw.

1638
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:21,503
You're Sokovian.

1639
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:24,165
Is that what this is about?

1640
02:00:24,342 --> 02:00:27,835
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.

1641
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:29,087
No.

1642
02:00:30,432 --> 02:00:33,391
I'm here because I made a promise.

1643
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:37,811
You lost someone?

1644
02:00:41,693 --> 02:00:43,730
I lost everyone.

1645
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:47,154
And so will you.

1646
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:57,074
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.

1647
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,285
But one which crumbles from within?

1648
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:03,412
That's dead.

1649
02:01:04,549 --> 02:01:05,549
Forever.

1650
02:01:14,392 --> 02:01:16,008
I know that road.

1651
02:01:18,396 --> 02:01:19,396
What is this?

1652
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,286
<i>Help my wife.</i>

1653
02:01:45,423 --> 02:01:47,710
<i>Please. Help.</i>

1654
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:54,387
<i>Sergeant Barnes?</i>

1655
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:57,474
<i>Howard!</i>

1656
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:06,104
<i>Howard!</i>

1657
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:45,105
No, Tony.

1658
02:02:54,284 --> 02:02:55,491
Did you know?

1659
02:02:57,996 --> 02:02:59,237
I didn't know it was him.

1660
02:02:59,414 --> 02:03:01,827
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

1661
02:03:05,712 --> 02:03:06,748
Yes.

1662
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:05,185
Get out of here!

1663
02:04:16,658 --> 02:04:17,364
It wasn't him, Tony.

1664
02:04:17,533 --> 02:04:18,636
HYDRA had control of his mind!

1665
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,660
Move!

1666
02:04:19,702 --> 02:04:20,702
It wasn't him!

1667
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:31,044
<i>Left boot jet failing.</i>

1668
02:04:31,923 --> 02:04:34,040
<i>Flight systems compromised.</i>

1669
02:04:34,759 --> 02:04:35,759
Ah, crap.

1670
02:04:49,524 --> 02:04:51,231
He's not gonna stop. Go.

1671
02:05:14,257 --> 02:05:15,257
Come on, come on.

1672
02:05:15,425 --> 02:05:16,961
<i>Targeting system's
knackered, boss.</i>

1673
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:18,176
I'm eyeballing it.

1674
02:05:36,779 --> 02:05:38,395
Do you even remember them?

1675
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,280
I remember all of them.

1676
02:06:03,139 --> 02:06:05,131
This isn't gonna change what happened.

1677
02:06:05,308 --> 02:06:06,799
I don't care.

1678
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:08,717
He killed my mom.

1679
02:07:10,206 --> 02:07:11,788
<i>You should have
seen his little face.</i>

1680
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:13,536
<i>Just try, okay?</i>

1681
02:07:13,709 --> 02:07:15,541
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

1682
02:07:15,711 --> 02:07:17,373
<i>I love you.</i>

1683
02:07:25,346 --> 02:07:27,759
I almost killed the wrong man.

1684
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:30,883
Hardly an innocent one.

1685
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:32,892
This is all you wanted?

1686
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:36,221
To see them rip each other apart.

1687
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:42,811
My father lived outside the city.

1688
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:46,072
I thought we would be safe there.

1689
02:07:46,701 --> 02:07:48,567
My son was excited.

1690
02:07:48,744 --> 02:07:51,578
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

1691
02:07:52,582 --> 02:07:55,791
I told my wife, "Don't worry.

1692
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,920
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

1693
02:08:02,258 --> 02:08:04,591
When the dust cleared...

1694
02:08:05,428 --> 02:08:07,795
and the screaming stopped...

1695
02:08:08,556 --> 02:08:12,470
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

1696
02:08:14,812 --> 02:08:16,394
My father...

1697
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:20,770
still holding my wife and son in his arms.

1698
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:27,231
And the Avengers?

1699
02:08:28,242 --> 02:08:29,983
They went home.

1700
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:34,116
I knew I couldn't kill them.

1701
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:36,782
More powerful men than me have tried.

1702
02:08:39,003 --> 02:08:41,245
<i>But, if I could get them
to kill each other...</i>

1703
02:08:45,801 --> 02:08:48,589
I'm sorry about your father.

1704
02:08:49,013 --> 02:08:50,845
He seemed a good man.

1705
02:08:52,642 --> 02:08:54,133
With a dutiful son.

1706
02:08:58,856 --> 02:09:00,643
Vengeance has consumed you.

1707
02:09:03,444 --> 02:09:05,777
It's consuming them.

1708
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:11,783
I am done letting it consume me.

1709
02:09:15,498 --> 02:09:17,831
Justice will come soon enough.

1710
02:09:21,170 --> 02:09:23,002
Tell that to the dead.

1711
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:30,218
The living are not done with you, yet.

1712
02:09:33,057 --> 02:09:35,515
<i>You can't beat him
hand-to-hand.</i>

1713
02:09:36,644 --> 02:09:37,805
Analyze his fight pattern.

1714
02:09:38,104 --> 02:09:39,265
<i>Scanning.</i>

1715
02:09:43,985 --> 02:09:45,021
<i>Countermeasures ready.</i>

1716
02:09:47,196 --> 02:09:48,196
Let's kick his ass.

1717
02:10:01,877 --> 02:10:03,163
He's my friend.

1718
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:04,957
So was I.

1719
02:10:12,013 --> 02:10:14,096
<i>Stay down. Final warning.</i>

1720
02:10:28,571 --> 02:10:30,733
I could do this all day.

1721
02:11:37,098 --> 02:11:39,340
That shield doesn't belong to you.

1722
02:11:40,976 --> 02:11:42,638
You don't deserve it.

1723
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:44,849
My father made that shield!

1724
02:12:20,516 --> 02:12:22,348
Meals at 8 and 5.

1725
02:12:22,518 --> 02:12:24,134
Toilet privileges twice a day.

1726
02:12:26,522 --> 02:12:28,684
Raise your voice, zap.

1727
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:31,350
Touch the glass, zap.

1728
02:12:31,694 --> 02:12:33,686
You step out of line, you deal with me.

1729
02:12:33,863 --> 02:12:36,025
Please, step out of line, hmm?

1730
02:12:38,242 --> 02:12:39,653
So how does it feel?

1731
02:12:40,578 --> 02:12:43,036
To spend all that time, all that effort...

1732
02:12:45,916 --> 02:12:50,035
to see it fail so spectacularly?

1733
02:12:54,049 --> 02:12:55,290
Did it?

1734
02:13:20,784 --> 02:13:21,900
It's just the first pass.

1735
02:13:22,036 --> 02:13:23,036
Yeah.

1736
02:13:23,078 --> 02:13:25,115
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

1737
02:13:25,289 --> 02:13:27,952
Shock absorption, lateral movement.

1738
02:13:28,584 --> 02:13:29,584
Cup holder?

1739
02:13:29,752 --> 02:13:31,472
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...

1740
02:13:31,587 --> 02:13:32,623
Ow.

1741
02:13:35,216 --> 02:13:36,456
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1742
02:13:36,592 --> 02:13:38,254
No. Don't help me.

1743
02:13:41,472 --> 02:13:42,472
Ah.

1744
02:13:54,318 --> 02:13:55,604
138.

1745
02:13:56,445 --> 02:13:59,062
138 combat missions.

1746
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:00,981
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1747
02:14:01,242 --> 02:14:04,280
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.

1748
02:14:06,163 --> 02:14:07,699
Because the fight needed to be fought.

1749
02:14:08,207 --> 02:14:09,823
It's the same with these Accords.

1750
02:14:10,501 --> 02:14:13,994
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.

1751
02:14:15,965 --> 02:14:18,002
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...

1752
02:14:19,301 --> 02:14:21,133
This is a bad beat.

1753
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:24,796
But it hasn't changed my mind.

1754
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:27,841
I don't think.

1755
02:14:38,279 --> 02:14:39,645
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1756
02:14:42,992 --> 02:14:45,985
Are you Tony Stank?

1757
02:14:46,203 --> 02:14:50,447
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

1758
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,331
Thank you for that!

1759
02:14:52,501 --> 02:14:54,333
Never dropping that, by the way.

1760
02:14:54,503 --> 02:14:56,415
"Table for one, Mr Stank.

1761
02:14:56,505 --> 02:14:57,666
"Please, by the bathroom."

1762
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:05,221
<i>Tony...</i>

1763
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:08,347
<i>I'm glad you're back at the compound.</i>

1764
02:15:08,517 --> 02:15:11,555
<i>I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.</i>

1765
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:13,095
<i>We all need family.</i>

1766
02:15:14,523 --> 02:15:18,358
<i>The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.</i>

1767
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:21,691
<i>I've been on my own since I was 18.</i>

1768
02:15:22,489 --> 02:15:25,152
<i>I never really fit in anywhere,</i>

1769
02:15:25,242 --> 02:15:27,074
<i>even in the Army.</i>

1770
02:15:28,704 --> 02:15:31,868
<i>My faith's in people, I guess.</i>

1771
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:33,248
<i>Individuals.</i>

1772
02:15:34,209 --> 02:15:37,247
<i>And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...</i>

1773
02:15:37,421 --> 02:15:39,037
<i>they haven't let me down.</i>

1774
02:15:41,050 --> 02:15:43,542
<i>Which is why I can't
let them down either.</i>

1775
02:15:47,514 --> 02:15:50,882
<i>Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.</i>

1776
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:54,887
<i>I know I hurt you, Tony.</i>

1777
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:58,148
<i>I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...</i>

1778
02:15:58,233 --> 02:16:00,566
<i>I was sparing you...</i>

1779
02:16:00,736 --> 02:16:03,399
<i>but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.</i>

1780
02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:05,898
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

1781
02:16:06,075 --> 02:16:08,237
<i>Hopefully one day you can understand.</i>

1782
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:10,860
<i>I wish we agreed on the Accords.</i>

1783
02:16:10,954 --> 02:16:12,536
<i>I really do.</i>

1784
02:16:12,706 --> 02:16:14,267
<i>I know you're doing what you believe in,</i>

1785
02:16:14,291 --> 02:16:15,827
<i>and that's all any of us can do.</i>

1786
02:16:15,918 --> 02:16:17,284
<i>That's all any of us should.</i>

1787
02:16:17,378 --> 02:16:19,370
<i>Priority call
from Secretary Ross.</i>

1788
02:16:19,463 --> 02:16:21,750
<i>There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.</i>

1789
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:24,791
Yeah, put him through.

1790
02:16:25,928 --> 02:16:27,385
<i>Tony, we have a problem.</i>

1791
02:16:27,471 --> 02:16:29,463
- Uh, please hold.
<i>- No, don't.</i>

1792
02:16:32,226 --> 02:16:33,592
<i>So no matter what...</i>

1793
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:36,102
<i>I promise you...</i>

1794
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:37,892
<i>if you need us...</i>

1795
02:16:38,774 --> 02:16:40,731
<i>if you need me...</i>

1796
02:16:44,988 --> 02:16:46,274
<i>I'll be there.</i>

1797
02:18:45,609 --> 02:18:46,645
You sure about this?

1798
02:18:48,862 --> 02:18:50,728
I can't trust my own mind.

1799
02:18:53,534 --> 02:18:56,117
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...

1800
02:18:56,286 --> 02:18:58,744
I think going back under
is the best thing.

1801
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,947
For everybody.

1802
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:24,596
Thank you for this.

1803
02:19:27,109 --> 02:19:29,146
Your friend and my father...

1804
02:19:30,112 --> 02:19:31,944
they were both victims.

1805
02:19:33,448 --> 02:19:36,782
If I can help one of them find peace...

1806
02:19:39,621 --> 02:19:42,329
You know, if they find out he's here...

1807
02:19:42,499 --> 02:19:44,536
they'll come for him.

1808
02:19:46,461 --> 02:19:48,123
Let them try.

1809
02:23:39,027 --> 02:23:43,442

Some guy.

So itchy, man, God.

What's "some guy's" name?

Uh, Steve.

Steve? From 12-C?

- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.

You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.

Ouch.
