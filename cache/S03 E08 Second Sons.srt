1
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,153
I'll give you one try, girl.

2
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,908
Kill me and you're free.

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,453
But if I live, I'll break both your hands.

4
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,791
Go on, hit me.

5
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,251
Hit me hard.

6
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,513
8qu all you want.

7
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,058
The truth is, you're lucky.

8
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,270
You don't want to be alone out here, girl.

9
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,940
Someone worse than me would find you.

10
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,858
There's no one worse than you.

11
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,277
You never knew my brother.

12
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,738
He once killed a man for snoring.

13
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
There's plenty worse than me.

14
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,870
There's men who like to beat little
girls, men who like to rape them.

15
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,623
I saved your sister from some of them.

16
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,292
You're lying.

17
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,211
Ask her, if you ever see her again.

18
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,632
Ask her who came back
for her when the mob had her on her back.

19
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,011
They would have taken her every which way

20
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,472
and left her there with
her throat cut open.

21
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,479
Is that the Blackwater?

22
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,356
The Blackwater?

23
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,192
Where do you think I'm taking you?

24
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,281
Back to king's landing,
to Joffrey and the queen.

25
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,908
Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen.

26
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:06,121
That's the red fork.
I'm taking you to the twins.

27
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,291
But why?

28
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:14,379
Your mother and brother will be
there, and they'll pay me for you.

29
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,675
Why would they be at the twins?

30
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,054
Those outlaws
you love so much never told you?

31
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,974
The whole countryside is yapping about it.

32
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,686
Your uncle is marrying
one of the frey girls.

33
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,230
So quit trying to bash my skull in,

34
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:36,359
and we might
just make it there in time for the wedding.

35
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,045
Men who fight for gold
have neither honor nor loyalty.

36
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,339
They cannot be trusted.

37
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,841
Jorah: They can be
trusted to kill you if they're well paid.

38
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,093
The yunkish are paying them well.

39
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,887
You know these men?

40
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,056
Only by the broken swords on their banners.

41
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,684
They're called the second sons.

42
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:14,815
A company led by
a braavosi named mero, the titan's bastard.

43
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,692
Is he more titan or bastard?

44
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,571
He's a dangerous man,
khaleesi. They all are.

45
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,407
How many?

46
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,412
Barristan: 2,000, your grace.
Armored and mounted.

47
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,498
Enough to make a difference?

48
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,463
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.

49
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,174
I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for the winning side.

50
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,385
I imagine you're right.

51
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,722
I'd like to talk
to the titan's bastard about winning.

52
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,766
He may not agree to meet.

53
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,184
He will.

54
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,105
A man who fights
for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.

55
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,274
Barristan: Your grace, allow me to present

56
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,484
the captains of the second sons,

57
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,612
mero of braavos,

58
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,615
prendahl na ghezn,

59
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,909
and, um...

60
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,287
Daario naharis.

61
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,668
You are the mother of dragons?

62
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,881
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in lys.

63
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,132
Mind your tongue.

64
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,508
Mero: Why?

65
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,676
I didn't mind hers.

66
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,722
She licked my ass like
she was born to do it.

67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,311
You, slave girl, bring wine.

68
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,645
We have no slaves here.

69
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,901
You'll all be
slaves after the battle, unless I save you.

70
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,405
Take your clothes off
and come and sit on mero's lap,

71
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,157
and I may give you my second sons.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,743
Give me your second sons
and I may not have you gelded.

73
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,288
Ser barristan,
how many men fight for the second sons?

74
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,540
Under 2,000, your grace.

75
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,751
We have more, don't we?

76
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,794
Barristan: 10,000 unsullied.

77
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,005
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

78
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,257
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

79
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,886
can explain to me
how you propose to defeat us.

80
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,555
I hope the old man is better
with a sword than he is with a lie.

81
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,891
You have 8,000 unsullied.

82
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,354
You're very young to be a captain.

83
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,106
He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

84
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,859
Even if your numbers are right,

85
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,945
the odds don't favor your side.

86
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,113
The second sons have
faced worse odds and won.

87
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,658
The second sons have
faced worse odds and run.

88
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,953
Or you could fight for me.

89
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,793
We've taken
the slavers' gold. We fight for yunkai.

90
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,182
Daenerys: I would pay you
as much and more.

91
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,257
Prendahl: Our contract is our bond.

92
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,053
If we break our bond,
no one will hire the second sons again.

93
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,348
Ride with me
and you'll never need another contract.

94
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,351
You'll have gold and
castles and lordships of your choosing

95
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,311
when I take back the seven kingdoms.

96
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,475
Daario: You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

97
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,148
You have no cavalry.

98
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:07,237
A fortnight ago, I had
no army. A year ago, I had no dragons.

99
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,908
You have two days to decide.

100
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,222
Show me your cunt. I want to see

101
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,057
if it's worth fighting for.

102
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,251
My queen, shall I slice out
his tongue for you?

103
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,753
These men are our guests.

104
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,506
You seem to be enjoying my wine.

105
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,967
Perhaps you'd like a flagon
to help you ponder.

106
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,054
Only a flagon?
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

107
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,140
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

108
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,519
The titan's bastard does not drink alone.

109
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,815
In the second sons, we share everything.

110
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,109
After the battle, maybe
we'll all share you.

111
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,742
I'll come looking for
you when this is over.

112
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,209
Ser barristan,
if it comes to battle, kill that one first.

113
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,628
Gladly, your grace.

114
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,017
Half Robert, half lowborn.

115
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,395
Show the boy to his chambers.

116
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,441
Have the maids draw him
a bath and find him some decent clothes.

117
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,901
I'll come visit you soon.

118
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,190
What do you mean to do with him?

119
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,496
You know.

120
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,290
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

121
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,960
If it needs to be
done, do it. Don't torture the boy.

122
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,546
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?

123
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,802
If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.

124
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,723
Her panic seeps into
her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.

125
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,309
You've slaughtered many lambs?

126
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,396
And none have seen the blade.

127
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,325
Davos: "And though

128
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,454
"visenya

129
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,956

132
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,839
"vhag..."

133
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,301
Fuck me.

134
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,390
"Visenya Targaryen

135

"to swallow a horse whole."

141
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,341
Your grace.

142
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,052
They feeding you enough?

143
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,595
Two meals a day.

144
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,724
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper. I cannot complain.

145
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,311
You don't belong in a place like this.

146
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,272
Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.

147
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,775
Yeah.

148
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,821
I'm sorry about your son.

149
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,450
Didn't get the chance to tell you before.

150
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,203
Good lad. Loyal lad.

151
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,000
Melisandre's returned.

152
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,420
I didn't know she'd been gone.

153
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,839
Came back with a bastard boy.

154
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,634
Robert's bastard boy.

155
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,514
She says there's power in king's blood.

156
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,308
She's going to kill him.

157
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,601
Sacrifice him.

158
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,770
Forgive me, your grace,
I'm not a learned man,

159
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,064
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

160
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,692
The boy is your nephew.

161
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,902
What of it? We're at war.

162
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,989
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

163
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,700
Robert bedded one drunken night?

164
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,994
Because he has your blood in his veins.

165
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,706
So did renly.

166
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,293
Renly wronged you.

167
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,962
Renly declared himself
king when the throne belonged to you.

168
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,673
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

169
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,883
This boy has done you no harm.

170
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,218
He's an innocent.

171
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,594
How many boys live in Westeros?

172
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,973
How many girls?
How many men? How many women?

173
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,560
The darkness will devour them all, she
says. The night that never ends.

174
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,772
Unless I triumph. I never asked for this.

175
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,566
No more than I asked to be king.

176
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,238
We do not choose our destiny,
but we must do our duty, no?

177
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,116
Great or small, we must do our duty.

178
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,413
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

179
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,087
Your grace,
why did you come to see me today?

180
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,715
I came to free you.

181
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,552
If you swear never to raise your hand
to the lady melisandre again.

182
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,763
I swear it.

183
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,599
I can't swear never to speak against her.

184
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,101
You have little regard for your own life.

185
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,229
Quite little, your grace. Verging on none.

186
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,942
You could have
freed me yesterday or tomorrow,

187
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,029
but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife

188
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,783
because you knew I'd counsel restraint.

189
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,704
You came to hear me
say it because you believe it yourself.

190
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,083
You're not a man who
slaughters innocents for gain or glory.

191
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,799
When my son was five, he said to me,

192
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,676
"I don't ever want to die."

193
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,347
I wanted to say to him,
"you won't, child. You won't ever."

194
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,893
I hated the idea
of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.

195
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,649
I think mothers and
fathers made up the gods

196
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,653
because they wanted their
children to sleep through the night.

197
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,240
I saw a vision in the flames.

198
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,830
A great battle in the snow. I saw it.

199
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,168
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

200
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,548
I never believed, but
when you see the truth,

201
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,634
when it's right there in front of you,

202
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:31,806
as real as these iron bars,
how can you deny her god is real?

203
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,746
That dragon bitch. She talks too much.

204
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,498
You talk too much.

205
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,042
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

206
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,712
8,000 unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

207
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,299
My cock will find a way. Tell him.

208
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,926
Is there any place that
my cock can't reach?

209
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,262
She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.

210
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,682
Daario naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

211
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,727
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

212
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,313
And I'm no whore, my friend.

213
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,940
She sells her sheath,
and you sell your blade.

214
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,067
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

215
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,986
For beauty?

216
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,654
We fight for gold.

217
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,742
The gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die,

218
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,162
the thrill of fucking
a woman who wants to be fucked

219
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,415
and the thrill
of killing a man who wants to kill you.

220
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,875
You'll die young.

221
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,561
Prendahl: What do we do
about the dragon girl?

222
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,795
We can't beat 8,000 unsullied
on the battlefield.

223
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,090
There won't be a battle,
and we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.

224
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,717
We only have to deal with her.

225
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,968
She's well guarded.

226
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,303
Tonight's a new moon.

227
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,390
One of us slips into her camp
past her unsullied and her knights.

228
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,935
Which one of us?

229
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,313
Close your eyes, love.

230
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,946
Three coins.

231
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,823
A coin from meereen,

232
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,992
a coin from volantis,

233
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,661
and a coin from braavos.

234
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,412
The braavosi does the deed.

235
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,336
One for each of us, darling.

236
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,380
No peeking.

237
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,897
Do you hear me?

238
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,150
Follow my voice. I'm right here.

239
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
You have something for me?

240
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,661
Valar morghulis.

241
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,684
Lady sansa.

242
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,938
You look very handsome, my lord.

243
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,273
Oh, yes.

244
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:32,570
The husband of your dreams.
But you do look glorious.

245
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,245
Perhaps we could
have a moment alone. Do you mind?

246
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,542
Podrick, could you escort
lady stark's handmaiden?

247
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,853
My lady, I want you to know

248
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,606
I didn't ask for this.

249
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,317
I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.

250
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,735
No, don't

251
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,489
you don't have to
speak to me as a prisoner anymore.

252
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,076
You won't be
a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife.

253
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,914
I suppose that's a
different kind of prison.

254
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,001
I just wanted to say...

255
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,505
I'm just trying to say, very badly...

256
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,383
I just...

257
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,011
Just want to say I know how you feel.

258
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,933
I doubt that very much, my lord.

259
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,897
You're right. I have no idea how you feel.

260
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,441
And you have no idea how I feel.

261
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:05,746
But I promise you
one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you.

262
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,211
Do you drink wine?

263
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,172
When I have to.

264
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,758
Well, today you have to.

265
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,852
Margaery: You look radiant, your grace.

266
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,563
Radiant? Why radiant?

267
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,926
It's the word that came to mind.

268
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,362
We're going to
be sisters soon. We should be friends.

269
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,615
You're a musical girl, aren't you?

270
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,201
I imagine you have a lovely voice.

271
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,204
A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

272
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,124
But you know the song
the rains of castamere?

273
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,377
Of course. They play
it so often here at court.

274
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,464
So you know the story
of house reyne of castamere?

275
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,707
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

276
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,470
House reyne was
a powerful family. Very wealthy.

277
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,847
The second wealthiest in Westeros.

278
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,643
Aren't the tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

279
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,981
Ambitious climbers don't want to
stop on the second highest rung.

280
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,901
If only you could take that final step,

281
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,361
you'd see further than all the rest.

282
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,824
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

283
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,953
So lord reyne built a castle
as grand as casterly rock.

284
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,874
He gave his wife diamonds
larger than any my mother ever wore.

285
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,879
And finally one day,
he rebelled against my father.

286
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,757
Do you know where house reyne is now?

287
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,925
Gone.

288
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,010
Gone.

289
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,389
A gentle word. Why not say "slaughtered"?

290
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,187
Every man, woman, and
child put to the sword.

291
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,273
I remember seeing their bodies hanging

292
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,651
high above the gates of casterly rock.

293
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:03,239
My father let them rot up there
all summer. It was a long summer.

294
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:09,662
"And now the rains weep o'er
their halls, and not a soul to hear."

295
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,586
If you ever call me "sister" again,

296
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,839
I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

297
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,537
What are you doing?

298
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,790
Your father's gone.

299
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,419
As the father of the realm, it is my duty

300
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,130
to give you away to your husband.

301
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,384
You may now cloak the bride
and bring her under your protection.

302
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,581
Could you...

303
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,589
Thank you.

304
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,933
Your grace, your grace,
my lords, my ladies,

305
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,645
we stand here in the sight of gods and men

306
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,857
to witness the union of man and wife.

307
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,446
One flesh,
one heart, one soul, now and forever.

308
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,175
Have you ever seen one like it?

309
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,888
I've never seen
anything like any of this. Not in my life.

310
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,808
It's shocking, isn't it,
the first time you encounter real wealth?

311
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,812
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

312
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,440
And stew is a kind word for it.

313
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,527
In flea bottom
we called them "bowls of brown."

314
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,324
We'd pretend that
the meat in them was chicken.

315
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,202
We knew it wasn't chicken.

316
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,173
Here, taste this.

317
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,885
You think I'm trying to poison you?

318
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,700
That's good.

319
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,081
That's really good.

320
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,208
Where do you think it's from?

321
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,043
I couldn't even guess.

322
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,089
Doesn't matter, does it?
It's the real thing or it's not.

323
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,051
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

324
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,388
Go on, have some more.

325
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,728
You still don't trust it.

326
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,397
You think this is all a mistake

327
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,816
and that you have to pay
for every bite you take.

328
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,902
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

329
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,238
There are no mistakes.

330
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,824
Not for us.

331
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,285
I'm a mistake.

332
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,165
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

333
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,166
instead of the girl next
to her in the tavern.

334
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:51,170
Your father chose your
mother because the lord of light willed it.

335
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,755
He willed it so you could be here right now

336
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,844
with a power inside you
you can't even begin to understand.

337
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,934
And he brought me here to draw it
from you and birth it into the world.

338
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,565
We're both a part of his plan.

339
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,486
He wants this for us.
No, he demands this of us.

340
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,826
I don't understand. This...

341
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,120
This doesn't seem very religious.

342
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,456
According to whom?

343
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,001
The silent sisters?

344
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:35,797
With their stern looks,
muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?

345
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,302
What have their gods done for you?

346
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,933
When you pray to them, what's their answer?

347
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,977
A god is real or he's not.

348
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,689
You only need eyes to see.

349
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,530
Death is coming for
everyone and everything.

350
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,575
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.

351
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,621
And we can stop it, you and I.

352
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,025
Let me show you what you have inside you.

353
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,654
Come fight death with me.

354
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,144
What are you doing?

355
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,190
You have to trust me.

356
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,298
What...

357
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,425
Get it away.

358
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,969
Get it off me.

359
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,513
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

360
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,558
Why are you doing this?

361
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,770
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

362
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,689
And you have so much blood.

363
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,609
No, no, no, no!

364
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,196
Not there. Not there!

365
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:15,123
You can blame ser davos. He didn't
believe in the power of king's blood.

366
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,419
He wanted a demonstration.

367
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,464
Gendry: Please. Please, your grace.

368
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,549
My lord!

369
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,255
The usurper robb stark.

370
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,052
The usurper balon greyjoy.

371
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,101
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

372
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,581
So their son will be your nephew.

373
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,041
After you're wed to Cersei, of course.

374
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,882
And you will be
the king's stepfather and brother-in-law.

375
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,679
When you marry the king, Joffrey's
mother will become his sister-in-law

376
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,475
and your son will be loras' nephew?

377
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,895
Grandson? I'm not sure.

378
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,106
But your brother
will become your father-in-law.

379
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,275
That much is beyond dispute.

380
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,340
Will you pardon me, my lord?

381
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,593
Of course. Of course. Enjoy.

382
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,476
Perhaps you could
talk to your bride-to-be instead.

383
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,931
I've got a lifetime for that.

384
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,786
Stay.

385
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,088
Tywin: You seem rather drunk.

386
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,133
Rather less than I plan to be.

387
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,678
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

388
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,890
This isn't about your
wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

389
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:24,354
Your wife needs a child,
a Lannister child, as soon as possible.

390
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,605
And?

391
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,832
If you're going to give her one,

392
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,942
you need to perform.

393
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,152
What did you once call me?

394
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,489
A drunken little lust-filled beast.

395
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,825
- More than once.
- There you have it.

396
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,827
Nothing to worry about.

397
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,915
Drinking and lust,
no man can match me in these things.

398
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,668
I am the god of tits and wine.

399
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:52,549
I shall build a shrine
to myself at the next brothel I visit.

400
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,428
You can drink, you can joke,

401
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,388
you can engage in juvenile attempts

402
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,390
to make your father uncomfortable,

403
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,184
but you will do your duty.

404
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,725
Well...

405
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,024
My father once told me...

406
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,318
Nobody cares what
your father once told you.

407
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,133
Congratulations, my lady.

408
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,843
Thank you, your grace.

409
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,680
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

410
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,140
Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.

411
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,976
It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?

412
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,728
What a glorious day.

413
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,021
Yes, your grace.

414
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,607
I suppose it doesn't really matter

415
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,276
which Lannister puts the baby into you.

416
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,614
Maybe I'll pay you a visit
tonight after my uncle passes out.

417
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,909
How'd you like that?

418
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,788
You wouldn't?

419
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,542
That's all right.
Ser meryn and ser boros will hold you down.

420
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,172
Joffrey: Time for the bedding ceremony.

421
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,382
All: Ah!

422
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,342
There will be no bedding ceremony.

423
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,137
Where's your respect for tradition, uncle?

424
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,015
Come, everyone. Pick her up
and carry her to her wedding bed.

425
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,644
Get rid of her gown.
She won't be needing it any longer.

426
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,564
Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.

427
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,441
There will be no bedding ceremony.

428
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,484
There will be if I command it.

429
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:24,159
Then you'll be
fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.

430
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,289
Joffrey: What did you say?

431
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,963
What did you say?

432
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,342
I believe we can
dispense with the bedding, your grace.

433
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,847
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean
to threaten the king.

434
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,523
A bad joke, your grace.

435
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,527
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.

436
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,156
Mine is so small.

437
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,659
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

438
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,621
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, your grace.

439
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,164
Tyrion: I am.

440
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,958
Guilty.

441
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,836
But...

442
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,715
But it is my wedding night.

443
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:25,053
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.

444
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,724
Come, wife.

445
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,981
I vomited on a girl once
in the middle of the act.

446
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,650
Not proud of it.

447
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,903
But I think honesty is important

448
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,948
between a man and wife, don't you agree?

449
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,701
Come, I'll tell you
all about it. Put you in the mood.

450
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,361
Is that wise, my lord?

451
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,946
Tyrion, sansa.

452
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,949
My name is Tyrion.

453
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,952
Is that wise, Tyrion?

454
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,084
Nothing was ever wiser.

455
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,432
Astoundingly long.

456
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,809
What?

457
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,144
Neck.

458
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,229
You have one.

459
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,650
How old are you exactly?

460
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,828
Well, talk won't make you any older.

461
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:26,341
My lord father has
commanded me to consummate this marriage.

462
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,129
Stop.

463
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,216
I can't.

464
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,222
I could, I won't.

465
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,390
But your father...

466
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:02,145
If my father wants someone to get
fucked, I know where he can start.

467
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,444
I won't share your bed.

468
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,949
Not until you want me to.

469
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,996
What if I never want you to?

470
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,301
And so my watch begins.

471
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,023
Nineteen?

472
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,399
Yes, your grace.

473
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,861
How can anyone speak 19 languages?

474
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:37,073
It only took your grace
a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.

475
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,534
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki

476
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,120
or grunt at my husband and hope...

477
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,706
What do you mean, "reasonably well"?

478
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,378
Dothraki is difficult for
the mouth to master.

479
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,356
So guttural and harsh.

480
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,134
Drogo said I spoke Dothraki
like one born to it.

481
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,553
It gave him great pride.

482
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,223
Athjahakar.

483
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,227
Athjahaka.

484
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,729
Ath-ja-hakar.

485
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,399
Athjahakar.

486
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,486
Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.

487
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,740
Your high valyrian is
very good, your grace.

488
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,286
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

489
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,247
It is the only proper language for poetry.

490
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,754
No screaming, or she dies.

491
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,061
What do you want?

492
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,190
You.

493
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,858
Let her go.

494
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,943
Don't scream, lovely girl.

495
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,244
You were sent here to kill me?

496
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,664
So why haven't you?

497
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,625
I don't want to.

498
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,961
What do your captains
have to say about that?

499
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,796
You should ask them.

500
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,139
We had philosophical differences.

501
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,599
Over what?

502
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,808
Your beauty.

503
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,020
It meant more to me than it did to them.

504
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,563
You're a strange man.

505
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,234
I'm the simplest man you'll ever
meet. I only do what I want to do.

506
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,194
And this is supposed to impress me?

507
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,238
Yes.

508
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,159
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

509
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,078
They ordered me to murder you.

510
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,747
I told them I preferred not to.

511
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,250
They told me I had no choice.

512
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:56,504
I told them I am daario
naharis. I always have a choice.

513
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,010
They drew their swords and I drew mine.

514
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,294
Will you fight for me?

515
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,052
Swear to me.

516
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,267
The second sons are yours,
and so is daario naharis.

517
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:56,439
My sword is yours,
my life is yours, my heart is yours.

518
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,335
You really ought to knock.

519
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,420
I brought your breakfast.

520
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:41,210
It's getting dark.
We could stay here for the night.

521
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,787
How hard can it be to build a fire?

522
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:22,585
It doesn't matter. Come under the
furs. We can keep each other warm.

523
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,355
He winked at me before.

524
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,192
I doubt it.

525
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,902
I saw him wink at me.

526
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,361
He blinked.

527
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,491
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

528
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,576
between a wink and a blink.

529
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,912
A what?

530
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:03,584
Well, I mean, there's no real difference.

531
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,547
A wink is on purpose.

532
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,427
You thought of a name yet?

533
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,476
It would be easier
to refer to him if he had a name.

534
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,811
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

535
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,814
What? No.

536
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,275
This is just the way I talk.

537
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,281
I'll build that fire.

538
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,543
Don't you think he should have a name?

539
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,129
I don't know many boys' names.

540
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,133
Let's see, there's Duncan,

541
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,178
kevan, Jon...

542
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,558
Guymon, feldan, tristifer.

543
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,767
Craster.

544
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,563
Uh... yes.

545
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,832
Maybe that's not...

546
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,941
Mormont.

547
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,488
That's a lovely idea,
but mormont's a last name.

548
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,157
Why is it a last name?

549
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,827
Well, it's a family name.

550
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,582
For instance, I'm samwell tarly.

551
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:29,878
Samwell is my birth name
and tarly is my family name.

552
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,675
You see? So my father is also a tarly.

553
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,554
His name is samwell tarly, too?

554
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,223
No, randyll tarly.

555
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,684
Randyll is a handsome name.

556
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,562
Please don't name him randyll.

557
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,901
Is your father cruel, like mine?

558
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,658
Different manner of cruel.

559
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,214
Not randyll, then.

560
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,530
Gilly: Don't.

561
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,533
Don't go out there.

562
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,204
I'll be back. I just want to look.

563
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,408
Go inside.

564
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,411
Go back inside. I'll...

565
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,635
It's come for the baby.

566
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:57,985
Stay back!

567
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,244
You stay back!

568
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,550
No, you can't have him! No!
