1
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:23,024
<i>Wait. You seriously want
to stop the assassination</i>

2
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,692
<i>of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand?</i>

3
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,819
Okay, let's... let's just hear her out.

4
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:30,088
After the assassination of the Archduke,

5
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,575
Europe's rival alliances
declared war on each other.

6
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,744
This singular murder
led to 20 million deaths.

7
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,847
The assassination
of the Archduke, therefore,

8
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,711
is what is known
as a "Fixed Point" in history.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,083
I'm sorry, "Fixed Point"?

10
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,960
"Fixed Point," noun.

11
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,087
An occurrence so pivotal to history,

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,506
that no time travel
is allowed on or near it.

13
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm a little fuzzy
on my time travel logic.

14
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,510
How is this a good idea?

15
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,720
Yes, I appreciate
your resolve, Miss Gideon,

16
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:55,598
but you see, we can't just go
and prevent the Great War.

17
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,243
Now, you were the ones
that taught me that.

18
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,268
Exactly.

19
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,687
Fixed Points are shrouded in mystery,
even to Evil Gideon.

20
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:04,357
Still, she and her robots won't be able
to resist restoring the timeline,

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,608
and we will let them.

22
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:09,195
Oh, so, we're not actually
going to stop the World War,

23
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,173
we're just going
to let her think we are to lure her in.

24
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,992
And the assassination
was a notoriously chaotic event.

25
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,452
Which will give us the window
we need to take back the ship.

26
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:18,955
Making the robots do the work
of fixing the timeline,

27
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,082
while we unplug your evil twin.

28
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,209
That is diabolical, Gideon.

29
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,586
I learned from the best.

30
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:25,920
All right, gang.

31
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:29,424
I know it has been a rough road
since we lost our <i>Waverider,</i>

32
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,384
but that ends now.

33
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:37,181
This time, we're going to win,
and today, we are going home.

34
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,142
All right, gang-gang.

35
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,311
The assassination
was such a famous fiasco,

36
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:45,231
I kindly decided
to draw you a diagram to help explain.

37
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:46,835
Ooh! I didn't know you were an artist.

38
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,193
And now, I see why.

39
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,821
No, I get it. It's abstract.

40
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,074
Oh... Okay, so,
my drawing skills are a little rusty.

41
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,927
You don't have to be
so insensitive, you jerks.

42
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,053
Now, just shut up and focus.

43
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,263
- I'm sorry, yeah.
- All right.

44
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,164
So, there are members
of a secret society

45
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,583
called the Black Hand
on the scene that day,

46
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,170
<i>including the eventual assassin,
Gavrilo Princip.</i>

47
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,546
The assassins set up across

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,590
from the Archduke's motorcade route
in Sarajevo.

49
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:14,385
Copy. Where does
the, uh, hippopotamus come into play?

50
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,554
That's the Archduke's car.

51
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,098
<i>He's waving.</i>

52
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,350
Ah!

53
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:21,893
Very abstract.

54
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:26,731
Okay, so, we will set up here,
next to the balloon salesman.

55
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,817
That is the assassin,
and he's holding a grenade.

56
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,516
The assassin tossed the grenade
at the motorcade,

57
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,455
<i>but it bounced off the car
and blew up nearby.</i>

58
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:39,952
So, Princip, with his mission a bust,
went to a nearby sandwich shop.

59
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,412
Hey, I see that sandwich.

60
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,412
And you know what?

61
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,541
That is some attention to detail
on the lettuce.

62
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,584
- Good job, bud.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:47,918
That's an explosion.

64
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,272
The motorcade took a wrong turn

65
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,016
<i>and went straight past
Princip's lunch spot.</i>

66
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,884
<i>So, Princip sees the Archduke,</i>

67
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,014
<i>realizes this is his moment,
and shoots him point blank.</i>

68
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:04,727
Okay. So, our surest shot
at unfixing the Fixed Point

69
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:08,106
is to take out the three assassins.

70
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,817
And the best place to do that
is at the Ćosić Tavern,

71
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,378
where the assassins met that morning.

72
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:14,153
Okay. So, we'll knock out the Black Hand

73
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,114
just long enough
that they miss the motorcade.

74
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,991
Meanwhile, we'll need to hide
the time machine.

75
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,660
Astra can work her Permuto spell,

76
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:23,143
turn it into something more portable,
and bring it back here.

77
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,916
Yes. And then,
the team will get into position.

78
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,000
By that swimming pool.

79
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,836
- Field, Gary.
- Field.

80
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,964
And when Gideon sends her robots
to keep the 20th century on course,

81
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,883
we will be ready
to hijack our home back.

82
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,303
Yeah.

83
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,973
And with that, we have a plan.

84
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,976
Nay. We have a foolproof plan.

85
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,073
There they are,
assassins for the Black Hand.

86
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,956
Now's our chance.

87
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:12,962
I'm sorry...

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,548
but if you'll come with me.

89
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,217
I think I'll stay right here.

90
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,511
I have to insist.

91
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:25,183
We wouldn't want to make a scene.

92
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:39,071
Look, I think there is
a misunderstanding happening.

93
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,657
You clearly don't belong here.

94
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,594
- We're on our honeymoon.
- We're backpackers.

95
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:44,762
- What he said.
- What she said.

96
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,426
We really should be
better at this by now.

97
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:48,247
Don't worry,

98
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:52,043
most time travelers blow their covers
even quicker.

99
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:55,379
Come with me.

100
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:08,851
What is this place?

101
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:15,233
You think you're the only ones
who want to save Archduke Ferdinand?

102
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:20,321
This is the place for people like you,

103
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,033
time travelers who are foolish enough

104
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,954
to try and prevent World War I.

105
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,957
Welcome to The Fixed Point.

106
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,652
What the hell is this?

107
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,280
These people
are all time travelers.

108
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,658
What are they doing here?
How come I didn't know about this?

109
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,410
What's with the tape?

110
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,496
Oh. It's Gwyn's time machine.
Gideon had me transform it.

111
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,583
Tape was my idea. ELO's <i>Time.</i>

112
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,168
It's a whole concept album
about a time traveler

113
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,212
torn between love and technology.

114
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,216
Cute.
All right, moving on.

115
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,385
Don't mind if I do.

116
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,680
Turns out, there's a lot more
going on in Sarajevo than we thought.

117
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,225
Yeah. Fixed Points are catnip
for disruptor types.

118
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:35,354
I created this space
to provide a watering hole

119
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,523
for those who want
a piece of the action,

120
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,487
whether they are here
to stop the assassination,

121
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,402
or just to watch people try.

122
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,245
Here we go, our next competitor.

123
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,165
Is that a...

124
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:59,587
It's a time portal.
Morning of June 28th, 1914,

125
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,380
when the motorcade began.

126
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,050
Okay, folks, our next competitor is up,

127
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:05,885
making his approach.

128
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,222
It's a live feed. How?

129
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,560
It's archival film taken by bystanders,

130
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,396
pieced together to form a view
of the whole motorcade.

131
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,443
The film updates each time
an attempt becomes history itself.

132
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,160
You get your ticket,
you wait your turn, you take your shot.

133
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,286
Them's the rules.

134
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,246
We're not here to follow your rules.

135
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,249
I wouldn't do that if I were you,

136
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:43,381
because although the filmstrip changes,
it always ends the same way.

137
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,520
Holy crap!

138
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,654
Wait. Did he just...

139
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,739
Self-immolation pays out.

140
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,409
Cumurija Road pays out.

141
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,705
You see,
you try to change time at a Fixed Point,

142
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,542
and time kills you.

143
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,544
Time can do that?

144
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:24,630
No one's ever even made it
to the last assassin.

145
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,509
But if you're so determined,
you are in the queue.

146
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,679
And by the look of today's competitors,

147
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,765
your turn will be up soon.

148
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,276
All right, Gwyn.

149
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,920
If we're going to save Alun,
we have to be smart.

150
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,047
We can't cause any ripples
that might affect the larger timeline.

151
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,072
I understand.

152
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,916
And I have to say,
I am mightily appreciative

153
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,136
that you've changed your mind
on this, Miss Sharpe. Thank you.

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,513
We would be dead if it weren't for you.
We can give you this.

155
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,832
My divine mission is almost complete.
Now, let me show you.

156
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,209
This is where Alun was ambushed.

157
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:03,711
Oh, perfect. Here you go.

158
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,629
Oh! Oh...

159
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,215
- Little soldiers.
- Yes. Found them in the attic.

160
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,884
Constantine was a bit of a hoarder.

161
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,261
Seems like a very peculiar fellow.

162
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,096
- Mr. Green.
- Hmm?

163
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,390
What, is the <i>Waverider</i> here?

164
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,810
Uh, not yet. I'm just here to drop off
Gwyn's time machine.

165
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,731
Astra said it should change back soon.

166
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,167
I'll assume that that makes sense, then.

167
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,210
No, that makes absolutely no sense.
What happened with the Archduke?

168
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,986
Oh, we're still waiting our turn

169
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,198
in a sort of
time-travel-<i>Cheers</i> meets <i>Thunderdome.</i>

170
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,010
- What's a Thunderdome?
- You don't want to know. Wait, stop.

171
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,411
- Is everyone, uh...
- No, no, we're fine. We're fine.

172
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,497
It's a pub filled with time travelers.

173
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,875
Yeah, people like us,
who are there to save the Archduke.

174
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,254
A whole community of time travelers,
all with the same aim and purpose.

175
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,341
Wow, Gwyn. None of this
would exist without your invention.

176
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,595
Wait a... Uh-oh.

177
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,282
None of this would exist
without your invention,

178
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,743
which means if we go on to save Alun,
you never invent time travel,

179
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,247
which means no <i>Waverider,</i> no Legends.

180
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,813
And no one to go back
to save Alun in the first place.

181
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,356
- Uh...
- Ah...

182
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,400
I can't deal with these time loops
and paradoxes all in one day.

183
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,070
I'm just going to
leave this in the foyer.

184
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,949
Okay. So, it's not as simple as saving
Alun from the Germans, right?

185
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,385
But we just have to make sure
that you go on to invent time travel.

186
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,370
Oh, I've already solved that,
Miss Sharpe.

187
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,248
You see, my mission is to save Alun.

188
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:25,209
However, my younger self
must never find out.

189
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,003
I must always end up here.

190
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,047
What?

191
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:32,550
But that means
he'd be out there alive and you'd be...

192
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,884
Alone.

193
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,179
So, let me show you
where he was ambushed.

194
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:40,641
Time is killing people?

195
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,395
I don't even understand
how time can have this power.

196
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,231
But I suppose I've never questioned
what made a Fixed Point fixed.

197
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,567
Who knew time travel
could be this complicated?

198
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,087
I don't know how you've wrapped your
human brains around it all these years.

199
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,654
Wait.

200
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,240
Yes, I do. I need a drink.

201
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,910
Hey, we could...

202
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,638
You wanna go check out
the betting tables?

203
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,414
- You bet.
- All right. Well, I'll see ya.

204
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,420
I mean, we could hang out or something,
unless you have some plans.

205
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,213
No. Yeah. We, uh...

206
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:16,677
You know, we have never done
the one-on-one... thing.

207
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,679
Yeah.

208
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,514
- After you.
- Okay, I'll go. Okay.

209
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,767
- Ah. What can I get you folks?
- Two stouts, please.

210
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,352
Anything for you?

211
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:29,523
Oh. Uh, I'll just have the one.

212
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,067
Thank you.

213
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,506
Now, when you say
time's out there killing people,

214
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,825
like, you can't mean literally,
because that doesn't make any sense.

215
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:43,579
I know it's a lot to take in,
but you've got to trust me on this one.

216
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:48,500
I've been in the time travel game
for a long time.

217
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,922
Oh, you've been in it for a long time?
Okay, then that makes you the authority.

218
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,381
Well...

219
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:58,177
I guess that does make you
the authority.

220
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,448
All these years, I never even knew
The Fixed Point had a bar.

221
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:02,973
Oh. Don't be too hard on yourself.

222
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,601
It's always been
a word of mouth kind of place.

223
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,645
Besides, you're young.

224
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,481
You can't expect to know
all there is to know.

225
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,778
You're right. Here I am,
thinking I have infinite knowledge.

226
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,280
But what do I know?
What do I know, Gary?

227
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:19,573
Hmm? Okay, for example.

228
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,785
Okay, what is a "pickleback?" Hmm?

229
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,412
Oh. Does that come in large?

230
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,377
- This is... this is great.
- Mmm-hmm.

231
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,129
This is great!

232
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,924
I mean like, us, finally.

233
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,886
Right? Yeah, it usually
gets so crazy around here,

234
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,556
we never get a chance to just... hang.

235
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,183
Totally, totally.

236
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,478
Because what people
do together is they...

237
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,107
- They talk.
- Yeah!

238
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,191
- Right? About...
- Yes.

239
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,568
Uh...

240
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,655
- Topics?
- Right. Yes, yes.

241
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,116
We all love topics, right?

242
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,493
There's things like...

243
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,915
- makeup, right?
- Ah! I do, yeah.

244
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,710
I like makeup,
but we can also talk about, uh...

245
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,379
guns.

246
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,298
Yeah. Yeah, we could.

247
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,091
Yeah.

248
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,426
Yeah.

249
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,308
And the second assassin
is this salt shaker, okay?

250
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,601
Now, he'll get distracted
when this motorcade...

251
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,438
Wait, wait, wait. I got it.
I got the plan that not even time

252
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,899
is going to see coming.
A true Legends plan.

253
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,987
No. No way!
Are you guys the Legends of Tomorrow?

254
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,532
It makes sense we'd be known
around these parts, I guess.

255
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,908
We get around.

256
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,459
Yeah, a bunch of washed-up superheroes

257
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,961
who think they can beat
the Fixed Point. Cute.

258
00:13:56,337 --> 00:14:00,466
Okay, calm down.
We are basically the same age as you.

259
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,305
Dude, sick burn.

260
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,517
- He said that...
- No one cares what he said, all right?

261
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,603
Why don't you guys
go giggle at your own table,

262
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,813
because we have adult things to do.

263
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,483
- Oh, aggressive.
- Okay. Sorry.

264
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,944
Number 71!

265
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,738
Okay, all right.

266
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,615
- Forget those guys...
- Yeah.

267
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,368
...because they do not matter.
All that matters is our plan.

268
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:28,911
- Hear me out.
- Go.

269
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,580
Three assassins fan out.
I follow the guy with the grenade,

270
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:35,042
then, here, I untie the dog
that's tied to the lamp pole...

271
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,669
And then knocks off the steak
from the table of the corner cafe.

272
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:38,796
Exactly.

273
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,673
- And then I use that...
- As a distraction to steal the bike.

274
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,343
Yeah, you got it. How do you know this?

275
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,846
He's doing it right now.

276
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,182
Okay. Well... Whatever.

277
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,810
Because my plan has a second steak

278
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,104
that I will slip
into the assassin's pocket...

279
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,689
And that's exactly what he's doing?

280
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,608
Really? No.

281
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,819
No!

282
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,281
And another one
bites the dust.

283
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,701
- Okay. Okay.
- Mmm.

284
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,246
Hey, this is a good thing,
because now we know

285
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,207
this plan is no good.
Onto the next plan.

286
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,376
Seventy-two!

287
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,961
Lance...

288
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,088
you're up.

289
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,259
Hey, if you need more time,
we can get it.

290
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,010
Huh.

291
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,554
Uh-uh.

292
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:34,393
I got this.
Improvising is what I do best, right?

293
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,312
Let's see what you got, old-timer.

294
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,441
Hey.

295
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,026
You're Sara damn Lance.

296
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,881
With Sara out there,
they won't make it past the tavern.

297
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,424
Mmm-hmm.

298
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,890
Damn it.

299
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,728
All right. Maybe
she's got something else planned.

300
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,916
Wait.

301
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,338
Ooh!

302
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,596
At least her comedic timing
is impeccable.

303
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,569
There she is.

304
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,614
- Bobby baby.
- Valiant attempt, Captain.

305
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,157
I'm sorry, guys.

306
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,576
I froze out there.
I didn't know my next move. I just...

307
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,537
- It wasn't that bad.
- No one noticed.

308
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,372
Uh-oh.

309
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:21,792
Y'all... Y'all feel
a shift in the timeline?

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,585
You know what, yeah, I did.

311
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,878
Now, the assassination is only

312
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,214
the second most epic tragedy
to happen today.

313
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,050
All right, all right.
At least I survived, okay?

314
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,597
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

315
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,102
Okay. Um...

316
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,274
I'm gonna get a drink.

317
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,991
Now, if we just divert
the Germans here...

318
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,302
- This isn't working.
- Oh, but it will now if you look...

319
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,566
No, it's not good enough, Gwyn.

320
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,820
The plan can't be for you
to live your life heartbroken.

321
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,375
There has to be a solve for this.
There's...

322
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,381
What if I take each of the Legends,

323
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,109
and I place them
in different points in time?

324
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,319
- We shouldn't do that.
- No, wait. I'm onto something here.

325
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,503
- The thing is...
- Now, Miss Sharpe...

326
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,558
my sorry fate, it isn't just a solve
for the paradox, you see.

327
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,810
It's what I deserve...

328
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,689
for loving Alun in the first place.

329
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:31,445
Gwyn... there's nothing wrong
with you loving another man.

330
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,381
That might be easy for you to say,
Miss Sharpe.

331
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,449
No, but it's true. It's true.

332
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,910
Listen, I am so, so sorry
that you've had to live your life

333
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,829
hiding who you really are,

334
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:46,460
but I promise you that there are places
where you can feel safe to be yourself,

335
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,920
- where people will accept you.
- It's not about the people.

336
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,217
It doesn't matter
if I'm accepted by others.

337
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,347
You see,
I will never be accepted by God.

338
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:07,856
You see, my love for Alun,
it goes against who God wants me to be.

339
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,027
It may be
my divine mission to save Alun,

340
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,365
but it must also be my divine punishment
to live without him.

341
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,534
- And that's the plan, okay?
- No.

342
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:32,214
Hey, watch out for the ladder, sis.

343
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,884
- I can't stand people like that!
- Yeah. Me, neither.

344
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,011
It's like they're always playing
these tough guys.

345
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,514
Yeah, and they think
they're better than everyone else.

346
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,433
Wait.

347
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,396
I can talk about people
I don't like literally all day.

348
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,772
Right.

349
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,535
Yeah. And guys like them is why
I stopped going to places like this.

350
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,567
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

351
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,070
That, and I kind of got abducted
by a Timeship.

352
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,950
You know what?
So did I, actually. So did I.

353
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,582
Why was it so hard for us
to do this before?

354
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,127
I thought you didn't like me.

355
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,628
Wow.

356
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,710
I always figured
you thought you were better than me.

357
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,804
No. I am so intimidated by you.

358
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,222
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

359
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,390
- No.
- Yeah.

360
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,951
Okay, I'm the one
that's intimidated by you.

361
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,560
- Get outta here.
- Yeah.

362
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:32,983
Hey.

363
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:34,985
Sorry about back there.

364
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,695
Team really didn't
put on the best front.

365
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,574
They trusted me.
I told them to trust me.

366
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,658
And then I get out there,

367
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,511
and I don't even know
what the hell I'm doing.

368
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,788
Hey, so, you had a case of the yips.
It happens to the best of us.

369
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,500
Besides, changing a Fixed Point
isn't supposed to be easy.

370
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,586
It's not just the Fixed Point.

371
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,506
It's this whole damn road trip,
or whatever the hell we're on.

372
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,633
Sara, we got this far.

373
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,719
Yeah. And where are we?

374
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,471
Seriously, where are we?

375
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,849
Running for our lives,
with no home, with no plan.

376
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,979
I feel like
I used to always know

377
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,607
what the next move was,
and now, it's like...

378
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,570
I don't know, nothing.
Nothing's working.

379
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,786
Look, we got this far
because of you.

380
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,163
And if it weren't for you,
we'd still be in Odessa,

381
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:31,166
making headlines,
while the FBI shuts down our circus.

382
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,376
Would have been a good circus.

383
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,629
- Would have been a great circus.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,465
But you know what? It's not all on you.

385
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:42,969
Yeah. You may be indestructible,
but don't mean you gotta all alone.

386
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,014
That's right.
This time, we'll go out there with you.

387
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,643
You guys, look, I appreciate it.
I really do.

388
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:54,231
But I can't put you in danger,
and we don't even have a plan.

389
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,152
Exactly.
We don't need a perfect front.

390
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,737
We're the Legends of Tomorrow.

391
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,073
We got something
those hotshots don't have,

392
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:04,825
that's experience.

393
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,576
Experience at failing.

394
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,084
Ah, you know what?
We've broken time before.

395
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,378
Let's do it again.

396
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,220
Since I'm the only one
who can live-die-repeat...

397
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,304
Uh... "Live-die-repeat"?

398
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,307
It's a reference to this time loop movie
that's so fire.

399
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,393
I'll show it to you
when we get the <i>Waverider</i> back.

400
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,812
So, I'll just keep going out there
again and again,

401
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,273
until we figure out
the best way to beat time.

402
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,025
Yeah. And when you do fail,
no offense, we'll be there

403
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,920
every step of the way
during the assassination,

404
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,839
from the time
the Black Hand shows up to the tavern,

405
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,281
to the time Princip takes the shot.

406
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,741
Uh, Spoonz and I can take the tavern,
if that's okay.

407
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,076
- Yeah, I'm down.
- Cool.

408
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,452
Great. And then the rest of us

409
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,205
will watch from the outskirts,
analyze your mistakes

410
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,499
and come up
with some new strategies, huh?

411
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,167
Ooh. Like a sideline of coaches.

412
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:59,588
Number 78.

413
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,821
God!

414
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,454
Sometimes,
the best play is a trick play.

415
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,879
Looking for this?

416
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,924
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

417
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,218
All right. Two to go, Sara.

418
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,108
Whoo!

419
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,153
Oh!

420
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,832
You call that a knife?

421
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,671
Now, that's a knife.

422
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,050
Looking for this?

423
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,308
Yes!

424
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,560
One more assassin to stop.
Come on, Sara.

425
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,187
She made it to Princip.

426
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,523
No one's ever made it that far.

427
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,464
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. It wasn't me. I didn't...

428
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,973
Well, well, well.

429
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:01,561
If it ain't the Failures of Tomorrow
failing again.

430
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,938
Stupid kids.

431
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:09,069
Well, we may be failing,
but at least we're failing together.

432
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:12,030
Yeah, and we're learning, too, right?

433
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,091
You know what? A couple more times,
and we're going to figure this out.

434
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:17,118
Yeah, well, we gotta hurry
because we only have two tickets left.

435
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,710
I think we have a few minutes
before the next try...

436
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,922
so smash, marry, kill,

437
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,174
Nate, Gwyn, Gary.

438
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,592
Um...

439
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,930
No, not really
into any of them.

440
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:42,143
Copy. Okay, how about, uh...
Sara, Ava, Astra?

441
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,563
Mmm...

442
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,649
Not... Not really into
any of them, either.

443
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,776
Also copy.

444
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,987
Okay, what is your type?

445
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:58,118
I don't really get
those types of feelings for anyone.

446
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,541
Maybe it's one of those things those
mushroom aliens messed up about me, huh?

447
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:10,338
Hey, no, no, no. What you're
describing is totally normal.

448
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,924
It just means maybe you're ace.

449
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,552
Asexual.

450
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,013
People who identify as ace
have little or no interest in sex,

451
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,097
but many of them
still want to be in relationships.

452
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,769
Wow, uh...

453
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,233
I guess that makes me ace.

454
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,695
OMG. Did you just come out to me?

455
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,074
- I guess I did.
- Yeah?

456
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,372
Okay, first of all, who would've thought
you'd be the first person I'd tell?

457
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,540
- Not me.
- Okay.

458
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,333
Cheers.

459
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,712
Hey, what's so funny?

460
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,965
- It's nothing.
- I guess you had to be there.

461
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,344
Cool, cool.

462
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,722
Okay. Copy that.

463
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,974
- We should go up here.
- Yes.

464
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:07,854
What about you, Z?

465
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,525
Besides broody wizards,
what's your type?

466
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,485
Uh...

467
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,613
What about that guy with the top hat?

468
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,201
What guy with the top hat?

469
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,123
Hey, gang.

470
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,727
We were just in the tavern,
and Spooner saw this guy in a top hat,

471
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,604
but when I turned to look at him,
he disappeared.

472
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,397
Yeah. So, we walked over
to where he was standing,

473
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,090
and my bad guy radar went off.
Yeah, big time.

474
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,696
- A man in a top hat?
- Yeah.

475
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,886
And I swear
I've seen him along the route.

476
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,347
- Maybe he's on the film.
- Hmm.

477
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,506
Stop. There.

478
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,774
Rewind the film.

479
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,194
Stop!

480
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,439
Can you go to the next frame?

481
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,201
Hmm.

482
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:05,578
He's only in that one frame.

483
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,665
Wait, wait, wait, wait. He appears
right before Sara makes a move,

484
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,059
and then he disappears, so maybe...

485
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,794
It's not time fixing itself...

486
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:14,837
It's a person.

487
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:25,640
So, it's a person fixing time,
not actually time, like we thought?

488
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,308
Yes!

489
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,601
I knew it.

490
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,061
Did I do that right?

491
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,539
Sorry, I'm just relieved
that it's a person and not time.

492
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,483
- Existential crisis averted. Carry on.
- All right.

493
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,236
So, we've got to figure out
how Mr. Peanut keeps fixing time,

494
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,612
then disappearing.

495
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,035
It's like he's stopping time.

496
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:49,997
What if he is?

497
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,959
Breakthrough.
Sara's having a breakthrough.

498
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,671
What if this top hat guy
has the ability to freeze time,

499
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,508
and then he fixes the timeline,
and then he restarts it

500
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,135
without anyone knowing he was there?

501
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,013
- Called it.
- Nice.

502
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,266
How are we supposed to beat someone
who can freeze freaking time?

503
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,476
I just wish there was some way

504
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,147
you could be, you know, invulnerable
to his time-freezing powers.

505
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:15,982
There is one way.

506
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,695
Dr. Davies,
do you think you could let us borrow

507
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,572
the CR-055 superconductor?

508
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,117
The CR-055 superconductor?
What would you want that for, then?

509
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,411
To build an anti-time manipulator.

510
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,419
What do you need
an anti-time manipulator for?

511
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:34,000
My plan to change the Fixed Point
has led us to a mysterious bad guy

512
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,793
who can stop time.

513
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:39,088
Well, I would very much like
to help you, Miss Gideon,

514
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,924
but that would mean
completely dismantling my time machine.

515
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,008
Not to mention risk never saving Alun
if I can't put it back together again.

516
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,600
But, uh...

517
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,396
maybe this is part of God's plan,
after all.

518
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,567
And I have always been destined
to fail him.

519
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,867
Gwyn, wait.

520
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,203
Hey.

521
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,039
Um, look, I understand
that you have a deep faith in God.

522
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,874
I do.

523
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,557
I don't know what that feels like, okay?

524
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:22,799
But I do know that if there is a God,
He, or She, or They,

525
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:28,096
or whatever pronoun they prefer
would want you to experience love,

526
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,431
you know?

527
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:35,728
And to feel acceptance
loving whoever it is you choose, Gwyn,

528
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:42,777
because love is love is love
is love is love is love is love.

529
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,033
That was profoundly beautiful,
Miss Sharpe.

530
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,701
I didn't know you were a poet.

531
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:54,247
No, I'm not. Actually, that last part
is Lin-Manuel Miranda.

532
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,333
- I don't know him.
- What I'm trying to say is that

533
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:02,255
you deserve love, Gwyn.
You are a good man.

534
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,257
Okay?

535
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,774
Now that you have
the Legends behind you,

536
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,637
I promise you
we will do whatever it takes

537
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,932
to make sure that you can be with Alun.

538
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,811
It moves me to know that.

539
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,523
What moves me even more is...

540
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:25,111
your unrelenting belief
that there is a way.

541
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:26,779
Always.

542
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:32,994
I thank you for that, Miss Sharpe.

543
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,039
Come here.

544
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,834
- Oh. Yes, okay.
- It's going to be okay.

545
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:42,670
I'm a hugger.

546
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:47,508
- I guess I'm a hugger, too, now so...
- Okay.

547
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,888
May we introduce
the anti-time manipulator?

548
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,140
Now, do be expeditious, Miss Lance.

549
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:57,310
You see, there is only enough power
to shield you from time stopping once.

550
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,437
Okay, no pressure.

551
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,706
- There's pressure.
- Lots of pressure.

552
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,850
Loads and loads of pressure.

553
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,733
Okay, thanks.

554
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,096
- You're welcome.
- Very welcome.

555
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:07,236
Yeah.

556
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,822
Ticket.

557
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,240
Uh...

558
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:13,534
No one?

559
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:16,329
- There's no more.
- We don't have any more.

560
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,998
I'm sorry, but rules are rules.

561
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:20,208
Here.

562
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,627
Take ours before we change our minds.

563
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:23,920
Uh...

564
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,005
These should come in handy, too.

565
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,424
Comms? Hell yeah.

566
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,719
Wait. Why do you guys want to help us?

567
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,429
I thought we were
a bunch of old geezers.

568
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,556
- Huh?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

569
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,725
We tend to lash out
when we feel threatened.

570
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,144
Yeah, we've been working out our issues
in group therapy.

571
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:41,229
Nice.

572
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:44,482
Anyways, you guys
still look like you've got it,

573
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,609
and this might be
your biggest legend yet,

574
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,653
so... please.

575
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,157
Thank you.

576
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,326
We only need one.

577
00:33:56,619 --> 00:34:00,206
Take a chance on Sara Lance!
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

578
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,460
Take a chance on Sara Lance!
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

579
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,212
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

580
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,756
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

581
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,968
- Go, Sara.
- Sara, come on!

582
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,976
I've got eyes on the prize.

583
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,520
Hey.

584
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,529
Take a chance on Sara Lance!
Take a chance on Sara Lance!

585
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:36,075
- Take a chance on Sara Lance!
- Take a chance on Sara Lance.

586
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,500
Here goes everything.

587
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,363
Thawne?

588
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,783
Big twist, I know.

589
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:21,078
Who would have thought me,
of all people, would be here,

590
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,789
protecting the timeline?

591
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,964
How the hell are you not frozen?

592
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:35,468
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't take you seriously in that hat.

593
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,871
You look like a railroad villain.

594
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,307
Yeah, well,
can a railroad villain do this?

595
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,301
What happened to your super speed?

596
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,615
Long story. Give it up, Sara.

597
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,200
You can never defeat a Fixed Point.

598
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:07,416
Have you met me?

599
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,013
Surrender or die again.

600
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,934
Surrender isn't an option.

601
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:28,062
I've sworn to protect
the Fixed Points at all costs.

602
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:31,107
So when you kill me,
you better be ready to take my place,

603
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,234
or all reality will fall apart.

604
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:38,823
Look, I'm not trying to break reality,

605
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,717
and I definitely don't want
to take your place.

606
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,201
Then why are you doing this?

607
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,495
It's a long story.

608
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,540
We have all the time
in the world, it seems.

609
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:54,672
Fine, let's do this differently.
Care for a drink?

610
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,096
First off, how?

611
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,476
Here's the deal,
every day is the same day.

612
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,271
I wake up, eat my porridge,

613
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,858
do my stretches, meditate,
and then I go to work,

614
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:17,069
except my job
is to protect the Fixed Point.

615
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:20,823
"Job, porridge"? Who are you?

616
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,701
The last time I saw you,
you were a despicable villain.

617
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,329
After the Black Flash vaporized me,

618
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,999
the Time Wraiths pulled me back
from nothingness.

619
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:34,712
They still had a plan for me.

620
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:41,010
My powers stripped,
I was "re-educated" and assigned here

621
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:42,595
to protect this Fixed Point.

622
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,389
- As penance for your past crimes?
- No.

623
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,601
Believe it or not, Sara,
I came to see their point

624
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:53,272
that history cannot
and should not be changed.

625
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:57,401
So, I'm posted here, making sure

626
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:00,529
this Fixed Point remains intact
with this.

627
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:07,536
This keeps me trapped in this day,
June 28th, 1914.

628
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,790
When this timer hit zero,
it jumps me back 24 hours.

629
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,501
It can also freeze time,
as you've discovered.

630
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,544
It really is just a handy little gadget.

631
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:23,719
So, tell me why you are so fixed
on unfixing this Fixed Point.

632
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:25,387
Say that five times fast.

633
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:31,352
Look, I don't want to stop World War I.
Not forever at least.

634
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,189
I just need to stop it long enough to
attract the attention of our Timeship,

635
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,900
so we can steal it back
from the evil AI that's controlling it

636
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,568
and her army of evil robots.

637
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,529
Hmm.

638
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:44,824
I am just trying to get everyone home.

639
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:50,955
You may be determined
to protect this point in history,

640
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,625
but my drive to keep my family safe
will break you down.

641
00:38:55,668 --> 00:39:00,130
So, unless you have another idea
to get me out of your hair,

642
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:04,552
I guess we should get back
to fighting forever.

643
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,096
Well...

644
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,017
There is one other idea.

645
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,688
I might be able to buy you some time

646
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,899
by making it look like
the assassination was prevented.

647
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,027
- How?
- I'll make it

648
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,780
so Gavrilo Princip will
still assassinate the Archduke,

649
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,365
only in 40 minutes,

650
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,784
but your ship's AI won't know that.

651
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:32,121
It'll just think that
there's been a five-alarm Aberration.

652
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,432
Forty minutes is plenty of time for us
to get our ship back.

653
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,666
Fair warning, though.

654
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,335
You go one second over,
and I will have no choice

655
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,628
but to try and kill you again.

656
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,298
And if you kill me,

657
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:47,970
you must swear to take up my post
and protect the Fixed Point.

658
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,560
You have a deal.

659
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,450
You've got 40 minutes, Sara Lance.

660
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,433
Yes, yes!

661
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:37,394
They actually did it.

662
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,271
Now, what happens?

663
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:42,650
Oh, time is being rewritten as we speak.

664
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,586
<i>Get into your positions.</i>

665
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:47,154
Hey, you two, stay here.

666
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,365
Yes, Dr. Heywood. Yes, of course.

667
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,824
Oh! Oh, my God.

668
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,235
I've always wanted to do that.

669
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:56,538
Me, too.

670
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,831
Okay.

671
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,792
Wow. Okay, fantastic.

672
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:05,381
That's good. We'll, uh...
hold the fort as it is.

673
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,012
There she is.

674
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:19,895
Get ready, Legends.
This time, there's no do-overs.
