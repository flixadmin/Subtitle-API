2
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:32,383
You can come on out.

3
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,732
It's an actual store.

4
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,233
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:52,019
I guess I figured
Vacuum Cleaner Repair

6
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:53,905
was a term of art.

7
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,746
If you would step right here
on this blue spot.

8
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:04,332
Leave your luggage
where it is for the moment.

9
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,312
That good?

10
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:19,313
Sure.

11
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:20,565
What about this?

12
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,767
I'll Photoshop that out.

13
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,661
Oh, Nebraska.
What's in Nebraska?

14
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:37,248
You. From now on.

15
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:39,417
It's gonna take me some time

16
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,918
to get your new situation fixed.

17
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:42,703
Until then,
you're gonna be staying here.

18
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:45,506
I got a place downstairs,
out of sight.

19
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,758
It's not the Ritz-Carlton,

20
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:49,576
but it's comfortable enough
for short-term.

21
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:51,412
How short-term?

22
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,466
Considering you got your face up on
buses and billboards all over town,

23
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:59,270
I'm thinking, uh, two days.

24
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:02,607
Maybe three.

25
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:04,442
Only thing is,

26
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,727
and I don't like to do this,

27
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:10,231
but, uh, you'll have a bunk mate.

28
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:13,284
Oh, yeah?
He's still here?

29
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,102
For the moment.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,539
He's a special case.
Gonna take some doing.

31
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,995
How's he holding up?

32
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,299
You be the judge.

33
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:49,991

34
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,910
We will find Hank.

35
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:08,995
Steve too.

36
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,614
They're out there,
and we're gonna find them.

37
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,700
You have my word.

38
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:20,006
Sir.

39
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:29,349
Call it in, get her out of here.
Move.

40
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:43,696
<i>I, uh, get to his door,</i>

41
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:46,866
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>

42
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,985
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>

43
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:51,654
<i>And I thought, you know,</i>

44
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:54,207
<i>maybe, uh...</i>

45
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:57,043
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>

46
00:03:57,077 --> 00:04:00,446
<i>The music stopped,
and then he was right there.</i>

47
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:03,883
<i>When he saw the gun,
he thought...</i>

48
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,618
Hey, Kenny.

49
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:08,922
Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

50
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:14,644
Just watch.

51
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:15,979
<i>Kept saying that...</i>

52
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:17,313
<i>You know,
"You don't have to do this."</i>

53
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,148
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>

54
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:23,519
Such a bitch.
He won't quit.

55
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:25,021
<i>...high-fiving,
because it worked,</i>

56
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:27,440
<i>then, you know, we turn around,</i>

57
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:30,360
<i>and there is this kid</i>

58
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:33,696
<i>on a dirt bike, looking at us.</i>

59
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,033
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>

60
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:40,253
<i>That kid that went missing
up in White Horse.</i>

61
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:42,088
<i>It's him.</i>

62
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:45,675
<i>And then out of nowhere,</i>

63
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:50,263
<i>Todd, that opie,
dead-eyed piece of shit,</i>

64
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:54,384
<i>pulls out a gun
and shoots the kid.</i>

65
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,552
<i>This is Todd Alquist
we're talking about?</i>

66
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,855
<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>

67
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,109
<i>Boom.
Like it was nothing.</i>

68
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:15,622
Hey, Uncle Jack.
Hold up.

69
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:20,126
I think we should keep him
for a while,

70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,378
get a couple of cooks
under our belt.

71
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,914
You seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

72
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,582
He ratted you out.
Personally.

73
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:28,718
We still got 600 gallons
of methylamine.

74
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:30,920
Meth?
Who gives a shit about meth?

75
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:31,971
We won the lottery here.

76
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:35,141
We've got all the money
in the world.

77
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,143
You're talking to me
about selling crank?

78
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:39,062
I mean, this is
millions, Uncle Jack.

79
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:40,096
No matter how much you got,

80
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:42,565
how do you turn
your back on more?

81
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:50,222
You little...

82
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,775
son of a bitch.

83
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:59,165
It's that Lydia woman.

84
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,251
You're sweet on her,
you little bastard.

85
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:03,736
Hey, Kenny, you believe this?

86
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:07,256
Hey, it's all about this
right here, huh?

87
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,011
Come on.

88
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:13,629
You can do better.

89
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,465
I mean, that one's so uptight,

90
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:17,266
she's probably got a wood
chipper for a coochie.

91
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,135
You stick it in down there,

92
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:21,304
you're pulling back a stump.

93
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,808
Ah, what the hell.

94
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,494
Heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

95
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:32,878
Let's go back and watch some more

96
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,868
of that crybaby rat, huh?

97
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,957
How thick is it?

98
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:38,097
This is mild steel?

99
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,332
Uh-huh.

100
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,668
Uh, no, this would be cash.

101
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,402
What?

102
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,187
Nothing.

103
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,176
Hey, you know what?

104
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,492
Make yourself useful.

105
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:09,361
Give me a list
of hitters, mercenaries.

106
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:12,498
Yes, yes, I remember.
You've got concerns.

107
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:15,635
Don't worry. We'll take
the time to vet them.

108
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,006
Make sure there are no
undercover cops on the team.

109
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,424
Five should do it.

110
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:25,561
Providing they're
the right men for the job.

111
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:27,546
I'm gonna hate myself for asking,

112
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:30,650
but, uh, who are we hitting?

113
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:36,656
Jack Welker.
And his men.

114
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,826
They murdered Hank.
They stole my life's work.

115
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,328
I don't know any hit men.

116
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:45,231
You know a guy who knows a guy.

117
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:48,417
Just get me the contacts.
Anybody in that world.

118
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:53,339
I'm paying top dollar.
We'll find them.

119
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:56,008
You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

120
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:58,410
Just for old time's sake?

121
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:00,546
You're worried about
your wife and kids?

122
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,381
Don't leave.

123
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:03,933
The way things are right now,

124
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,885
some people, not me, mind you,

125
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,186
but some people might say

126
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,305
you're leaving her high and dry.

127
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:12,892
Some people would be
ignorant on the facts.

128
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,760
Some people wouldn't know

129
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:17,396
that as far as the police
are concerned,

130
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,782
Skyler is a blameless victim.

131
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:24,537
No, no, no.
Go ahead.

132
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:27,106
Get it off your chest.

133
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:28,774
Go on.

134
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,626
The phone call was a smart move.

135
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,661
Kudos to you.

136
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:33,412
Odds are it was recorded.

137
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:34,664
It's gonna play great for a jury.

138
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,465
It might even buy her a mistrial.

139
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,467
In a year and a half.

140
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,919
Until then,
if they don't have you,

141
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:40,953
they're going after her.

142
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,805
There's no point.
She knows nothing.

143
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,056
Well, too bad for her, then.

144
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,975
She's got nothing to trade.

145
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,593
I hate to be a downer here,

146
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:49,729
but there are two
DEA agents missing.

147
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:50,963
Presumed dead.

148
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,815
You think the feds
are gonna just let that go

149
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,183
'cause you hit the ejector seat?

150
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,651
First thing they're gonna do,

151
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:58,637
they will RICO your wife
and kids out of the house.

152
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,656
That condo is gone.

153
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,491
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

154
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,476
Her picture's probably
on TV right now,

155
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:05,528
next to yours.

156
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:06,946
Who's gonna hire her?

157
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,080
Money's no problem.

158
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:10,249
Well, I don't mean
to contradict you,

159
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:12,585
but getting it to her,
impossible.

160
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,338
The feds are just praying
that you'll make contact.

161
00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:17,506
Internet, the phone...
it's all tapped.

162
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,209
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

163
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,262
But every time he tried to get his
nest egg to his granddaughter,

164
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:27,350
it ended up
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

165
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,885
So you propose what?

166
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:34,273
Stay. Face the music.

167
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:38,344
Hey, I mean, how much time
have you got left?

168
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:40,396
You walk in with
your head held high.

169
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:41,847
You'll be the John Dillinger

170
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:43,349
of the Metropolitan
Detention Center.

171
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,516
How bad is that?

172
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,319
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money,

173
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:49,288
maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

174
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:51,657
Maybe they let your family
stay in the house.

175
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,294
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

176
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:57,363
God, you think I want to run?!

177
00:10:57,381 --> 00:11:00,333
This is the last thing
that I want.

178
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,468
This... this changes nothing.

179
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:06,038
What I do, I do for my family.

180
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,474
My money goes to my children.

181
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:10,542
Not just this barrel.
All of it!

182
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:16,349
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

183
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,818
and I'm gonna
take back what is mine

184
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,353
and give it to my children.

185
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,489
And then, and only then...

186
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:25,157
Am I through.

187
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,410
Do you understand?

188
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,198
Everything good?

189
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,116
Define "good."

190
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,203
You're set.
Time to go.

191
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,588
You'll be a little longer.

192
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:41,590
I'm still working
on transportation.

193
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,342
Change of plans.

194
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:44,593
He's coming with me.

195
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,912
No.
No, that's not...

196
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,467
We're going together.
I can use him.

197
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:53,886
I'll give you two a minute.

198
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,772
Hey, I'm a civilian.

199
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,107
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

200
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:00,309
I'm nobody's lawyer.
The fun's over.

201
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,778
From here on out,
I'm Mr. Low Profile.

202
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,430
Just another douche bag
with a job

203
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,614
and three pairs of Dockers.

204
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,982
If I'm lucky, month from now,

205
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:08,200
best-case scenario,

206
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:10,119
I'm managing a cinnabon in Omaha.

207
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:12,371
You're still part of this.
Whether you like it or not.

208
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:14,824
I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

209
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,417
You remember what I told you?

210
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:27,503
It's not over.

211
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:30,723
Unti...

212
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:50,576
It's over.

213
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,765
Is she even listening?

214
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,152
Mrs. White?

215
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,187
Are you following all this?

216
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,691
Do you understand
what's happening here?

217
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,527
Yes.

218
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,300
I understand.

219
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,915
I understand
I'm in terrible trouble.

220
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,504
I understand that you
will use everything

221
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,124
in your power against me
and my children

222
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,462
unless... unless
I give you Walt.

223
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:11,082
But the truth is,
I can't give you what you want.

224
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,303
I don't know where he is.

225
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,280
All right, go and discuss this
with your lawyer here.

226
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,299
Rack your brain.

227
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,436
And hope you can come up
with something we can use.

228
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:44,850
<i>4-17?</i>

229
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,356
4-17. No activity.

230
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:41,356
Ma'am, is there anybody
else in the house?

231
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,974
What about your son?

232
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,943
If I go look in his room,

233
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,912
am I gonna see him?

234
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,282
He's not gonna pop out
and surprise me?

235
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,250
If this guy takes his hand away,

236
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,154
are you gonna scream?

237
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,009
He's at his friend's house.

238
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,994
He's been there all week.

239
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:06,131
Please...
Please don't hurt my baby.

240
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,017
- Please... please.
- Ma'am.

241
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,888
We... we got a lot
of respect for your husband.

242
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,007
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

243
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:19,528
Okay? We know that you've
been talking to the police,

244
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,729
and that's okay.

245
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,564
You gotta do that.

246
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:26,184
But you've seen some people.

247
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:30,705
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

248
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,075
The one with the black hair.

249
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,694
You said anything about her?

250
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:43,468
You sure about that?

251
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,054
I didn't.

252
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,341
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

253
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,383
Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to say it.

254
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:02,487
I... will... not...

255
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:07,776
say anything about her.
Ever.

256
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,227
I swear.

257
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,787
Okay.

258
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,171
When we leave,

259
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,539
you're not gonna go

260
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:25,176
running to those
police officers out front?

261
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,746
No.

262
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:36,388
Okay. Okay.

263
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,027
'Cause you really
don't want us coming back here.

264
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,412
Don't.
Stay where you are.

265
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,865
We'll talk like this.

266
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,453
Okay.

267
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,091
So that thing
that we talked about,

268
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,676
I went to
Mr. and Mrs. White's house...

269
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,629
You don't...
have to say the name.

270
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,766
Sure.

271
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,184
And it went really good.

272
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,188
I mean, the message
was received loud and clear.

273
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,943
The message? Yeah.

274
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,812
Look, I know you did your best.
I just think...

275
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,481
Hi.
What can I get you?

276
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,950
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

277
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,985
And I'll need more stevia.

278
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,954
Sure.

279
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,294
The person we're discussing
saw my face.

280
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,829
You're not Western Union, Todd.

281
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:29,667
We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

282
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,885
Really, if you'd been there,

283
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,921
I think you'd see it different.

284
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,090
We threw a real scare into her.

285
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:39,877
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

286
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,212
So...

287
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,897
You're not going to have
a problem with her.

288
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,382
I can pretty much guarantee it.

289
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,434
I wish I had your certainty,

290
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,353
but I'm not like
you and your uncle.

291
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:52,107
I'm just... I'm not used
to this kind of risk.

292
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,275
We're gonna have to take a break.

293
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,782
I... I have 50 pounds
vacuum packed and ready to go.

294
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,836
And I wish you all the luck
in the world with it.

295
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,788
It's 92%.

296
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:12,343
I'm sorry?

297
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,264
92%.

298
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,583
Truly?

299
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:19,584
Tested it twice.

300
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:23,087
And it's blue.
Just like before.

301
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:27,976
92.
That's Heisenberg level.

302
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,529
He's not... with you?

303
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,949
Well, next best thing.
Pinkman.

304
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,768
They're looking for Pinkman.

305
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:39,287
Well, they're not
going to find him.

306
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,240
He's with us,
and he's not going anywhere.

307
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,547
Ms. Quayle, this is what
your guys in Europe

308
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,300
have been begging for, right?

309
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:02,293
I just think we work together... good.

310
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:06,764
We make a good team.

311
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,768
I think it's kind of...

312
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,771
mutually good.

313
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,976
92%.

314
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,212
Ugh.

315
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,947
Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshire.

316
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:16,641
All right.

317
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:19,260
Let's have a look at this place.

318
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,764
You got about a month's
worth of food on hand,

319
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:24,616
most of it's canned goods,

320
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,985
but there's steaks
in the freezer.

321
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,120
You got a generator outside,

322
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:30,538
works on LP.

323
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:32,540
Ought to be enough in the tank

324
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:33,775
to last out the winter.

325
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:35,210
It's only 15 amps,

326
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,962
but that ought to do
for the lights,

327
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:38,797
TV, and the freezer.

328
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:40,799
That's a wood-burner.

329
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,284
Ought to warm
the place up pretty good.

330
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:46,137
Plus you can cook on it.

331
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:47,923
On the TV front,

332
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:50,225
the reception's pretty much nil.

333
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:51,977
You got some mountains
in the way.

334
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:55,296
Weather's right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

335
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:58,299
but mostly you'll be
limited to DVDs.

336
00:22:58,317 --> 00:23:02,737
<i>Mr. Magorium's
Wonder Emporium.</i>

337
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,973
Two copies.

338
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:08,827
I'm not much of a movie guy.

339
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,696
I'll make a supply run
next month.

340
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:15,834
You want something else
to watch, put it on the list.

341
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,752
Supply run.

342
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:21,373
$50,000 for a trip to Costco.

343
00:23:21,424 --> 00:23:22,757
It's risk.

344
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:25,210
And risk is what
you're paying me for,

345
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:26,845
not toilet paper.

346
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:30,682
Risk and a 4,400-mile
round trip.

347
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:34,836
Mr. Lambert,
my clients and I

348
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:37,439
don't usually have
an ongoing relationship.

349
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:40,892
Normally, you and I would have
already gone our separate ways,

350
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:43,611
but you're you.

351
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:47,649
Where's the phone?

352
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:48,950
No phone.

353
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:53,321
Up here, ice storms
equal service calls,

354
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:55,957
equal you in cuffs.

355
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:57,492
Internet?

356
00:23:57,526 --> 00:23:58,827
Same deal.

357
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:03,415
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

358
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:07,052
You want news, I'll bring
the Albuquerque papers.

359
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:08,887
Whatever you need, just...

360
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:10,055
- put it on the list.
- Put it on the list.

361
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,056
Yeah.

362
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,593
Look, I have business to conduct.

363
00:24:15,644 --> 00:24:18,880
Your business is your business.

364
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:22,150
My business is keeping
you out of custody.

365
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:25,487
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

366
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:27,489
Your face is all over TV.

367
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:30,158
You are the hottest client
I have ever had.

368
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:32,610
<i>By far.</i>

369
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:34,579
It stands to reason

370
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:38,283
you've got to keep out of sight.

371
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:41,786
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

372
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:43,788
Nothing.

373
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,041
There's a little
one-horse town

374
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:47,675
eight miles down the hill.

375
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,677
There's not a thing
on God's green Earth

376
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:52,747
that I can do to stop you
going down there.

377
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:54,415
All I'm saying is,

378
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:57,385
if you leave this place,

379
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,138
you will get caught.

380
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:02,357
And, I gotta tell you,

381
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:06,694
if I find out that
you've left the reservation,

382
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:08,563
I won't be coming back.

383
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:10,765
That is for my own safety.

384
00:25:10,783 --> 00:25:14,786
You understand?

385
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,772
Sure.

386
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,273
You know how to work the stove?

387
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,608
- The flue can be tricky.
- Yeah.

388
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:22,377
I got it.

389
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:29,384
You paid good money for this.

390
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:30,835
You got two acres up here,

391
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:33,121
lots of woods, nice, warm place.

392
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:35,473
Seems to me just the spot

393
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:39,644
for a man to rest up,
think on things.

394
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:44,799
If you look around,
it's kinda beautiful.

395
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:48,520
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.

396
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:50,405
See you in a month.

397
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:29,254
Tomorrow.

398
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:34,792
Tomorrow.

399
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:25,393
Come...

400
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,237
That's not my chocolate
chip, is it?

401
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:38,573
You're gonna spoil him.

402
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:44,612
Hey, you awake?

403
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:47,749
Huh? Yeah.

404
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:50,752
We had some Ben and Jerry's.

405
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:56,457
There's peanut butter cup
and "Americone Dream."

406
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:57,542
I didn't know what you liked,

407
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,510
so I got you some of each.

408
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:05,300
There you go.

409
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:21,316
So that batch that you
just cooked was 96%.

410
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,186
Kinda figured you deserved
a little something.

411
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:28,790
Thanks.

412
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:46,224
Well, better get some sleep.

413
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:49,210
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

414
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:50,978
Got a whole new batch.

415
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:53,097
Hey, um, Todd.

416
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:54,432
Yeah?

417
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:59,437
Would you mind, uh,
leaving the tarp off tonight?

418
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:01,189
Well, might get cold.

419
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:02,556
No, I... I don't mind.

420
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:06,060
I just...
I just wanna see the stars.

421
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:12,417
Sure. Okay.

422
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:14,919
Thanks.

423
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:19,173
Well, goodnight, Jesse.

424
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,592
Night.

425
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:21,686
Okay. Okay. Okay.

426
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:57,855
Come on. Bitch.

427
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:50,825
Go ahead! Do it!

428
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:53,060
Just kill me now
and get it over with,

429
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:54,395
because there's no way

430
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:56,030
I'm doing one more cook

431
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,115
for you psycho fucks!

432
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:18,719
Yes?

433
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:20,087
Hi, ma'am.
How you doing tonight?

434
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:22,256
Um, you're Andrea, right?

435
00:33:22,274 --> 00:33:24,475
How can I help you?

436
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:27,528
You know Jesse Pinkman?

437
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,263
Right?
Well, I'm a friend of his.

438
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:30,898
My name's Todd.

439
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:32,783
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

440
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:36,821
but it's nice to meet you.

441
00:33:41,276 --> 00:33:42,994
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

442
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,778
Yeah, he's okay.

443
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:47,131
Actually, I brought him with me.

444
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:48,549
Jesse's here?

445
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:51,002
Yeah, he's right...
over there.

446
00:33:51,053 --> 00:33:53,087
In that truck.

447
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,983
Where?

448
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,570
No!

449
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:16,243
Just so you know,
this isn't personal.

450
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:19,980
No!

451
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:42,603
Whoa. Hey.
Settle down.

452
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:46,607
Settle down.

453
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,509
Hey, remember.

454
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:50,695
There's still the kid.

455
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:57,558
I brought you a couple
of cases of ensure.

456
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,160
Maybe put a little weight on you.

457
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:00,662
Jesus.

458
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:02,697
I can barely read this.

459
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:04,832
Ah. Almost forgot.

460
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,734
Without a prescription,

461
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:08,703
I had to take an educated
guess and shotgun it.

462
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:10,171
One of these ought to come close.

463
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:12,206
Oh.

464
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:16,594
Did you, uh, check on them?

465
00:36:16,629 --> 00:36:18,579
Is Skyler in a better place?

466
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:21,966
Nah, she's still at that
place off of Eubank.

467
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:24,352
Kids are both still
with her for the moment.

468
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:26,971
Uh, there's no court date yet.

469
00:36:27,022 --> 00:36:29,524
The news was talking
about a grand jury,

470
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:31,759
but they didn't say when.

471
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:35,113
I saw her public defender on TV.

472
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:37,765
Looks like a deer
in the headlights.

473
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:42,370
Think I got socks older than him.

474
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:44,989
What are they doing for money?

475
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,792
She's doing
taxi dispatch part-time.

476
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:51,963
Leaves the baby with a
neighbor when she goes in.

477
00:36:51,997 --> 00:36:53,998
I saw her shopping one time.

478
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,717
She looks pretty good.

479
00:36:55,751 --> 00:36:58,336
And she's using her maiden name.

480
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:00,722
I wouldn't take that personally

481
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:02,340
under the circumstances.

482
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:03,975
Those working for you?

483
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:06,293
Oh, yeah.

484
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:08,680
I took a run by your old house.

485
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:10,648
Uh, the auction's still pending.

486
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:12,734
They put a fence up around it.

487
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:13,985
They put up a fence?

488
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:15,136
Seems like the place

489
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:17,238
got to be kind of
a tourist attraction.

490
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:18,856
Kids breaking in.

491
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:19,974
The neighbors complained,

492
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:22,476
so the bank put up a fence.

493
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,750
You ready?

494
00:37:28,784 --> 00:37:30,918
Hmm?

495
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,923
Yeah.

496
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:41,662
Sorry about last time.

497
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,798
It should go better now.

498
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:47,668
I watched a couple
of YouTube videos.

499
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:51,022
It's all about finding the vein.

500
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:54,642
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

501
00:38:08,707 --> 00:38:11,159
Here.
You... you do it.

502
00:38:13,712 --> 00:38:15,196
Big fist.

503
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:16,579
Tight. There we go.

504
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:19,255
All right.

505
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:21,807
It's just...

506
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,309
little stick.

507
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,010
That's it. Okay. Hey.

508
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:27,847
Pretty good.
There you go.

509
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,269
Think I had worse
my last physical.

510
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,692
I will see you on...

511
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:41,861
Let's see.

512
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:46,449
Afternoon of the 15th.

513
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,001
Stay a little longer?

514
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:53,906
Yeah, I got a long trip
ahead of me.

515
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:57,593
Two hours?

516
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:02,581
I'll... I'll give you
another $10,000.

517
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:10,940
Please.

518
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,529
$10,000.

519
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,597
One hour.

520
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,371
Cards?

521
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,628
All right, well...

522
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:37,383
The game will be Seven Card.

523
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,670
I'll deal, since you are...

524
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,789
encumbered.

525
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:55,484
One of these days
when you come up here...

526
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,102
I'll be dead.

527
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,942
My money over there.

528
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:07,163
What happens to it then?

529
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:11,917
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?

530
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:21,343
Would you do it?

531
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:29,018
If I said yes...

532
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,387
would you believe me?

533
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:43,732
You wanna cut the cards?

534
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:48,687
No.

535
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,996
A king.

536
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,964
Two kings.

537
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,006
_

538
00:43:41,707 --> 00:43:43,875
<i>Flynn White to the
Principal's office, please.</i>

539
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:55,487
I'm sorry to pull you
out of class.

540
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:57,188
It's your Aunt Marie.

541
00:43:57,222 --> 00:43:59,724
It sounds very important.

542
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:01,743
You can take it in here, okay?

543
00:44:01,777 --> 00:44:02,777
Okay.

544
00:44:02,828 --> 00:44:05,614
Here he is.

545
00:44:05,665 --> 00:44:07,365
Thank you.

546
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,584
Hey, Aunt Marie.

547
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,953
Um, what's...
what's going on?

548
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:13,838
Hold on a sec, honey.

549
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,048
<i>Son, it's me.
Please don't let on.</i>

550
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:24,349
<i>Carmen's nearby, right?</i>

551
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:25,967
<i>She cannot know.</i>

552
00:44:26,018 --> 00:44:28,887
<i>Son, are you there?</i>

553
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:31,189
Ye... yes.

554
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:35,193
It's so good to hear your voice.

555
00:44:38,263 --> 00:44:39,781
I... I...

556
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:43,401
I, uh...

557
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:48,456
Son, the things
that they're saying...

558
00:44:48,491 --> 00:44:51,743
<i>about me...
I did wrong.</i>

559

<i>I... I made
some terrible mistakes.</i>

560
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:59,634
But the reasons were always...

561
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:06,091
Things happened that...

562
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:09,460
I... I never... intended.

563
00:45:09,478 --> 00:45:12,013
I never intended.

564
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:18,269
Listen.

565
00:45:18,303 --> 00:45:20,905
Son, we don't have much time.

566
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,577
Is Louis' family
still at 4848 Newcombe?

567
00:45:25,611 --> 00:45:28,947
<i>Son, your friend, Louis Corbett,</i>

568
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:31,182

569
00:45:31,217 --> 00:45:33,652
<i>up on Newcombe?</i>

570
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:34,686
Ye... yes.

571
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,820
<i>Okay, good.</i>

572
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:37,956
Okay,
he's... he's a good kid.

573
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,708
He's... he's like you.
He'll understand.

574
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:42,627
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>

575
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:46,464
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis,
but it's for you.</i>

576
00:45:46,498 --> 00:45:50,935
<i>Your mother and your sister.</i>

577
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,022
There's...
there's money inside.

578
00:45:54,056 --> 00:45:59,527
About $100,000.
Okay?

579
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:01,780
I think.

580
00:46:01,814 --> 00:46:05,233
<i>It was all that
I could fit into the box.</i>

581
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:06,868
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>

582
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,319
And if anyone says a word,

583
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:10,538
the police will take it.

584
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:24,219
<i>I wanted to give you
so much more.</i>

585
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,588
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>

586
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:29,090
Do you understand?

587
00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:35,764
Son?

588
00:46:35,815 --> 00:46:38,767
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

589
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:44,739
You want to send money?

590
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:46,324
Yes. Good.

591
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:49,828
Good, good.

592
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:52,530
So you'll...
you'll talk to Louis, right?

593
00:46:52,564 --> 00:46:55,083
You killed Uncle Hank.

594
00:46:55,117 --> 00:46:56,234
You killed him!

595
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:58,569
Wait. Wait, son.

596
00:46:58,587 --> 00:47:01,873
No.
What you did to mom... you asshole.

597
00:47:01,907 --> 00:47:03,425
You killed Uncle Hank.

598
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:05,060
Listen to me.
You've got to listen to me.

599
00:47:05,077 --> 00:47:07,095
<i>Just shut up.
Just stop it.</i>

600
00:47:07,129 --> 00:47:08,596
Sto... stop it.

601
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,414
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

602
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:12,434
I don't give a shit.

603
00:47:12,468 --> 00:47:13,768
You need this money.
Your mother...

604
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:15,303
<i>You killed Uncle Hank.
You killed him!</i>

605
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:17,021
Your mother needs this money.

606
00:47:17,056 --> 00:47:18,177
It can't all be for nothing.

607
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,724
<i>What you did...
Just shut up.</i>

608
00:47:19,758 --> 00:47:21,592
<i>- Please.

just leave us alone.</i>

611

You asshole!

612
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:29,484
Why are you still alive?

613
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,936
<i>Why don't you just...
just die already?</i>

614

00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,657
<i>who... who was there early on,</i>

657
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:46,892
<i>but who had virtually</i>

658
00:50:46,926 --> 00:50:48,727
<i>nothing to do with
the creation of the company,</i>

659
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:49,895
<i>and still less to do</i>

660
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:51,496
<i>with growing it
into what it is today.</i>

661
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:54,833
<i>So what was Walter White's
contribution?</i>

662
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:58,937
<i>You know, to be honest...
Honey?</i>

663
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,073
<i>- The company name.
- The company name.</i>

664
00:51:01,107 --> 00:51:03,942
<i>We came up with it
by combining our names.</i>

665
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,410
<i>Uh, "Schwartz" means black,</i>

666
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:07,045
<i>black plus White makes gray.</i>

667
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,780
<i>It's Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

668
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,682
<i>Exactly.
As far as I can recall,</i>

669
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:13,085
<i>his contribution begins
and ends right there.</i>

670
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,853
<i>There are continuing reports</i>

671
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:16,622
<i>of blue methamphetamine,</i>

672
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:20,025
<i>considered his signature product
throughout the Southwest,</i>

673
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:23,462
<i>and some evidence
of reaching as far as Europe.</i>

674
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:25,163
<i>So my question is,</i>

675
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:28,233
<i>is Walter White still out there?</i>

676
00:51:28,268 --> 00:51:30,335
<i>No, he's not.</i>

677
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,072
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

678
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:35,340
<i>I am.</i>

679
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,076
<i>I can't speak to this Heisenberg</i>

680
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,646
<i>that people refer to,</i>

681
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,348
<i>but whatever...</i>

682
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:44,783
<i>whatever he became,</i>

683
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:47,619
<i>the... the sweet, kind,
brilliant man</i>

684
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:51,523
<i>that we once knew,
long ago, he's gone.</i>

685
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:53,625
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>

686
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:22,254
Police. Hands.

687
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:23,288
Show us your hands.

688
00:52:23,322 --> 00:52:25,340
Show me your hands.
