1
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,341
[Jesse] There.

2
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,511
That's them.

3
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,608
[Sighs] Your play, Walter.

4
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,643
You're on your own.

5
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,894
Looks like you're about 1,000
gallons light here, Mike.

6
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,896
Where's the juice?

7
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,232
The methylamine isn't coming.

8
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,703
Why is that?

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,671
And who the hell are you?

10
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,173
I'm the man who's keeping it.

11
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,009
What the hell's this?

12
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:19,695
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

13
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,681
- So where's the tank, Mike?
- Mike doesn't know where it is.

14
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:26,152
Only I do. And you're dealing
with me now, not him.

15
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,353
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want,

16
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,522
or what you think is gonna
happen here, all right?

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,325
'Cause we're gonna get
what we came for.

18
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,695
That 1,000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands

19
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:39,381
than it is in yours or anyone
else's, for that matter.

20
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,384
But I need distribution.

21
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,887
[Chuckles] Distribution.

22
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,872
That's right.

23
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,375
So if you agree
to give up your cook

24
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:53,229
and sell my product instead,

25
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,714
I'll give you 35 percent
of the take.

26
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:59,384
35 percent?
Wow. Are you kidding me?

27
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,721
35-- Mike, please tell
me this is a joke.

28
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:06,108
You know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

29
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,893
And why the hell
would we want you?

30
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,912
You realize we have
our own operation, right?

31
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:12,581
I know all about
your operation.

32
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:16,001
My partners here tell me
that you produce a meth

33
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,455
that's 70% pure,
if you're lucky.

34
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,709
What I produce
is 99.1% pure.

35
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,244
So?

36
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,434
So... it's grade school T-Ball

37
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,104
versus the New York Yankees.

38
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:38,807
Yours is, uh, just some tepid,

39
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,094
off-brand,
generic cola.

40
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:46,098
What I'm making
is classic Coke.

41
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,867
All right. Okay.

42
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,819
So, um, [Clears throat]

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,122
if we just waste you
right here,

44
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,291
right now,
and leave you in the desert,

45
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,876
then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

46
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,629
See how that works?
There's only us.

47
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:04,616
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca Cola?

48
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,230
My partner tells me
that your crew

49
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,150
switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

50
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,519
You dye your meth
with food coloring

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,187
to make it look like mine.

52
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,658
You already ape my product
at every turn.

53
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:31,443
But now...

54
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,862
you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

55
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,914
I need you to listen to me.

56
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,916
We're not gonna
give up this deal

57
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,036
to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

58
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,038
For what?

59
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,374
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

60
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,094
A better high
means customers pay more.

61
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,516
A higher purity
means a greater yield.

62
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,836
That's 130 million dollars
a profit

63
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:01,857
that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

64
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:04,727
Now you listen to me.

65
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,012
You've got the greatest
meth cook in a--

in America right here,

68
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,236
and with our skills,

69
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,789
you'll earn more from that 35%

70
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,857
than you ever would
on your own.

71
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,026
Yeah. So you say.

72
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,195
Just wondering why
we're so lucky.

73
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,130
Why cut us in?

74
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,083
Mike is retiring from our crew,

75
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,803
so his share of the partnership
is available,

76
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,972

78
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,394
And if you give him
five million dollars

79
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,396
of the 15 million
that you brought today.

80

Just think of it
as a finder's fee

81
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,817
for bringing us together.

82
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,454
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship,

83

do that for me, right?

- Right down there.
- Ah.

323
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,426
But because it happened, what,

324
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:29,428
am I supposed to just lie down

325
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:31,430
and die with him?

326
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:32,982
It's done!

327
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,984
It makes me sick
that it happened,

328
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:37,937
just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

329
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,872
What Todd did--

330
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:43,609
You and I have done things
that are just as bad.

331
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:44,944
Yeah.

332
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,946
All the people
that we've killed--

333
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:50,166
Gale and the rest...

334
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,168
If you believe
that there's a hell--

335
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,171
I don't know if you're into that.
But we're...

336
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:57,623
We're already pretty much
going there, right?

337
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:01,144
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

338
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:05,648
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

339
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:08,300
How many more people
are gonna die 'cause of us?

340
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,469
No one. None.

341
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:13,189
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

342
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,110
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

343
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:19,612
- No.
- Always! You know what?

344
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:22,532
I'm done, okay?

345
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,534
You just give me my money,

346
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:27,036
and you and I--

347
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,339
we're done.

348
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:35,128
Hmm. Okay.

349
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,630
Why?

350
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,301
Why do you want this money?

351
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,190
Because it's mine.
It's my cut.

352
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,942
But isn't it filthy
blood money?

353
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:53,396
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

354
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:56,199
No, no, no, no.
You shouldn't touch that dirty money.

355
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,818
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

356
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,487
Come on.

357
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:03,156
You want it.

358
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,742
You want it just as much
as I want it.

359
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,745
And it's not wrong to want it.

360
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:10,246
Okay?

361
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:14,133
So stay and work with me,

362
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:17,369
and you can make ten ti--
20 times as much.

363
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,644
Whatever, man.

364
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:28,097
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

365
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:29,599
Yes, you do.

366
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,151
It's on you, all right?

367
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:35,104
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

368
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:37,573
You're not done.
You're not leaving,

369
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:40,109
because if you leave,
you get nothing!

370
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,696
Do you understand me?
Nothing!

371
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,199
Jesse!

372
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:54,553
<i>Budget for the current fiscal
year for electronic surveillance</i>

373
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:55,854

374
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>on par with ATF</i>
<i>and the Marshal Service,</i>

375
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,959
<i>but still just a fraction</i>
<i>of FBI totals.</i>

376
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:04,045
<i>We're lobbying congress</i>
<i>for an additional 1.41,</i>

377
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,181

381

382
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:19,344

00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:23,565
<i>Hank?</i>

385
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,367
<i>Hank!</i>

386
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:29,237
<i>I think we're going</i>

389
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,410
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

390
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:50,225
<i>You know no one wants</i>

391
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,394
<i>to see you succeed at this</i>
<i>more than me, right?</i>

392
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:55,096
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I know how good you are.</i>

393
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:58,233
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

394
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,602
<i>But you're not knocking</i>

395
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:02,771
<i>You're in charge</i>

396
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:04,990
<i>and that comes</i>
<i>with responsibilities.</i>

397
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,192
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports</i>

398
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:09,494
<i>aren't being filed</i>
<i>in a timely manner.</i>

399
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,413
I'll work on it.
It'll get better.

400
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:13,832
<i>Yeah, it will, because way
too much time and money</i>

401
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,533
<i>is being spent</i>
<i>on the Fring case,</i>

402
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,202
<i>a case which is</i>
<i>essentially over.</i>

403
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:19,087
<i>All this overtime</i>

404
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:21,373
<i>to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

405
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:23,408
<i>That's just money that could</i>
<i>be better spent elsewhere.</i>

406
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,093
I understand,

407
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:26,911
but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

408
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:29,414
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street,

409
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:32,250
Fring's gang is still operational,
and Ehrmantraut is involved.

410
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:33,584
It's that simple.

411
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,586
<i>I believe you.</i>
<i>But so what?</i>

412
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:37,588
<i>It's one case out of dozens,</i>

413
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:40,558
<i>and you don't play favorites with it
just because it used to be yours.</i>

414
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:42,560
- I really think that--
<i>- Don't play favorites with it, Hank.</i>

415
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:44,429
<i>You got a bigger job than that.</i>

416
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:46,431
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>forget the financial cost.</i>

417
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,933
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

418
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:51,236
That was an error in judgment.

419
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,288
- Won't happen again.
<i>- You're damn right it won't.</i>

420
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,290
<i>I'm just gonna bottom line</i>
<i>this for you.</i>

421
00:25:55,324 --> 00:25:58,326
<i>The surveillance budget</i>
<i>for Ehrmantraut is now zero.</i>

422
00:25:58,377 --> 00:26:00,412
<i>We clear?</i>

423
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:03,298
Sure. Thank you.

424
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:05,350
- Clear.
<i>- Good.</i>

425
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:07,385
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

426
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:19,514
[Knocking] Yeah?

427
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:22,633
Hey.

428
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:31,242
So, Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

429
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:33,161
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

430
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:35,113
Yeah.
Something like that.

431
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:38,033
No more following Ehrmantraut.

432
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:41,619
Not worth
the financial investment.

433
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,838
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

434
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:46,324
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

435
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:48,343
He's just living
a boring old-man life

436
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,929
like he has nothing left
to hide.

437
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:52,964
And none of Fring's crew
is talking?

438
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:54,632
Not giving an inch.

439
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,718
You sweeten the pot enough?

440
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:00,021
Zero jail time and an
all-expense-paid trip to Maui?

441
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:02,173
[Chuckles] Not that, but close.

442
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,841
Nobody wants to bite.

443
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,176
Christ!

444
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:07,278
They're either the most
loyal crew in history,

445
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,947
or someone's
still paying them off.

446
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:10,281
You still checking
bank records?

447
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:11,700
No one living
beyond their means.

448
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,651
Nine perps...

449
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,904
All being represented
by one lawyer.

450
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:18,189
Not unusual
in a case like this.

451
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:20,191
Yeah, this guy--
What's his name?

452
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:23,078
Daniel Wachsberger?

453
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:26,214
He represents every one
of these douchebags

454
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:28,533
except for Ehrmantraut.

455
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:30,868
Can we find out
more about the lawyer?

456
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:33,138
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

457
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:35,724
Like the shit ain't deep
enough for you already?

458
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,726
Hey, Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

459
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,228
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

460
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,713
Do it.

461
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:45,233
You're the boss.

462
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:49,571
[Door closes]

463
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:54,392
[Sighs]

464
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:06,871
[Sighs]

465
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,129
All right.
Shall we get started?

466
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,131
Now, I know that most of this,

467
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:18,550
or all of this,
is gonna be new to you.

468
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:22,137
But, uh, did you take
chemistry in high school?

469
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:23,471
Just basic?

470
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:25,807
No.

471
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:27,809
Okay.
That's all right.

472
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,612
As we go, I'll be as
detailed as possible

473
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:32,781
without being overwhelming.

474
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:35,483
Yes, sir.

475
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:40,038
Look, Todd,
I-I don't need you

476
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:42,657
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

477
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,909
Uh, what I do need

478

00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:11,064
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

637
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,082
No, Jesse.

638
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:13,416
Jesus, I'll do it.

639
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,036
Besides, you're out, remember?

640
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,071
Mike, tell me where
to get this bag.

644
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,047
Hello, Walter.

645
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:37,951
Before I hand this over,

646
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:39,486
I need something from you.

647
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,887
And what's that?

648
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:43,123
The names of your nine men.

649
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:45,925
[Scoffs] Why?

650
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,461
You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

651
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:51,714
The point is, Mike,
it affects me.

652
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:55,301
It affects Jesse, too,
and we deserve to know.

653
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:58,304
The only thing left
to do now is leave town.

654
00:41:58,339 --> 00:41:59,806
You understand?

655
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,008
"Leave town." Wow.

656
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:05,845
Yeah, I just can't up and
leave, like you, Mike.

657
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,348
I've got a family.
I've got people who depend on me.

658
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:11,317
Yeah.

659
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,801
Good-bye, Walter.

660
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:33,573
You're welcome!

661
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:37,343
[Scoffs]

662
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:39,345
I'm sorry, what?

663
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,898
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

664
00:42:41,932 --> 00:42:43,900
I don't owe you a damn thing.

665
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:47,720
All of this, falling apart
like this, is on you.

666
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:49,222
Wow.

667
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,157
[Laughs] Wow!

668
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:54,244
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

669
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:57,447
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA,

670
00:42:57,498 --> 00:42:59,782
and now, suddenly,
this is all my fault?

671
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,451
Why don't you walk me
through this, Mike?

672
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:04,504
We had a good thing,
you stupid son of a bitch!

673
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,956
We had Fring.
We had a lab.

674
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:09,876
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

675
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,878
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth,

676
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:15,131
cooked, and made as much
money as you ever needed.

677
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:18,751
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

678
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:21,420
You and your pride
and your ego!

679
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:23,723
You just had to be the man.

680
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:26,392
If you'd done your job,
known your place,

681
00:43:26,426 --> 00:43:28,611
we'd all be fine right now!

I just...

687
00:45:44,998 --> 00:45:47,333
I just realized
that Lydia has the names.

688
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:49,619
I can get them from her.

689
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,342
I'm sorry, Mike.

690
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:01,214
This-- this whole thing
could've been avoided--

691
00:46:01,248 --> 00:46:03,766
Shut the fuck up.

692
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:09,138
Let me die in peace.
