00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:08,463
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

163
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:15,554
Give me time.

164
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,974
What's going on?

165
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:23,145
Nothing that's my problem anymore.

166
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:26,148
Where you going?

167
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:28,609
I just want to make sure.

168
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:34,907
Fuck <i>it.</i> I don'<i>t want to</i> know.

169
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,336
- Peña.
- (In Spanish) Mr Peña has arrived.

170
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:50,964
Let's go. Search.

171
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:24,039
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

172
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:25,707
What are the Castaños thinking?

173
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:28,961
That they can chase me out?

174
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,879
I'm not leaving.

175
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,881
They don'<i>t want</i> you to leave,
they want to kill you.

176
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,926
And what about you?

177
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:39,179
You're in this with me, too.

178
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,103
Look...

179
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:50,524
You brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

180
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:52,734
This is all your doing.

181
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,696
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

182
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:58,198
Don't call me again.

183
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:03,328
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

184
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:06,581
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

185
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:08,166
that's killed innocent people.

186
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,377
I'm sure some newspaper in America

187
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:13,588
might be interested
in hearing more about that.

188
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:17,134
Are you threatening me?

189
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,345
Yes, I'm threatening you.

190
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,021
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

191
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:32,399
What do you want?

192
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,443
You're a cop.

193
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:38,447
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

194
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:41,408
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes.

195
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,202
Arrest them.

196
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:47,581
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

197
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:50,959
- It doesn'<i>t</i> work that way.
- Oh, no?

198
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:52,794
Then how?

199
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:04,848
We'll do it my way.

200
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:09,561
(Berna) So you want Judy
to be a rat?

201
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:11,313
I don'<i>t</i> agree with this, Javier.

202
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:14,816
We are narcos, but we have our honour.

203
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:17,527
Berna...

204
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:21,073
you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

205
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,201
Fuck your honour.

206
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:25,535
(Soft chuckle)

207
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,121
Says you.

208
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:31,833
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

209
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,045
And what have you done?

210
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,841
If you have a better idea, go for <i>it.</i>

211
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:43,345
Otherwise, this is the deal.

212
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,847
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

213
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:49,267
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

214
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:52,771
If you don'<i>t</i> like it,

215
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:55,524
you can take on the Castaños alone.

216
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,194
(In English)
And you can go fuck yourself.

217
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,114
(Steve) 'Best way
to make a bad story go away

218
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,074

231
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:43,363
(In Spanish) We haven't heard anything
from him for weeks.

232
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,408
We don'<i>t</i> even know where he is.

233
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:49,202
(Hermilda) I don'<i>t</i> know why
you're letting De Greiff come here.

234
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,079
He's coming to scare you.

(Gentle scoff)
You don'<i>t</i> understand, do you?

237
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:02,883
We don't have any more money,
Hermilda.

238
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:05,927
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

239
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,473
Pablo has many properties.
Don'<i>t</i> be so dramatic, Tata.

240
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:12,017
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

241
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:14,269
They're going to give us their money?

242
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:21,276
No one is going to help us.

243
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,696
Everyone knows what that would mean.

244
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,169
Whatever he's doing...

245
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:44,799
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

Don'<i>t</i> forget <i>that.</i>

247

(Softly) Pablo? Pablo?

248
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:19,417
Can you hear me, Pablo?
Please answer.

249
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:24,589

- (Cow mooing)

- (Pablo) Tata, can you hear me?

(Miguel) That's a lot of product for men
who don'<i>t</i> know how to run this business.

260
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:08,568
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn'<i>t</i> done.

261
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:10,779
Our donation to them is an advance.

262
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,491
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

263
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:18,787
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

264
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,413
What a fucking joke,

265
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:23,667
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

266
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:28,588
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

267
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:32,676
What? Any news about Judy?

268
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:37,597
The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

269
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:41,101
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

270
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:42,686
What about her assistant?

271
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,480
The fat one, what do they call him?
Berna?

272
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:48,525
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

273
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,945
Don Berna. Him we found.

274
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,447
Where?

275
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:55,907
Here.

276
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,368
Out front.

Welcome to Cali.

279
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,262
Gilberto, thank you, brother.

280
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:20,223
Forgive us, but we weren'<i>t</i> expecting you.

281
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:25,145
Don'<i>t</i> worry about <i>it.</i>
I'm here to speak to you all.

282
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:27,856
Very well, brother.

283
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,066
It's about Judy.

284
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:37,782
(In English) Where's Peña?

285
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:40,827
What do you need?

286
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:47,667
I got a tip. A guy.

287
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,544
He says he may have a lead, man.

288
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:54,007
Yeah, well, why don'<i>t</i> you, uh,
give it to Martinez?

289
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,677
Or you could give it
to your Los Pepes pals.

290
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:00,930
He wants to give it to an American.

291
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,560
Yeah, what's he got?
Who is this guy?

292
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:07,353
He's a guy I know.

293
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,899
Come on, Murphy. He's safe.
He knows I work with you.

294
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,400
What, he doesn'<i>t</i> trust you?

295
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:21,159
- All right. Bring him in.
- He's in Bogotá.

296
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:24,496
So I gotta go to Bogotá
to meet your friend? Forget <i>it.</i>

297
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,584
Come on, Murphy.
You want Escobar, don'<i>t</i> you?

298
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:33,588
Please, talk to him.

299
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,299
It's really important.

300
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,220
- All right. Set it up.
- OK.

301
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:43,097
(In Spanish)
Thanks. You won'<i>t</i> regret <i>it.</i>

302
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:45,391
In English, please!

There's no signal here.

311

I don'<i>t</i> know why you keep trying.

312
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:37,110
Why don'<i>t</i> you come and drink with us?

313
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,320
I'll be right there.

There's coffee in the Thermos.

317
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:08,242
(Man in Spanish)
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

318
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,745
Those are the codes and frequencies.

319
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:13,790

Pablo is using a radio.

00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,209
That's the way he communicates
with his wife.

321
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,836
And these are the codes, Murphy.

322
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:23,424
Yeah? Where did it come from
and how did you get it?

323
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,302
Lugo is a <i>fiscal at</i> the Tequendama.

324
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:28,888
He guards the family.

325
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,351
What do you want for this?
Money? Visa?

326
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:36,187
(In Spanish) What do you want, Lugo?
Money? Visa?

327
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:37,563
It don'<i>t</i> work that way, bud.

328
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,900
(In Spanish) No visa, no money,
you understand?

329
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:44,988
(In Spanish) Is that what he thinks?

330
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:47,490
That everyone wants to go
to the United States?

331
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,576
I don'<i>t want</i> anything.

332
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:55,289
All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

333
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:58,251
Find him and kill him.

334
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,515
(In English)
So? What do you think?

335
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:20,940
Javi, he's given us everything.
We got codes, frequencies.

336
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:24,444
- 'I think it's real.'
- Take it to Martinez.

337
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,070
I'm at the embassy.
I gotta call you back.

338
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,489
'What you doing at the embassy?
What's going on?'

339
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:31,743
Nothing I can'<i>t</i> handle.
I'll fill you in when I can.

340
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:34,996
- 'Javi, let's get on this.'
- Murphy, take it to Martinez.

341
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:37,081
'L'll call you later.'

342
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,084
Peña's in Bogotá?

343
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:44,130
Yeah, Javi's into something. Shit.

344
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:47,091
I'll take the codes back.
You stay with Peña, OK?

345
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:49,844
No fucking way. The codes are staying
with me. I'll take it to Martinez.

346
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:58,019
We give Judy immunity,
take her testimony and we are covered.

347
00:25:58,144 --> 00:25:59,645
Don'<i>t</i> lie to me again, Peña.

348
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,774
This is a tier-one narco

349
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:06,778
who's ready to flip
on other tier-one narcos.

350
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:12,116
She's been in the business for 30 years.
She knows Cali's operation.

351
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:14,869
It's not intel anyone can provide.

352
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:16,370
She has leverage over you.

353
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:21,417
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

354
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,795
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

355
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,965
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

356
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:36,474
She doesn'<i>t</i> get immunity
until after she talks.

357
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,976
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

358
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,604
Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

359
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:44,732
They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

360
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,068
And Peña...

361
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:48,986
Be discreet. Tell no one.

362
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:51,906
There are people in this building
who won'<i>t</i> like <i>it.</i>

363
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,041
(Lift dings, doors opening)

364
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,210
(Bill) Going down?

365
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,592
(Clears throat)

366
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:16,889
So... how's it going?

367
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,937
(Buzzing)

368
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:37,201
(Cows mooing)

369
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,917
(Father) What are you doing, Pablo?

370
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:48,629
(Chuckles)
You don'<i>t</i> know how to tie a knot.

371
00:27:57,555 --> 00:28:01,100
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

372
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,576
(Indistinct chatter in Spanish)

373
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,912
(Laughter)

374
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,959
(Father chuckles)

375
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:39,555
(Man) 'Wanted: Pablo Escobar.
Reward 2,700,0OO pesos.

376
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,143
'Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-60O.

377
00:28:44,268 --> 00:28:47,438
'In Bogotá, 222-50-12.

378
00:28:47,563 --> 00:28:50,149
'In Medellín, 461 -11 -11 .'

379
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:37,029
(Birds calling)

380
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,420
The kids would love to be here.

381
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,135
I've been thinking...

382
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:05,891
I could buy some land here next to you.

383
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,940
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

384
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:18,362
And have my own farm.

385
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,502
We could run it together.

386
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,887
What do you think?

387
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:01,489
We need to finish putting up the wire.

388
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:19,256
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

389
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:25,262
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

390
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:31,143
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

391
00:31:33,396 --> 00:31:38,859
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

392
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:41,654
You are a survivor.

393
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:44,240
A man of action.

394
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:49,578
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

395
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,083
- (Martinez in Spanish) Good evening.
- (Men) Colonel.

396
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,626
Sit.

397
00:31:57,253 --> 00:32:00,965
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

398
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,676
Yes, Colonel.
I verified the frequencies.

399
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,970
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

400
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:08,305
He'll use them when he calls her.

401
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:11,183
Did you confirm it's Escobar?
Did you hear him?

402
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:14,103
No, Colonel, not yet.

403
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:18,065
(In English) All right, say he picks up
the phone. How close can we get?

404
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,610
If Pablo talks in Medellín,
we'll know every word he says.

405
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:25,322
- Can you get his exact location?
- If it's within range, yes.

406
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:30,661
All right, if Pablo uses the phone
outside of Medellín with the same codes,

407
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,455
can you hear him?

408
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:37,626
No. The antenna is not that strong.

409
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:05,196
Why didn'<i>t</i> you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

410
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:08,407
I wasn'<i>t</i> paying that much attention.

411
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,702
But you're paying attention
to me now, right?

412
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,210
So, what do you think?

413
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:23,047
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

414
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:28,844
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

415
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:38,103
Now hold on to the pig.

416
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:42,274
Fuck!

417
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:47,279
(Father)
Funny that you don'<i>t</i> like blood.

418
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,449
How strange.

419
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,285
What are you trying to say?

420
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,376
Clean yourself.

421
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,175
(Soft chuckle)

422
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:11,887
You know what's funny?

423
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,353
That my dad...

424
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:26,485
has no fucking idea who I am.

425
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:32,032
- I know very well who you are.
- Mmh.

426
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:38,289
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

427
00:34:38,414 --> 00:34:39,582
Is that right?

428
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:42,876
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

429
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:46,171
- The United States? Disgusting.
- Mmh.

430
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:51,260
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

431
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:55,764
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

432
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:59,977
- So what? So what? So what?
- So what?

433
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:03,939
And what about you?
What about you?

434
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,571
An ignorant old man...

435
00:35:10,696 --> 00:35:12,197
who lives alone.

436
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:15,576
On this shithole farm.

437
00:35:16,952 --> 00:35:19,913
Who doesn'<i>t</i> know his own grandchildren.

438
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:24,251
Not even one fucking picture
of them here.

439
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:28,589
Mmh.

440
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:31,675
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

441
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,387
That's right.

442
00:35:38,932 --> 00:35:41,977
Now tell me... (Shaky chuckle)

443
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,064
Tell me...

444
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:49,276
what you think of me.

445
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:56,283
- Who cares?
- I do.

446
00:35:56,408 --> 00:35:57,951
(Drops knife)

447
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:00,162
It's important to me.

448
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:07,169
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

449
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:11,423
But that's not possible, Pablo.

450
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,427
You chose your life!

451
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,846
Be in charge of it.

452
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:22,267
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

453
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:26,438
I'm ashamed.

454
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:32,903
I think you're a murderer.

455
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,285
At last, the truth.

456
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:46,750
At last, the truth.

457
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:50,462
(Voice quavers) A truth...

458
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:56,093
that breaks my heart.

459
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:03,016
Leave me alone.

460
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,040
http://hiqve.com/

461
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,262
Limón.

462
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:44,349
Yes, sir?

463
00:37:48,979 --> 00:37:51,023
You like it here, right?

464
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:52,649
(Soft chuckle)

465
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:54,693
Yes, boss.
It's a peaceful place.

466
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:58,572
(Whispers) Peaceful.

467
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,117
(Sighs)

468
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:03,786
Kneel down.

469
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:21,637
A few kilometres from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

470
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:26,600
Under that tree
is a buried case of money.

471
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:29,978
Go and get it.

472
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:31,313
Are we leaving, boss?

473
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,024
Yes.

474
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,777
Go on.

475
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:45,953
(Sighs)

476
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:57,089
(De Greiff)
That's correct, Mrs Escobar.

477
00:38:57,214 --> 00:39:01,510
How long did you think
this arrangement was going to last?

478
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:04,888
(Tata) Do you not realise that if
we leave here, they're going to kill us?

479
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:11,687
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

480
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:15,274
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

481
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:19,736
That is not our problem.
Mrs Escobar, I'm sorry.

482
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:21,363
You're sorry?

483
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,199
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

484
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:28,662
I don'<i>t</i> have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But...

485
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:30,747
But you can'<i>t</i> help us find asylum.

486
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:38,505
- (Slams table)
- That's bullshit!

487
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:41,049
They're going to...

488
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:43,552
(Whispers) ...kill us all.

489
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:46,430
Mama, what's wrong?

490
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,311
(Whispers) Nothing, my love.

491
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:06,116
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

492
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:10,913
but I don'<i>t</i> know what else to do.

493
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,007
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

494
00:40:22,132 --> 00:40:24,176
Tell him to surrender.

495
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,681
The power of the law is your last hope.

496
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:33,060
Think about your children.

497
00:40:52,412 --> 00:40:53,747
(Hits object)

498
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:13,600
(Sniffs)

499
00:41:19,523 --> 00:41:21,274
Shit.

500
00:42:37,726 --> 00:42:40,562
- No. (Whines)
- Yes, before you go to sleep.

501
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:43,899
- Do you like it? Yes?
- No. No. (Babbles)

502
00:42:55,243 --> 00:42:57,287
(Rustling)

503
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,249
(Soft noises in next room)

504
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:18,683
Fuck.

505
00:43:19,768 --> 00:43:22,771
Jhon. What are you doing here?

506
00:43:28,276 --> 00:43:33,865
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

507
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,493
We spent <i>it. It</i>'s gone.

508
00:43:36,618 --> 00:43:39,412
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

509
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,502
You've already hurt me.

510
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,380
You've fucked up my life.

511
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:59,558
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

512
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:02,561
Hang on, Maritza.

513
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:22,038
And this?

514
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:29,588
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

515
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:34,009
Please, don'<i>t</i> take <i>it.</i> Please.
It's for the baby, please!

516
00:44:34,134 --> 00:44:37,762
You lying... bitch! Get off!

517
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:40,557
Motherfucker! Bastard!

518
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:44,477
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

519
00:44:44,603 --> 00:44:47,939
- Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.
- (Baby whimpering)

520
00:44:50,192 --> 00:44:51,818
What did you say?

521
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,156
Are you going to say something? Hmm?
Are you going to rat on me?

522
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:59,743
I might! Why shouldn'<i>t</i> I?

523
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:06,374
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero? (Spits)

524
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,877
Jhon!

525
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,297
I know you! Get that shit out...

526
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:14,299
- (Gunshot)
- (Gasps)

527
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:53,255
(Turns off engine)

528
00:46:08,645 --> 00:46:11,147
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

529
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:14,234
But I have bad news.

530
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:16,361
- What happened?
- Look.

531
00:46:24,911 --> 00:46:26,746
It's rotten, sir.

532
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:41,636
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

533
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:53,690
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

534
00:46:53,815 --> 00:46:56,359
There's about six thousand dollars
I counted, boss.

535
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:09,956
Get your things. We're leaving.

536
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,586
(Judy) Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

537
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:18,882
(Javier) 'Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.'

538
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:20,008
Where?

539
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,260
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

540
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:24,220
We've used it before.

541
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:26,931
'Berna knows where.'

542
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,142
(Judy) 'I'll see you there.'

543
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:49,954
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

544
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:52,916
Let's go, Flaco.

545
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:02,342
(In English)
She's on her way.

546
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:10,600
(In Spanish)
I know what you're thinking.

547
00:48:13,478 --> 00:48:16,606
I'm making a mistake.
(Chuckles)

548
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:21,820
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

549
00:48:21,945 --> 00:48:25,365
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

550
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,658
Up here, Flaco.

551
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:43,425
I can'<i>t</i> protect a rat.

552
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:50,765
(Static, stops)

553
00:49:00,942 --> 00:49:04,070
I didn'<i>t</i> think you'd betray me.

554
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,657
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

555
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:11,286
So now, you're going
to get on that plane.

556
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:14,289
And if I don't, what?
What happens?

557
00:49:14,414 --> 00:49:17,333
If you don'<i>t</i> get on,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

558
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:19,502
And I won'<i>t</i> protect you anymore.

559
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,410
Tell me something.

560
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:55,622
Did Cali arrange this?

561
00:49:58,124 --> 00:50:00,543
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

562
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:04,672
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

563
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:07,592
They don'<i>t</i> understand our business,

564
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:11,763
- but they'll be useful in mine.
- So you fucked over your partner.

565
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:14,098
I was never your partner.

566
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:17,268
I only protected your life.

567
00:50:18,353 --> 00:50:22,857
Relax. You'll have money.

568
00:50:22,982 --> 00:50:26,194
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

569
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:30,031
- Where am I going?
- Doesn'<i>t</i> matter.

570
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:35,578
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

571
00:50:42,043 --> 00:50:43,795
Don'<i>t</i> worry about a thing.

572
00:50:44,504 --> 00:50:50,176
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

573
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,118
(In English)
Hey, man. How's it going?

574
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:18,246
Everything good at the safe house?

575
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:22,208
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

576
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:25,837
Reassigned. Headed home.

577
00:51:25,962 --> 00:51:29,799
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

578
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:32,176
Something about chain of command.

579
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:34,846
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

580
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,852
Judy has an interview
with the "Miami Herald" in, uh...

581
00:51:40,977 --> 00:51:42,812
oh, about five hours.

582
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:46,941
Now I can'<i>t</i> be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

583
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:51,237
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

584
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:56,492
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

585
00:51:56,618 --> 00:51:58,786
it won'<i>t</i> be pointed in my direction.

586
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:02,123
You should've stayed in your lane.

587
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,250
(Whispers) Wow.

588
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,420
And Cali too, right?

589
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:10,757
They get a pass?

590
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:16,763
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

591
00:52:16,888 --> 00:52:18,848
Pay me?

592
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,558
(Gentle scoff)

593
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:22,935
Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.

594
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:26,064
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

595
00:52:27,273 --> 00:52:29,859
We're gonna get them someday.

596
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:31,653
But not your way.

597
00:52:32,779 --> 00:52:36,949
For everything you know, you're, uh...
extremely naive.

598
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:39,702
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

599
00:52:40,286 --> 00:52:41,412
The laughs.

600
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,456
Um... Oh.

601
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:45,625
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

602
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:50,463
I guess word about this "Miami Herald"
thing is spreading like a prairie fire.

603
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,799
And bring your passport.

604
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,760
I think you're going home, <i>but...</i>

605
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,305
you didn'<i>t</i> hear that from me.

606
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:45,620
Tata?

607
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:47,079
(Static)

608
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,460
Tata, can you hear me?

609
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,587
(Tata) 'Pablo?'

610
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,008
It's me, my love.

611
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,553
'Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

612
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,931
'I've missed you so much.

613
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:07,058
'Where have you been, Pablo?'

614
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:13,147
I had to do something very important.

615
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:19,570
But I'm back home, my love.

616
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:24,700
I'm home.

617
00:55:24,724 --> 00:55:29,724
