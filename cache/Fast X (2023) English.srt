﻿1
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,402
There is nothing a father
wouldn't do for his son.

2
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:00,129
Your mother
never understood this.

3
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,890
She looked at you
and saw a monster.

4
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,065
I saw potential.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,551
When a bully took your money,
you took his eye.

6
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,175
When they called you crazy,
you took their tongues.

7
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,833
But I brought you here today.

8
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,524
Was it generosity?

9
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:18,630
Love?

10
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,976
No.

11
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,599
It's so what I built
doesn't die with me.

12
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,360
So my legacy can live on,

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,535
because a father and his son
is everything.

14
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:30,055
I have a job that I can
only trust with one man.

15
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:31,574
You.

16
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:34,508
My most ruthless soldiers
were watching our cash houses,

17
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,752
and they let this Dominic
Toretto burn what is mine.

18
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:39,478
I'll kill Dominic Toretto.

19
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:41,963
I'll kill 'em all.

20
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:44,552
Kill them?
You'd show them mercy?

21
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:45,933
No, my son.

22
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:50,351
When suffering is owed,
never accept death as a payment.

23
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,736
Make Toretto suffer.

24
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,893
Now the work begins.

25
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:16,619
And in there,

26
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:20,450
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

27
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,626
Let's get started.

28
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,429
Shit!

29
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,357
Hey, there's too many of them!

30
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,186
- We're not gonna make it.
- You're right. We aren't.

31
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:52,326
- You are.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

32
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,121
Now, you stick with the plan.

33
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,812
It was always the plan.

34
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,486
Get him.

35
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,218

I didn't have it.

49
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,921
B, no one starts
at the finish line.

50
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,095
You got to have faith.

51
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:22,787
Remember today's lesson.

52
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:25,479
Find the line,

53
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,481
feel the car,

54
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,827
and let it fly.

55
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,933
- It's okay to be afraid.

56
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,211
Sometimes fear can be
the best teacher.

57
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:34,764
I wasn't scared.

58
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,664
- Everyone gets scared, son.
- You don't.

59
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:39,597
You're not afraid of anything.

60
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,601
We better hurry.

61
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,499
- Great-Grandma just flew in.

62
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,846
And she's making
her famous maduros.

63
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,608
We got to get to those
before Uncle Roman does.

64
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,195

to be afraid of.

- It's time to get you living.
Told you guys,

73
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,321
I don't need that.

74
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:17,255
There, profile done.

75
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,705
You're welcome.

76
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:20,154
Now, you give it
about three, four days...

77
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,501
- It never happens instantly.

78
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,261
- Wait, what?
Hmm.

79
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,573
Wow.

80
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:25,919
Let me see
your profile picture again.

81
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,196
He must have
put a filter on there.

82
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,818
What are you guys looking at?

83
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:30,337
- Oh, wait. No, no, no, no.
- They're just video games, man.

84
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:31,580
- H-H-Hold on, man.
- Just videos, man.

85
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,788
Can I sit next to you?

86
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:33,720
Boy nosy.
- You drifting yet?

87
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,962
I am.

88
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:38,069
You should've seen us.
It was so cool, Mom.

89
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,449
Hey!

90
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:40,450
!¡Oye, familia!

91
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,935
I am starving!

92
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,626
- Come on.

93
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:46,802
I also want a hug from
every single person in--

94
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:48,182
Oh.

95
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:49,770
- Ah.
- You see the line?

96
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,565
We're all waiting in line
for this love, abuelita.

97
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,602
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait till you taste this.

98
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:54,706
It's really good.

99
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,570
I put myself out for this one.

100
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,020
- Oh.

101
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,818
Okay, everybody pipe down, please.

102
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,785
Abuelita would like
to say something.

103
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,478
- Piping and downing, please.

104
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:11,723
As I look out
at this wonderful family,

105
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:17,073
I am filled with so much pride.

106
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:20,525
The kind of pride that my son--
your father--

107
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,423
would have enjoyed
if he were here.

108
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:26,324
I know that this road
has been very hard

109
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:29,085
and also not fair.

110
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,606
And yet here you are,

111
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,229
despite all of the odds,

112
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:37,542
building this magnificent

113
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,579
- leg...

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,141
It is a legacy that will go on
for generations.

115
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:51,591
No one can take it away.

116
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,523
Not now.

117
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:54,973
Not ever.

118
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:58,045
- Yeah!

119
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,115
To familia.

120
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:02,084
Familia.

121
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:04,224
Siempre. Always.

122
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,053
♪ Costa Rica...

123
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,816
Hey, these new Nikes, man.
Stop playing! Goddamn...

124
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,266
Come on, Roman.
The agency put you in charge,

125
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,440
and you said I get to drive.

126
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,269
See, what I really need

127
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,374
is I need your brain.

128
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,377
Words Roman Pearce
has never said.

129
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,483
So talk me through it again.
I need details.

130
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,141
Yeah, the agency got a tip on
some stolen military hardware.

131
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,281
Tomorrow, a next-gen
quantum computer chip

132
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:29,525
will be transported
through the streets of Rome,

133
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:30,699
and they need us to steal it.

134
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:32,632
I checked Roman's intel.

135
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,667
It's legit.

136
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,737
Of course it's legit.

137
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,083
We're talking 'bout Rome.

138
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,327
Rome. Roman.

139
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:39,742
Come on, man.

140
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:41,330
That's like planning a heist
in my backyard.

141
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,781
Only thing you know about Rome
is "ro-man" noodles.

142
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:45,714
One thing
you didn't explain to us is:

143
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,198
Why the hell
do we need a RC car,

144
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:50,719
a gold Lamborghini
and 12 tanks of laughing gas?

145
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,099
Yes, I'm in,
'cause you are definitely

146
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,583
going to need
all the brains you can get.

147
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,999
You up to something.

148
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,621
Hey, Rome... -
Don't talk to me, man.

149
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:57,967
Don't talk to me.

150
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,555
- All right.
- You know what?

151
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:02,869
The disrespect
is gon' have to stop.

152
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:04,560
Now!

153
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,357
That's just my--
You know what I'm saying?

154
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:11,705
Me just, you know,
practicing my leadership voice.

155
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,570
I see what's going on.

156
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,468
Tej, you think you slick, bro.

157
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,607
Look at you.

158
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:18,954
Spying on me.

159
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,749
What's up with
this old boat anchor?

160
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:21,922
No fuel injection.

161
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,372
I mean, I'd expect
something bigger

162
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,649
and better from you, Dom.

163
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,030
Little B and I
are building it together.

164
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,860
The carburetor
forces him to listen.

165
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,379
That's the problem nowadays.

166
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,105
- Nobody listens anymore.
- Well, you better watch out.

167
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:34,901
Little man's gonna be
a better wrench than any of us

168
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:36,212
by the time he's 12.

169
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,007
I mean, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

170
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,528
Pass it down.

171
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:43,806
Each generation
better than the last.

172
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:46,395
That's true.

173
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:47,810
That's fatherhood.

174
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:51,952
Come a long way from
the two of us popping gas trucks

175
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:54,058
- in the D.R., huh?
- We sure did.

176
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,750
Those were some tough times.

177
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,994
Those were some great times.

178
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,588
Oh, you...
Y-Y'all was in a meeting?

179
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,245

to interrupt y'all.

Han, let's go, man.

182
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:15,596
Roman asked if he could
lead this mission.

183
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,322
How could I tell him no?

184
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:20,325
But you know I can't let them
go to Rome without you.

lose your way.

But I am.

212
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,975
I'm afraid of losing a son.

213
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,532
Or a wife.

What?

218
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,080
Eternity

in this moment.

220
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,666
I'm as surprised as you are.

221
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:24,535
I've imagined killing you
a thousand times.

222
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:28,815
Last time, there was six inches
of reinforced glass,

223
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:30,851
- guns...
- No!

224
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:31,956
...guards.

225
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,854
I couldn't reach you then.

226
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:35,580
Now I can.

227
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,858
You're gonna want to hear
my last words.

228
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,688
- Dom! -
- No!

229
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:50,078
Did you hear Elena's last words

230
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,872
before you killed her?

231
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:55,566
Then don't you think I'd have a
goddamn good reason to be here?

232
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:58,086
Maybe the only reason
that's ever mattered to you.

233
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,193
LETTY [whispers]:
Little B.

234
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,851
Wake up, sweetie.

235
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,784
We have an unwanted guest.

236
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:08,234
You know what to do.

237
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:21,833
What is it that you want?

238
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,180
Speak.

239
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,706
I met the devil tonight.

240
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:37,194
Honestly, I always thought
it was me.

241
00:17:37,194 --> 00:17:39,541
So that was
kind of disappointing.

242
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,443
He came to my door.

243
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:52,450
He let himself in.

244
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,420
They say
when you're facing death,

245
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,113
your life flashes
before your eyes.

246
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,081
Are they right?

247
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:09,088
I'd start with who you are.

248
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,297
A question most can't answer
in a lifetime.

249
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:12,746
You have three seconds.

250
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:17,303
Before you bleed out
on my couch,

251
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,719
you might want to explain
why you're here.

252
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,584
I'm here

253
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,896
because the enemy

254
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,727
of my enemy

255
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:28,797
is you.

256
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:30,833
I am a man with

257
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,904
no name.

258
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,699
Heir to nothing.

259
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,668
And I'm here for
the same reasons you are.

260
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:39,601
Dominic Toretto.

261
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,981
You want to kill Dom?

262
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,880
Line's around the block.

263
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,675
No, no, no.

264
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:49,162
Never accept death
when suffering is owed.

265
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,820
But I need your help.

266
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,547
Your toys and your tech.

267
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,135
All your boys.

268
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,447
'Cause you're either with me
or you're...

269
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:01,243
I don't play well with others.

270
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,176
Then you'll have to watch
who you love most die.

271
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,729
You're looking at
who I love most.

272
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,939
You thought you could use
my own move against me?

273
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,183
I wasn't talking to you.

274
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,840
I was talking to Zeke.

275
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,843
Amir.

276
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,640
Kevin's dad.

277
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:24,404
Who could it be?

278
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:35,519
Cute kids.

279
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:41,766
Ooh.

280
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,669

281
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:50,050

282
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,121
Not even a kitty cat.

283
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:55,677
The rest of you have a choice.

284
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:59,439
Me or...

285
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,309
You want to control the world.

286
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,934
I just want to punish it.

287
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:19,908
I will remember this.

288
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:22,048
I think everyone will.

289
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,087
Huh. I need someone to help me
operate this, don't I?

290
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:28,882
Nerds?

291
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:30,194

292
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,540

296
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,039
Shit.

297
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:52,941
Did you think I would trust you?

298
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,329
It is hard finding good help
these days.

299
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,891
There's a war coming.

300
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:00,724
The sides are being chosen.

301
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:06,039
And everyone you love
will be destroyed.

302
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,993
Lost six pints of blood.

303
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:30,547

304
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,134
We're shipping her back
to our black site.

305
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:34,758
- She may not make it.
- But did her story check out?

306
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,415
We confirmed
the shooting downtown,

307
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,968
but her tech wasn't there.

308
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:40,557
And whoever took it
now has an electronic arsenal.

309
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:43,629

- Yeah, Mia and Brian are safe.

00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:43,749
That's all it took?

358
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,233
♪ Bando sopra il Booster

359
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,062
♪ ANNA fattura e no,
non parlo di buste ♪

360
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,236
♪ Mando tutto io...

361
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:49,893
All those agency toys,

362
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:51,688
and you still can't
reach Roman?

363
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:54,242
No cell phone,
emails or text messages.

364
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,795
Nothing's going through.

365
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:58,315
I even tried swiping right
on Han's dating app.

366
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:01,732
Whoever sent him
on this bogus mission

367
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:04,321
made for damn sure
we couldn't warn them.

368
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,290
Keep searching. They're close.

369
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,913
All right, everybody, showtime.

370
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:11,984
- Here we go!

371
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:20,613
In position.

372
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,097
Cue Tiny Tej.

373
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:24,237
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Tiny Tej?

374
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:26,688
What are you talking about,
Roman? -

375
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,483
All right, all right,
fire 'em up!

376
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:29,967
We never agreed on that.

377
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,521
You said you wanted to drive.
Now you driving.

378
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:35,248
What are you laughing at?
Don't... -

379
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:37,250
Where'd you even get that?

380
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:40,219
Just so you know,
Tiny Tej's brain?

381
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:41,358
Still bigger than yours.

382
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,754
Back is blind.

383
00:26:57,754 --> 00:26:59,618
Watch out, ladies.
This ain't "nun" ya business!

384
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,689
It's time to shine!

385
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,440
We're in. I have the wheel.

386
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,064
We're locked inside!

387
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:34,514
The truck's being
steered remotely.

388
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:48,045
And a one, and a two, and a...

389
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,748
Holy shit! What happened?!

390
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:03,336
Put a little too much in, huh?
Ready?

391
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:14,209
That was awesome!

392
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,348
Ooh.

393
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:16,867
Scusi!

394
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:20,664
They're stealing our truck.

395
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,735
And with us inside.

396
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,016
Just got reports of
two explosions near the Forum.

397
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,673
That's them.

398
00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:36,991
Ready? And...

399
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:38,509
- Wait, you hear that?

400
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,891
- What the hell is that?!
- I have no idea!

401
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:44,964
Oh, shit.

402
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:46,345
That's a big-ass bomb!

403
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,105
- What?
- Bomb!

404
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:50,211
Roman, you said
this was carrying chips

405
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,453
for a supercomputer.

406
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:52,834
That is not a chip.
It's a bomb!

407
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:55,319
What happens if it goes off?

408
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,563
What do you mean,
"What happens if it goes off?"

409
00:28:57,563 --> 00:28:59,392
The Seven Hills of Rome
will be down to two and a half!

410
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:02,637
City-wide devastation,
countless lives lost.

411
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,363
You know, the thing bombs do.

412
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:06,227
We're coming to you.

413
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:12,992
All right, dorks.
What are we blowing up?

414
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:14,131
What?

415
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,512
The Vatican?

416
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:17,238
Wow.

417
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:18,653
Okay. I'll do it.

418
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:20,551
But you guys are going to hell.

419
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,762
That's their truck.

420
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,387
Oh, thank God. Dom, Letty.

421
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:30,630
Ooh. Look who's here.

422
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,770
You're right on time, Dominic.

423
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,564
Turn off the encrypted radio.

424
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:36,809
Ramsey?

425
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,294
We're being remote-controlled.
There's a bomb on board.

426
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:42,194
It's a DM-79 subnautical
high-yield neutron mine.

427
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:45,818
Ah! Found it.

428
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,027
I can disarm it
with an agency kill switch.

429
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:50,064
I just need physical hands
on the device.

430
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:51,962
- We have to stop that truck.
- Sorry, Captain America.

431
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:53,584
Can't let you do that.

432
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,866
We got to hurry!
The truck is speeding up.

433
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,628
- We got to block its path.
- I'm gonna get ahead of it.

434
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:05,079
Ramsey, Tej, strap in.

435
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:09,393
Whoop.

436
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,439
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

437
00:30:23,787 --> 00:30:26,272
Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched!

438
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,034
Dominic.

439
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:32,244
Come on!

440
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,350
Damn it, he's fast.

441
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,428
Really? The clothesline?

442
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:45,878
Well, we can't drive it,

443
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,535
guess we're just
gonna have to roll it.

444
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:09,798
Holy shit! The truck's
about to go over the hill!

445
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:12,353
- We have to crash into it.
- We have to what?!

446
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:29,163
I'm so sorry, my gold baby!

447
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,235
It's not stopping!

448
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,032
Dom, the bomb is out.

449
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:41,244
Everybody, stay clear.
I got this.

450
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:43,108
No. We got this.

451
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:57,985
Letty!

452
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:11,239
Have we made them all
terrorists?

453
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,827
Their images have been
fed to the authorities.

454
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:15,174
All right, Bob!
I got to go kill that jerk

455
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:16,900
that's trying to disarm my bomb.

456
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,557
It's always something, you know?
Oh.

457
00:32:18,557 --> 00:32:21,594
Remember, I still have your
families, so don't go anywhere.

458
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,320
Buongiorno, Roma!

459
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,804
All right.

460
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:09,780
Man, who the hell is that?

461
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,230
Hey! There he is!

462
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,577
Man of the hour.
Roman Pearce, team leader.

463
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:16,235
Can't wait to see you
get out of this one.

464
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:24,588
DANTE [singsongy]:
Oh, Letty!

465
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:26,970
I think I found our guy.

466
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,937
Hey, Letty. Vaffanculo!

467
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,561
I'm on him.

468
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:47,542
That pump's gonna blow.

469
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,769
Little Nobody, you're up.

470
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:50,536
- Moving to dis...
- Peekaboo!

471
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,754
Get out of there!
It's gonna blow! -Oh, shit.

472
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:06,587
- Boom.

473
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:09,305
We need to jam
the detonator now.

474
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,548
I got it, I got it.
Letty, don't lose him.

475
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,587
I can lock on to your location
and transmit

476
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:17,347
cellular interference
through your phone.

477
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:19,901
That should jam his detonator
and buy us some time.

478
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,975
Letty.

479
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:08,950
Bravo!

480
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,297
It's getting tricky, guys.

481
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,160
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

482
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,059
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

483
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,164
The Tiber? Uh...

484
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:17,614
Uh, 60 feet.

485
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,202
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

486
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:21,411
reduce its power
by ten times, maybe.

487
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:39,567
Damn it!

488
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:43,606
You missed me
by that much, baby!

489
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:49,439
I lost him. He's gone.

490
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,958
Damn!

491
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,097
He's out of our reach.

492
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:53,581
We can't jam the signal anymore.

493
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:56,515
Bad news, Dom.
I'm back in business.

494
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,700
You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

495
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:14,637
Dom, he armed the bomb,
and you're almost at the river.

496
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:50,155
15 seconds, Dom.

497
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:52,364
Dom, listen to me.

498
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,883
The Vatican's within
the blast radius.

499
00:38:53,883 --> 00:38:55,298
Get out of there.

500
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:56,955
You've done
everything you could.

501
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:58,681
Not everything.

502
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:07,517
Five.

503
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:10,934
Four.

504
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,697
Three.

505
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:18,839
Two.

506
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,944
One.

507
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:03,539
What have we done?

508
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:10,856
Through your suffering,
I'll fulfill my destiny.

509
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:14,653
Come find me.

510
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:17,622
Your pain has just begun.

511
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,313
I'll see you soon, Dom.

512
00:40:19,313 --> 00:40:20,901
Breaking news from Italy.

513
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:24,076
The capital Rome has been hit
by a massive explosion.

514
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:30,911
...to be
a large military weapon.

515
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:33,603
The Vatican has sustained

516
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:34,708
some structural damage.

517
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,468
...but no lives were claimed.

518
00:40:37,814 --> 00:40:39,471
Authorities have identified
the terrorists as

519
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,577
- these five individuals.

520
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:44,234
...as these five individuals,
led by this man.

521
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,960
- Dominic Toretto.
- Toretto. -Toretto.

522
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,825
- Dominic Toretto.
Dominic Toretto.

523
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:51,449
Law enforcement is
working across borders,

524
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,623
mobilizing
an international fugitive hunt

525
00:40:53,623 --> 00:40:55,004
- of unprecedented scale.
I'm sorry, sir.

526
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,109
- I don't know how she got in.
- I do.

527
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:58,525
I stole your badge.

528
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,251
I'm done with it now, though. Thanks.

529
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,874
Well, if it isn't, um--

530
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,496
Honestly, I-I don't know
what to call you.

531
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,325
Little Miss Nobody?

532
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:07,879
How about you call me
by my actual name?

533
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:11,192
Last I heard, Tess, you were
running ops in Damascus.

534
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:12,504
You think you can
walk in this room

535
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:13,988
just 'cause your daddy's
an agency legend?

536
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,680
I'm here because
someone needs to speak

537
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,302
on behalf of the defense.

538
00:41:17,302 --> 00:41:19,718
What just happened in Rome
was an unmitigated disaster.

539
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:21,409
Casualties were kept
to a minimum,

540
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:22,756
but the impact was global.

541
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:25,344
And what do you think
happened in Italy?

542
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:28,693
Oh, sightseeing,
eating bucatini,

543
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:30,729
- stealing a 20-kiloton bomb.
- Oh, come on, Aimes.

544
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:33,318
That's bullshit
and you know it. -Careful, now.

545
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:34,975
With Little Nobody
out of commission

546
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:38,496
and your daddy in the wind,
you're talking to the new boss.

547
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,532
Showtime.

548
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,569
Los Angeles, 2001.

549
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:45,054
Humble roots, local kids,

550
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,746
street racers
who became hijackers.

551
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:50,335
Graduated to
high-speed smuggling,

552
00:41:50,335 --> 00:41:51,923
mobile jailbreaks,
train robberies.

553
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:54,822
If it could be done in a car,
they did it.

554
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:58,550
If it violates the laws of God
and gravity, they did it twice.

555
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,139
You write that yourself?

556
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,072
We first took notice in 2011,

557
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:06,558
Rio, when they robbed
a drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes,

558
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,526
left his body on a bridge.

559
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,115
My predecessor, Mr. Nobody,
saw potential,

560
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,497
so he recruited them--
freelance, of course.

561
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,637
They ran missions for us
in Abu Dhabi,

562
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:19,433
Tokyo, London,
New York, Tbilisi.

563
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,366
You ask me, we should've
cut ties years back,

564
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,024
but they had their champions.

565
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:25,473
That's their M.O.

566
00:42:25,473 --> 00:42:27,372
To corrupt law enforcement.

567
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:28,684
Brian O'Conner.

568
00:42:28,684 --> 00:42:30,582
Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs.

569
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:32,480
Everyone becomes family.

570
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,413
It's like a cult with cars.

571
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:37,934
Even Tess's dear old dad.

572
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:40,005
So we're all just

573
00:42:40,005 --> 00:42:42,594
a barbecue and a beer away
from corruption?

574
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:43,871
What's your point?

575
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,424
Point is they're criminals.

576
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:47,185
Rome was a matter of time.

577
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:48,876
They've stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars

578
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:52,190
and at least one nuclear sub.

579
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,918
The real question is: How did
we let this go on so long?

580
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:58,472
This family has gotten their
hands dirty to keep ours clean.

581
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:02,303
They've driven to the gates of
hell and back for this agency.

582
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:04,202
Something is not right
with Rome.

583
00:43:04,202 --> 00:43:05,341
It can't be.

584
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:07,688
It can and it is.

585
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,517
The agency is better than this.

586
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:10,967
We are smarter than this.

587
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,659
We should be standing with Dom
and his family.

588
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,177
That is the very least
that we can do.

589
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:15,972
If we don't act,
this blows back on all of us.

590
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:18,872
The fallout will be existential.

591
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,945
I'm asking for
full green-light authority.

592
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:25,568
Kill or capture
the Toretto clan by any means.

593
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:27,570
Aimes, what are you doing?

594
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:36,303
Looks like the ayes have it.

595
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:38,098
As your direct superior,

596
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:40,721
I don't give a shit about
anybody's heart of gold,

597
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:43,655
and I hate barbecues.

598
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:46,209
You know I'd make a
freight train take a dirt road,

599
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:49,350
so do not get in my way.

600
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:53,872
Okay.

601
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:58,566
I'll go my own way.

602
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:04,296
♪ My world has fallen

603
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:08,300
♪ I'm falling to my knees

604
00:44:10,026 --> 00:44:11,165
♪ Oh, yeah

605
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:15,411
♪ And now I feel

606
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:16,930

607

♪ Ain't no promise
I'll breathe again. ♪

608
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,184
When Rome falls,
so does the world.

609
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:33,463
Well, it ain't no Roman holiday.

610
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,294
And you're no Gregory Peck.

611
00:44:36,294 --> 00:44:38,227
Mm.

612
00:44:38,227 --> 00:44:39,746
My family?

613
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:43,508
Your team's gone to ground.
They're safe for now.

614
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:46,028
They've taken Letty.

615
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:49,583
- Who's they?
- The agency.

616
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:51,378
And you've just shot
to number one

617
00:44:51,378 --> 00:44:53,035
on the world's most wanted list.

618
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:56,521
Whoever did this wanted
to sever your ties to the agency

619
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:58,419
and isolate you
from your family.

620
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:01,733
Any attempt to contact your team
will be traced.

621
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,253
I need you to get a message
to Mr. Nobody.

622
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:06,911
You'll need a medium for that
or a magician.

623
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,947
He's done his disappearing act.

624
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:11,570
Just get the message out.

625
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,780
Tell him I'm ready
to have that Belgian,

626
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,057
and he'll know where to go.

627
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:16,748
I've got a message for you, ducky.

628
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:20,062
The world is on fire,
and you want to keep running

629
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:22,443
into the burning building
to save lives,

630
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:25,723
but eventually the building's
gonna collapse on you.

631
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,414
I don't care about dying.

632
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:32,730
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

633
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,526
You know why gladiators
never had families?

634
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,632
- Why?
- Because they knew

635
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:41,255
that every day
might be their last.

636
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:45,466
You're choosing a lonely way,
my darling.

637
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:48,159
Can't take anyone with you.

638
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,733
Bring God's Eye online.

639
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:12,804
Yes, sir.
Initiating.

640
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:14,668
Get me Toretto
and the others' locations

641
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,118
to the millimeter.

642
00:46:16,118 --> 00:46:17,809
Sir, we have a problem.

643
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,673
The God's Eye tracking hardware
has been removed.

644
00:46:19,673 --> 00:46:21,364
Tess.

645
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:23,815
I guess her visit
wasn't purely a social call.

646
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,161
Do me a favor.

647
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:27,612
She pops up on any grid,
let's see where she goes.

648
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:31,581
As for the rest, our fugitives
aren't unknown quantities.

649
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:35,275
Toretto has a sister, a son.

650
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:37,587
Until we find him,

651
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,279
find his family.

652
00:46:58,885 --> 00:47:01,404
Oh!

653
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,199
- Again.

654
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,339
Wow.

655
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:06,996
Are you cheating
on-on your favorite auntie?

656
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:09,792
It doesn't matter if you win
by an inch or a mile.

657
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:10,931
Winning's winning.

658
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,899
Where have I heard
that one before?

659
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,593
Go! Go!

660
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:21,355
Search everywhere!
We need them alive!

661
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:29,260
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

662
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:33,436
No! Mia! Let her go!

663
00:47:38,717 --> 00:47:40,064
Run!

664
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:08,713
- What's up?
- Uncle Jakob?

665
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:09,783
Your dad sent me.

666
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:12,613
Change of plans.

667
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:32,840
Don't move!

668
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,981
- I said don't move!

669
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:17,023
Do you have Little B?

670
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:19,266
B!

671
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,201
- Freeze!

672
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:30,553
- You okay?
- Yeah.

673
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:38,665
Are you okay?

674
00:49:42,427 --> 00:49:44,533
B!

675
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,190
Come, come.

676
00:49:49,124 --> 00:49:51,126
Who the hell were those guys?

677
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:54,232
Agency. Rome was a trap.
Whole family's being targeted.

678
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:55,854
Okay, I got to get to Brian
and the kids...

679
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:57,132
Dom sent me to take him.

680
00:49:57,132 --> 00:49:59,099
Remember that place
we said we'd go

681
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,342
if the world went to hell?

682
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:02,344
Dom wants the team
to meet there.

683
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:03,690
Yeah.

684
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,002
Okay, look.

685
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,417
Little B, you're gonna go
with Uncle Jakob.

686
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,729
Okay? You do whatever he says.
Yeah?

687
00:50:08,729 --> 00:50:11,594
I'm gonna get you to your dad.
If that's okay with you.

688
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:14,701
Protect him with your life.

689
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,945
I love you, Jakey.

690
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:20,327
I love you, too, sis.

691
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:22,088
Let's do it.

692
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh, my God.

693
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:37,965
Yo!

694
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:39,795
It's not that one.

695
00:50:39,795 --> 00:50:41,693
It's this one.

696
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,489
Yep.

697
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:47,699
Wait, but...

698
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,494

as they can handle.

718
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,395
Thanks.

719
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:04,811
Cheers.

720
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:10,610
Queenie told me
I could find you here.

721
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:11,956
Belgian?

722
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:14,165
Mr. Nobody said
he had a daughter.

723
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:16,236
He did?

724
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:20,137
Well, now that
he's gone missing,

725
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,931
I came in from the cold.

726
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,795
Your dad kept the agency
in line.

727
00:52:23,795 --> 00:52:27,247
Now it feels like
all the anchors have been cut.

728
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:31,631
In a world where there is
no code, no one's safe.

729
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,564
You're right.

730
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:36,843
The agency has turned its back
on everything it stood for.

731
00:52:36,843 --> 00:52:40,295
The new boss, Aimes, he's coming
for you with everything.

732
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:43,298
I'm buying you some time.

733
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:48,475
And borrowed their, uh,
little tracking device thingy.

734
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:51,029
Look familiar?

735
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:52,410
God's Eye.
- Mm-hmm.

736
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,101
I'd put that
in a vault somewhere.

737
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:57,657
People pull vaults out of walls,
so I think it's safer with me.

738
00:52:57,657 --> 00:52:59,245
I pulled a screen grab

739
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:01,074
off of a traffic cam
that they missed,

740
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:02,765
put it in God's Eye.

741
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:04,422
There was a hit in Rio.

742
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:07,218
You wouldn't happen to have
any enemies in Rio, would you?

743
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,565
- Reyes.
- Hernan Reyes?

744
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:14,467
Still pretty dead,
but he has a son, Dante.

745
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:18,298
So you're gonna
have to get me to Rio.

746
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:21,646
That's your second wish.
You have one more.

747
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:23,924
Letty.

748
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:30,034
Letty's in a black site prison
off of every map.

749
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:31,242
Then get her out.

750
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:32,899
Nobody can.

751
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:34,763
Nobody would.

752
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:36,247
Dom, I'm so sorry,

753
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:39,630
but what you're asking me to do
is impossible.

754
00:53:47,293 --> 00:53:49,536
Nothing's impossible.

755
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:54,886
You just have to have faith.

756
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:09,280
Sneaking us out of Rome
in a shipping container

757
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,558
full of aftershave,
that was a terrible idea, Roman.

758
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:14,561
Wait, I think
I lost my sense of smell.

759
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:16,563
That is not aftershave.
That is tear gas.

760
00:54:16,563 --> 00:54:19,325
Hey, man, I don't know
what y'all are talking about.

761
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:21,292
You know what I mean?

762
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,845
I smell magic.

763
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:24,226
I took a bottle for myself.

764
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:25,917
This is all thanks to you.

765
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:27,471
You know that, right?

766
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:29,956
No, see, you just got to follow
my "leat" as a "leater."

767
00:54:29,956 --> 00:54:33,787
You see what I'm saying?
I'm a natural-born "leater."

768
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,548
Where are we?

769
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:37,515
I brought you back home, Ramsey.

770
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:40,207
The city with the most
amount of surveillance cameras.

771
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:41,588
Perfect.

772
00:54:51,426 --> 00:54:54,429
- Dad know you drive this thing?
- He should.

773
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:55,706
I raced him in it.

774
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:58,502
And just so you know,
in the '90s,

775
00:54:58,502 --> 00:55:01,332
if you were rolling in a 5.0,
it meant you were the man.

776

01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:43,501
And you were
fantástico, fabuloso, o cara.

887
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:45,434
He saved the Vatican.

888
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,643
Who does that?

889
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,922
Seriously. The Pope? God?

890
01:00:49,922 --> 01:00:51,786
By the way,
did you see what I did there?

891
01:00:51,786 --> 01:00:53,684
The ball through the city was

892
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:56,376
a bit of an homage
to my family's safe.

893
01:00:56,376 --> 01:00:58,378
Except it was on fire.

894
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:03,590
You remember my father?

895
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:06,179
- Hernan Reyes.
- Yes.

896
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:09,527
I remember he thought he had
his foot on this city's neck.

897
01:01:09,527 --> 01:01:11,081
But you know what happened?

898
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:13,186
I took him down.

899
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:16,707
Let's not argue
in front of the children.

900
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,433
You are absolutely right.

901
01:01:18,433 --> 01:01:21,091
My father was a horrible man,

902
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:23,576
very bad daddy,

903
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:25,371
but I kind of liked him.

904
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:28,098
And you took him from me
when you stole our money

905
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:30,652
and left us
with nothing but suffering.

906
01:01:30,652 --> 01:01:33,655
Well, that's what
I came here for.

907
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,313
To end that suffering.

908
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:39,488
Oh, and I didn't take
that money.

909
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:44,045
I burned it.

910
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,633
Uh-oh.

911
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:49,602
Well, Brazil is mine,

912
01:01:49,602 --> 01:01:51,190
and I own this city.

913
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:54,331
Ooh.

914
01:01:58,369 --> 01:02:00,889
You people think
you can buy everything.

915
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:04,790
But you can't buy the streets.

916
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:11,762
We stand with Dom.

917
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,319
Well, this is awkward.

918
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:20,598
So, how about we all just
start shooting each other

919
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:21,599
and see what happens?

920
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,568
Or we race.

921
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:26,501
If you win, you take me in.

922
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:27,951
If you lose...

923
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:31,782
Don't lose.

924
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:35,234
You all came 'cause
you wanted to see a race.

992
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:03,260

Goddamn it.

999
01:08:12,571 --> 01:08:14,366
And then he was like, "Boom!"

1000
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:16,333
And I was like, "Blam!"
And she was like, "What?"

1001
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,163
I was like, "Shut up."

1002
01:08:18,163 --> 01:08:20,406
And now I'm the best racer
in the world, so...

1003
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:24,617
Do not touch that. Let it dry.

1004
01:08:26,826 --> 01:08:29,174
You guys look fantastic.

1005
01:08:29,174 --> 01:08:32,694
I know the black is
very slimming and very scary,

1006
01:08:32,694 --> 01:08:34,558
but the pastels, you know,
they're in season,

1007
01:08:34,558 --> 01:08:37,527
and I feel like it tones down
the masculinity a little bit,

1008
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:39,667
which we all need these days.

1009
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:42,083
Did you know...

1010
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:43,671
Listen to me.

1011
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:46,156
Did you know that I was
legally dead for two minutes?

1012
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:47,502
Two minutes.

1013
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,780
- Bob, pay attention.

1014
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,851
And you know what I saw?

1015
01:08:51,851 --> 01:08:53,094
Nothing.

1016
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:55,407
Not a goddamn thing.

1017
01:08:55,407 --> 01:08:59,652
But I do feel like
once he, uh...

1018
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:02,483
cracked my skull open,
it just opened my mind.

1019
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:05,451
Yeah, that's deep, right?

1020
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:07,798
- You're absolutely right, Bob.

1021
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:08,903
We should get back to work.

1022
01:09:10,801 --> 01:09:12,182

You. You are evil.

turn they backs on us,

after all we've done for them?

1059

And we got to get ready
to fight.

1064
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:08,540
Wait, so we need guns,
artillery, tanks?

1065
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,267
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get that with no money?

1066
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,751
What?

1067
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:14,131
- We've been hacked.

1068
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:15,719
Look. Every account.

1069
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:20,103
Every dollar we made
over the last 20 years is gone.

1070
01:11:20,103 --> 01:11:21,346
He took everything.

1071
01:11:21,346 --> 01:11:22,864
We got heisted
during our own heist.

1072
01:11:22,864 --> 01:11:24,556
- Just decrypt the... Yeah.
- Decrypt the blockchain.

1073
01:11:24,556 --> 01:11:26,523
I'm on it. Then we can find
the transaction hash.

1074
01:11:26,523 --> 01:11:27,766
The transaction hash.

1075
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:28,767
Gets us the receiving IPs. Exactly.

1076
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,871
English.

1077
01:11:29,871 --> 01:11:31,148
Following our money, genius.

1078
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:32,357
We're trying to see
where he sent it.

1079
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:33,634
The coding is next-level.

1080
01:11:33,634 --> 01:11:35,912
I've never seen
anything like this.

1081
01:11:35,912 --> 01:11:38,294
We need more computing power.

1082
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,019
How are we gonna do that
if we broke?

1083
01:11:40,019 --> 01:11:42,574
What do you mean, "we" broke?

1084
01:11:45,024 --> 01:11:47,337
Wait, you holding out on us?

1085
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:48,856
No wonder you've been so calm.

1086
01:11:48,856 --> 01:11:51,962
Bro, what-what d--
what do you think this is, bro?

1087
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:54,068
You know what? Turn around.

1088
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:55,172
"Turn around"? What do you...

1089
01:11:55,172 --> 01:11:56,484
What you mean, "turn around"?

1090
01:11:56,484 --> 01:11:58,590
Man, I'm a grown-ass...

1091
01:11:59,763 --> 01:12:02,559
- What-- N-- What are you doing?
Hey, Roman, do not.

1092
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,150
Please tell me
you're not wearing Spanx.

1093
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:09,359
Oh, this ain't Spanx.
These banks.

1094
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:11,361
But it's okay, bro. I got you.

1095
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:12,673
All right?

1096
01:12:12,673 --> 01:12:15,365
You know what I mean?

1097
01:12:18,403 --> 01:12:19,990
Yeah. That's for you.

1098
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:21,958
That's for you.

1099
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,200
Let me see.

1100
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,617
Han, you always good
for the bag,

1101
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:28,758
'cause the bag
always come back, you know.

1102
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:32,693
So what I need from
all of y'all, I need receipts.

1103
01:12:32,693 --> 01:12:35,627
Who is you talking to?
Got your receipt.

1104
01:12:36,248 --> 01:12:39,769
So where do we go
to shop off the grid?

1105
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:42,392
I know a place.

1106
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:01,584
Wait. The agency's after us.
Aren't they gonna see our faces?

1107
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:03,206
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

1108
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:04,621
The first rule of tradecraft:

1109
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:06,554
you can't lose a tail
if they don't find you.

1110
01:13:06,554 --> 01:13:07,935
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1111
01:13:07,935 --> 01:13:09,419
I'll just-- Wait.
You know what, I'm just...

1112
01:13:09,419 --> 01:13:10,524
We'll just--
If you want to, uh, go.

1113
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:12,008
Uh, we'll stay here.

1114
01:13:12,008 --> 01:13:13,389
- You guys, you guys go around.
- Go around? Great.

1115
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,149
Go around.

1116
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:21,914
Sir, we just got a hit
on the boy and his uncle.

1117
01:13:21,914 --> 01:13:23,571
The rest of the team
is still in Europe.

1118
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:24,745
We're interfacing
with local authorities.

1119
01:13:24,745 --> 01:13:26,332
Forget authorities.

1120
01:13:26,332 --> 01:13:27,610
These people have been
outrunning the cops

1121
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,887
since they could
reach the gas pedal.

1122
01:13:28,887 --> 01:13:30,751
Get word to
every snitch, smuggler,

1123
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:32,131
hitter and hacker
we've ever used.

1124
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:34,720
Money talks and so will they.

1125
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,308
- We're getting an alert

1126
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:37,309
on Black Site A.

1127
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:39,622
Tess just visited Ortiz.

1128
01:13:39,622 --> 01:13:41,209
They have a nice chat?

1129
01:13:42,176 --> 01:13:43,971
Guess not.

1130
01:13:43,971 --> 01:13:46,663
Run it back for me.

1131
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:50,771
Stop. Zoom in.

1132
01:13:52,497 --> 01:13:54,326
Back-trace her flight path.

1133
01:13:54,326 --> 01:13:55,983
Find out where she was
before this.

1134
01:13:55,983 --> 01:13:57,778
That's where Dom is.

1135
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:15,485
You knew who I was
all along, didn't you?

1136
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:17,314
From the moment I saw you.

1137
01:14:17,314 --> 01:14:22,078
Your sister smiled with her eyes
and led with her heart.

1138
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:26,116
Just like you do.

1139
01:14:27,393 --> 01:14:29,050
We were nothing alike.

1140
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:31,570
She was the good sister.

1141
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,572
Always putting others first.

1142
01:14:33,572 --> 01:14:35,954
Always doing what was right.

1143
01:14:38,784 --> 01:14:41,925
Sometimes I would think
that the wrong sister died.

1144
01:14:43,202 --> 01:14:45,273
Why the good one and not me?

1145
01:14:55,629 --> 01:14:59,322
You're wrong about
not being anything like her.

1146
01:14:59,322 --> 01:15:02,187
You think
that's what she wants to hear?

1147
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,088
A cop and a street racer.

1148
01:15:07,088 --> 01:15:08,952
I'll tell you something.

1149
01:15:08,952 --> 01:15:12,093
They travel down the same road
long enough...

1150
01:15:13,854 --> 01:15:17,547
...and they realize
how much alike they really are.

1151
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,586
Trust me...

1152
01:15:22,587 --> 01:15:25,175
...I know.

1153
01:15:33,598 --> 01:15:36,186
She's still doing it, isn't she?

1154
01:15:39,914 --> 01:15:42,227
She's still helping people.

1155
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,233
She's helping us.

1156
01:15:49,475 --> 01:15:51,823
You know, Elena,

1157
01:15:51,823 --> 01:15:54,273
she knew everything
about the Reyes family.

1158
01:15:54,273 --> 01:15:55,930
After they killed her husband,

1159
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,726
she dedicated her life
trying to take them down.

1160
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:02,178
I think I still have her files.

1161
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:06,113
Wait, so we gonna find
military-grade gear

1162
01:16:06,113 --> 01:16:07,597
in the middle of London?

1163
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,219
You said you wanted
to shop off the grid.

1164
01:16:12,913 --> 01:16:16,088
Wait a second.
Did we just time-travel?

1165
01:16:16,088 --> 01:16:18,470
Would you look for
a black-market operation

1166
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:20,092
in a place like this?

1167
01:16:21,853 --> 01:16:23,130
You've got mail.

1168
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,235
- Ooh, snacks.
- Get me a receipt, homey.

1169
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,515
How am I gonna get a receipt
from a vending machine?

1170
01:16:29,515 --> 01:16:30,896
How about you figure it out?

1171
01:16:30,896 --> 01:16:33,589
Paper trail, bruh.
For tax write-off.

1172
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,004
I swear to God...

1173
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,110
What's up, Bowie420?

1174
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:40,665
Oh, shit. FreddieMerc?

1175
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,461
What? I had a life
before you knew me.

1176
01:16:45,773 --> 01:16:47,361
Bowie here runs
one of the most notorious

1177
01:16:47,361 --> 01:16:48,983
online black markets.

1178
01:16:48,983 --> 01:16:50,985
If you want it, he'll sell it.

1179
01:16:50,985 --> 01:16:52,573
I thought you didn't like that
about me, though.

1180
01:16:52,573 --> 01:16:53,988
Well, desperate times.

1181
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:55,541
What kind of muffins are these?

1182
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:56,681
Oh, those are fun muffins.

1183
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:58,199
You have like four of them,

1184
01:16:58,199 --> 01:16:59,856
you'll be in your underwear
watching Fantasia.

1185
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:01,099
Is that what you guys came for?
My muffins?

1186
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:02,756
Oh, it's gonna be
a muffin party?

1187
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:06,276
We, uh, we need transport.

1188
01:17:06,276 --> 01:17:08,451
Weapons, cars, the works.

1189
01:17:08,451 --> 01:17:09,866
And quietly.

1190
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:11,592
Cool, then I'm just
gonna need cash. Okay?

1191
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:12,938
None of that crypto stuff.

1192
01:17:12,938 --> 01:17:15,044
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here
got you covered.

1193
01:17:15,044 --> 01:17:17,736
Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even
been into outer space.

1194
01:17:17,736 --> 01:17:19,876
Wow. -If y'all was gonna be
giving out my money,

1195
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:21,878
I'd appreciate
some type of a heads-up,

1196
01:17:21,878 --> 01:17:23,328
you know what I'm saying?

1197
01:17:23,328 --> 01:17:25,364
How much we talking about, bruh?

1198
01:17:25,364 --> 01:17:26,918
Just like a reasonable amount.

1199
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,403
How about that?

1200
01:17:30,922 --> 01:17:32,440
That won't even cover
the muffins.

1201
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,683
Is this guy serious?

1202
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:35,685
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

1203
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:37,860
Come on, man,
you're an astronaut.

1204
01:17:39,102 --> 01:17:41,208
Well, how about that?

1205
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,796
What, did you leave
all your money in space?

1206
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:44,694
Man, give me this.

1207
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:46,351
- Thank you.
- Are you serious right now?

1208
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:48,733
You know I pay for everything
around here, right?

1209
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:50,562
You should pay for everything.

1210
01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:53,807
It's your mission in Rome that
got us here in the first place.

1211
01:17:53,807 --> 01:17:56,223
No, it was your intel
that led us to Rome.

1212
01:17:56,223 --> 01:17:58,432
To be fair, that setup would
have confused the best of us.

1213
01:17:58,432 --> 01:17:59,675
No, I'm tired of this.

1214
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,090
'Cause all he do is talk.

1215
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,471
And then everyone
has to do their job and yours.

1216
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,818
What are you saying, Tej?

1217
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:06,371
- Mean, what I'm saying?
Hey, guys.

1218
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:08,580
- This is a family environment.
- What? Really?

1219
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,478
- Really?
Take it outside, fellas.

1220
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:13,171
So, what we doing, bruh?

1221
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,413
Uh-oh.

1222
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:17,106
- Gentlemen, please! Guys!

1223
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:20,419
Oh, not the vending machine.
No. -WOMAN: Unbelievable.

1224
01:18:20,419 --> 01:18:23,526
Guys, you're causing like
dozens of dollars in damage!

1225
01:18:23,526 --> 01:18:25,355
Let's go. Come on.

1226
01:18:25,355 --> 01:18:27,392
Should we stop this?

1227
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,845
Hold on!
- Nah, let 'em bond.

1228
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:35,124
Hey!
That computer's from, like, '98!

1229
01:18:36,194 --> 01:18:37,885
Huh?

1230
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:41,820
BOWIE [echoing]:
What the hell, man?

1231
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:54,453
Okay. All right.

1232
01:18:54,453 --> 01:18:55,765
We doing stomachs now.

1233
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:57,318
All right, all right,
that's enough.

1234
01:18:57,318 --> 01:18:58,975
You've been wanting that
for years! -BOWIE: Uh, I think

1235
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:01,150
he hit the copy machine so hard
it works now.

1236
01:19:05,499 --> 01:19:06,914
What the hell was that?

1237
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,053
He's like a ghetto magician.

1238
01:19:08,053 --> 01:19:10,090
You know what it is, bruh.

1239
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:12,333
- I beat your ass.
- You just beat my ass?

1240
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,610
- Beat my ass, huh?
- My God,

1241
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:14,888
will you two just quit it?
Please.

1242
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:16,855
We don't have time for this. You.

1243
01:19:16,855 --> 01:19:18,443
- Get to work.
- Oh, I just need

1244
01:19:18,443 --> 01:19:20,479
to hack into the marketplace.
It'll just take a second.

1245
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:22,688
Oops.

1246
01:19:22,688 --> 01:19:24,518
What the hell, Bowie?
What did you just do?

1247
01:19:24,518 --> 01:19:25,830
I'm sorry.
Your guys's faces are,

1248
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:27,590
like, all over the dark web.

1249
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,247
I mean, that reward is dope.

1250
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:31,076
- Ow. Hey.
- We have to move.

1251
01:19:31,076 --> 01:19:33,665
- The agency's minutes away.
- Look, it's nothing personal.

1252
01:19:33,665 --> 01:19:35,909
- Hey, fun muffins on me, okay?
- What? Huh?

1253
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:36,979
- Oh!
Oh!

1254
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:39,188
I deserved that.

1255
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:41,811
- Are you okay, bro?
- Yeah, thank you, man.

1256
01:19:47,127 --> 01:19:48,818
All right, so where to now, huh?

1257
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:50,095
- Jail?

1258
01:19:50,095 --> 01:19:53,443
I know somewhere.
Last place I want to go.

1259
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,782
How does it feel to be
on my side of the law?

1260
01:20:21,782 --> 01:20:24,647
They like to fix things
before they break 'em.

1261
01:20:24,647 --> 01:20:27,339
It's a sick place, Letty.

1262
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,172
You're welcome.

1263
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:33,518
What did you do?

1264
01:20:33,518 --> 01:20:36,624
I rerouted anesthetic gas
into their air conditioning.

1265
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:40,111
And I bought us a few minutes
before these cameras reset

1266
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:43,045
and they find out this place
turned into a sleep study.

1267
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:50,431
You gonna stay grumpy or
do you want to get out of here?

1268
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:53,952
They're not gonna sleep forever.

1269
01:20:53,952 --> 01:20:56,852
Don't you want to get back
to your precious family?

1270
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,993
Shit.

1271
01:21:02,754 --> 01:21:04,721
Seems like you got this covered.

1272
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:06,516
- What do you need me for?
- I have a plan,

1273
01:21:06,516 --> 01:21:09,105
but it's a two-person job.

1274
01:21:17,942 --> 01:21:19,598
Now, was that so hard?

1275
01:21:20,496 --> 01:21:22,601
How much time do we have?

1276
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:24,707
I'd say about four minutes.

1277
01:21:24,707 --> 01:21:25,881
It'll have to do.

You got to hit me harder
for that.

1284
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:44,830

Dante Reyes.

1303
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:19,028
Born in Portugal.

1304
01:23:19,028 --> 01:23:21,997
Mother from the Pacific Islands.

1305
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,000
Sociopathic tendencies
from an early age.

1306
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,141
He bounced from juvie to prison
to mental wards.

1307
01:23:28,141 --> 01:23:30,522
And each time, Daddy was there
to spring him out.

1308
01:23:30,522 --> 01:23:34,250
After his father died,
he disappeared.

1309
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:38,875
Properties Reyes owned
before he died.

1310
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,499
Now all sold and repo'd.

1311
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:43,156
Except this one.

1312
01:23:44,674 --> 01:23:46,849
The police station.

1313
01:23:46,849 --> 01:23:49,093
It's been abandoned for years.

1314
01:23:49,093 --> 01:23:51,474
And guess whose name
is on the deed.

1315
01:23:52,924 --> 01:23:54,546
Dante Reyes.

1316
01:23:55,616 --> 01:23:57,032
I'll find my answer there.

1317
01:23:58,757 --> 01:24:01,691
I'm coming with you.

1318
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:07,214
I need you to stay safe.

1319
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:15,222
I would have won that race,
you know.

1320
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:17,397
So you want a rematch?

1321
01:24:17,397 --> 01:24:19,916
- I'm demanding it.

1322
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:22,643
So I guess I'll see you soon.

1323
01:24:54,192 --> 01:24:56,815
Guys, you don't want to do this.

1324
01:24:56,815 --> 01:24:59,024
He needs a new watch, cop.

1325
01:24:59,024 --> 01:25:00,543
Look, the watch was a gift.

1326
01:25:00,543 --> 01:25:03,098
But I got 16 carats of
uncut diamonds in my jockstrap

1327
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,823
if you want to take a look.

1328
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,802
Now you really do need
a new watch.

1329
01:25:23,048 --> 01:25:24,705
Damn it.

1330
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:35,682
B, you okay?

1331
01:25:37,684 --> 01:25:39,168
Tried gum? Gum helps.

1332
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:41,515
I don't like planes.

1333
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:44,415
If it's the height,
that's gonna be an issue.

1334
01:25:45,381 --> 01:25:47,866
You know, I used to be
scared of cars.

1335
01:25:48,764 --> 01:25:52,630
After my dad died,
I guess I blamed myself.

1336
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,665
It was tough.

1337
01:25:53,665 --> 01:25:56,185
I had panic attacks,
the whole bit.

1338
01:25:56,185 --> 01:25:57,704
Heck, I took the bus.

1339
01:25:57,704 --> 01:26:00,603
Yeah. I think I was just
so worried about making mistakes

1340
01:26:00,603 --> 01:26:03,813
and not being
as good as my brother.

1341
01:26:03,813 --> 01:26:05,263
- You?
- Uh, excuse me.

1342
01:26:05,263 --> 01:26:07,092
Have you met your dad?

1343
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:09,094
He casts a pretty big shadow.

1344
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:14,686
Huh. Feeling better?

1345
01:26:14,686 --> 01:26:15,825
- Yeah.
- Good.

1346
01:26:15,825 --> 01:26:17,655
Me, too.

1347
01:26:21,693 --> 01:26:25,387
Here's the drink
that you ordered, sir.

1348
01:26:27,872 --> 01:26:29,701
You know her?

1349
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:32,842
Yeah, it's good to have friends
in high places.

1350
01:26:32,842 --> 01:26:34,568
On the count of three,

1351
01:26:34,568 --> 01:26:37,192
we're gonna get up
and go to the bathroom. Ready?

1352
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,504
- Three.

1353
01:27:14,332 --> 01:27:15,747
Who were those guys?

1354
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:18,474
Agency. They found us.
Now let's lose our tail.

1355
01:27:26,827 --> 01:27:28,691
Holy shi...

1356
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:33,144
Wait! Swearing is for song
lyrics only and stubbed toes.

1357
01:27:33,144 --> 01:27:34,559
Forget about it. Pay attention.

1358
01:27:34,559 --> 01:27:36,975
Okay?
We're-we're too high to glide,

1359
01:27:36,975 --> 01:27:40,185
so we need thrust,
which means, uh,

1360
01:27:40,185 --> 01:27:42,464
combustion, which means...?

1361
01:27:43,637 --> 01:27:47,262
Oxygen and fuel.

1362
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,332
Alcohol.

1363
01:27:48,332 --> 01:27:49,747
- Um...
- Huh?

1364
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:50,989
Oh.

1365
01:27:58,238 --> 01:27:59,653
That's rosé. Not gonna work.

1366
01:27:59,653 --> 01:28:01,483
Long story.
But good initiative.

1367
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:14,219
I'm glad it wasn't the height.

1368
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:15,876
Enjoy the ride, Little B.

1369
01:28:28,406 --> 01:28:30,097
Bowie tagged us.

1370
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,375
The agency is on our tail.

1371
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:32,755
We need to find gear

1372
01:28:32,755 --> 01:28:34,930
and get to the rendezvous
as soon as possible.

1373
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:36,207
It's right here.

1374
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:39,452
You guys hold back.
Let me take care of this.

1375
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:41,661
No, no, no.
Th-That's a bad idea.

1376
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:44,353
- I mean like Roman-level bad.
- What?

1377
01:28:44,353 --> 01:28:45,423
What are you talking about, man?

1378
01:28:45,423 --> 01:28:46,873
You heard what I said.

1379
01:28:46,873 --> 01:28:49,047
Look, bro, you don't
have to do this, man.

1380
01:28:49,047 --> 01:28:50,704
You know I got your back.

1381
01:28:50,704 --> 01:28:51,809
We got your back.

1382
01:28:55,019 --> 01:28:57,435
- I got to do this alone.

1383
01:29:16,212 --> 01:29:18,560
I have something
to talk to you about.

1384
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,115
The only reason a dead guy
shows up at my door:

1385
01:29:22,115 --> 01:29:23,392
revenge.

1386
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:29,122
Oh, shi...

1387
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:34,817
- Oh, shit.
- Shit. Han!

1388
01:29:36,129 --> 01:29:38,269
Should have stayed dead.

1389
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:40,098
I can get in. I can get in.

1390
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:42,549
I don't like repeating myself.

1391
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:44,965
You ruined my snacks.

1392
01:29:48,417 --> 01:29:51,696
Relax.
I don't want to fight you.

1393
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:53,802
Then this is gonna end quick.

1394
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,427
You bring more men to kill me?

1395
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,394
They're trying to kill me, too.

1396
01:30:35,084 --> 01:30:37,535
Well, it looks like
we got more company.

1397
01:30:37,535 --> 01:30:40,193
- You still drive?
- What do you think?

1398
01:30:43,403 --> 01:30:45,578
Okay, just give me a second.

1399
01:30:45,578 --> 01:30:46,889
Freeze!

1400
01:31:10,154 --> 01:31:12,018
- Drop the laptop!
- Okay.

1401
01:31:38,182 --> 01:31:39,563
- Guys, I'm in.

1402
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:52,748
No, no, no, no!

1403
01:31:57,063 --> 01:31:58,478
Now we're even.

1404
01:32:05,278 --> 01:32:06,313
You okay?

1405
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,608
Now, see, I understand all this.

1406
01:32:24,608 --> 01:32:26,057
What the hell was that?

1407
01:32:31,235 --> 01:32:32,995
You got scared. I saw that.

1408
01:32:32,995 --> 01:32:36,033
- Ain't nobody got scared, bruh.
- No, you were... he was scared.

1409
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,774
LETTY [over speakers]:
We have an unwanted guest.

1410
01:32:52,774 --> 01:32:53,947
DOM [over speakers]:
My family?

1411
01:32:53,947 --> 01:32:55,604
They're safe for now.

1412
01:32:55,604 --> 01:32:56,709
You're not afraid of anything.

1413
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:58,296
I don't care about dying.

1414
01:32:58,296 --> 01:33:01,403
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

1415
01:33:01,403 --> 01:33:02,577
Hold us in your heart

1416
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,164
and you will never
lose your way.

1417
01:33:04,164 --> 01:33:05,580
You're not afraid of anything.

1418
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,167
Fear can be a great teacher.

1419
01:33:07,167 --> 01:33:08,721
LITTLE BRIAN [distorted]:
You're not afraid of anything.

1420
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,875
DANTE [over phone]:
How do you like my place?

1421
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:28,257
I'm bummed I'm not there
to show you around.

1422
01:33:28,257 --> 01:33:30,639
And a little embarrassed
you saw my vision board.

1423
01:33:32,123 --> 01:33:34,091
But at least you know
how hard I've been working

1424
01:33:34,091 --> 01:33:35,437
to get us to this point.

1425
01:33:35,437 --> 01:33:37,197
Now I know you're a dead man.

1426
01:33:37,197 --> 01:33:38,509
You mean resurrected.

1427
01:33:38,509 --> 01:33:40,166
Thanks to you.

1428
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,892
You know, if you never would
have gotten behind that wheel,

1429
01:33:41,892 --> 01:33:44,757
I'd never be the man
that I am today.

1430
01:33:44,757 --> 01:33:46,793
You built such a beautiful life,

1431
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:49,831
filled with love and family.

1432
01:33:49,831 --> 01:33:51,591
I never got that chance.

1433
01:33:51,591 --> 01:33:55,560
Collateral damage, chaos, death.

1434
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,045
This is your legacy.

1435
01:33:57,045 --> 01:33:58,391
I'm your legacy.

1436
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:00,151
You know what
I can't figure out?

1437
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:04,086
How someone born so rich

1438
01:34:04,086 --> 01:34:07,676
chooses the poorest path
through life.

1439
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:09,505
You got no honor.

1440
01:34:09,505 --> 01:34:13,199
Without honor,
you got no family.

1441
01:34:14,476 --> 01:34:16,236
And without family...

1442
01:34:18,411 --> 01:34:20,447
...you've got nothing.

1443
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:22,415
I have nothing because of you.

1444
01:34:22,415 --> 01:34:24,866
My future. My family.

1445
01:34:24,866 --> 01:34:27,558
You stole that from me.

1446
01:34:27,558 --> 01:34:30,319
And now I'm gonna break yours,

1447
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:32,908
piece by piece.

1448
01:34:32,908 --> 01:34:35,393
Stop talking and face me.

1449
01:34:35,393 --> 01:34:36,843
Do you like surprises, Dommy?

1450
01:34:36,843 --> 01:34:39,674
I adore them.

1451
01:34:41,365 --> 01:34:42,884
But the game's not over yet.

1452
01:34:42,884 --> 01:34:45,196
There's still
so many people to hurt.

1453
01:34:47,923 --> 01:34:49,856
I'm coming for you.

1454
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,203
Well, that's gonna be
hard to do in handcuffs.

1455
01:34:52,203 --> 01:34:54,378
Okay, bye, Dommy.

1456
01:34:54,378 --> 01:34:56,276
No, you hang up first.

1457
01:34:56,276 --> 01:34:57,450
Okay.

1458
01:35:07,771 --> 01:35:09,013
Toretto, freeze.

1459
01:35:09,013 --> 01:35:11,809
Time to face the music, Dom.

1460
01:35:11,809 --> 01:35:14,329
You're playing
right into his hands, cop.

1461
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:53,195
Okay. Come on.

1462
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:56,854
Oh.

1463
01:35:59,788 --> 01:36:01,341
Yeah.

1464
01:36:11,627 --> 01:36:13,802
Great.

1465
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:16,115
Just great.

1466
01:36:16,115 --> 01:36:17,944
Shit.

1467
01:36:24,537 --> 01:36:27,022
Little chilly?

1468
01:36:28,506 --> 01:36:29,818
Your plan still sucks.

1469
01:36:29,818 --> 01:36:32,545
Maybe, but at least
you'll be warm.

1470
01:36:33,615 --> 01:36:36,514
"Thank you, Cipher. Thank you."

1471
01:36:45,351 --> 01:36:46,455
- Oh, wow.

1472
01:36:46,455 --> 01:36:47,836
Take a look at this.

1473
01:36:47,836 --> 01:36:49,665
This should cover us
in the gear department.

1474
01:36:49,665 --> 01:36:51,357
You are not to be trusted.

1475
01:36:51,357 --> 01:36:55,154
Hey, you ain't
on my Christmas list either.

1476
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:59,744
Nothing here is for free.
Let me be clear on that.

1477
01:36:59,744 --> 01:37:01,505
Make sure you get a receipt
from him, okay?

1478
01:37:01,505 --> 01:37:02,851
I'd love to see that.

1479
01:37:02,851 --> 01:37:04,508
Well, I guess Bowie

1480
01:37:04,508 --> 01:37:06,648
wasn't entirely worthless.
I can use his hard drive

1481
01:37:06,648 --> 01:37:08,063
to complete our trace of Dante.

1482
01:37:08,063 --> 01:37:10,583
He's been ten moves ahead of us
this whole time.

1483
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:12,033
How does he do it by himself?

1484
01:37:12,033 --> 01:37:13,724
Uh, this isn't good.

1485
01:37:13,724 --> 01:37:16,071
Our money, it's been split into
accounts all over the world.

1486
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:18,246
And look
who they're registered to.

1487
01:37:18,246 --> 01:37:20,938
Those are mercenary kill teams.
Real scum.

1488
01:37:20,938 --> 01:37:22,767
He used our money
to buy an army.

1489
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,769
So this guy doesn't
just want us dead.

1490
01:37:24,769 --> 01:37:26,081
He wants to erase us
off the planet.

1491
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:27,565
He's trying to tear us apart.

1492
01:37:27,565 --> 01:37:29,636
That's exactly why we need
to link back up with Dom

1493
01:37:29,636 --> 01:37:31,846
at the rendezvous point.

1494
01:37:35,056 --> 01:37:36,643
You need to see this.

1495
01:37:38,714 --> 01:37:40,371
They've been paid to target us

1496
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:43,892
and anyone who ever helped us
until now.

1497
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:48,207
Mum.

1498
01:38:10,781 --> 01:38:12,956
I'll have transport
waiting for you.

1499
01:38:12,956 --> 01:38:15,199
And where are you going?

1500
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,994
I'm gonna dig some graves.

1501
01:38:27,763 --> 01:38:29,386
Mr. Nobody's golden boy,

1502
01:38:29,386 --> 01:38:31,560
caught without
so much as a fight.

1503
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,217
That's no fun.

1504
01:38:33,217 --> 01:38:35,081
It's like going
all the way to Everest

1505
01:38:35,081 --> 01:38:36,876
and taking the elevator.

1506
01:38:38,567 --> 01:38:39,983
You might want to buckle up.

1507
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:43,158
I know you did some good work
for the agency.

1508
01:38:43,158 --> 01:38:46,023
I'm sure you figured
that buys you some leniency.

1509
01:38:46,023 --> 01:38:48,094
But it's a new day.

1510
01:38:48,094 --> 01:38:51,442
That's the problem nowadays.
Nobody listens.

1511
01:38:54,825 --> 01:38:57,483
You should have spent less time
with your head under the hood

1512
01:38:57,483 --> 01:38:59,899
and more time preparing
for what's coming.

1513
01:38:59,899 --> 01:39:02,419
Spies have been replaced
by satellites,

1514
01:39:02,419 --> 01:39:07,355
fighter pilots by drones,
intelligence by an algorithm.

1515
01:39:07,355 --> 01:39:10,116
The days where one man
behind the wheel of a car

1516
01:39:10,116 --> 01:39:12,981
can make a difference
are over, Dom.

1517
01:39:12,981 --> 01:39:15,777
Hell, the days of any man

1518
01:39:15,777 --> 01:39:17,744
behind the wheel of a car
are over.

1519
01:39:20,989 --> 01:39:22,059
What are you doing?

1520
01:39:22,059 --> 01:39:24,682
Preparing for what's to come.

1521
01:39:24,682 --> 01:39:26,615
Right.

1522
01:39:44,461 --> 01:39:45,600
Go. Go. Go.

1523
01:40:02,582 --> 01:40:06,862
Dominic, I brought you back
to where we first met.

1524
01:40:06,862 --> 01:40:08,588
And I have a surprise for you.

1525
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,271
Dom!

1526
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:39,481
I'm listening now.

1527
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:14,827
Dominic?

1528
01:41:14,827 --> 01:41:16,139
Dominic!

1529
01:41:16,139 --> 01:41:18,002
Would you stop hurting
my new friends?

1530
01:41:18,002 --> 01:41:20,626
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

1531
01:41:20,626 --> 01:41:21,661
Oh.

1532
01:41:21,661 --> 01:41:24,216
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1533
01:41:24,216 --> 01:41:25,872
That little car stunt
you just did?

1534
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:26,942
That was pretty awesome.

1535
01:41:26,942 --> 01:41:28,185
Wasn't it?

1536
01:41:28,185 --> 01:41:29,531
It was so cool.

1537
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:31,740
But if you don't stop,

1538
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:34,847
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

1539
01:41:34,847 --> 01:41:36,331
Badly.

1540
01:41:41,716 --> 01:41:43,338
There she is.

1541
01:41:43,338 --> 01:41:45,823
- Hmm.
- Fashionably late.

1542
01:41:46,755 --> 01:41:48,171
You got me.

1543
01:41:49,068 --> 01:41:51,035
Mmm.

1544
01:41:51,035 --> 01:41:53,452
- Off you go.

1545
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:56,800
Family.

1546
01:41:59,147 --> 01:42:02,116
Will you please get off my car?

1547
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:05,774
- Hmm.

1548
01:42:05,774 --> 01:42:07,604
That is so disrespectful.

1549
01:42:07,604 --> 01:42:09,399
You talk too much.

1550
01:42:23,206 --> 01:42:24,379
Stop, stop!

1551
01:42:24,379 --> 01:42:25,863
You don't know
your own strength.

1552
01:42:29,798 --> 01:42:31,317
You butthole!

1553
01:42:31,317 --> 01:42:33,492
Oh, hey.

1554
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,702
Do you like ballet?

1555
01:42:36,702 --> 01:42:38,324
I adore Swan Lake.

1556
01:42:38,324 --> 01:42:40,223
I feel like you're more of a--
kind of a Nutcracker guy.

1557
01:42:40,223 --> 01:42:43,329
And a one, and a two,
and...

1558
01:42:45,124 --> 01:42:46,746
No!

1559
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:54,478
Wait for it.

1560
01:42:57,101 --> 01:42:58,655
Oh, no.

1561
01:42:58,655 --> 01:43:01,451
She's in peril.
What will you do?

1562
01:43:03,418 --> 01:43:05,317
You know what your problem is?

1563
01:43:06,904 --> 01:43:09,597
Family.

1564
01:43:10,736 --> 01:43:12,358
You can't save 'em all.

1565
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:16,569
Five. Four.

1566
01:43:16,569 --> 01:43:17,915
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1567
01:43:17,915 --> 01:43:19,434
Go on.

1568
01:43:19,434 --> 01:43:20,780
Two.

1569
01:43:32,758 --> 01:43:34,553
You don't like ballet.

1570
01:43:34,553 --> 01:43:36,244
I can feel it.

1571
01:43:36,244 --> 01:43:38,212
May I please have the God's Eye?

1572
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,834
- Screw you.
- No?

1573
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:40,938
Pretty please?

1574
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:43,734
- Oh, there it is.

1575
01:43:43,734 --> 01:43:45,943
Ooh. Gotcha.

1576
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:49,153
Good trade. Keep the car.

1577
01:43:49,153 --> 01:43:50,914
Oh, Dommy!

1578
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:56,264
I told you,
you owe me suffering!

1579
01:43:56,264 --> 01:43:58,784
Your legacy isn't money or power

1580
01:43:58,784 --> 01:44:01,269
or the family you built
or the life you led.

1581
01:44:01,269 --> 01:44:04,410
It's the life you made.

1582
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:07,896
And a father and his son...

1583
01:44:07,896 --> 01:44:09,208
is everything.

1584
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:11,314
You killed my father
on this bridge.

1585
01:44:11,314 --> 01:44:15,041
And now I know
where to find your son.

1586
01:44:16,905 --> 01:44:19,253
Enchanté.

1587
01:44:28,434 --> 01:44:31,817
You're gonna be okay, Tess.
It went clear through.

1588
01:44:31,817 --> 01:44:33,232
Kinda hurts.

1589
01:44:33,232 --> 01:44:35,303
Your father would be proud.

1590
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:37,305
Yeah.

1591
01:44:37,305 --> 01:44:39,756
You will stop him.

1592
01:44:41,136 --> 01:44:42,621
Have faith.

1593
01:44:54,184 --> 01:44:55,703
She needs a hospital.

1594
01:44:55,703 --> 01:44:57,601
Mm.

1595
01:45:16,965 --> 01:45:18,967
You're gonna be okay.

1596
01:45:18,967 --> 01:45:20,452
I got her.

1597
01:45:20,452 --> 01:45:22,074
Go save your son.

1598
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,388
My nephew.

1599
01:45:38,573 --> 01:45:42,370
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry,
so let me do you one better.

1600
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:44,717
Let's get your son.

1610
01:46:16,749 --> 01:46:19,062
So, it used to be an old mine,

1611
01:46:19,062 --> 01:46:21,789
and they blasted tunnels
deep into the mountain.

1612
01:46:21,789 --> 01:46:25,068
And I just, uh...

1613
01:46:25,068 --> 01:46:26,587
repurposed the place.

1614
01:46:26,587 --> 01:46:28,934
You just got to keep yourself
open to possibilities.

1615
01:46:28,934 --> 01:46:32,316
And, of course, [sighs] have
a lot of time on your hands.

1616
01:46:32,316 --> 01:46:34,836
You said we'd meet him here.

1617
01:46:39,979 --> 01:46:41,049
Hey.

1618
01:46:42,844 --> 01:46:43,604
You know your dad.

1619
01:46:43,604 --> 01:46:46,020
He's got to make it safe.

1620
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,573
We'll just wait.

1621
01:46:50,127 --> 01:46:52,992
I love you, Uncle Jakob.

1622
01:47:00,897 --> 01:47:01,967
What's that?

1623
01:47:01,967 --> 01:47:05,349
That? Ah, project
I've been working on.

1624
01:47:05,349 --> 01:47:07,628
You wouldn't be interested.

1625
01:47:19,502 --> 01:47:21,952
All right, we're entering
Portuguese airspace.

1626
01:47:21,952 --> 01:47:24,576
Jakob's already there.
Any word from Dom?

1627
01:47:26,888 --> 01:47:28,752
Hey.

1628
01:47:28,752 --> 01:47:30,996
Why are you so quiet?
You all right?

1629
01:47:30,996 --> 01:47:33,481
Just been sitting here
thinking, man.

1630
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:34,896
I knew I smelled
something burning in here.

1631
01:47:34,896 --> 01:47:39,176
Tej, it was my mission,
y'all took my lead,

1632
01:47:39,176 --> 01:47:41,972
and I messed this thing up
every step of the way.

1633
01:47:41,972 --> 01:47:44,665
I guess this whole...

1634
01:47:44,665 --> 01:47:46,805
leadership thing
really ain't for me.

1635
01:47:46,805 --> 01:47:49,842
You took us to London
on a container.

1636
01:47:49,842 --> 01:47:53,018
You spent thousands of dollars
of your own cash,

1637
01:47:53,018 --> 01:47:54,882
strapped to your ass,

1638
01:47:54,882 --> 01:47:57,540
that now smells like
cheap cologne.

1639
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:59,542
Now you're sitting here
taking sole responsibility

1640
01:47:59,542 --> 01:48:01,682
for something that we all wear.

1641
01:48:01,682 --> 01:48:03,477
Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

1642
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:04,754
Nah, it don't sound stupid
at all.

1643
01:48:04,754 --> 01:48:06,272
You know what
it sounds like to me?

1644
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,758
That sounds like a leader.

1645
01:48:17,698 --> 01:48:19,976
Come on, man.
Get your ass up, man.

1646
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:23,358
I love you, man.

1647
01:48:23,358 --> 01:48:24,636
I love you, too, bro.

1648
01:48:24,636 --> 01:48:27,708
Sometimes we got to say,
"I'm sorry."

1649
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:29,503
I'm sorry for
whupping your ass, man,

1650
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:31,366
'cause I didn't really mean
to do that.

1651
01:48:31,366 --> 01:48:33,334
The whole thing, it would've
been a whole dif... -

1652
01:48:33,334 --> 01:48:35,474
- You okay? What's wrong?

1653
01:48:35,474 --> 01:48:37,683
I'm just allergic
to your bullshit.

1654
01:48:37,683 --> 01:48:39,271
- Come on.

1655
01:48:42,688 --> 01:48:45,311
Hey, go easy there.
You're gonna break that thing.

1656
01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:47,175
- You all right?

1657
01:48:47,175 --> 01:48:48,798
God's Eye was just used to send

1658
01:48:48,798 --> 01:48:50,903
dozens of mercenaries
after Dom's son.

1659
01:48:50,903 --> 01:48:55,632
Something I created
hurting the people we love.

1660
01:48:58,393 --> 01:49:00,326
It was meant to help.

1661
01:49:00,326 --> 01:49:02,639
This is bigger than just Dante.

1662
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,641
This is bigger than just us.

1663
01:49:04,641 --> 01:49:07,575
We have to stop
this monster now.

1664
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,901
We got to go.

1665
01:49:44,198 --> 01:49:45,509
Hold on!

1666
01:49:55,071 --> 01:49:57,107
I got eyes on
Uncle Muscle and the kid.

1667
01:49:57,107 --> 01:49:59,282
All right, everybody,
remember the plan.

1668
01:49:59,282 --> 01:50:01,560
Contain and kidnap. Thank you.

1669
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,320
No.

1670
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,528
No guns.

1671
01:50:04,528 --> 01:50:06,703
I need this little shit alive.

1672
01:50:06,703 --> 01:50:08,291
At least for a while.

1673
01:50:37,838 --> 01:50:40,081
- You ready?
- Ready.

1674
01:50:57,098 --> 01:50:58,721
Holy sh...

1675
01:50:59,445 --> 01:51:00,964
Oh, no, you're good.
You're good.

1676
01:51:00,964 --> 01:51:03,553
Okay, uh, song lyrics,
stubbed toes and cannon cars.

1677
01:51:03,553 --> 01:51:04,830
Yeah.

1678
01:51:09,283 --> 01:51:11,009
Here we go!

1679
01:52:02,543 --> 01:52:04,165
It's stuck. It's stuck.

1680
01:52:07,651 --> 01:52:08,860
They got an army
down there, Dom.

1681
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:10,862
Your team's not far out.

1682
01:52:10,862 --> 01:52:12,829
- Bring us down.
- I can't put her down here.

1683
01:52:12,829 --> 01:52:14,728
There's an airfield
seven klicks west.

1684
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,868
Okay, we'll meet you there.
Now open the back.

1685
01:52:16,868 --> 01:52:19,836
Dom, there's really
nowhere to land.

1686
01:52:21,562 --> 01:52:23,909
Who said anything about landing?

1687
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:43,135
Look.

1688
01:52:49,003 --> 01:52:51,005
I'm coming for you, son.

1689
01:53:00,256 --> 01:53:01,567
What the...

1690
01:53:31,839 --> 01:53:33,841
- Dad!
- Hey, son.

1691
01:53:33,841 --> 01:53:35,809
Good to see you, big bro.

1692
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:38,535
Good to see you guys.
Follow me to that plane.

1693
01:53:38,535 --> 01:53:40,296
We're right behind you.

1694
01:53:42,816 --> 01:53:44,403
I got you now.

1695
01:53:52,515 --> 01:53:54,206
Aimes, we're on our way.

1696
01:53:54,206 --> 01:53:57,175
Dom, I'll be touching down
five klicks west.

1697
01:53:57,175 --> 01:53:58,832
But they're still on your tail.

1698
01:54:00,626 --> 01:54:02,249
It's jammed.

1699
01:54:06,046 --> 01:54:08,738
B, what are you doing?

1700
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:12,224
Careful.

1701
01:54:13,777 --> 01:54:15,193
Okay, okay, okay.

1702
01:54:23,684 --> 01:54:26,583
Shut the front door.

1703
01:54:26,583 --> 01:54:28,102
Little B.

1704
01:54:34,937 --> 01:54:37,422
Uncle Jakob!

1705
01:54:37,422 --> 01:54:39,389
I fixed it!

1706
01:54:44,463 --> 01:54:45,809
B!

1707
01:54:45,809 --> 01:54:47,363
Toodle-oo.

1708
01:54:49,123 --> 01:54:50,642
- Help!
- Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up.

1709
01:54:50,642 --> 01:54:51,919
Damn it.

1710
01:54:51,919 --> 01:54:53,990
You party? I party.

1711
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:55,923
- Whoa.

1712
01:54:56,959 --> 01:54:59,547
Dom, I lost him.
Dante has Little B.

1713
01:55:19,084 --> 01:55:21,431
Hey, Dominic.
Welcome to the big showdown.

1714
01:55:21,431 --> 01:55:23,882
It's the last lap.
Check out my copilot.

1715
01:55:23,882 --> 01:55:26,712
- Dad!
- Who could've seen this coming?

1716
01:55:26,712 --> 01:55:28,611
I mean, you know, except for me.

1717
01:55:45,835 --> 01:55:48,424
Shit. Looks like
my fuel line's been shot.

1718
01:55:49,563 --> 01:55:52,911
- I can't get to him, Dom.
- Jakob, stay with me.

1719
01:55:52,911 --> 01:55:55,500
I'm out of this race.

1720
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,950
It has to be you.

1721
01:55:56,950 --> 01:56:00,160
Hey, Dom!
Got a little surprise for you.

1722
01:56:10,032 --> 01:56:12,517
You raised a hell of a son, Dom.

1723
01:56:12,517 --> 01:56:15,623
Time for me to step out
from under your shadow.

1724
01:56:16,659 --> 01:56:18,454
Thanks for showing me the light.

1725
01:56:18,454 --> 01:56:19,800
Jakob?

1726
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,250
I'm gonna go clear the way.

1727
01:56:22,630 --> 01:56:24,667
Go get your son.

1728
01:56:24,667 --> 01:56:26,013
Jakob, don't!

1729
01:56:26,013 --> 01:56:28,084
- Don't!

1730
01:56:36,886 --> 01:56:38,370
Uncle Jakob!

1731
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:05,880
Looks like Uncle Muscle won't be
coming to the next barbecue.

1732
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,986
Oh.

1733
01:57:07,986 --> 01:57:09,608
I mean, it's very honorable.

1734
01:57:11,127 --> 01:57:13,336
Three miles away.
Take the service road.

1735
01:57:13,336 --> 01:57:15,062
It'll lead you
right to the airfield.

1736
01:57:26,487 --> 01:57:29,249
You know how to beat your dad
in a street race?

1737
01:57:36,704 --> 01:57:38,016
Take away the streets.

1738
01:57:38,016 --> 01:57:39,742
- Dad!

1739
01:57:45,644 --> 01:57:47,508
Amazing.

1740
01:57:47,508 --> 01:57:48,613
Oh.

1741
01:58:02,005 --> 01:58:04,491
We got it.
We got it.

1742
01:58:12,464 --> 01:58:13,465
My turn.

1743
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,389
He's good. Your dad's good.

1744
01:58:45,463 --> 01:58:47,154
Dom, you got one mile left.

1745
01:58:47,154 --> 01:58:50,192
Son, I never break a promise.

1746
01:58:50,192 --> 01:58:53,678
Now, let's finish
that driving lesson.

1747
01:58:53,678 --> 01:58:55,162
Feel the car,

1748
01:58:55,162 --> 01:58:57,026
find your line

1749
01:58:57,026 --> 01:58:58,441
and fly.

1750
01:59:19,669 --> 01:59:20,705
- Oh!

1751
01:59:34,995 --> 01:59:37,204
- Now!

1752
01:59:50,838 --> 01:59:51,908
No.

1753
01:59:54,014 --> 01:59:55,222
Take the service road now.

1754
02:00:03,472 --> 02:00:05,405
- I'm wheels down.
- We're headed to you now.

1755
02:00:05,405 --> 02:00:07,407
Your team is on their way.

1756
02:00:07,407 --> 02:00:09,132
I'll meet you at the airfield.

1757
02:00:09,132 --> 02:00:11,238
- You okay?
- I'm good, Dad.

1758
02:00:11,238 --> 02:00:13,551
I'm real proud of you, son.

1759
02:00:58,906 --> 02:01:01,254
Oh, Dommy boy.

1760
02:01:01,254 --> 02:01:03,152
It's so good to see you again.

1761
02:01:03,152 --> 02:01:05,672
Did you hit me with
a helicopter back there?

1762
02:01:05,672 --> 02:01:07,156
Hmm.

1763
02:01:07,156 --> 02:01:09,814
Ow, you big brute.
I mean, I get it.

1764
02:01:09,814 --> 02:01:12,230
You're showing off
in front of your son.

1765
02:01:12,230 --> 02:01:13,611
But honestly,
did you really think

1766
02:01:13,611 --> 02:01:16,614
it was going to be that easy?

1767
02:01:16,614 --> 02:01:19,030
You're exactly
where I wanted you to be.

1768
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:20,963
Yes.

1769
02:01:20,963 --> 02:01:22,792
Wait for it.

1770
02:01:22,792 --> 02:01:25,036
I got a surprise for you.

1771
02:01:31,732 --> 02:01:34,425
The cavalry's here.
We got you, Dom.

1772
02:01:35,667 --> 02:01:37,807
Roman, get out of here.
It's a trap.

1773
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:43,088
Incoming!

1774
02:01:58,241 --> 02:01:59,726
Yes!

1775
02:02:00,796 --> 02:02:03,419
See, that's the problem
with having a big family.

1776
02:02:06,974 --> 02:02:08,735
Can't protect 'em all.

1777
02:02:14,016 --> 02:02:15,293
Ooh!

1778
02:02:15,293 --> 02:02:17,640
Oh, Dominic,
is that your new friend?

1779
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,022
Aw.

1780
02:02:20,022 --> 02:02:21,679
You are so predictable.

1781
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:25,096
You think everyone's gonna
end up on your side?

1782
02:02:25,096 --> 02:02:28,341
Problem is Aimes was mine first.

1783
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:31,723
Now the work begins.

1784
02:02:31,723 --> 02:02:33,346
And in there,

1785
02:02:33,346 --> 02:02:36,349
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

1786
02:02:37,902 --> 02:02:38,972
Let's get started.

1787
02:02:48,395 --> 02:02:50,052
Well, looks like
our partnership's

1788
02:02:50,052 --> 02:02:52,399
off to a fantastic start.

1789
02:02:55,402 --> 02:02:58,163
You know, Dominic,
to become a real saint,

1790
02:02:58,163 --> 02:02:59,924
you have to perform miracles.

1791
02:02:59,924 --> 02:03:02,029
Or die a martyr.

1792
02:03:02,029 --> 02:03:04,135
So what's it gonna be?

1793
02:03:12,385 --> 02:03:16,216
I took your money,
I took your freedom,

1794
02:03:16,216 --> 02:03:18,183
and I'm gonna take your family.

1795
02:03:18,977 --> 02:03:20,393
And you're gonna die

1796
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:22,567
knowing that
you couldn't save your son.

1797
02:03:25,467 --> 02:03:27,434
Dad.

1798
02:03:27,434 --> 02:03:29,436
I have faith.

1799
02:03:36,961 --> 02:03:39,653
You made one mistake.

1800
02:03:40,516 --> 02:03:42,725
You never took my car.

1801
02:04:03,056 --> 02:04:04,126
Oh!

1802
02:06:02,624 --> 02:06:04,349
The suffering is over, Dom.

1803
02:06:09,769 --> 02:06:12,047
It's time for you to die.

1804
02:07:11,313 --> 02:07:13,384
No way.

1805
02:07:14,488 --> 02:07:16,145
