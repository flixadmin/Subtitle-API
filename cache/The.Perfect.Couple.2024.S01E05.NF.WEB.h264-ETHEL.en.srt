1
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,750
Good morning.

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,125
I'm sorry. I...

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:42,333
My parents are still asleep and I didn't
want to use the machine upstairs.

4
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,125
I'm going to get us a hotel today.

5
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,916
The first week of July?
Oh. That's impossible. Don't worry.

6
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,916
No, no, you must stay.

7
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,208
I don't think
a lot of mothers like to admit it,

8
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:05,250
but there is somehow a fear
when our sons get married

9
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,000
that we are being replaced,

10
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,708
and I don't think anyone wants to line up
for second place. Do you?

11
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,708
He thought that you walked on water.

12
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,333
But now,

13
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,375
you're tethered to terra firma
just like the rest of us.

14
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,958
Greer, where's Tag?

15
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,291
He had to spend the night
at the police station,

16
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,791
so they must have had a reason
to keep him there.

17
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:59,708
Which is unfortunate,
since today is my book launch.

18
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,166
What are you going to wear?

19
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,250
Uh...

20
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,541
I really don't think that Benji's going to
want to be in the same room as me.

21
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:11,458
Well, it's too late to cancel,
and everyone's going.

22
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,541
I, of course, don't want tongues wagging
about anything, but my book.

23
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,458
Okay.

Hmm.

Yeah.

00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,708

Anything.

34
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you know who Eric Carmen is?

35
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,291
Please don't laugh at me right now.

36
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,333
I'm trying to bridge
a very, very painful generational gap.

37
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,916
-No. Okay, of course, yeah. I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,416
He wrote a song that everyone
thinks is a Celine Dion song,

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,458
but it's not really a Celine Dion song.

40
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,958
It goes like this.

So did I do it?

00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,458
-Bridge the generational gap?
-I think you did.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,833
I did think it was Celine Dion, though.

00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,958
-You did?
-Yeah.

00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,375
Um, I can't.

58
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,375
You can't what?

59
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,375
What are you talking about?

60
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,833
I can't have this.

61
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,791
I can't have it.

62
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,166
Oh!

63
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,333
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

64
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,666
Yeah, "Oh, shit."

65
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,583
Oh... Oh...

66
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,833
Holy shit, sweetheart, are you pregnant?

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,708
I'm pregnant.

68
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,416
That's beautiful.

69
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,250
- Really?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,666
You are so beautiful.

71
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,750
I love you.

72
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,875
I love you.

73
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,666
I should probably get back.

74
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,291
-Yeah, of course. Yeah.
-Yeah.

75
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,666

What are you, the morality police now?

91
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,500
Just because we had a connection,

92
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,541
okay, doesn't mean I killed her.

93
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,375
-And how long did this connection go on?
-A couple of months.

94
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,583
She was, um...

95
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,833
She wanted more.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,416
But you know how those things are.

97
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,625
Why don't you tell us
how those things are?

98
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:55,416
Uh, Mr. Winbury, your kayak
was left out overnight down by the water,

99
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,291
but the staff tells me
that boat was your baby

100
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,458
and you never leave it out.

101
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,666
You spoke to my staff?

102
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,458
Typically, in a murder investigation,

103
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:08,750
we talk to anyone who's in a position
to help us, even <i>your</i> staff.

104
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:17,083
So, normally, you lock the kayak
in the boathouse, right?

105
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,750
Yes, normally I would,
but I had a lot going on that day.

106
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,250
Like what?
Like murdering your pregnant mistress?

107
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,583
Uh...

108
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,041
Well, for one,
my son was getting married the next day.

109
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,458
Anyone else have a key?

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,083
Pretty much every member of the staff.

111
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:42,541
Oh! So maybe someone on the staff
took Merritt out on your kayak,

112
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,583
dosed her with a barbiturate,

113
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,916
and then left her out there to drown?

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,291
I don't know. It's possible.

115
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,208
It sounds a little far-fetched to me,
then again, you are the police.

116
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,250
Well, you said it yourself,
she wanted more.

117
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,791
Look, I didn't take her out
on the boat, okay?

118
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,083
The last time I saw her,

119
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,833
she was under the tent
with Tom and Isabel. All right?

120
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,708
I have absolutely nothing
to hide from you.

121
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,375
That's why I haven't called my lawyer,

122
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,041
but if you insist
on this line of questioning, I will.

123
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:12,500
And you're not gonna want that,
because he's a very good attorney,

124
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,416
and, um, he also happens to be
one of the two or three people

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,541
who paid for the uniform
you're wearing right now.

126
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,625
Hmm.

127
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,625
"Under the tent with Isabel."
Would that happen to be Isabel Nallet?

128
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,125
Yes. She's a family friend.

129
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,208
Hmm.

130
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,291
You can ask her.

131
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,250
Uh, Merritt may have been
upset with me,

132
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,875
but she was very much alive
when I went to bed.

133
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,916
"Family friend"?

134
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,500
-Which side?
-Mine.

135
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,083
And how's your connection with her?

136
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,916
Thank you, Carl.

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,541
<i>Yes, thank you, Carl.</i>

138
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,291
I'm sure it will be
a delicious fucking cup of coffee.

139
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,583
-You want a donut with that?
-No donut.

140
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,750
If they have a problem
with me packing up her things,

141
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,125
then they can arrest me.

142
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,708
But they won't. Because I'm a white woman.

143
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,416
So gross.

144
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, I... I guess.

145
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,291
I thought you might want
some of this stuff.

146
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,208
Byredo Blanche. The literal best.

147
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

148
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,375
It's okay.

149
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,791
I can tell that you really loved her.

150
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,500
Sorry. It's just my friends are all like,

151
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,916
"What mommy-and-me music class
are you doing?"

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,666
And "Who's still wearing Golden Goose?"

153
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,250
I liked how you guys were just, like,

154
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,458
real.

155
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,625
Thank you.

156
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,041
I was looking forward
to being sisters-in-law, you know?

157
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,250
Maybe having an ally here.

158
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,666
So everyone knows?

159
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,416
Oh, I thought you'd be leaving today.

160
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,125
Yeah, me too.

161
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,916
But Greer wants me to go
to this book party thing.

162
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,166
What? Why?

163
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,000
I guess so no one will ask
why I'm not there.

164
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,291
Oh.

165
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,791
Okay. Makes sense, I guess.

166
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,916
No, you know what?

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,750
You should go. Wear something amazing.

168
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,791
Hold your head up high.
Show them they can't break you.

169
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,750
I'll be your wingwoman.

170
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,875
-Really?
-Yeah.

171
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,958
- Since I read <i>Nightfalls on Nantucket...</i>
- Yes.

172
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,041
...I just love looking forward
to your next book.

173
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,416
And I love knowing
what to get her for Christmas.

174
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,916
- Yeah. So true.
- Oh, I love you both.

175
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,625
-Greer, I am so sorry I'm late.
-Give me one second.

176
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,541
Oh, Enid.

177
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,166
-Where's your other half?
-Great turn out. He's not gonna make it.

178
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,708
-Everything all right?
-Yes, yes.

179
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,458
Greer, you remember Hyacinth?

180
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,791
-Hi, babe.
-And this is Brad.

181
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,875
It's such a big day.
Here's one for the socials.

182
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,708
-We'll do one for us as well.
-For Brad.

183
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,500
-I love it. That's so good.
-Yeah. Got that? Thank you.

184
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,583
So I'm going to announce
the new direction today.

185
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,708
I thought this could be Dash and Dolly's
going-away party.

186
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,500
Did you tell them? Last novel.

187
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,583
Mmm-hmm.

188
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,666
-Isn't that better?
-It's so much better.

189
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,041
Oh, my God. What's this?

190
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:35,166
I did text him to ask for a video message,
but I haven't heard back.

191
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,000
So I solved the problem.

192
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,708
-What do you think?
-No!

193
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,416
-Absolutely not. Why would you want...
-No. Terrible.

194
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,625
-Really?
-Cover it. Roger, honestly, I told you.

195
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,375
You just say he is out of commission
for the day. Keep it simple.

196
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,333
Okay.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,125
Hey.

198
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,333
Oh, hey!

199
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,458
I didn't know you were gonna...
You were going to be here.

200
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,541
Yeah.

201
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,541
Um...

202
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,208
Do you want to maybe hang out after this?
Want to have fun?

203
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,041
Um, I... I don't think I can, actually.

204
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,000
Because of the boat.

205
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,166
-I... I would. I'm just grounded.
-Totally. I get it. I'm sorry.

206
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,625
Okay.

207
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

208
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
We'll take one of those. Thank you.

209
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,166
Thank you.

210
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,875
Jesus. It looks like Lilly Pulitzer
projectile-vomited all over this place.

211
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,083
Who is gonna tell
the middle-aged men of the world

212
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,750
that they cannot wear shorts with loafers?
Is it going to have to be me?

213
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,833
You know, I'll deny I ever said this,
but I don't totally blame you.

214
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,708
Shooter's just so...

215
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,666
He's just so...

216
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,166
-rich.
-Interesting.

217
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,166
What?

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,083
"He's so rich"?

219
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,166
Oh!

220
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:06,791
Okay.

221
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,208
Well, at Deerfield, he had bodyguards.

222
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,666
He's, like, kidnap-rich.

223
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,250
He never mentioned that.

224
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, he plays it down.

225
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,708
People with that kind of money
don't talk about their money.

226
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:25,375
Plus, I've always gotten the sense
it was, like, Middle Eastern in some way.

227
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,291
No, he's from India.

228
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,375
Exactly.

229
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,708
Hi. Excuse me.

230
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,666
Aren't you people supposed to be able
to tell when someone's shining you on?

231
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,250
I'm telling you the truth.

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,500
What... We've known each other now,
what, ten, 15 years?

233
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,333
When you came here with, uh...

234
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,416
Chloe.

235
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,375
Right, with Chloe in 2014...

236
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,083
After her mother passed.

237
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,541
-Right.
-Hmm.

238
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,041
After that, yeah.

239
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,583
I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,916
-Congratulations! This is so amazing!
-Thank you. Yes.

241
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,041
-Look at you.
-You must be so proud.

242
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,833
I am. I am.

243
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,333
-That's great. Thank you.
-Oh!

244
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,291
In France, we don't let this kind of thing
get us down, you know?

245
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,875
Maybe you could get some
hot apology sex out of it.

246
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:42,000
Maybe, but we're not in France, and,
um, this really isn't helping. Thank you.

247
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm just saying,
don't let it derail your life.

248
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,000
An affair is just the heart's way
to check if it's still alive.

249
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,083
The heart...

250
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,416
Or the pussy.

251
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,625
Sometimes both.

252
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,666
This is interesting. Um...

253
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:03,291
That's good advice,
and I'll take it onboard. Thank you.

254
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,541
Why me?

255
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:21,666
<i>Um, again, we had a couple of glasses
of rum, a couple of cigars,</i>

256
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,083
and that's where it ended, under the tent.

257
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,750
That's the last I saw her.

258
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,333
And you went to bed at 1:30?

259
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,500
Or thereabouts.
I don't keep a fucking diary.

260
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,666
We are all tired, Mr. Winbury,

261
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,000
but we are trying to nail down
Miss Monaco's timeline.

262
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:43,166
The drugs hadn't been in her system
for very long before Miss Sacks found her,

263
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,916
but we know she stayed out late,

264
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,291
and we know you were
part of the late-night crew.

265
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,500
I never said I wasn't.

266
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:53,916
Drinking rum, perfect opportunity
for you to dose somebody's drink.

267
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,625
So,

268
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,666
if there's anything you haven't told us,

269
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,666
this would be the time.

270
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,875
No.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,916
Or you could just
let us do all the legwork

272
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,250
and eventually
we'll get to the truth anyway.

273
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,625
But even if you didn't do it,

274
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,583
you're still criminally liable
for not helping us find out who did.

275
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,416
Okay.

276
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,333
She really came at me.

277
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,791
So, I said, "Lady, I'm the one
who wrote the guest list,

278
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,708
and I promise you're not on it."

279
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,625
And then she was like,
"Well, check it again."

280
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:10,875
"It's 'Rockerfeller.'
R-O-C-K-E-R-F-E-L-L-E-R."

281
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:11,791
Idiot.

282
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,375
What an idiot!

283
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,125
I doubt she could spell it either.

284
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,833
-Oh, good night, guys.
-Good night.

285
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,250
Good night.

286
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,291
Anybody up for a paddle?

287
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,416
Perfect conditions for it.

288
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,916
No, thank you.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,250
Hmm.

290
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,583
Here.

291
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,416
Take this.

292
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,416
-You look cold.
-Thank you.

293
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,458
Gotta keep yourself warm.

294
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Don't wait for anybody else to do it.

295
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,375
Hey.

296
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,250
Hey.

297
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,916
-Are you seriously going out right now?
-Yeah.

298
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,875
Best time.
Look how glassy it is out there.

299
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,416
I need to talk to you.

300
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,541
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

301
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,333
What's up?

302
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,875
Are we really doing this?

303
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,250
-Are we doing this for real?
-Oh.

304
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,625
Hey.

305
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,416
You okay?

306
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,333
I need to know. You have to tell me.

307
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,333
Please.

308
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,291
-Tell you what?
-Just be honest.

309
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,083
I honestly adore you.

310
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,125
What's going on inside you right now is...

311
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,791
...one of the most beautiful things that
could happen between a man and a woman.

312
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,041
The thing is, for me, right now...

313
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,875
...it's a question of timing, you know?

314
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,500
No, I don't know. What do you mean?
What does that mean exactly?

315
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,416
Well, for one thing,
there are a couple of, uh...

316
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,625
pretty inconvenient truths
that I have to address,

317
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,458
and that might take a little time.

318
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,541
Okay.

319
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,958
How much time were you thinking?

320
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,375
Merritt, please don't do that.

321
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,666
-Don't do that. I'm asking you a question.
-Putting a number on it won't...

322
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,125
Yeah, there's a number on it
'cause the thing with babies...

323
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,250
-What are you doing?
-...is that in nine months, they arrive.

324
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,875
-So I'm just...
-Why are we doing this?

325
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,666
Look at... Look at this.

326
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,333
Uh...

327
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,500
It's such a beautiful night.

328
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,541
I'm not having a good night.

329
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,250
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,125
You want me to get rid of it?

331
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,583
-I... No, it's not...
-You do. You want me to get rid of it.

332
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,000
-You want... You want me to get rid of it?
-Honey... Stop.

333
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,666
- Why? Why?
- Come here.

334
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,250
No, no, no! No, no!

335
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,333
Hey.

336
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,125
-It's a conversation. If you just...
-You lied to me.

337
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,750
-I didn't...
-You lied to me!

338
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,541
-Yes, you did.
-What are you doing? Hey, come here.

339
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,125
-Don't...
-Come here! Stop!

340
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,916
-Don't touch me! No!
-Stop!

341
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,166
<i>Hello!</i>

342
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,291
<i>Hello?</i>

343
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,500
My watch.

344
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,875
My watch! My watch!

345
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,958
You said six o'clock, right?

346
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,208
<i>-What?
-The body was found at 6:00 a.m.</i>

347
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,333
<i>Thereabouts.</i>

348
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,875
<i>Look, uh...</i>

349
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,791
<i>I lied to you
about going to sleep at 1:30.</i>

350
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:16,791
Merritt and I had an...
Had an argument down by the beach

351
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,416
and I didn't want to tell...

352
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,375
She told me...

353
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,541
This doesn't lie.

354
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,250
This can prove without a shadow of a doubt
that I was in bed by 2:30.

355
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:33,666
That's almost four hours
before she was found,

356
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,666
and you said the drugs
hadn't been in her system that long.

357
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,125
This has an app.

358
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:43,041
It can track your heart rate,
your lung capacity, your sleep cycles.

359
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,125
It knows if you snore,
if your partner snores.

360
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:48,541
It knows if you so much as fucking fart
in your sleep.

361
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,625
Check it.

362
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:54,291
I've done some stupid things,
but, uh, I didn't kill her.

363
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,208
The data will be on my phone.

364
00:24:58,791 --> 00:24:59,791
Check it.

365
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,041
Come on in.

366
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:14,166
Please come in. Take the center.

367
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,500
-Oh!
-I know she hates it.

368
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,458
"Greer" on three. One, two, three!

369
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:19,541
-Greer!
-Greer!

370
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,166
Champagne?

371
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,208
-You need it.
-Oh! Yes, please.

372
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,458
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,041
You are beautiful.

374
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:37,416
What?

375
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,583
- Thank you.
- Objectively...

376
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,375
...you are beautiful.

377
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,958
But that's not why Greer hates you.

378
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,958
She hates you because you're real.

379
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,500
That's why she hates me too.

380
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,500
Because I say what I think.

381
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,875
I don't think Greer hates you.

382
00:25:56,958 --> 00:26:00,458
When people have spent their
whole lives caring about what others say,

383
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,166
they cannot stand to see someone...

384
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,208
They just can't stand to see someone...

385
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,625
Reminds them of their wasted life.

386
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,375
I... I am...

387
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,000
I really liked her.

388
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,708
Your friend.

389
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:26,833
Thank you.

390
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:29,500
Did you talk to her?

391
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,000
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

392
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,041
Hey, have you seen a phone anywhere?

393
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:39,916
I can't find my phone.

394
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,166
-Are you all right?
-No, I'm just having a day.

395
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,875
-Oh!
-Or, more of a life, actually.

396
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:52,166
I was going to have a nightcap,
but my date disappeared.

397
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,291
Do you want to join me?

398
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,500
Oh, no, thank you. Sorry, no.

399
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:57,541
Well, if you change your mind...

400
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,250
But she looked so upset.

401
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:02,541
She did?

402
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,791
-About what?
-What else?

403
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,291
<i>Amour.</i>

404
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,708
Ah!

405
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:11,750
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

406
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,250
I changed my mind.

407
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,291
I see.

408
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:22,583
I don't know
why I keep picking the wrong guy.

409
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,333
The heart wants what it wants.

410
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,083
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

411
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,958
Isn't that just something people say
to justify cheating?

412
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,416
You don't approve of cheating?

413
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,000
I...

414
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,708
Yeah, I guess I just

415
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:47,208
don't really consider it cheating
if it's more of an exit ramp.

416
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,750
Is that what he told you?

417
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,958
They never leave.

418
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,625
So you have to make the wife leave them.

419
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,333
One way or another.

420
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,416
Let's toast.

421
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,083
Hmm?

422
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,958
To the other woman.

423
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,166
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Shit! Oh, shit!

424
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,291
- Careful, don't...
- No...

425
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,500
Tomorrow is another day.

426
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,791
-Yeah.
<i>-Amour.</i>

427
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,250
Hey.

428
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,541
Oh, hey.

429
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,250
What the fuck do you want?

430
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,958
-What do I want?
-What are you doing here, man?

431
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,041
Your mom invited me.

432
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,625
Did she?

433
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Benji...

434
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,916
I'm sorry. Okay?

435
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,666
I don't expect you to say anything,
but I need you to know,

436
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,458
that kiss was the first time
anything like that happened.

437
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,000
- You're sorry?
- I want to be honest with you.

438
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,125
Okay.

439
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,041
Benji, you can't do that.

440
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:41,875
Do what?

441
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,166
You can't just hit someone here.
Your mom's going to kill you.

442
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,375
Why, are you jealous? You want to go?

443
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,666
-Come on, let's go. Wanna wrestle?
-Yeah, you want to wrestle me?

444
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,958
-You need to eat something.
-Come on, let's wrestle.

445
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,458
I fucking hate oysters.
Come on, let's wrestle.

446
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,041
-No, let's get out of here.
-What's wrong with you?

447
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,625
-Come on, just follow me.
-Why? Where are we going?

448
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,208
-You want to wrestle out there?
-Sure.

449
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,916
Come on. Come on. Come on.

450
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,291
Benji, what are you doing?

451
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,166
Oh, God. More oysters?

452
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,125
You need to calm down.
I need to take you home.

453
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:16,375
-I'm calm. It's fine. I don't want water.
-You need some water. Just... Okay.

454
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,250
What... What I need is this.

455
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,875
No, no, no! No more alcohol.

456
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,625
-Benji, no!
-You have some. You have some.

457
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,125
Okay. Mmm! Yum, yum, yum!

458
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,666
-Great, okay. Here, have some water.
-Oh, God, I'm fine.

459
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,583
Okay.

460
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,250
-There. Okay. Happy?
-Yeah. Great.

461
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,375
Look at you, huh.
You're caring about me now.

462
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,208
-I do care about you.
-It's so nice.

463
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,458
Yeah! Whoo!

464
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,875
-She cares about me!
-I'm so sorry.

465
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,208
-Don't apologize to him. Watch this.
-Sorry.

466
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,125
Watch, watch.

467
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,208
-I can take care of myself. Wait.
-Okay.

468
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,250
Oh, my God! Benji!

469
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

470
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,250
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, my God. Okay, Benji.

471
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,291
Okay. You're drunk.

472
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,708
- Yeah, no shit.
- Okay.

473
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,208
I'm gonna take you home now.

474
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,666
No, I don't want to go home.
I want to go out.

475
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,000
-That's not a good idea.
-Let's go out and party, just you and me.

476
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:09,708
Oh, that's right, I remember,
you don't want to party with me anymore.

477
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,250
You just want to go
and fuck somebody else.

478
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,666
It's fine. It's okay.

479

-It's none of my business.

What is it about?

482
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,250
Show me what it's about.

483
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,375
-Show me what you want.
-Benji...

00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,750
I think he's telling the truth,
which is weird,

634
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,583
because even when he tells the truth,
he looks like he's lying, but...

635
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:45,416
Wait, hold on.

636
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,333
Hold on. Look. All these other nights,

637
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:50,291
look, there's two sleepers,
two sets of breathing,

638
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,541
but on that night,

639
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:55,791
there's only one sleeper
from, like, 3:00 a.m. to 4:30.

640
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,291
So there's no one else in the room
for, like, an hour-and-a-half.

641
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Hey.

642
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,208
Hey.

643
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,458
Hey, can we talk?

644
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,375
Sure.

645
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:29,041
-I just want to make sure you're okay.
-I'm fine.

646
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,125
-You told me you didn't have any money.
-I didn't say that.

647
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,958
I said I didn't care about money.

648
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,208
And I don't. I never think about it.

649
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,666
Well, it's a lot easier to say
when you've always had it.

650
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,458
You're just like the rest of them.

651
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,291
No one around here tells the truth.
They're all lying.

652
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:54,375
All the time.

653
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,166
Amelia, I would have told you...

654
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,208
You let me think that we were the same.

655
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:01,916
But we're not.

656
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,750
Not at all.

657
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,083
I'm sorry.
Why are you so upset about this?

658
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,875
I had sex with Benji.

659
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
At the party.

660
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,375
He was drunk, but I wasn't.

661
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,000
So now you know.

662
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,666
I'm just as messed up as everyone else.

663
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,083
So, good.

664
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:59,875
Good we realized this was impossible
before we did anything else stupid.

665
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,083
And hurt anyone more than we already have.

666
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,500
Glad that's settled.

667
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:31,458
Hey, Dan.

668
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,375
Second time in two days.

669
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,666
Becoming a regular.

670
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:43,750
I thought you'd be here.

671
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,583
-I would've never guessed whiskey.
-No?

672
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:52,958
Then you're not a very good detective,
are you?

673
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,666
The Mayor and the Chamber of Commerce
would agree with you.

674
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,916
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Joe.

675
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
What's that?

676
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,750
Dark 'N' Stormy.

677
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,875
I did not name it, but it is very good.

678
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:09,958
Joe?

679
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:11,750
Coming right up.

680
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:12,791
Oh!

681
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:16,083
Okay, Detective Henry.

682
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,875
You're gonna have to admit
you like me a little bit more after this.

683
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,750
You know that 3:08 a.m. call

684
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,416
to the Sand Dollar hotel
from Greer's office line

685
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,416
-the night of the murder?
-Yes. Yes!

686
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,666
Broderick Graham.

687
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,583
Graham?

688
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,541
{\an8}Isn't that that guy they had to
kick out from Greer's book party?

689
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,833
-So she knew him?
-Looks like it.

690
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:37,833
And we did a background check.

691
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,375
He's a pretty tough customer.

692
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,041
Huh.

693
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,250
-What?
-What do you think?

694
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,750
-What do I think?
-Yeah. You like me any better now?

695
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,875
See? I'm growing on you.

696
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:59,125
-Oh, no, what happened?
-You had to ruin it.

697
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:01,208
Oh, it was so good, and then...

698
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,083
I could help you.

699
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,666
I'm very good with motive.

700
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,416
I need to get my mind off everything.
I've had a hell of a day.

701
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,791
Please?

702
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,208
Okay, uh, I'll play. Um...

703
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,250
Isabel Nallet.

704
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,250
Ah! Oh, she's been in love with my husband
for years.

705
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,625
She, um, finds out
that he's sleeping with Merritt

706
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,125
and decides to eliminate the competition.

707
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,833
Well, okay. That's an easy one.

708
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,708
How about you?

709
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,750
I would say what makes it so obvious
is what makes it so unlikely.

710
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:45,916
Yeah, well. But maybe that's your cover,
you know, hiding in plain sight.

711
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,833
Mmm. Mmm!

712
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,000
That'd be a good one.

713
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,333
Uh-huh.

714
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,166
Having a drink with me right now,
offering to help.

715
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,500
I mean, who would do that
if they were guilty?

716
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:58,291
It would take a very good liar.

717
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:01,458
-Well, you do write fiction.
-One Dark 'N' Stormy.

718
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:08,250
I see. But even the best of liars
get very tired juggling too much.

719
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:12,166
Or it gets too overwhelming,
and they... snap.

720
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:16,875
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

721
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,041
That's good.

722
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,791
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

723
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:46,791
Carter.

724
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,166
Hello? Chief, are you there?

725
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,958
-You're on speakerphone with me and Carl.
-Hey, Chief.

726
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,583
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Okay.

727
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:55,791
Um...

728
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:58,625
Get this. The night Merritt died,

729
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,375
Greer was on the phone
with someone at the Sand Dollar

730
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,250
about a half-hour
before our estimated time of death.

731
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,958
Who?

732
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:10,250
Well, the guest is a guy
named Broderick Graham,

733
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:12,833
and he flew in from London that day.

734
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,250
-It gets better, Chief.
<i>-Okay.</i>

735
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:20,000
So, it turns out
that Graham is some low-level errand boy

736
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,333
for a gang with ties to the Turkish mafia.

737
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:26,083
Yeah, he got tattoos, and he looks
like some kind of British Scarface.

738
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,083
So this gang,

739
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:32,833
they run heroin out of Mumbai,
they dabble in the arms trade,

740
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:36,333
<i>and Graham's been calling the house
ever since the night Merritt died.</i>

741
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:37,291
<i>He won't stop.</i>

742
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:39,833
<i>- He's called nine times since that night.</i>
<i>- Nine times!</i>

743
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:44,250
- Okay.
<i>- But this is the best part.</i>

744
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:49,041
We found a record
of a wire transfer for $300,000

745
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,458
to Broderick Graham from...

746
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:53,416
Drumroll, Carl.

747
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,250
...Shooter Dival.

748
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,416
Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,666
Mmm-hmm.

750
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,208
Right.

751
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:05,583
Fuck!

752
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:18,583
Oh!

753
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:20,416
Hi.
