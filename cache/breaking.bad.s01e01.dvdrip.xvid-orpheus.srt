1
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,427
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

2
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,492
I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

3
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,118
Albuquerque, New Mexico,
87104.

4
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:25,584
To all law enforcement entitles,
this is not an admission of guilt.

5
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,384
I am speaking
to my family now.

6
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:36,792
Skyler...

7
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,464
you are the love
of my life.

8
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:41,646
I hope you know that.

9
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:44,892
Walter, Junior...

10
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:47,008
you're my big man.

11
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,347
There are...

12
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,420
There are going
to be some...

13
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,461
things... things...

14
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:57,292
that you'll come to learn
about me in the next few days.

15
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,340
I just want you to know

16
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,316
that no... no matter
how it may look,

17
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,868
I only had you in my heart.

18
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,616
Good-bye.

19
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,905
Happy Birthday.

20
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:21,546
Look at that.

21
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:24,491
That is veggie bacon.

22
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,049
Believe it or not.
Zero cholesterol.

23
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,452
You won't even taste
the difference.

24
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:32,286
What time do you think
you'll be home?

25
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,354
Same time.

26
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:35,709
I don't want him dicking
you around tonight.

27
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:38,887
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5, no later.

28
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:41,910
Hey.

29
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,237
- Happy Birthday.
- Well, thank you.

30
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,225
You're late... again.

31
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:50,229
There was no
hot water... again.

32
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,052
I have an easy fix
for that.

33
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:53,658
You wake up early,

34
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:56,683
and then you get to be
the first person in the shower.

35
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,325
I have an idea.

36
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:04,064
How about buy
a new hot water heater?

37
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:05,512
How's that idea?

38
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:08,303
For the millionth
and billionth time.

39
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,559
- Did you take your Echinacea?
- Yeah.

40
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,434
I think it's getting better.

41
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,527
What the hell is this?

42
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:22,508
It's veggie bacon.
We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.

43
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:24,515
Not me.
I want real bacon.

44
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,312
Not this fake crap.

45
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:27,467
Too bad.

46
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:28,616
Eat it.

47
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:32,916
This smells
like Band-aids.

48
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,020
Eat... it.

49
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:42,287
So, how's it feel
to be old?

50
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,899
How does it feel
to be a smart ass?

51
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,229
Good.

52
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:49,969
Eat your veggie bacon.

53
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,731
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

54
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,384
- All right, see you at home.
- Okay, see you.

55
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:18,783
Chemistry.

56
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,987
It is the study of what?

57
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:24,552
Anyone?

58
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:27,106
Ben.

59
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:30,061
- Chemicals.
- Chemicals!

60
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:31,759
No!

61
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,897
Chemistry is...

62
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,189
Well, technically,

63
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:39,944
chemistry is
the study of matter.

64
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:44,210
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

65
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:46,613
Now just...
just think about this.

66
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:47,991
Electrons.

67
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:49,699
They...

68
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:52,502
change their energy levels.

69
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:53,694
Molecules.

70
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,887
Molecules change
their bonds.

71
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:58,916
Elements.

72
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:02,717
They combine
and change into compounds.

73
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,258
Well, that's...
that's all of life.

74
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,765
Right? I mean, it's just...
It's the constant.

75
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:11,287
It's the cycle.
It's solution,

76
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,276
dissolution, just over
and over and over.

77
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,306
It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

78
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:24,189
It is fascinating, really.

79
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,396
Chad...

80
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:35,638
Is there something
wrong with your table?

81
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,331
Okay.
Ionic bonds...

82
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,403
Are you done?

83
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,372
Ionic bonds.

84
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:56,989
Chapter 6.

85
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,734
And 2, 3 makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

86
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,175
Here's your receipt,

87
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,558
and hand this claiming disc
to your car wash professional.

88
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:18,364
Thank you.
Come again.

89
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,294
He's not coming.

90
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,775
He said he quits.

91
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,556
I'm gonna run
the register.

92
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:38,170
Bogdan, no.
We talked about this.

93
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,773
I'm shorthanded, Walter.

94
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,177
What am I to do?

95
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:44,641
Walter?

96
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,024
What am I to do?

97
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:10,801
Hey, Mr. White!

98
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,277
Make those tires
shine, huh?

99
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,590
Oh, my God.

100
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:19,026
You would not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

101
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,407
Mr. White...

102
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,203
from Chemistry.

103
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:43,144
Surprise!

104
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:45,866
Happy Birthday, Dad!

105
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:52,076
You're so very late.

106
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,145
Really, I'm serious,
Skyler.

107
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,680
I mean, you're flat
as a washboard.

108
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,845
You look awesome.

109
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,851
She's not showing
at all, is she?

110
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:03,350
She's showing
a little.

111
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,126
Carmen, this is
my sister Marie.

112
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,646
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

113
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,728
Glock 22.
It's my daily carry, okay?

114
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,831
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, plus, B-plus loads,

115
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,756
you can forget
the 9-mil, all right?

116
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,736
I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

117
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,645
Yeah, the way you shoot.

118
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,785
If you're gonna
bring a gun,

119
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,481
you gotta bring
enough gun.

120
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:29,727
.40 caliber.

121
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:33,796
- This is awesome right here.
- Nice, isn't it?

122
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:35,856
Dad, come check
this out.

123
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:38,112
- Yeah, I see it.
- Come on, take it.

124
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:39,715
Check it out, Walt.

125
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,221
No, no,
it's just heavy.

126
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,040
That's why they hire men.

127
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:47,990
It's not gonna
bite you, all right?

128
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:51,755
Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

129
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:55,518
Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up,
listen up, listen up!

130
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:56,812
I'm gonna give a toast.

131
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:59,335
A little toast to my brother-in-law.
Come here.

132
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:03,424
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin,

133
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:06,501
but we're not gonna
hold that against you.

134
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,729
Because your heart's
in the right place, man.

135
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,178
Your heart's
in the right place.

136
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,629
We love you, man.
We love you.

137
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,222
Everybody!
To Walt!

138
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:14,165
Na zdorovje!

139
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,479
Na zdorovje!

140
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,808
Hey,
turn on Channel 3.

141
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:26,327
At which point we apprehended
three individuals

142
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:28,043
and placed them into custody.

143
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,306
I'm proud to say
the outstanding

144
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,393
professionalism
of my fellow agents

145
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,278
at the Albuquerque
District Office

146
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,102
resulted in
a substantial amount

147
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,540
of methamphetamine
being taken off the streets.

148
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:39,915
Were any shots fired?

149
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,563
No, ma'am. Our agents took
the suspects by surprise.

150
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,220
Damn, the TV does
add ten pounds.

151
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,940
Ten pounds?

152
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:49,448
Hey, sit and spin.
Both of you.

153
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,112
- Hank.
- What?

154
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,300
Sorry.
You didn't see that.

155
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,053
So charming.

156
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:58,166
This is clearly
an ongoing operation,

157
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,397
one which was
well organized...

158
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,902
Hank, how much
money is that?

159
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,254
It's about 700 grand.
That's a pretty good haul, huh?

160
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:07,418
As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque

161
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:10,410
when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

162
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:13,642
But that's unusual,
isn't it, that kind of cash?

163
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:15,957
Well, it's not the most
we ever took.

164
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:17,294
It's easy money...

165
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:18,944
until we catch you.

166
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,283
Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

167
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,593
You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

168
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:26,752
Get a little excitement
in your life.

169
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,014
Well, someday.

170
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:40,778
Which one's this?

171
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:42,816
That faux-Lalique vase

172
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,840
I picked up
at the Super-Swap.

173
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:51,600
How's it doing?

174
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,140
I met my reserve,

175
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:55,226
and there's still
two minutes.

176
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:04,664
What's up?

177
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,709
You tell me,
birthday boy.

178
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:12,704
Oh, hey, so what's up
for Saturday?

179
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,803
Car wash.

180
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,457
Bogdan says
he needs me.

181
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,530
Until what time?
Noon? 1-ish?

182
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,428
Probably 2,
more like it.

183
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:23,003
And then what
after that?

184
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:26,132
Actually...

185
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,217
I was thinking
of driving

186
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,039
up to Los Alamos.

187
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:34,139
The visitor center
has an exhibit on...

188
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:35,827
It's really supposed
to be...

189
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,359
- You're not gonna paint?
- I'll paint.

190
00:14:39,237 --> 00:14:41,078
It's just that this...

191
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,829
part of this exhibition on the...

192
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:46,253
Mars Rover
photographs are...

193
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:50,707
The detail really is just
supposed to be amazing.

194
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:53,211
It's just that I really need you
to paint at some point.

195
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:56,401
I mean, the sooner that
back bedroom gets finished.

196
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,258
And I'd do it myself, except
you said you don't want me

197
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,267
- Standing on the stepladder.
- I'll paint. I will paint.

198
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,559
What is going on
down there?

199
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:10,289
- No, it's just...
- Is he asleep?

200
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,157
No, It's nothing.
You know, just...

201
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,605
You know,

202
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:17,889
we gotta be careful
about the baby.

203
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,895
Don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

204
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,397
We are just
doing you tonight.

205
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:27,437
So just close your eyes.

206
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,544
Relax, and let it...

207
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,821
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

208
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:43,142
There you go.

209
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:44,936
That's it.

210
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,007
That's it.

211
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,865
There you go.

212
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:52,255
Keep it going.

213
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,512
Keep it going.

214
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,489
Keep it going.

215
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,282
Keep... Yes!

216
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:02,622
56!

217
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,782
This is so embarrassing.

218
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,484
I am fine. Honestly.

219
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,231
It's just some bug
going around.

220
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:02,921
First my wife had it,
then my son, and now me.

221
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:06,472
It's just like
a chest cold.

222
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:09,235
Could be some
low blood sugar as well.

223
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,233
I didn't have the greatest
breakfast this morning, honestly.

224
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:15,503
Hey, listen, can you do me a favor?
Can you just...

225
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,880
drop me off
at a corner somewhere?

226
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:20,626
No. Sorry.

227
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,264
It's just that I don't have
the greatest insurance.

228
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:26,520
Take a couple
of deep breaths for me.

229
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:35,306
Is there anybody you want us
to contact for you?

230
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:36,588
God, no.

231
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,105
Lean forward for me,
would you?

232
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,079
Mr. White,
are you a smoker?

233
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:45,825
No. Never.

234
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:49,750
Why do you ask?

235
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:31,454
Mr. White.

236
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,310
Mr. White?

237
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:36,980
Yes.

238
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,148
You understood what
I've just said to you?

239
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:42,259
Yes.

240
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,871
Lung cancer.
Inoperable.

241
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:48,647
I'm sorry...

242
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,971
I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

243
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,065
Best-case scenario,
with chemo,

244
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,796
I'll live maybe
another couple years.

245
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:01,461
It's just...

246
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:04,890
you've got mustard
on your...

247
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:08,856
Right there.
Mustard, there.

248
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:10,255
Right there.

249
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,990
So my records show
that I paid it,

250
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,403
and I certainly don't
feel that we owe any late...

251
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,086
All right.

252
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,799
Well, I'll check
with the bank

253
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,621
and maybe the post office,

254
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,421
if they lost it or something.

255
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,504
Yeah, let me look
into that.

256
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,459
Okay.

257
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:38,055
Thank you.

258
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,391
Did you use
the MasterCard last month?

259
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,333
15.88 at Staples?

260
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,183
We needed printer paper.

261
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:04,200
Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

262
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:07,337
Okay.

263
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:10,989
So how was your day?

264
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:14,141
Oh, I don't know.

265
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:17,533
I don't know.
It was, um...

266
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:21,126
It was fine.

267
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,764
Come on. I'm shorthanded.
I need you to do some wipe-downs.

268
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,034
- Come on.
- What?

269
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:00,306
I said I need you outside
to do some wipe-downs.

270
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,715
Are you here to work
or to be staring at the skies?

271
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:04,182
Come on, let's go.

272
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:07,423
Come on, man.

273
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:10,497
- Fuck you, Bogdan.
- What?

274
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:12,379
I said fuck you!

275
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,064
And your eyebrows!

276
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:19,436
Wipe down this!

277
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,523
Uh, Hank.

278
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,665
Hank, it's Walt.
Hey.

279
00:22:25,196 --> 00:22:27,384
Oh, listen...
I didn't wake you, did I?

280
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:29,265
Oh, good, good.

281
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:32,969
No, no, nothing's wrong.
I just, uh...

282
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:36,819
I've been, uh, thinking
about that offer...

283
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,188
that ride-along.

284
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,851
It's the last house
on the right. See it?

285
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:44,677
Not the two-story one.
The one next to it.

286
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,696
The kind of... I don't know,
what do you call that?

287
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,513
- Green?
- Sage.

288
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:51,798
Sage.

289
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:54,456
What, do you work at
the fucking Pottery Barn?

290
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:56,542
Sage.
That's the word for it.

291
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,791
My fault the only word
your dumb ass knows is green?

292
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,035
Cheese dick.

293
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,208
I know that one.
How 'bout that?

294
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:06,087
Anyway, it's the sage one.
See it?

295
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:09,915
So what tells you
it's a meth lab?

296
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:12,737
Star snitch says
some dude

297
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:15,869
goes by Cap'n Cook
lives up to his name in there.

298
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:19,182
Says he always adds
a dash of chili powder.

299
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,507
Ah, you exuberant
Mexicans.

300
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:25,513
Captain Cook,
that's a white boy's name.

301
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:26,960
Dopey as hell, too.

302
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:28,750
Yeah?
Tell you what.

303
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,633
I got 20 bucks that
says he's a beaner.

304
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:33,445
- All right.
- You're on.

305
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,437
All right,
come on, come on.

306
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:44,542
All right. School bus is clear.
Got the green light.

307
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:45,545
Copy that.

308
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:56,115
Watch this.
This makes 'em shit.

309
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:02,026
Go, go, go.

310
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:13,326
Meth labs are nasty
on a good day.

311
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:15,722
You mix that wrong,
you got mustard gas.

312
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,325
Phosphine gas.

313
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:19,654
I think.

314
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:20,970
Yeah, exactly.

315
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:23,921
One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

316
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,025
House is clear.
One suspect in custody.

317
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,356
Copy that.

318
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:19,838
The suspect, might he be
of the Latino persuasion?

319
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:22,629
Driver's license says
Emilio Koyama.

320
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:24,030
Asian!

321
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:25,285
Pay up, sucker.

322
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,223
First name Emilio.

323
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:29,117
That's at least half
a beaner.

324
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,175
Tell you what,
I'll let you off for a 10.

325
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:36,056
Cheer up, Gomey.
You people still got J. Lo.

326
00:25:36,093 --> 00:25:39,705
Hank, do you think
I might get to go inside?

327
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:41,563
See the actual lab?

328
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,394
Yeah. Yeah,
I tell you what,

329
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,170
we're gonna go
peek our heads in,

330
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,818
check it out first.

331
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:53,012
Stay here a minute.

332
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,396
God.

333
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,882
Oh, my God.

334
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:38,045
Pinkman?

335
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,733
It's me.

336
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:38,137
I'm alone.

337
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,210
How'd you find me?

338
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:48,831
You're still
in our filing system.

339
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:54,374
So your aunt
owns this place, right?

340
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:56,298
I own it.

341
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:01,452
No one's looking for you.

342
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:03,064
Why are you here?

343
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:05,139
I was curious.

344
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,698
Honestly,
I never expected you

345
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:10,527
to amount to much,
but methamphetamine?

346
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,913
I didn't picture that.

347
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,410
There's a lot of money
in it, huh?

348
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,169
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:28:20,185 --> 00:28:22,001
- No?
- Not a clue.

350
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:26,307
Cap'n Cook?

351
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,803
That's not you?

352
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:37,075
Like I said,
no one is looking for you.

353
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:40,916
Look, I don't know what you think
you're doing here, Mr. White.

354
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,347
I mean, if you're planning
on giving me some bowl winder

355
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:47,300
about getting right with Jesus
by turning myself in...

356
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,029
- Not really.
- High school was a long time ago.

357
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:52,971
You ain't Welcome Back Kotter,
so step off.

358
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:54,429
No speeches.

359
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:56,107
Short speech.

360
00:28:57,057 --> 00:28:59,847
You lost your partner today.
What's his name?

361
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:02,190
Emilio?

362
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,696
Emilio is going to prison.

363
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:10,689
The DEA took all your money,
your lab.

364
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:13,732
You got nothing.

365
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,239
Square 1.

366
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:18,427
But you know
the business.

367
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,407
And I know the chemistry.

368
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:26,353
I'm thinking...

369
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:29,356
maybe you and I
could partner up.

370
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,418
You want to cook crystal meth?

371
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:47,726
You?

372
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:50,879
You and, uh... and me?

373
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,100
That's right.

374
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:57,523
Either that...

375
00:29:58,469 --> 00:29:59,976
or I turn you in.

376
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:12,863
What the hell is this?

377
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:14,183
Damned if I know.

378
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,467
I described it
as mosaic folk art.

379
00:30:16,536 --> 00:30:18,959
- Somebody bought it?
- Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

380
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,510
$14.00 plus shipping.

381
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:21,305
Yes!

382
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:24,624
At this rate, in 50 or 60 years,
you'll be rich.

383
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:27,199
So how goes the novel?

384
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,573
It's not a novel,
actually, which I have...

385
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:32,278
You're not writing a novel?
You told me you were.

386
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:33,764
No. Short stories.

387
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:36,399
I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones

388
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,275
that maybe I'll try and...

389
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,008
publish another collection.

390
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,847
Those really didn't sell.

391
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:47,565
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

392
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:49,429
Yeah, well, maybe so.

393
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:54,892
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

394
00:30:56,214 --> 00:30:57,050
No.

395
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:02,240
I mean, I'm not at
that stage where I...

396
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:04,527
No.

397
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,347
Open offer.

398
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,644
So what's up
with Walt lately?

399
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:11,554
What do you mean?
He's fine.

400
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:14,533
He just seems,
I don't know...

401
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:16,271
quieter than usual.

402
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,244
Turning 50
is a big deal.

403
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:21,647
I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

404
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:26,020
You're gonna be
a complete basket case.

405
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,510
So it's mid-life crisis.

406
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,555
No, he's just quiet.

407
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:37,653
- How's the sex?
- Marie, Jesus.

408
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:41,253
Guess that answers that.

409
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:25,379
You just gonna sit there?

410
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:34,663
This.
Look at this.

411
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:38,198
Kjeldahl-style
recovery flask,

412
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,489
800 milliliters.
Very rare.

413
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,662
You got your usual
paraphernalia:

414
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:44,960
Griffin beakers,
your Erlenmeyer flask.

415
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,134
But the pièce de résistance:

416
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:51,516
a round bottom boiling flask.
5,000 milliliters.

417
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,038
Well, I cook in one of those.

418
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:58,456
The big one.

419
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:00,742
One of these?

420
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:04,509
No, this is a volumetric flask.
You wouldn't cook in one of these.

421
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,258
Yeah, I do.

422
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:07,931
No, you don't.

423
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:11,799
A volumetric flask is
for general mixing and titration.

424
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:15,141
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

425
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:17,453
That's what
a boiling flask is for.

426
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:19,710
Did you learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

427
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:22,854
No. You flunked me.

428
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,028
- Remember?
- No wonder.

429
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,940
Prick.

430
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:29,931
Now let me tell you something else.
This ain't chemistry,

431
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:31,587
this is art.

432
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,911
Cooking is art.

433
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,152
And the shit I cook is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

434
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:39,343
The shit you cook is shit.

435
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,963
I saw your setup.
Ridiculous.

436
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:44,529
You and I
will not make garbage.

437
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:46,795
We will produce
a chemically pure

438
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:49,124
and stable product
that performs as advertised.

439
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:51,732
No adulterants. No baby formula.
No chili powder.

440
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,860
No, no, chili P
is my signature.

441
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,129
Not anymore.

442
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:58,617
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

443
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:02,129
- What the hell is this?
- Lab safety equipment.

444
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:05,287
We're also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

445
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:08,638
These chemicals
and their fumes are toxic,

446
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,348
in case you didn't know that.

447
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:13,094
Well, you can dress up
like a faggot if you want.

448
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:14,173
Not me.

449
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:22,805
Listen, this stuff doesn't
stay more than a day.

450
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,726
What? I thought
we were gonna cook here.

451
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:27,391
No, we're not
gonna cook here.

452
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:30,228
Okay, this is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

453
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,385
Well, then, where
are we gonna work?

454
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,674
You tell me.

455
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,061
This is your deal.

456
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:37,905
You want to smoke it up,
smoke it up at your house.

457
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:39,791
Nah, I didn't think so.

458
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,059
Oh, well.

459
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:44,019
Well...

460
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,281
what if we rented one
of those self-storage places,

461
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,101
you know, those little orange garages,
worked out of there?

462
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:51,946
No.

463
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:55,440
They're on to that.
They got dogs that sniff around.

464
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:59,515
RV. That's what you want.

465
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:02,409
What, like a Winnebago?

466
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:05,394
Yeah.

467
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,899
I know a dude
who wants to sell his.

468
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:12,086
He just goes camping with it.

469
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:14,167
But a mobile meth lab?

470
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:16,107
That'd be the bomb.
I mean,

471
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:18,204
drive way out
in the boonies.

472
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,425
Be all evasive.

473
00:35:49,758 --> 00:35:52,740
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.
My guy wants 85.

474
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:55,379
This is all the money
I have in the world.

475
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:58,380
You're a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

476
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:02,745
You are not how
I remember you from class,

477
00:36:02,747 --> 00:36:04,384
I mean, like, not at all.

478
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:07,250
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait. Hold on.

479
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:10,627
Tell me why
you're doing this.

480
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,062
Seriously.

481
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:13,691
Why do you do it?

482
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:15,721
Money, mainly.

483
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:20,060
- There you go.
- Nah, come on!

484
00:36:20,372 --> 00:36:23,798
Man, some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass,

485
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:25,548
all of a sudden
at age, what, 60,

486
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:27,341
he's just gonna break bad?

487
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:30,074
- I'm 50.
- It's weird is all, okay?

488
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,015
It doesn't compute.
Listen...

489
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:34,896
if you've gone crazy
or something...

490
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,619
I mean, if you've...
if you've gone crazy

491
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,374
or depressed,
I'm just saying...

492
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,806
that's something
I need to know about.

493
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:47,370
Okay?
I mean, that affects me.

494
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:54,233
I am awake.

495
00:36:59,111 --> 00:36:59,992
What?

496
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,242
Buy the RV.

497
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,424
We start tomorrow.

498
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:16,258
How's it coming
in there?

499
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:17,834
Fine.

500
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:27,658
Do you want me
or your dad?

501
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:30,880
Dad.

502
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:49,962
So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

503
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:52,624
'Cause you don't want to get 'em
if they're too tight.

504
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,831
They're pre-shrunk.

505
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:58,678
Are you sure you don't want
to get a different kind.

506
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,699
Like, you know,
the skinny jeans?

507
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,721
Those are really supposed
to be in style now.

508
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,061
The skaters wear them.

509
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:05,788
Do I look like a skater?

510
00:38:06,055 --> 00:38:07,235
All right.

511
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,473
Mom, look at
my big-boy pants.

512
00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:14,928
Mommy, could you
zip up my big-boy pants?

513
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:24,053
- Don't.
- What?

514
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:26,498
Don't.

515
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:27,494
Walt.

516
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,903
- Where...
- I have no idea.

517
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,008
You know what?
Don't even look at them.

518
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,151
They're obviously
very stupid.

519
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:40,177
Yep.

520
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:43,847
I think that, um...

521
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,800
I think those jeans
look really good on you.

522
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:48,410
You should get 'em
if you like 'em, okay?

523
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,375
Why don't you just hang out
here for a second?

524
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:51,828
I'll be right back.

525
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:52,772
Fine.

526
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,939
Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand-new big-boy pants.

527
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:06,660
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong, chief?

528
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,607
Having a little trouble
walking?

529
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:10,626
Get off me.
Get off me!

530
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:15,619
I'll mess you up, man.

531
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:18,706
Well, you'll have one shot.
You better make it good.

532
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,942
What, are you waiting
for your girlfriends?

533
00:39:20,952 --> 00:39:22,543
You better go. Take it.

534
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,275
Take your shot.
Take it!

535
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:27,317
Come on. Come on.

536
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,890
- Come on, let's get outta here.
- Let's go.

537
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:32,907
Psycho.

538
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,065
Yeah,
nothing but cows!

539
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:16,312
Got some big cow house
way out that way, like 2 miles,

540
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:18,442
but I don't see nobody.

541
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:20,516
Cow house?

542
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,970
Yeah, where they live.

543
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,179
The cows.

544
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,541
Whatever, man.

545
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:29,693
Yeah, let's cook here.

546
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:33,555
Cow house.

547
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:35,811
God help me.

548
00:40:47,817 --> 00:40:49,414
What are you doing?

549
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:51,446
These are my good clothes.

550
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:54,794
I can't go home smelling
like a meth lab.

551
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,211
Yeah, you can.
I do.

552
00:40:58,593 --> 00:40:59,683
Those?

553
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,949
Those, uh...
You're keeping those on, right?

554
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:12,833
Come on.

555
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,703
Daylight's burning.

556
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:16,088
Oh, my God.

557
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,771
Oh, this is, uh...
this is a good look for you.

558
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,597
And you're maybe only the world's
second biggest homo.

559
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,820
Would you shut up
and help me?

560
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,428
Oh, yeah.

561
00:41:35,114 --> 00:41:36,565
Oh, yeah, work it.

562
00:41:36,866 --> 00:41:38,328
Baby, work it.

563
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:40,765
Turn that off!

564
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,404
This is glass grade.

565
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,140
I mean, you got...

566
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:55,931
Jesus, you got crystals in here
2 inches, 3 inches long.

567
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:58,126
This is pure glass.

568
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:01,588
You're a damn artist.

569
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,788
This is art,
Mr. White.

570
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,019
Actually, it's just
basic chemistry,

571
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:10,417
but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

572
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:13,506
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

573
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,572
Every jibbhead from here to Timbuktu
is going to want a taste.

574
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:19,819
Now I gotta...
I gotta try this.

575
00:43:20,103 --> 00:43:21,737
No. No.

576
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:25,806
No, we only sell it.
We don't use it.

577
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,360
Okay, since when?

578
00:43:29,337 --> 00:43:32,034
Listen, you've been watching
way too much Miami Vice.

579
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:33,793
That ain't happening.

580
00:43:37,149 --> 00:43:39,537
So... what now?

581
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:43,176
How do we proceed?

582
00:43:47,132 --> 00:43:48,894
We cook more tomorrow.

583
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:51,618
Meantime...

584
00:43:52,603 --> 00:43:54,400
I know just the guy to talk to.

585
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:07,630
Kraze, how you doing,
my man?

586
00:44:11,346 --> 00:44:13,773
You got a new dog.
Right on, man.

587
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:15,283
What's his name?

588
00:44:16,692 --> 00:44:18,947
Yeah, I had
a dog like that once,

589
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,995
except maybe,
like, twice as big.

590
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:23,747
Super purebred.

591
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,515
Now, me personally, I would train him
to go straight for the nuts...

592
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:29,873
Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

593
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:31,647
I ain't buying, ese.

594
00:44:32,355 --> 00:44:33,654
I'm selling.

595
00:44:43,072 --> 00:44:45,371
Tell me that ain't
the finest scante

596
00:44:45,403 --> 00:44:46,986
you ever laid eyes on.

597
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:49,234
Go ahead, try it.

598
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,312
Hey, poochie.

599
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:52,961
How you doing?

600
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,198
Jesus Christ.

601
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,582
See? What'd I say?

602
00:44:59,716 --> 00:45:02,438
- It's all right.
- It's all right? It's all right?

603
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:04,967
- Yeah, it's all right.
- So, what? You back in business?

604
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:06,564
Hell, yeah, I'm back.

605
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:08,311
With a vengeance.

606
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,435
Vato loco gotta make a living.

607
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,490
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all.

608
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:16,723
And listen, homes,
about that.

609
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:20,632
It really broke me up
about Emilio.

610
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:23,491
That dude
is like my brother.

611
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,228
He okay?
You talk to him?

612
00:45:25,234 --> 00:45:26,865
Yeah, yeah,
I talked to him.

613
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,732
He said when the Feds came,
you were out

614
00:45:28,735 --> 00:45:30,959
sticking it
in some neighbor lady.

615
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:33,459
Hey, you know,
I got lucky twice.

616
00:45:33,472 --> 00:45:35,086
I don't know, man.

617
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:36,551
Emilio...

618
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:41,433
He thinks maybe
you dimed on him.

619
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:44,671
That is bullshit.

620
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:48,067
That is bullshit,
Krazy-8!

621
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:51,218
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

622
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:54,075
You know what?
Next time you talk to Emilio,

623
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:56,239
you tell him for me,
all right?

624
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,805
Why don't you
tell him yourself?

625
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:05,632
- Made bail this morning.
- Go ahead, pendejo.

626
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:07,406
Kick my ass.

627
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:08,897
Hey, listen...

628
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,007
Where did you get this?

629
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:18,986
Because I know your little
punk ass didn't cook it.

630
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,699
Hey, man.

631
00:46:49,285 --> 00:46:51,076
You some kind of nudist?

632
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,679
That's some stone-fine tick tick
you been cooking there, ese.

633
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:58,846
How about you come
work for me?

634
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,575
I'd be willing
to sell it to you if...

635
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:04,832
the price is right.

636
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:17,955
You out here
all by yourself, huh?

637
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:28,018
I know you.

638
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,724
He was there when I got busted.
He's with the DEA!

639
00:47:30,837 --> 00:47:31,670
No.

640
00:47:32,138 --> 00:47:33,921
You ratasnitch
motherfucker!

641
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:36,574
Run, Mr. White! Run!

642
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:48,217
I say we cap 'em both.

643
00:47:55,425 --> 00:47:57,754
Hey, you really
cook up that batch?

644
00:47:59,414 --> 00:48:00,190
Yeah.

645
00:48:01,865 --> 00:48:03,253
You an artist.

646
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:06,843
It's a damn shame.

647
00:48:06,877 --> 00:48:09,169
Wait! Wait a minute.

648
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:11,717
Listen to me.

649
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:14,224
I'll teach you my recipe.

650
00:48:15,218 --> 00:48:17,930
What do you say?
You want to cook like me?

651
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,458
You let us both live...

652
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:25,368
and I will teach you.

653
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:58,252
Put the cigarette out.

654
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:02,371
Please.

655
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:48,153
Move it, homes.

656
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,081
We ain't got all day.

657
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:53,734
Okay.

658
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:06,229
What happened?

659
00:54:10,284 --> 00:54:12,075
What'd you
do to them?

660
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:15,901
Red phosphorus
in the presence of moisture

661
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:19,440
and accelerated by heat
yields phosphorus hydride.

662
00:54:21,084 --> 00:54:22,457
Phosphine gas.

663
00:54:23,357 --> 00:54:24,983
One good whiff and...

664
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,334
We gotta...

665
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:56,316
We gotta... clean this up.

666
00:55:45,406 --> 00:55:46,853
Where were you?

667
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:56,358
Walt.

668
00:55:59,765 --> 00:56:02,716
I don't know what's been going on
with you lately, but...

669
00:56:02,717 --> 00:56:05,064
Nothing.
I'm fine.

670
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,906
Whatever it is...

671
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,295
I'll tell you this.

672
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:13,067
I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

673
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:17,421
The worst thing
you can do is shut me out.

674
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,584
Walter, is that you?
