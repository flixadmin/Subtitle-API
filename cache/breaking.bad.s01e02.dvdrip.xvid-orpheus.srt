1
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,642
Are you okay?

2
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,837
- You are a life saver.
- Yeah, man.

3
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,548
- We can't thank you enough.
- Hey, mad props.

4
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,800
I could have sworn
the guy said south.

5
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:05,053
But then, all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

6
00:02:05,094 --> 00:02:08,556
I'm trying to read the map while I'm
driving, which is a bonehead maneuver.

7
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,476
And all of a sudden...
Bam, we're in that ditch.

8
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:14,062
Yeah, bam,
I'm like, what the hell? You know?

9
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:16,022
Yes, and my coffee mug.

10
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:18,233
Coffee? My mug of coffee?

11
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:21,569
It spills all over my pants.
I mean, just... a nightmare.

12
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:24,614
Dude, you so need GPS.
I mean, for real.

13
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,013
Like I said,

14
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,225
we couldn't be more grateful.

15
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,284
Can't we just
dump 'em here?

16
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:11,411
What, then somebody finds them?

17
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:14,289
Then what?
People have seen us.

18
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:22,964
You're gonna flood it, man.

19
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,466
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

20
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,594
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

21
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:31,014
We're going to clean up this mess.
Wish you would start.

22
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,350
Damn it. See? You flooded it.

23
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,145
All right. All right.
You know what?

24
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:39,439
The RV is going to start now.

25
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:41,524
The RV is going
to start right now.

26
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,319
It's gonna start and we're gonna
drive it over to your house.

27
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,570
- My house?
- Yes.

28
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,864
We'll drive it over there
and park it overnight.

29
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:50,366
- And then tomorrow...
- No, man, not my house!

30
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,244
Shut up!

31
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:08,343
After we finish
cleaning up this mess,

32
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,554
we will go our separate ways.

33
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,349
Our paths will never cross.

34
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:16,684
And we will tell this to no one.

35
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:18,478
Understood?

36
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:23,066
What, I can talk now?

37
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:25,151
Fine.

38
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:27,987
That goes double for me.

39
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:36,246
Be good to me.

40
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:13,157
Oh, shit.

41
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:43,620
Walt?

42
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:48,041
You coming out?

43
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:58,677
Yeah, absolutely.

44
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:14,568
You wanna hear something funny?

45
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:18,822
We had a faculty
meeting last Thursday

46
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:22,159
and the topic was
senior class photos,

47
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:25,537
and how we had instituted
a new rule last year

48
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:27,497
that seniors are allowed to

49
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:30,834
have photos taken by
a photographer of their choice,

50
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,005
Not necessarily the photographer
that the school hires, right? So...

51
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:41,053
Anyway, some of the senior girls

52
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:43,221
were going to that...

53
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:46,683
Glamour Shots place,
to have their photos taken,

54
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:49,937
and now they're bringing us
all these photos,

55
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:52,022
and Joan Epperman,
you know Joan,

56
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,982
suddenly has to go
through all these photos

57
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:57,903
and turn them down,
because they show cleavage.

58
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:04,201
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

59
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,328
Yeah. I'm good.

60
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:11,416
You know, even these
small-busted girls... have cleavage.

61
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:16,046
Apparently there's some
new type of brassiere,

62
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,590
or something.

63
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,842
The Wonderbra...

64
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:23,845
It's the Wonderbra.

65
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:35,148
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Junior.

66
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:38,860
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

67
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:42,489
Hello, Mr. White.
This is AT&T calling.

68
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:45,701
Are you happy with your
current long distance service?

69
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:48,662
'Cause if you're not,
I would definitely, really

70
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:51,164
love to talk to you
as soon as possible about...

71
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,458
Hello? Hello.
This is Walter White speaking.

72
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,086
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

73
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:58,130
You said he would die any minute!

74
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:01,508
Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now,

75
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:04,469
and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

76
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:07,055
Well, too bad, man,
'cause guess what.

77
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,682
He's still not dead!

78
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:11,602
I went and put my ear to the RV,
I can hear him, like,

79
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:13,645
rolling around in there, all right?

80
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:17,399
I think he's awake, man,
I think he's trying to get loose.

81
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,901
Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out over here!

82
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:22,696
- Calm down, damn it.
- Are you gonna help me clean this up?

83
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,782
- We got loose ends here!
- Calm down!

84
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,451
I will be there after school.

85
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:30,037
After school?
Are you shitting me?

86
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,205
Ditch it, man, call in sick.

87
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:34,875
Listen, that is just not
going to work for me.

88
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,710
I'm not interested in that at all.

89
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:40,172
And I would appreciate
if you don't call here anymore.

90
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:43,050
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

91
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:50,596
- You have a good day, sweetie.
- Okay, Mom. You too.

92
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,640
Bye, honey.

93
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:59,439
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

94
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:16,039
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

95
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:17,790
representing the ABQ.

96
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,417
What up, biatch?

97
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,377
Leave it at the tone.

98
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:39,263
So, the term "chiral"

99
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:43,184
derives from
the Greek word "hand."

100
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:48,272
The concept here being that,
just as your left hand,

101
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:52,819
and your right hand are
mirror images of one another, right?

102
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:55,113
Identical, and yet opposite.

103
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:59,075
Well, so too organic
compounds can exist as

104
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,202
mirror image forms

105
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,414
of one another all the way down
at the molecular level.

106
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:08,292
But although
they may look the same,

107
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,771
they don't always
behave the same.

108
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:12,439
For instance...

109
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:21,990
I'm sorry...
For instance...

110
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:24,284
Thalidomide.

111
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:29,289
The right-handed isomer
of the drug Thalidomide

112
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:33,293
is a perfectly fine good medicine
to give to a pregnant woman

113
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,088
to prevent morning sickness but,

114
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:39,132
make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman

115
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:42,300
the left-handed isomer
of the drug Thalidomide,

116
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:45,095
and her child
will be born with

117
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,263
horrible birth defects.

118
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:52,519
Which is precisely
what happened in the 1950s.

119
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:56,856
So, chiral, chirality,

120
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,317
mirrored images, right?

121
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:01,820
Active, inactive.

122
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,613
Good, bad.

123
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,575
Yes, Ben?

124
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:12,077
Is this gonna be on the murder?

125
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:15,330
What?

126
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,958
Is this gonna be on the mid-term?

127
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:24,631
The chirality on the mid-term?
No, no, well, maybe,

128
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:27,301
maybe, yes, you know,
but prepare

129
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,219
for it to be on the mid-term.

130
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,638
Can't hurt to know it, right?

131
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,724
Knowledge is power!

132
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,902
Oh, no, no...

133
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:01,955
Not good. Not good.

134
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,021
What the...

135
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:43,594
Hey, you.

136
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,986
Listen...
No, no, no, no!

137
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:53,948
Oh, God!

138
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,655
MILF's?

139
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:02,908
What the hell is a MILF?

140
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,220
Now what?

141
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,644
The other one,
out in the RV, he's...

142
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:33,480
- You're sure?
- Yes.

143
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,398
Positive?

144
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,067
- Feel free to go check it yourself.
- Yes, good idea.

145
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:40,195
Maybe I should do that before he, too,
wanders off on the damn street!

146
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,031
- Okay, you know what, I...
- All right, all right!

147
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:47,119
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

148
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,580
Come on, anything, something!

149
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:52,499
- Start with his name, at least!
- Krazy-8.

150
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,168
Krazy-8?
What the hell does that even mean?

151
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,963
I don't know, man, okay?
I mean, he's like,

152
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:00,173
Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

153
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:03,135
So, you work with him regularly?

154
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,387
No, not him so much.

155
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,140
- His cousin, mainly.
- Who's his cousin?

156
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:11,184
- The guy out in the RV!
- All right, all right.

157
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:13,604
Krazy-8's one level higher.

158
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,606
One level higher?

159
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,691
Yeah, you know,
not like street level.

160
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:19,192
Higher.

161
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:22,446
You know, there's like
a Starbucks at every corner?

162
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:26,074
Krazy-8 is, like, the dude
that sells Starbucks his beans.

163
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,535
Okay, so he's a distributor.

164
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:31,663
Okay, so, is he...

165
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean, is he...
In other words...

166
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,170
What is his reputation for violence?

167
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,756
Well, um...

168
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,092
He did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

169
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:47,471
What I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

170
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,891
He's a... He's a businessman,
he's a man of business.

171
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:54,269
It would therefore seem to follow
that he is capable of acting

172
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,980
out of mutual self-interest, yes?

173
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,857
What?

174
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:01,735
Do you think he is capable

175
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:04,279
of listening to reason?

176
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:06,323
What kind of reason?

177
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,116
Like "Dear Krazy-8, listen,

178
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:11,370
"if I let you go, will you promise not
to come back and waste my family?

179
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,206
"No Colombian neckties."
You mean that kind of reason?

180
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:18,252
No, man, I can't say as I have
high hopes where that's concerned.

181
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,717
What was that?

182
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:28,470
What was what?

183
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:34,518
Come see!

184
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:37,479
We gotta tie him up.

185
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:40,023
Why the hell didn't we tie him up?

186
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,900
Because he was out cold.

187
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,236
But what if he's faking it?

188
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:48,115
Like if it was me, I'd be all
faking being knocked out, yo!

189
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,909
And then,
when the coast is clear,

190
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:53,453
I'd be up looking
for weapons and shit,

191
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:55,163
waiting to pounce!

192
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:23,942
Now if it was me, and I couldn't
find a decent enough weapon,

193
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:27,279
I would just lie back down,
and bide my time.

194
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,914
So now what do we do?

195
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,336
You keep asking me that

196
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,923
like you think
I have some answer.

197
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,010
- Well, you gotta do something!
- We!

198
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,472
We have got to do something,
and I am opened to suggestions.

199
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,350
Man, uh-uh, okay,
this whole thing was your deal!

200
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:46,644
Don't you dare put that on me!

201
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,064
You brought those guys out there,
this is your responsibility!

202
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,746
Like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

203
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:56,438
"Nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please!

204
00:19:56,439 --> 00:20:00,526
"I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny, but
her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV."

205
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:10,870
What about the...
the phosphate gas?

206
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,581
Phosphine gas.
What about it?

207
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:16,625
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

208
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,462
You know, with like
a delayed reaction or something?

209
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,465
I don't know.

210
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,385
- You're supposed to be a scientist!
- Look!

211
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:29,306
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

212
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:32,684
We have got a body in that RV,

213
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,395
and it's getting warmer
outside, understand?

214
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,773
And we have got to do something
about that soon.

215
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:41,693
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

216
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:44,029
Now that last part

217
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:46,088
is very, very important.

218
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:47,340
Therefore,

219
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,845
it seems to me that
our best course of action

220
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:56,349
would be chemical disincorporation.

221
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:03,105
Dissolving in strong acid.

222
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,907
Oh man, that's messed up.

223
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:17,203
You're not...
You're not serious?

224
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,113
You're serious?

225
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:29,343
Who's gonna do that?

226
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:31,470
And don't look at me!

227
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:36,267
I guess we'll both do it together.

228
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:39,604
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

229
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:44,525
We're in this 50/50, okay?

230
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:50,187
I guess the only
other fair way

231
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,898
to go about this would be...

232
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:56,402
that one of us deals with the...

233
00:21:56,986 --> 00:22:00,447
body situation,
while the other one of us...

234
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:04,285
deals with the Krazy-8 situation.

235
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,392
In a scenario like this,

236
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:15,896
I don't suppose
it is bad form to just...

237
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,108
flip a coin.

238
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:30,911
- Heads or tails?
- I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

239
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:33,497
Heads or tails?

240
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:43,799
Heads.

241
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:05,946
Best two out of three?

242
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:26,049
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

243
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:27,843
representing the ABQ.

244
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:29,428
What up, biatch?

245
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:31,305
Leave it at the tone.

246
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,391
Mr. White, it's me, pick up.

247
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:37,686
I got a container question.

248
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:42,191
Hello? Mr. White,
pick up the phone, man!

249
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:43,192
Yes?

250
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:45,027
What kind of plastic, man?

251
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:47,029
Polyethylene.

252
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:50,141
How the hell
am I supposed to know that?

253
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:51,935
Because I told you.

254
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,770
Look, just...

255
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:58,483
look at the bottom
for a triangle

256
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:01,236
stamped "LDPE."

257
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:03,571
It should be molded
right into the plastic.

258
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:06,032
Yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

259
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:10,495
But... I don't know, man,
this feels kind of flimsy.

260
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,831
Any decent acid's gonna
eat right through this.

261
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:16,459
- Not hydrofluoric.
- Why not?

262
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:21,631
Look, you skipped,

263
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,342
clowned around
or otherwise jerked off

264
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:26,886
to every lecture I ever gave.

265
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:30,557
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

266
00:24:30,723 --> 00:24:32,892
Oh, okay.
Be a dick about it.

267
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:37,480
So, hey, have you...

268
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,109
Have you done the thing?

269
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,087
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

270
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:56,803
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

271
00:24:57,092 --> 00:25:00,595
Not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

272
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,100
Now, if it was me, I would just
try and think of it like I was...

273
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:08,061
I was doing him a favor.

274
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:21,285
Who's there?

275
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:27,588
Don't you fucking play games
with me. Who's there?

276
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:34,386
Yeah, I see you.

277
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,725
What are you gonna do?

278
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:53,822
I need water!

279
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,419
Bring me some water, would you?

280
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:04,090
Please?

281
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,376
You don't like the crust?

282
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,642
Where's my cousin Emilio?

283
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,523
He dead?

284
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,280
Hey, Mr. White!

285
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:38,824
Mr. White?

286
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,207
Are you smoking weed?

287
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:48,792
Oh, my God!

288
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:51,829
Wait a minute.
Is that my weed?

289
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:55,458
What the hell, man?

290
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,377
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

291
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,585
So what did you end up buying?

292
00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:04,587
Nothing.

293
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:09,842
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

294
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:14,763
I don't suppose you could
buy two bins...

295
00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:22,646
Legs in one,
torso in the other?

296
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:24,565
God.

297
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:28,694
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

298
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:42,616
How did it go?

299
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,439
So you didn't do it?

300
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:53,587
Not yet.

301
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,811
God.

302
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:03,661
- I gotta go.
- What? No, come back here!

303
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:07,040
Sorry.
I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.

304
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:07,953
Tomorrow?

305
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:10,163
I've got a doctor's appointment,
I gotta go.

306
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:12,271
Look, stay away from him.

307
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,044
He's awake.

308
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:18,755
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

309
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,891
We flipped a coin!

310
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:30,990
We're good?

311
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,346
We're very good.

312
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:35,358
We're excellent, I'd say.

313
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,334
Oh, would you look at that face!

314
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:44,616
Smile, peanut!

315
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,927
So, who's up for knowing?

316
00:33:58,716 --> 00:33:59,832
Girl.

317
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:00,948
Girl?

318
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:03,895
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

319
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:12,280
Can I tell you this is exactly
what I was hoping?

320
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:17,433
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

321
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:19,746
Looking fabulous.

322
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:22,681
Let me see if they're done with the
blood sugar, then we'll get you out.

323
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,855
I'll be right back.

324
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:53,996
Who is Jesse Pinkman?

325
00:35:01,628 --> 00:35:02,755
Jesse...

326
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,097
Jesse Pinkman.

327
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,551
He called just this morning,
Walt, please don't deny it.

328
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:16,371
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

329
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:18,884
Was he one of your students?

330
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,709
Yeah. He was...

331
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:22,785
nobody.

332
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:26,349
Who is he to you?

333
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:29,045
Why is he calling?
What is this big secret

334
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,834
you seem to be discussing
with some... druggie burn-out?

335
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:38,405
You don't come home

336
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,801
last night until 2 in the morning,
you don't tell me where you've been.

337
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:45,467
You spent the entire night
in the bathroom, Walt.

338
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:48,816
Tell me what's going on with you.

339
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,282
Don't you think you owe me that?

340
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:57,786
Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you?

341
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:04,890
He sells me pot.

342
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,588
He sells you... pot?

343
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:12,855
Marijuana, yeah.

344
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:14,586
Not a lot.

345
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:16,873
I mean, I don't know.

346
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:20,655
I kinda like it.

347
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,919
Are you out of your mind?

348
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:27,103
What are you,
like 16 years old?

349
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:29,365
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

350
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,390
What is wrong with you?

351
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:35,180
Skyler...

352
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:40,744
I just...

353
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,382
haven't quite been myself lately.

354
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,880
Yeah, no shit.
Thanks for noticing.

355
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:51,044
I haven't been myself
lately, but I love you.

356
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:54,324
Nothing about that has changed.

357
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:56,603
Nothing ever will.

358
00:36:57,294 --> 00:37:00,380
So right now,
what I need

359
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:04,336
is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

360
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,616
Can you do that?

361
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:12,164
Will you do that for me, honey?

362
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:15,924
Will you, please, just once,

363
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:18,114
get off my ass?

364
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:21,277
You know, I'd appreciate it.

365
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,810
I really would.

366
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:46,341
Stop!

367
00:37:57,574 --> 00:38:00,160
Stop in 15 minutes.

368
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,139
Just meat, is all.
Just a bunch of meat.

369
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,900
Oh, Jesus.

370
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,362
It's cool, you're cool.

371
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:10,059
You're all good, yo.

372
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,187
You're all good in the hood.

373
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:17,391
It's fine. Just a bunch of meat,
come on. You got it.

374
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:41,633
Excuse me!

375
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:44,137
Excuse me?

376
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:44,900
You.

377
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:46,653
Yes, you.

378
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,398
May I talk to you?

379
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,632
This is private property!

380
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,826
Just a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

381
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:56,780
No, I'm not interested.

382
00:39:56,781 --> 00:40:00,600
Hey, don't touch me!
Do not touch me.

383
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:03,429
All right, look, not touching, okay?
Not touching here.

384
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:07,266
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

385
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,640
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.

386
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:11,994
My husband is Walter White, yo.

387
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,918
He told me everything.

388
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:18,911
- Seriously?
- That's right.

389
00:40:19,593 --> 00:40:21,470
And just so you know...

390
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:25,406
My brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

391
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,260
And I will not hesitate to call him.

392
00:40:28,315 --> 00:40:30,109
Not if I have to.

393
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:31,691
Understood?

394
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:35,399
This is your one
and only warning.

395
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:39,714
Do not sell marijuana
to my husband.

396
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,344
- Okay.
- I mean it.

397
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:46,648
Don't call our house again.

398
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,535
You stay away from him,
or you'll be one sorry individual.

399
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:53,787
You got me?

400
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:56,549
I think so, yeah.

401
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,617
No more marijuana.

402
00:40:59,177 --> 00:41:00,595
I can dig it.

403
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:02,619
You can dig it.

404
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,136
Wonderful.

405
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:16,617
Not that it's any of my business,

406
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:20,839
but you might wanna consider
a different line of work.

407
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,099
Okay.

408
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:20,669
"Let's go to your house, yo!

409
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,663
"Makes perfect sense. Let's...

410
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:27,335
"Let's completely
screw up your house

411
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:29,957
"so you never wanna
spend another night in it."

412
00:42:29,996 --> 00:42:32,374
"Sure.
You know, why not?"

413
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:41,318
"And then, how's about I send over
my psycho-bitch wife to...

414
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,854
"you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

415
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:46,163
"God, that'd be hilarious."

416
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,460
"And then, the killer
in the basement?

417
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:51,957
"The one who's completely
my responsibility.

418
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:55,424
"Hell, let's just let him
live down there.

419
00:42:56,446 --> 00:43:00,325
"Just, I don't know,
make sure to feed him, like...

420
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,436
"three times a day."

421
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:03,907
"Sure, why not?

422
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:05,856
"That would be amazing.

423
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:07,976
"Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

424
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:11,799
"I always dreamt about,
I don't know, melting bodies."

425
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:38,335
You got a brother
in the goddamned DEA?

426
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,583
What?

427
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:45,064
You said you were just
doing some ride-along.

428
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,357
Yes or no, do you have
a brother in the DEA?

429
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:50,416
Brother-in-law.

430
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,956
Now there's a load off my mind.

431
00:43:52,991 --> 00:43:54,674
Where did you hear that?

432
00:43:54,817 --> 00:43:58,613
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up on my shit.

433
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,013
Yeah, that's right.

434
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:02,707
She almost caught me
moving Emilio!

435
00:44:03,463 --> 00:44:06,257
Good job in wearing
the pants in the family.

436
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,885
And why did you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

437
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:14,090
Because somehow,
it seemed preferable to admitting

438
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:17,251
that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

439
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:27,799
Is that what I think it is?

440
00:44:28,696 --> 00:44:31,156
Yeah, it is.
I smoked a bowl, so what?

441
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:32,792
My house, my rules.

442
00:44:33,098 --> 00:44:36,601
Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay?
I held up my end.

443
00:44:36,636 --> 00:44:37,421
I already took care of Emilio.

444
00:44:37,895 --> 00:44:40,397
You're still diddling around,
trying to get your nut up.

445
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:44,251
Well, boo-hoo.
I have the truly awful job here.

446
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:46,152
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

447
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:50,275
Try dragging 200 pounds
of stink up a flight of stairs.

448
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,535
I barely got him in the bathtub!

449
00:44:52,955 --> 00:44:54,499
Bathtub? What...

450
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:57,834
- What do you mean, "bathtub"?
- That's another thing,

451
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,123
Why you got me
running around town,

452
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:01,948
trying to find some
stupid piece of plastic,

453
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:04,300
when I have a perfectly
good tub I can use?

454
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:09,025
Oh, God.

455
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:09,520
I'm sorry,
what were you asking me?

456
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:10,898
Oh, yes.

457
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:15,117
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

458
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:18,951
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

459
00:46:19,357 --> 00:46:22,735
It will however dissolve
metal, rock,

460
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,006
glass, ceramic.

461
00:46:26,055 --> 00:46:27,724
So there's that.
