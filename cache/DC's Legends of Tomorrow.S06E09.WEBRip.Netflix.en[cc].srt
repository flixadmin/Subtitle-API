Tonight he enters adulthood.

As well as the 36 chambers

- They're kids.

359
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,918
Just play something young

360
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,254
and poppy and dumb,

361
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,254
like Dragon Girl.

parents you're skipping work?

366
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,719
- Oh, I'm gonna honestly explain

367
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,719
that I'm pursuing my passion.

368
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,639
I have a dream.

369
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,639
It's up to me to follow it.

370
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,601
And then I'm gonna get smacked.

you're doing?

- You're really gonna get high?

382
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,580
To tell your parents you're

383
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,580
quitting the family business

384
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,416

- Well, how else

388
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,629
would I get through

389
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,884
such a deep,

390
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,884

- This show is too niche.

398
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,771
We need something

happens on this show.

403
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,112

is really starting to give off

428
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,701
an "improvised lie

Little tropey, but,

00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,749

You're ruining one

Well, this animatronic alien

is adorable.

And the audience ate it up.

464
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,965
So if we're ever gonna be

465
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,965
more than a cult show

466

00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,634
a little less foreign.

- Less foreign?

469
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,470
It's a freakin' alien, man.

470
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,639
- I want broader appeal.

471

the alien is.

00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,226
- Okay.

475
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,226
This thing is freaking me out.

476
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,270
The puppeteer

477
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,270
is going really method,

478
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,106
because this thing

479
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,106
is way too lifelike.

480
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,525
- Remember how we got here.

481
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,401
I was your first audience.

482
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,777
The one who encouraged you

483
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,821
and drove you to

484
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,821
all your stand-up gigs.

485
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,116
Have I ever steered you

486
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,116
wrong before?

487
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,955
- Can we at least

488
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,955
reshoot the ending?

489
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,706
Hell, get some VFX money,

490
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,706
make that crash

491
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,833
look a little more convincing?

492
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,502
- We'll fix it in post.

See, Spooner?

00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,972
need a smaller gun.

00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,849
What are you still doing here?

502
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,601
Come on.

00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,603
- Oh!

504
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,603
We're just--

How's it going?

Ow!

00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,486
You're no animatronic.

you know?

513
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,077
It feels like only yesterday

514
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,077
that we were watching her

on this ship,

519
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,499
it's that being a parent

520
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,499
is really just about

521
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,668
being cool when things

522
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,668
aren't really that cool, yeah?

00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,559
I can't help it.

1563
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,479
This is the laugh

1564
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,479
I was programmed with.

1565
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,939
- Wow.

1566
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,649
That I did not see coming.

1567
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,902
[upbeat suspenseful music]

1568
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,967
