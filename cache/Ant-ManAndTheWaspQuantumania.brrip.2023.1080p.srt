<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

136
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed this.</font>

137
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:19,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No pizza in the Quantum Realm?</font>

138
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No anything.</font>

139
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Mom, you can talk about it.</font>

140
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:26,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want.</font>

141
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:29,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.</font>

142
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:32,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna live right now.</font>

143
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:40,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?</font>

144
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:41,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa.</font>

145
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"This time"?</font>

146
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:44,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there a last time?</font>

147
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, last time barely counts.</font>

148
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:48,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know that.</font>

149
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:49,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you call me?</font>

150
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:51,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I knew you'd be like this.</font>

151
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would've just broken you out with ants.</font>

152
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:54,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you know what? Family meeting.</font>

153
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:55,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we have a family meeting?</font>

154
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:56,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that what we're doing?</font>

155
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I mean about this.</font>

156
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About everybody being so fine with this.</font>

157
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:04,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you wanna help. I get it.</font>

158
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:05,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do, Cassie. I really do.</font>

159
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't want you wasting your life.</font>

160
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.</font>

161
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:13,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I literally saved the world.</font>

162
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:14,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, did you?</font>

163
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.</font>

164
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.</font>

165
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was that for you, Scott?</font>

166
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should write a book about it.</font>

167
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:22,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha ha. Hilarious.</font>

168
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:24,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.</font>

169
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what do you do now?</font>

170
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sign books?</font>

171
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?</font>

172
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:34,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...</font>

173
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just to fight Captain America at the airport?</font>

174
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fight with Captain America at the airport.</font>

175
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't fight Captain America.</font>

176
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:42,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not insane.</font>

177
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People still need help, Dad.</font>

178
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least we're trying to do something
that matters.</font>

179
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's"we"?</font>

180
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you three up to?</font>

181
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:58,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Science.</font>

182
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With ants.</font>

183
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:04,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ant science.</font>

184
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:06,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe you.</font>

185
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just show him.</font>

186
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:15,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they building?</font>

187
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:16,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you doing this?</font>

188
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:20,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, no, they built their own tech.</font>

189
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty smart ants.</font>

190
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so when you were all...</font>

191
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:26,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like, gone those 5 years,
I had a lot of time.</font>

192
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:29,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...</font>

193
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...</font>

194
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Quantum Realm?</font>

195
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...</font>

196
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:38,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we've been talking about it.</font>

197
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:39,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had some questions, okay?</font>

198
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:42,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help if people are inspired by me.</font>

199
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:48,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?</font>

200
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:51,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you ask me about it?</font>

201
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried, Mom.</font>

202
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:54,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot.</font>

203
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never wanted to talk about it.</font>

204
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:57,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie's just been curious...</font>

205
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we gave her some pointers.</font>

206
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?</font>

207
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is.</font>

208
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we all do, Mom.</font>

209
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.</font>

210
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we made this.</font>

211
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.</font>

212
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Quantum.</font>

213
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just need a map.</font>

214
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.</font>

215
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:29,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never even have to go.</font>

216
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:34,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.</font>

217
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...</font>

218
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:43,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I could have found you.</font>

219
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's amazing.</font>

220
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:50,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm blown away.</font>

221
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does it work?</font>

222
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:57,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's kinda like that 2-way radio
we used to have.</font>

223
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You send a signal down from here...</font>

224
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:01,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.</font>

225
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:02,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Wait a minute.</font>

226
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?</font>

227
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

228
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:11,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut it down now.
- Janet...</font>

229
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why would we shut it...
- What's wrong?</font>

230
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to turn it off!</font>

231
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop and tell us what's wrong!</font>

232
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet?</font>

233
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:27,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something I should have told...</font>

234
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

235
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

236
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- Mom!</font>

237
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:09,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

238
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:12,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

239
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:15,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

240
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:48,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

241
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

242
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie.</font>

243
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:28,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

244
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Dad. Come on.</font>

245
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:32,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

246
00:14:32,474 --> 00:14:33,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

247
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:34,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'm okay.</font>

248
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we?</font>

249
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom!</font>

250
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:13,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

251
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope. Over here.</font>

252
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:19,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

253
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should be dead.</font>

254
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:23,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't we?</font>

255
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

256
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we where I think we are?</font>

257
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would say yes...</font>

258
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:33,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it wasn't like this.</font>

259
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:34,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet!</font>

260
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:36,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom!</font>

261
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet!</font>

262
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom!</font>

263
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:55,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not move.</font>

264
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to find Scott and Cassie.</font>

265
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:17,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now.</font>

266
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hope? Hope?</i></font>

267
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:25,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hank? Can you hear me?</i></font>

268
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Can anyone hear me?
- Oh, my God.</i></font>

269
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:31,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?</font>

270
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:33,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.</font>

271
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:35,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're okay. It's gonna be okay.</font>

272
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:36,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saying"okay" too much.</font>

273
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.</font>

274
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:39,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're okay.</font>

275
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:40,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are fine.</font>

276
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.</font>

277
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the meantime, look around.</font>

278
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:46,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

279
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:48,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? We're outside.</font>

280
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:51,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like we're camping. We love camping.</font>

281
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:52,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've never been camping.</font>

282
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we've always talked about it.</font>

283
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:02,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that sun moving?</font>

284
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:13,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back!</font>

285
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:19,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

286
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:22,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think this is a sun!</font>

287
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:24,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.</font>

288
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Honey, it's okay.</font>

289
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:27,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still okay.</font>

290
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:37,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad. Oh, my God.</font>

291
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:38,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was weird.</font>

292
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run.</font>

293
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?</font>

294
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:18,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

295
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know that either.</font>

296
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that back there, Mom?</font>

297
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that ship looking for?</font>

298
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your voice down.</font>

299
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said there was nothing down here.</font>

300
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you tell us about all of this?</font>

301
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...</font>

302
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just need you to trust me.
- Then make me trust you!</font>

303
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...</font>

304
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have time to talk, Henry.</font>

305
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you need to tell us what's...</font>

306
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.</font>

307
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet, I'm so sorry.</font>

308
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...</font>

309
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:53,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. It's...</font>

310
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll talk later.</font>

311
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, we stick together...</font>

312
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we find Scott and Cassie...</font>

313
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:02,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we go home. Okay?</font>

314
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay?
- Okay?</font>

315
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:05,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

316
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay close.</font>

317
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:15,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is incredible.</font>

318
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.</font>

319
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:21,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I see any of this?</font>

320
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You weren't able to look deep enough.</font>

321
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:26,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not through the Void and Subatomica.</font>

322
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are worlds here...</font>

323
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:31,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">worlds within worlds.</font>

324
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:36,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a place outside time and space.</font>

325
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:40,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a secret universe...</font>

326
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:42,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">beneath ours.</font>

327
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:05,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, get your hands off me!</font>

328
00:20:12,637 --> 00:20:13,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie?</font>

329
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:17,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my daughter?</font>

330
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:20,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is she?</font>

331
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:22,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie?</font>

332
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:27,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my daughter?</font>

333
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:32,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie!</font>

334
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:35,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

335
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:37,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie!</font>

336
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:39,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink the ooze.</font>

337
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:42,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

338
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:05,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll handle this.</font>

339
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:20,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom.</font>

340
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:16,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that a good stab?</font>

341
00:22:17,524 --> 00:22:18,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got us a ride.</font>

342
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:39,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's friendly.</font>

343
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:41,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quite a ride.</font>

344
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:44,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.</font>

345
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:45,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like ants.</font>

346
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:47,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I love that you love them. Here.</font>

347
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These will help us blend in.</font>

348
00:22:51,644 --> 00:22:54,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where exactly are we going on this?</font>

349
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not too far from an old friend of mine.</font>

350
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...</font>

351
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:00,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it'll be him.</font>

352
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:02,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you.</font>

353
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Saddle up, Ant-Man.</font>

354
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:13,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me go! Let me go!</font>

355
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:25,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what you're saying!</font>

356
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:27,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what you...</font>

357
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:47,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

358
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:58,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink the ooze!</font>

359
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink the ooze!</font>

360
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:02,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink the ooze!</font>

361
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:03,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink the ooze!</font>

362
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:06,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

363
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:07,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Hi.</font>

364
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:09,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you drink the ooze?</font>

365
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can I understand you?</font>

366
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:13,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great. That's the ooze.</font>

367
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!</font>

368
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can finally be friends.</font>

369
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:21,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. I am Veb.</font>

370
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just drank me.</font>

371
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:24,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did... What?</font>

372
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you need some more ooze? Here.</font>

373
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can pour some ooze into your hole...
- No, I'm okay.</font>

374
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Oh, wow!</font>

375
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A big hole.</font>

376
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many holes do you have?</font>

377
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:35,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?</font>

378
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have any holes.</font>

379
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:38,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His name is Scott Lang.</font>

380
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:41,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has 7 holes.</font>

381
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:47,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's right.</font>

382
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:49,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know that?</font>

383
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:51,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's Quaz. He's a telepath.</font>

384
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:54,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can read minds?</font>

385
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.</font>

386
00:24:58,283 --> 00:25:01,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone is disgusting.</font>

387
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:05,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Could you please stop thinking that?
- Sorry.</font>

388
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please, stop.
- Thinking?</font>

389
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:10,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thinking that.
- I'm trying.</font>

390
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:13,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.</font>

391
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:15,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.</font>

392
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:16,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish my head glowed.</font>

393
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:18,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, you don't.</font>

394
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:21,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.</font>

395
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:22,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

396
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:24,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you a spy?
- What? No. No, no.</font>

397
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:25,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should torture him.</font>

398
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:26,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys. No, it's okay.</font>

399
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:29,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not spies. He's my dad.</font>

400
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:32,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Welcome.</font>

401
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:37,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then who is San Francisco?</font>

402
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's where we're from.
- It's a place.</font>

403
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:39,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what's Earth?</font>

404
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:40,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's also where we're from.</font>

405
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:42,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should torture them.</font>

406
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:44,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you always trying to torture people?
We have other options.</font>

407
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...</font>

408
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:49,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Veb, stop asking about his holes.</font>

409
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of us have holes.</font>

410
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

411
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you from?</font>

412
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Up there. Up there.</font>

413
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See, above this, it's a different universe.
- The Earth. Big Earth.</font>

414
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
- This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.</font>

415
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sometimes, I guess.
- I get big. I shrink.</font>

416
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And it's like...
- But I wrote a book about it, actually.</font>

417
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:06,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't know.
- This is the Quantum Realm.</font>

418
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.</font>

419
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
- It's bigger where we're from.</font>

420
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, we're small right now.
- It's bigger.</font>

421
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, they're telling the truth.</font>

422
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter.</font>

423
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You come from above.</font>

424
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:26,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like him.</font>

425
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:30,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, he is hunting you.</font>

426
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will burn the world to find you.</font>

427
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:35,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

428
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:38,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Conqueror.</font>

429
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:44,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.</font>

430
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:47,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...</font>

431
00:27:49,011 --> 00:27:51,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a subatomic universe.</font>

432
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:53,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This changes everything we know about life...</font>

433
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">evolution, our place in the galaxy...</font>

434
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit!</font>

435
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy looks like broccoli.</font>

436
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:10,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your head down.</font>

437
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:04,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

438
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:18,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink those.</font>

439
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:20,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back.</font>

440
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:36,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for Krylar.</font>

441
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:42,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's you.</font>

442
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:43,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's keep that between us.</font>

443
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:46,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Krylar.</font>

444
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:47,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

445
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:50,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know your ways or customs...</font>

446
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:54,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?</font>

447
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:55,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely, sir.</font>

448
00:29:58,403 --> 00:30:00,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's your story then?</font>

449
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God.</font>

450
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:05,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move.</font>

451
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:07,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time.</font>

452
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:08,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

453
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:16,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right this way.</font>

454
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How exactly do you know this guy?</font>

455
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Old freedom fighter friend of mine.</font>

456
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?</font>

457
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or terrorist.</font>

458
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Depends on who you ask.</font>

459
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:37,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, trust me, he can help.</font>

460
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet Van Dyne?</font>

461
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:25,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were dead.</font>

462
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:27,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been a long time, Krylar.</font>

463
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Officially, Lord Krylar now.</font>

464
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:33,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fought like hell against that.</font>

465
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:35,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It sounds so elitist.</font>

466
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:39,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have got to be Hank.</font>

467
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:43,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've heard so much about you and your ants.</font>

468
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:46,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are ants anyway?</font>

469
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:47,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we have 'em down here?</font>

470
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:49,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so. No.</font>

471
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:51,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's too bad.</font>

472
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope.</font>

473
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to be Hope.</font>

474
00:31:56,824 --> 00:31:59,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She talked about you every day.</font>

475
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:00,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's strange...</font>

476
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she never said anything about you.</font>

477
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think I would have told
my kid either.</font>

478
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wild stuff.
- Funny.</font>

479
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:11,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How wild?</font>

480
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:15,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very wild, Henry. Yeah.</font>

481
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:19,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Krylar, we need your help.</font>

482
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:24,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet, after all we've been through,
together...</font>

483
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:25,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just ask me.</font>

484
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:27,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, how can I help?</font>

485
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But...</font>

486
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is anyone starving? I'm starving.</font>

487
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:32,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boys...</font>

488
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:34,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>

489
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:44,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't know anything.</font>

490
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:47,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About... anything.</font>

491
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:48,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then get them out of here.</font>

492
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:51,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

493
00:32:51,717 --> 00:32:53,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.</font>

494
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just trying to find our family.</font>

495
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:56,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a map?</font>

496
00:32:56,847 --> 00:32:58,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we wanna do is go...</font>

497
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:02,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait. Don't shoot.</font>

498
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:03,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're with us.</font>

499
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:06,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that building alive?</font>

500
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:08,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yours are dead?</font>

501
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Excuse me.</font>

502
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just wanna go home.</font>

503
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:20,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least you still have a home.</font>

504
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened here?</font>

505
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Conqueror burned our homes.</font>

506
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our stories.</font>

507
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:40,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.</font>

508
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of us escaped...</font>

509
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">found others on the run.</font>

510
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gathered who we could to fight.</font>

511
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was never enough.</font>

512
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

513
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can help.</font>

514
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cassie...
- Dad, you're an Avenger.</font>

515
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need help.</font>

516
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:05,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. What I need to do is get you home.</font>

517
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:06,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you wanna help?</font>

518
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:08,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know anything about this place.</font>

519
00:34:08,383 --> 00:34:10,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.</font>

520
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:11,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have we been gone for 10 seconds?</font>

521
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:12,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or have we been gone for 10 years?</font>

522
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:13,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about your mom right now.</font>

523
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:16,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you imagine what she must be...
- Don't use Mom as an excuse.</font>

524
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:18,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You just don't care.
- No, I do care.</font>

525
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:20,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you wanna help. I do.</font>

526
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is not our fight.</font>

527
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:25,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.</font>

528
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:27,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

529
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:32,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you look at me?</font>

530
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:35,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's disappointed in you.</font>

531
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:37,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got that. Yeah. Thank you.</font>

532
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

533
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll talk about it later.</font>

534
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:41,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, let's just find the others.</font>

535
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:44,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one knows this place
better than Janet.</font>

536
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say?</font>

537
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

538
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:50,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That name.</font>

539
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:53,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet Van Dyne.</font>

540
00:34:53,183 --> 00:34:54,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is she?</font>

541
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?</font>

542
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know her.</font>

543
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:00,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She shouldn't be here.</font>

544
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:04,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.</font>

545
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:05,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, thank you.</font>

546
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:09,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you haven't had this, don't try it...</font>

547
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:11,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless you want to change your life.</font>

548
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:26,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.</font>

549
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two of them.</font>

550
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:30,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Human, like us.</font>

551
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:31,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Human, that's the word.</font>

552
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:35,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.</font>

553
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:36,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Human.</font>

554
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:39,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you not human?</font>

555
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not technically, but yes.</font>

556
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:43,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the ways that matter.</font>

557
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:48,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

558
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:53,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us talk.</font>

559
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?</font>

560
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:04,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I remember correctly, you left.</font>

561
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:08,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left all of us.</font>

562
00:36:08,932 --> 00:36:10,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With him.</font>

563
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet, what is he talking about?</font>

564
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't tell them about him.</font>

565
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:22,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you say anything...</font>

566
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:25,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about what you did here?</font>

567
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:29,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many people died because of you?</font>

568
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:37,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does your family even know who you are?</font>

569
00:36:40,717 --> 00:36:41,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mommy...</font>

570
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:45,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is full of secrets.</font>

571
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:46,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lying.</font>

572
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lie.</font>

573
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:50,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot.</font>

574
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not about this.</font>

575
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:57,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let them go.</font>

576
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just wants me.</font>

577
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:02,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you want them.</font>

578
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:05,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So they're coming too.</font>

579
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:10,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Along with those other friends of yours.</font>

580
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard about them.</font>

581
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:15,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he did too.</font>

582
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:19,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he sent the Hunter.</font>

583
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of hunter?</font>

584
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:24,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a man. Not a machine.</font>

585
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:28,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mechanized organism designed only...</font>

586
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:30,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for killing.</font>

587
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:34,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they?</font>

588
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:35,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No clue.</font>

589
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead.</font>

590
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably dead.</font>

591
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:57,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so sad when all of this...</font>

592
00:37:58,093 --> 00:37:59,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could have been avoided, Janet.</font>

593
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:02,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give him what he wants.</font>

594
00:38:06,144 --> 00:38:07,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to you?</font>

595
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:13,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We fought against him.</font>

596
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can be very persuasive.</font>

597
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:20,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's pay him a visit.</font>

598
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we're done here.</font>

599
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:45,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can that ship get us out of here?</font>

600
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:49,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover me?</font>

601
00:38:49,274 --> 00:38:50,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always.</font>

602
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, take the helm.</font>

603
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.</font>

604
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:31,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are the controls?</font>

605
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are the controls.</font>

606
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:37,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

607
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:39,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.</font>

608
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the bike alive?</font>

609
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands, all the way in!</font>

610
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like stuffing a turkey.</font>

611
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:11,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really, him?
- He used to be charming.</font>

612
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:12,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That guy?</font>

613
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was down here for 30 years, Henry.</font>

614
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I had needs.
- Oh, my God.</font>

615
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:18,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I get it. I've got needs too.</font>

616
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:19,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

617
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had dinner with someone a few times.</font>

618
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:23,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name was Linda.</font>

619
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It didn't work out.</font>

620
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:27,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What went wrong?</font>

621
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:29,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wasn't you, baby.</font>

622
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
- All right.</font>

623
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:37,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And, Xolum.
- Right here.</font>

624
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:40,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take them as far away from here as you can.</font>

625
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- What?</font>

626
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:44,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.</font>

627
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You led them straight to us.</font>

628
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.</font>

629
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take as many as you can.</font>

630
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll hold them off.</font>

631
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

632
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:27,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Hurry, hurry!</font>

633
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:29,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta go! We gotta go!</font>

634
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:30,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on. Get on now!</font>

635
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:32,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go now. Now!</font>

636
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:51,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

637
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:10,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie, let's go!</font>

638
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the sanctuary.</font>

639
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:20,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for my message.</font>

640
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Veb, we're leaving.
- No. No, wait!</font>

641
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:25,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Move! Move!
- All my friends.</font>

642
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:48,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Give up the travelers.</i></font>

643
00:42:48,786 --> 00:42:50,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Conqueror will show you mercy.</i></font>

644
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:51,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know his mercy.</font>

645
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:06,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay here. I'm...</font>

646
00:43:07,598 --> 00:43:08,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie?</font>

647
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:11,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

648
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:35,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I have a suit.</font>

649
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:37,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I noticed.</font>

650
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yes.</font>

651
00:43:41,593 --> 00:43:42,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, momentum, right?</font>

652
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:45,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.</font>

653
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:46,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how to do it, Dad.</font>

654
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:47,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you? Really?
- Yes.</font>

655
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.</font>

656
00:43:48,935 --> 00:43:50,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I messed up on the timing.</font>

657
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:51,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump...</font>

658
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:57,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like that.</font>

659
00:43:57,903 --> 00:43:59,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see what I did? You see what I did?</font>

660
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You're like this small.</font>

661
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:02,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I jumped and tapped.</font>

662
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:15,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jentorra, we have to go.</font>

663
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the ship!</font>

664
00:45:25,415 --> 00:45:28,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.</i></font>

665
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:31,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I've been waiting a long time for this.</i></font>

666
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:33,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

667
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:35,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is someone in there?</font>

668
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:38,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, yes.</i></font>

669
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:40,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The destiny you cannot escape.</i></font>

670
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:44,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Our fates have always been forged together...</i></font>

671
00:45:46,438 --> 00:45:48,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>ever since that day we met.</i></font>

672
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:52,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott Lang.</font>

673
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away from us!</font>

674
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:55,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The day you broke me.</i></font>

675
00:45:58,285 --> 00:46:00,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Banished me down here.
- Wait.</i></font>

676
00:46:02,497 --> 00:46:03,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darren?</font>

677
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:06,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surprised to see me?</font>

678
00:46:08,713 --> 00:46:09,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

679
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:11,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the bee guy?</font>

680
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:13,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's the bee guy?
- Cassie?</font>

681
00:46:13,468 --> 00:46:15,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost didn't recognize you.</font>

682
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:17,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you not dead?</font>

683
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:19,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I became the ultimate weapon.</font>

684
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:23,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what this is?</font>

685
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:25,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Darren.</font>

686
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:30,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darren is dead!</font>

687
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is only M.O.D.O.K.!</font>

688
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's no place you can run, Scott.</font>

689
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:38,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not from me.</font>

690
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not from him.</font>

691
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:44,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the future.</font>

692
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the past.</font>

693
00:46:46,879 --> 00:46:50,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now all he needs is you.</font>

694
00:46:56,473 --> 00:46:57,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom?</font>

695
00:46:58,058 --> 00:46:59,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's after Scott and Cassie?</font>

696
00:47:01,646 --> 00:47:03,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to find them.</font>

697
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something I have to do first.</font>

698
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:07,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They could be dead!</font>

699
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:09,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope, please.</font>

700
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're still hiding things from us.</font>

701
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:13,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am trying to protect you.</font>

702
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:14,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From what?</font>

703
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you so afraid of?</font>

704
00:47:32,012 --> 00:47:33,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Third time in jail?</font>

705
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:36,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4.</font>

706
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And here we are again.</i></font>

707
00:47:48,405 --> 00:47:49,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Face to face.</font>

708
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:53,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a face.</font>

709
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:56,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a big face.</font>

710
00:47:56,789 --> 00:47:58,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you just a floating head?</font>

711
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.</font>

712
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:03,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.</font>

713
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But the Conqueror found me.</i></font>

714
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Rebuilt me.</i></font>

715
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Made me the ultimate weapon.</i></font>

716
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A mechanized organism designed
only for...</i></font>

717
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:15,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">M.O.D.O.K.?</font>

718
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it. It's an acronym.</font>

719
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:21,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an acronym.</font>

720
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.</font>

721
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:27,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.</font>

722
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:31,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
- Just now noticing the baby legs.</font>

723
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:33,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not baby legs.</font>

724
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little bit like a Björn.</font>

725
00:48:34,914 --> 00:48:36,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you're so smart.</font>

726
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.</font>

727
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:41,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who stole my whole life.</font>

728
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:42,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I did it.</font>

729
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you here.</font>

730
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:47,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found your signal, Cassie.</font>

731
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:50,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.</font>

732
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:55,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're looking at a man set free.</font>

733
00:48:56,729 --> 00:49:00,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.</font>

734
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:04,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All for him.</font>

735
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:10,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.</font>

736
00:49:13,414 --> 00:49:15,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this place?</font>

737
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:18,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He said he was a traveler.</i></font>

738
00:49:18,586 --> 00:49:21,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A scientist who crashed off course.</font>

739
00:49:29,223 --> 00:49:30,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He had a ship...</i></font>

740
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">beyond anything I had ever seen.</font>

741
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:37,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A ship that could travel the Multiverse.</i></font>

742
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Multiverse?</font>

743
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:42,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As in alternate dimensions?</font>

744
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parallel realities?</font>

745
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:46,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't believe it at first.</font>

746
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:49,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's real.</font>

747
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:53,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just like we theorized.</i></font>

748
00:49:55,627 --> 00:49:57,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can this take us home?</font>

749
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:00,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can take you anywhere.</font>

750
00:50:19,904 --> 00:50:21,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'd never met anyone like him.</i></font>

751
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:26,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He felt so...</i></font>

752
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:27,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>lost.</i></font>

753
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:30,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I guess we both were.</i></font>

754
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But we had a way out.</i></font>

755
00:50:35,213 --> 00:50:37,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We tried everything...</i></font>

756
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to recharge his ship's energy core.</i></font>

757
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:47,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Nothing worked.</i></font>

758
00:50:49,102 --> 00:50:53,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.</i></font>

759
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:56,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lied to Hope.</font>

760
00:51:01,032 --> 00:51:02,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told her I was coming home.</font>

761
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:08,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see her by the door.</font>

762
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waiting for me.</font>

763
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the last thing I did...</font>

764
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:22,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was lie to her.</font>

765
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:27,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just thought I'd have more time.</font>

766
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:34,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can give that to you.</font>

767
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:37,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time.</font>

768
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:42,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not what you think it is.</font>

769
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:48,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a cage.</font>

770
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:51,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it does everything it can...</font>

771
00:51:51,963 --> 00:51:53,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to break you.</font>

772
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:59,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...</font>

773
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:02,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just how small...</font>

774
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it always was.</font>

775
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:11,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to get out of here.</font>

776
00:52:15,238 --> 00:52:16,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gonna open the door...</font>

777
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:19,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you'll be there.</font>

778
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:25,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise.</font>

779
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:32,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's get to work.
- Okay.</font>

780
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:38,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It took ages, but we did it.</i></font>

781
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We brought it back to life.</font>

782
00:52:44,145 --> 00:52:45,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go home.</font>

783
00:52:50,193 --> 00:52:52,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>His ship was neurokinetic.</i></font>

784
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:54,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Connected to his thoughts.</i></font>

785
00:52:58,619 --> 00:52:59,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When I touched it...</i></font>

786
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:03,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw his mind.</font>

787
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:05,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I felt...</i></font>

788
00:53:07,462 --> 00:53:08,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>what he had done.</i></font>

00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:14,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Entire worlds...</i></font>

791
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:21,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Gone, like they never even existed.</i></font>

792
00:53:39,956 --> 00:53:40,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet?</font>

793
00:53:45,753 --> 00:53:46,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can leave.</font>

794
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:50,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now.</font>

795
00:53:55,181 --> 00:53:56,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is Kang?</font>

796
00:54:02,147 --> 00:54:03,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who I need to be.</font>

797
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:09,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't crash here.</font>

798
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was exiled here.</font>

799
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:15,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Outside space and time.</font>

800
00:54:16,913 --> 00:54:18,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only place...</font>

801
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:21,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that could hold him.</font>

802
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:23,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exiled?</font>

803
00:54:24,254 --> 00:54:25,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By who?</font>

804
00:54:26,089 --> 00:54:27,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

805
00:54:29,593 --> 00:54:31,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they sabotaged his ship.</font>

806
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And trapped him here.</font>

807
00:54:36,893 --> 00:54:38,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And because of me...</font>

808
00:54:39,687 --> 00:54:41,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he was getting out.</font>

809
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:42,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet?</font>

810
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay away.</font>

811
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:53,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saved my life.</font>

812
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a promise.</font>

813
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:08,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me take you home.</font>

814
00:55:10,763 --> 00:55:11,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then?</font>

815
00:55:13,975 --> 00:55:15,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you going to do?</font>

816
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Win.</font>

817
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:50,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you time isn't what you think.</font>

818
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:53,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can make it...</font>

819
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you never left her.</font>

820
00:55:58,191 --> 00:56:01,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope is going to open the door...</font>

821
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you'll be there.</font>

822
00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:07,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how many worlds will die...</font>

823
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:10,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you get out?</font>

824
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yours.</font>

825
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll never know.</font>

826
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:23,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you want to see your daughter again?</font>

827
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:27,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't let you leave.</font>

828
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:32,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think you can stop me?</font>

829
00:56:50,163 --> 00:56:51,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it to me, Janet.</font>

830
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it to me!</font>

831
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:57,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.</font>

832
00:56:58,422 --> 00:56:59,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

833
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:05,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Hope.</font>

834
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:08,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

835
00:57:36,214 --> 00:57:37,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I blew up his core.</i></font>

836
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:40,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Cut him off from time.</i></font>

837
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:43,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And trapped us both down here forever.</i></font>

838
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:47,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I gave him back enough.</font>

839
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:49,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that he had his suit back...</font>

840
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:52,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he became what he always was.</font>

841
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:55,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A conqueror.</i></font>

842
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:58,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's got weapons and technology...</i></font>

843
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:02,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>centuries beyond anything we can dream of.</i></font>

844
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:06,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He took his prison and made it his empire.</i></font>

845
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:11,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spent years fighting him...</font>

846
00:58:11,211 --> 00:58:13,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">running from him, hiding from him.</font>

847
00:58:15,506 --> 00:58:16,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then you saved me.</font>

848
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:21,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You brought me home.</font>

849
00:58:23,182 --> 00:58:24,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I didn't deserve it.</font>

850
00:58:26,018 --> 00:58:29,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I unleashed a monster on this place...</font>

851
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and ran away.</font>

852
00:58:32,025 --> 00:58:35,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet, you couldn't have known.</font>

853
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I never told you.</font>

854
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted to forget.</font>

855
00:58:44,038 --> 00:58:46,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted to be your mom again.</font>

856
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:54,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.</font>

857
00:58:55,676 --> 00:58:58,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you are not alone now.</font>

858
00:59:01,975 --> 00:59:03,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll stop him together.</font>

859
00:59:04,435 --> 00:59:05,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's after the core.</font>

860
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.</font>

861
00:59:09,566 --> 00:59:12,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.</font>

862
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:14,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And a head start.
- Exactly.</font>

863
00:59:15,114 --> 00:59:16,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We gotta get out of here.
- Hope.</font>

864
00:59:17,241 --> 00:59:18,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He cannot get out.</font>

865
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:41,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're an interesting man...</font>

866
00:59:45,606 --> 00:59:47,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott Lang.</font>

867
00:59:48,692 --> 00:59:49,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know who you are...</font>

868
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:52,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you've made a big mistake.</font>

869
00:59:53,488 --> 00:59:54,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

870
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an Avenger.</font>

871
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've called the other Avengers...</font>

872
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:00,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're an Avenger?</font>

873
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I killed you before?</font>

874
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:07,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

875
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all blur together after a while.</font>

876
01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:13,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the one with the hammer?</font>

877
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:15,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's Thor.</font>

878
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We get confused a lot.</font>

879
01:00:18,308 --> 01:00:20,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Similar body types.
Who are you?</font>

880
01:00:22,938 --> 01:00:24,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a man...</font>

881
01:00:24,856 --> 01:00:26,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's lost a lot of time.</font>

882
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:28,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you.</font>

883
01:00:30,446 --> 01:00:32,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we can help each other with that.</font>

884
01:00:34,242 --> 01:00:36,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.</font>

885
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:38,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he stole something from me.</font>

886
01:00:40,582 --> 01:00:42,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not speak when I am in the room.</font>

887
01:00:50,843 --> 01:00:53,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.</font>

888
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:55,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Janet too?</font>

889
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:58,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does everyone down here know Janet?</font>

890
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:01,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't tell you about me?</font>

891
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:07,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess that's not a surprise.</font>

892
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:12,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet stole something from me.</font>

893
01:01:13,618 --> 01:01:16,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ticket out of here.</font>

894
01:01:18,957 --> 01:01:21,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're the only one
who can steal it back.</font>

895
01:01:22,253 --> 01:01:23,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why would I do that?</font>

896
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:26,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you want to get out of here.</font>

897
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:31,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I need to get out of here.</font>

898
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I know how it ends.</font>

899
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:37,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How what ends?</font>

900
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:41,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it.</font>

901
01:01:45,403 --> 01:01:48,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't live in a straight line.</font>

902
01:01:51,284 --> 01:01:52,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with time...</font>

903
01:01:53,787 --> 01:01:54,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's hard...</font>

904
01:01:55,372 --> 01:01:57,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to skip to the end.</font>

905
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:01,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if you want to stop what's coming...</font>

906
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:04,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and trust me...</font>

907
01:02:04,257 --> 01:02:05,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you do...</font>

908
01:02:07,802 --> 01:02:09,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the only shot you have.</font>

909
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:11,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's coming?</font>

910
01:02:13,975 --> 01:02:14,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

911
01:02:16,896 --> 01:02:19,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of me.</font>

912
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:27,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They exiled me, down here.</font>

913
01:02:30,702 --> 01:02:32,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're afraid of me.</font>

914
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:41,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm the man who can get you home.</font>

915
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, do we have a deal?</font>

916
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't think we do.</font>

917
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

918
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:11,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me make this easy for you.</font>

919
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:13,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will bring me what I need...</font>

920
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:15,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...</font>

921
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:18,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then make you relive that moment...</font>

922
01:03:18,296 --> 01:03:21,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over and over again in time, endlessly...</font>

923
01:03:21,758 --> 01:03:24,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until you beg me to kill you.</font>

924
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we understand?</font>

925
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:31,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do this.</font>

926
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a man who likes to be understood.</font>

927
01:03:40,946 --> 01:03:41,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>

928
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:44,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't listen to him.</font>

929
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:47,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

930
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:48,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we can talk about this.</font>

931
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:50,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do it!</font>

932
01:03:50,664 --> 01:03:52,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really should do it.</font>

933
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:53,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

934
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:57,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my daughter, please.</font>

935
01:03:57,339 --> 01:03:59,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?</font>

936
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:00,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please!</font>

937
01:04:01,134 --> 01:04:02,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'm lying?</font>

938
01:04:03,512 --> 01:04:05,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I look like a liar to you?</font>

939
01:04:06,974 --> 01:04:07,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

940
01:04:08,142 --> 01:04:09,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.</font>

941
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll do it. Just let her go.</font>

942
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her go. Let her go!</font>

943
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're out of your league.</font>

944
01:04:27,288 --> 01:04:28,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ant-Man.</font>

945
01:04:34,546 --> 01:04:36,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just be glad I need you.</font>

946
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:53,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch her again.</font>

947
01:04:53,483 --> 01:04:55,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then give me what I need.</font>

948
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it?</font>

949
01:05:39,618 --> 01:05:41,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

950
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:43,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a multiversal engine core.</font>

951
01:05:45,248 --> 01:05:48,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.</font>

952
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:52,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then Janet blew it up.</font>

953
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in that?</font>

954
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is that.</font>

955
01:05:59,931 --> 01:06:01,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we have to get to the center.</font>

956
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:04,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good to know.</font>

957
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:09,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.</font>

958
01:06:09,441 --> 01:06:12,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once you're inside, find the core...</font>

959
01:06:12,237 --> 01:06:13,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and size it back down.</font>

960
01:06:14,113 --> 01:06:15,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does it look like?</font>

961
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.</font>

962
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:19,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll know it when you see it.</font>

963
01:06:19,911 --> 01:06:22,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in and out as fast as you can.</font>

964
01:06:22,373 --> 01:06:25,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.</font>

965
01:06:28,587 --> 01:06:29,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better hurry.</font>

966
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:31,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

967
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:35,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

968
01:06:36,054 --> 01:06:37,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all my fault.</font>

969

01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:23,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Scott.</font>

1104
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:26,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Janet.
- Give that to me.</font>

1105
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:27,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We have to go now.
- No.</font>

1106
01:14:27,695 --> 01:14:28,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got Cassie.</font>

1107
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...</font>

1108
01:14:33,242 --> 01:14:35,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you cannot give that to him.</font>

1109
01:14:35,536 --> 01:14:36,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't trust her.</font>

1110
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:42,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet has a way of...</font>

1111
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:46,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">changing her mind.</font>

1112
01:14:53,806 --> 01:14:56,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Jellybean.</font>

1113
01:15:02,482 --> 01:15:03,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

1114
01:15:07,362 --> 01:15:08,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's it gonna be, Scott?</font>

1115
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:14,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, well.</i></font>

1116
01:15:15,997 --> 01:15:18,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>If it isn't my old mentor.</i></font>

1117
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hi, Hank.</i></font>

1118
01:15:27,801 --> 01:15:28,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darren?</font>

1119
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...</font>

1120
01:15:32,057 --> 01:15:33,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, Darren.</font>

1121
01:15:34,726 --> 01:15:36,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to you?</font>

1122
01:15:36,227 --> 01:15:38,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the ultimate weapon!</font>

1123
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:50,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I need to take it?</font>

1124
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:52,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is my daughter?</font>

1125
01:15:54,665 --> 01:15:55,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott.</font>

1126
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

1127
01:15:58,919 --> 01:16:01,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a deal.</font>

1128
01:16:01,755 --> 01:16:03,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be fine without you.</font>

1129
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So long, Hank.</i></font>

1130
01:16:37,837 --> 01:16:38,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry.</font>

1131
01:16:46,012 --> 01:16:48,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left me right here to die.</font>

1132
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:53,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see how they do.</font>

1133
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you see?</font>

1134
01:18:04,974 --> 01:18:08,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.</font>

1135
01:18:10,312 --> 01:18:11,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I always wondered.</font>

1136
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:17,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you touched my mind...</font>

1137
01:18:28,624 --> 01:18:30,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what did you see?</font>

1138
01:18:31,168 --> 01:18:32,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A monster...</font>

1139
01:18:33,879 --> 01:18:35,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who thinks he's a god.</font>

1140
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:38,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you can see time the way I do...</font>

1141
01:18:38,343 --> 01:18:40,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't get to close your eyes.</font>

1142
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:43,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're the only one who sees?</font>

1143
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:48,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the only one that can see it's broken.</font>

1144
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:49,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who broke it?</font>

1145
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:53,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

1146
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every version of me.</font>

1147
01:18:58,532 --> 01:18:59,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My variants.</font>

1148
01:19:00,701 --> 01:19:02,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throughout the Multiverse.</font>

1149
01:19:04,371 --> 01:19:07,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Playing with time, like children.</font>

1150
01:19:09,961 --> 01:19:13,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I saw how it ends.</font>

1151
01:19:14,299 --> 01:19:16,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw their chaos...</font>

1152
01:19:17,093 --> 01:19:20,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">spreading across realities.</font>

1153
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:23,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Universes colliding.</font>

1154
01:19:24,935 --> 01:19:26,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Endless incursions.</font>

1155
01:19:27,521 --> 01:19:29,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw the Multiverse.</font>

1156
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:32,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it was dying.</font>

1157
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:35,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All because of them.</font>

1158
01:19:36,615 --> 01:19:38,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I took control.</font>

1159
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:40,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean you started a war.</font>

1160
01:19:41,829 --> 01:19:45,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.</font>

1161
01:19:46,209 --> 01:19:47,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what monsters do.</font>

1162
01:19:48,002 --> 01:19:50,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what conquerors do.</font>

1163
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:54,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They burn the broken world.</font>

1164
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:57,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they make a new one.</font>

1165
01:19:58,055 --> 01:20:00,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.</font>

1166
01:20:03,061 --> 01:20:05,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You only want revenge because they beat you.</font>

1167
01:20:06,314 --> 01:20:07,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you lost.</font>

1168
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:09,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have lost.</font>

1169
01:20:11,152 --> 01:20:15,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea what I have lost.</font>

1170
01:20:16,826 --> 01:20:20,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I will burn them out of time...</font>

1171
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:22,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for what they've done to me.</font>

1172
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:27,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be wiping out entire timelines.</font>

1173
01:20:27,921 --> 01:20:31,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murdering trillions of people.</font>

1174
01:20:32,467 --> 01:20:34,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish that mattered, Janet.</font>

1175
01:20:56,953 --> 01:20:58,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, God. What am I doing?</i></font>

1176
01:21:09,216 --> 01:21:10,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What?</i></font>

1177
01:21:14,597 --> 01:21:15,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hank!</i></font>

1178
01:21:19,227 --> 01:21:20,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are these your ants?</font>

1179
01:21:21,188 --> 01:21:22,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the ant farm?</font>

1180
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:24,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Scott, they're my ants.</font>

1181
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:26,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you find them down here?</font>

1182
01:21:27,695 --> 01:21:30,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.</font>

1183
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:35,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.</i></font>

1184
01:21:35,244 --> 01:21:36,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some kind of interference.</font>

1185
01:21:36,996 --> 01:21:38,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1186
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:40,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it wasn't.</font>

1187
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:42,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the ants.</font>

1188
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:47,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were reaching out the whole time.</font>

1189
01:21:49,052 --> 01:21:52,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.</i></font>

1190
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:55,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...</i></font>

1191
01:21:56,476 --> 01:21:59,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>expanding their knowledge,
their science...</i></font>

1192
01:21:59,772 --> 01:22:02,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.</i></font>

1193
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I didn't find them.</i></font>

1194
01:22:05,277 --> 01:22:06,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They found me.</font>

1195
01:22:08,614 --> 01:22:10,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you they were smart.</font>

1196
01:22:12,703 --> 01:22:17,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-2 civilization.</font>

1197
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...</font>

1198
01:22:21,045 --> 01:22:23,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but we could learn a lot from these...
- Dad.</font>

1199
01:22:25,008 --> 01:22:26,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, they're my ants.</font>

1200
01:22:27,051 --> 01:22:29,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And ants don't give up.</font>

1201
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care who this guy is.</font>

1202
01:22:30,638 --> 01:22:31,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care what he can do.</font>

1203
01:22:32,016 --> 01:22:33,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting Cassie.</font>

1204
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:35,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how do we even the odds against Kang?</font>

1205
01:22:38,772 --> 01:22:40,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got some ideas.</font>

1206
01:22:40,357 --> 01:22:41,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you thinking?</font>

1207
01:22:41,525 --> 01:22:44,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as a great writer once said...</font>

1208
01:22:45,488 --> 01:22:47,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"There's always room to grow."</font>

1209
01:22:50,118 --> 01:22:51,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You read my book?</font>

1210
01:22:51,911 --> 01:22:55,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every goddamn word.</font>

1211
01:22:57,918 --> 01:22:59,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's go to work.</font>

1212
01:23:12,225 --> 01:23:14,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! I'm sorry.</font>

1213
01:23:14,227 --> 01:23:16,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was probably terrifying.</font>

1214
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:17,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

1215
01:23:18,232 --> 01:23:19,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm rescuing you.</font>

1216
01:23:19,776 --> 01:23:20,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

1217
01:23:22,362 --> 01:23:23,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good question.</font>

1218
01:23:24,614 --> 01:23:27,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this thing have like a key?</font>

1219
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:29,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a card? Like a room key?</font>

1220
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know, like a...</font>

1221
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:33,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

1222
01:23:41,508 --> 01:23:42,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Jump and tap.</i></font>

1223
01:23:51,519 --> 01:23:52,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jentorra.</font>

1224
01:23:53,979 --> 01:23:55,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I got your people hurt.</font>

1225
01:23:57,483 --> 01:23:58,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I help?</font>

1226
01:24:03,657 --> 01:24:04,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1227
01:24:04,866 --> 01:24:06,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's hurt 'em back.</font>

1228
01:24:07,244 --> 01:24:08,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, you're cool.</font>

1229
01:24:09,372 --> 01:24:10,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a plan?</font>

1230
01:24:10,498 --> 01:24:11,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeing you was basically my plan.</font>

1231
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:13,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a plan?</font>

1232
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:16,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.</font>

1233
01:24:16,838 --> 01:24:18,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then free our people
from the detention cells below...</font>

1234
01:24:18,673 --> 01:24:19,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and launch a counteroffensive from within.</font>

1235
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:22,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?</font>

1236
01:24:22,428 --> 01:24:23,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

1237
01:24:23,554 --> 01:24:25,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Great.</font>

1238
01:24:29,435 --> 01:24:32,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built an empire down here, Janet.</font>

01:55:17,621 --> 01:55:21,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the exiled one is dead.</font>

1511
01:55:23,503 --> 01:55:25,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure he's dead?</font>

1512
01:55:26,047 --> 01:55:28,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.</font>

1513
01:55:29,551 --> 01:55:32,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.</font>

1514
01:55:33,013 --> 01:55:35,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of us...</font>

1515
01:55:36,517 --> 01:55:38,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">killed him.</font>

1516
01:55:40,521 --> 01:55:41,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They did.</font>

1517
01:55:42,773 --> 01:55:47,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.</font>

1518
01:55:47,988 --> 01:55:49,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we let them...</font>

1519
01:55:49,907 --> 01:55:51,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they will take...</font>

1520
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everything...</font>

1521
01:55:55,705 --> 01:55:57,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've built.</font>

1522
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So let's stop wasting time.</font>

1523
01:56:04,923 --> 01:56:06,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're late.</font>

1524
01:56:08,135 --> 01:56:10,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many did you call?</font>

1525
01:56:10,804 --> 01:56:13,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of us.</font>

1526
02:03:36,166 --> 02:03:41,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time is everything.</font>

1527
02:03:46,427 --> 02:03:49,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It shapes our lives.</font>

1528
02:03:50,724 --> 02:03:54,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, perhaps, we can shape...</font>

1529
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it.</font>

1530
02:03:58,815 --> 02:03:59,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's him.</font>

1531
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:03,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.</font>

1532
02:04:05,323 --> 02:04:06,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is.</font>
