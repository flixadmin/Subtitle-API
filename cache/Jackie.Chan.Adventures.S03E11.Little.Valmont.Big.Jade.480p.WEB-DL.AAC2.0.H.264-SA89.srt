1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,774
(Alarm rings)

2
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,909
(Sirens)

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,578
Blast!

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,217
Blast!

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,261
Ugh!

6
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:32,698
Me, valmont, mastermind
of the dark hand,

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,467
fleeing authorities
like a common--

8
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,568
both: Oof!

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,370
You!
You!

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,141
The supplies for
my locator spell!

11
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:45,010
You shall suffer for
what you have done!

12
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,712
What I have done?

13
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:50,215
You transformed my enforcers
into samurai zombies!

14
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:54,153
I've been reduced
to performing
my own dirty work.

15
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,523
Return Finn, ratso,
and chow to me at once!

16
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,793
Heh! Why
would daolon wong
heed the demands

17
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,429
of an insignificant
pickpocket?

18
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:06,532
Uh...Because
I'm bigger than you!

19
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,300
Oh?

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,942
Aah!

21
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,044
Heh! Not anymore.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,685
Blaaast!

23
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,442
Come on.

24
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,915
No!

25
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,917
The whole time
we've been in America,

26
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,318
I haven't grown
one inch.

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm never gonna
grow up, Jackie!

28
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,055
Patience, Jade.

29
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,291
Enjoy your childhood
while it lasts.

30
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,693
Tsk! I've a billion years
of school left,

31
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,095
I can't reach anything
in the freezer,

32
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,164
and I never get invited
on your missions.

33
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,965
Way enjoyable.

34
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,267
Uncle: Hot cha!

35
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,805
(Whinnying)

36
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,143
Uncle's locator spell
is complete.

37
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,549
The horse is somewhere
in London, england.

38
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,323
(british accent) Cheerio!
Either of you chaps

39
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,359
fancy a spot of tea before
we hop across the pond?

40
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,628
Captain black
has a jet
waiting for us.

41
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,830
And he's agreed
to look after Jade.

42
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,032
(british accent) What?

43
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,034
(american accent)
I mean, what?!

44
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,672
Come, Jackie!
We must hurry!

45
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,476
Captain black will be here
any minute, Jade.

46
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,682
Then I don't
have much time.

47
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,186
Me, valmont,

48
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:45,224
forced to ask Jackie chan
for help again!

49
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,194
Quickly! We must
not let daolon wong

50
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:52,231
claim the healing power
of the horse.

51
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,503
No. We mustn't.

52
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,609
Maybe Jackie'll let me
come to London

53
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,612
if this grow-up spell
makes me older!

54
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,357
Work already!

55
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,963
Oh, whatever, I'm going
to London anyway.

56
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,171
Unh! Uncle, have
you ever considered

57
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,674
traveling lightly? Unh!

58
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,509
Uncle is
traveling lightly.

59
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,578
Brought only
one cauldron.

60
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,848
Jade: Unh! Nngh!

61
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,917
It may not be
first class...

62
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,955
Valmont: Ow!

63
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,028
Aah!
Aah!

64
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,529
What are you
doing here?

65
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,464
What are you
doing small?

66
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,002
Captain black,
is Jade staying
out of trouble?

67
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,672
Uh, actually...

68
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:10,042
(Muffled)
What?!
Where did she--ow!

69
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,677
Whoa!
Whoa!

70
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,646
Ohhh.

71
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,948
Heh heh!
Hey, Jackie.

72
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,017
Uh, she's with me.

73
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,154
Brilliant!
Now I have
a paper cut!

74
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:25,557
Ohh! Tohru, it is
your former boss!

75
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,759
Uh, half of him.

76
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,895
Valmont?
What happened?

77
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,064
Well, how should I know?
I must have nicked it

78
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,299
on one of the codger's
confounded books.

79
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,435
Boy genius,
what happened as in

80
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,137
how come you're
suddenly ordering
off the kid's menu?

81
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,440
Ohh, it's
- humiliating, really.

82
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,942
That batty old
wizard cursed me!

83
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,345
Oh! Daolon wong!

84
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,548
But the horse talisman
will heal me.

85
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,383
Tsk! News flash!

86
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,385
The talismans
are history.

87
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,287
The horse we're after
is an animal.

88
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,956
You'd best
watch your tone
with me, child!

89
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,592
Why should I, <i> child?</i>

90
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,862
B-b-because I am
bigger than you!

91
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,264
Ohh.

92
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,907
(Chanting)

93
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,310
While uncle and I
search for the horse,

94
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,813
you two will wait here
and stay out of trouble.

95
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,382
Ohhh.

96
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,449
Now see here,

97
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,851
just because I look
like a child

98
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,419
doesn't mean you can
treat me like one!

99
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,621
I am treating you
like a criminal.

100
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,023
Tohru will treat you
like a child.

101
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:36,561
Now, are you going
to be a good little boy?

102
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:41,867
¶ You're not the boss of me,
you're not the boss of me ¶

103
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,137
ohhh. Please behave.

104
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,076
And Jackie thinks
I'm a handful.

105
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,978
(Crash)

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,447
So, will you
take me to chan,

107
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,383
or shall I
ring room service
for some dessert?

108
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,485
Grrr.

109
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,788
Tsk, tsk. I'm just
a child, remember?

110
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,990
So am I, remember?

111
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,292
Now, tell tohru
you're sorry.

112
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,860
Why should I?

113
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,929
Because I'm bigger
than you!

114
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,866
Ohh! You are!

115
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,102
I am?

116
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,076
2 whole inches!
I'm getting older.

117
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,079
My grow-up spell's
working!

118
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,015
Grow-up spell?

119
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,384
Well, why didn't you
say something?

120
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,420
I command you
to cast this spell
on me immediately!

121
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,889
You don't own me.
Do it!

122
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,224
No!
Yes!

123
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,292
Never!
Now!

124
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,493
(Rings)

125
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,794
No dice!
Why, you--

126
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,097
hello? Jackie, you are
at the kempton racecourse?

127
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm just waiting
for uncle to pick
a noble winner.

128
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,037
(Chanting)

129
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,105
How are things
at day care?

130
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,741
Fine. Bye.

131
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,077
Call Jackie back.
Now that I'm older,

132
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,712
he'll probably
want me to help.

133
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,048
Hmm.

134
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,617
Where's valmont?

135
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,055
Where to, little man?

136
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,524
Kempton racecourse.
And if you call me
that again,

137
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,893
I shall have you
eliminated.

138
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,229
Remain here.
I will find him.

139
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,698
But my grow-up spell--

140
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,099
I'll be of voting age
before you know it.

141
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,201
No.

142
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,307
Tohru...

143
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,143
Do I look older to you?

144
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,751
Tsk!

145
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,021
This is <i> so</i>
ànot the growing up
I had in mind.

146
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,690
But spell or no spell,
we gotta grab valmont.

147
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,158
Unh!

148
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,628
Please, just
stay in the room.

149
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,738
Uh, don't think I can.

150
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,577
Royal medicine?

151
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,747
See? That is
the healer we seek.

152
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,350
Whoa!

153
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,264
Heh! I'm big-boned.

154
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:30,335
Jade, I promised Jackie
that I would keep you
our of trouble.

155
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,337
Tsk!
It's just not fair

156
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,172
that valmont gets
to play and I don't.

157
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,075
Sorry, t!

158
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,277
Ohhh.

159
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,212
Children.

160
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,014
Announcer on p.A.:
All jockeys and horses

161
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,883
to the starting
gate, please.

162
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,686
Prepare to race!

163
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,372
Gan! Ren! Chui!

164
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,746
I'm Finn.
He's ratso.
That's chow.

165
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,215
Would it kill you
to learn our names?

166
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,784
The horse!

167
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,122
Ok, stretch. Get off
your high horse--

168
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,824
unhand me,
you buffoons!

169
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,359
Whoa!
It's big v!

170
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,194
And he's mini.

171
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:32,330
Indeed. I attempted
to liberate you three,

172
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,599
and that rancid prune
of a wizard

173
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,535
burdened me with this...
Juvenile curse!

174
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,538
Ohh! You tried
to rescue us?

175
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,606
Aww!

176
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,241
We didn't know
you cared.

177
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,411
Forget the child!
Claim the horse!

178
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,914
Uh, I saw it first?

179
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,706
If you are here,
where is Jade?

180
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,742
Being humongous
rules--oof!

181
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,547
Except for the low
overhang problem.

182
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,328
Jackie! Stop
horsing around!

183
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,071
You will not survive

184
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:50,241
my fiery stare--oh!

185
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,343
See what you've
reduced me to?

186
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,479
I'm helping
chan--uhh!

187
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:58,249
Be careful.
I have a paper cut,
you know.

188
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:02,053
A mere flesh wound
is the least
of your worries.

189
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,355
(Dark warriors shouting)

190
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,857
Finn:
- Ease up, sweaty.

191
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,626
No one touches
little v with us around.

192
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,863
At least
valmont bothered
to learn our names.

193
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:16,367
And he's
so cute now...Boss.

194
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,969
I am not your boss.

195
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,772
Waah!

196
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,574
I am your master!

197
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,443
Dark warriors: Aah!

198
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,245
Finn: Yes, master!

199
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,547
Chow: We'll be
good, master!

200
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,982
Giddy up!

201
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,651
(Warriors moaning)

202
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,555
Fetch!

203
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,656
Yes, master!

204
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,724
You got it, master!

205
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,793
Whatever
you say, master!

206
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,396
You three
are pathetic!

207
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,967
Announcer on p.A.:
And they're off!

208
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,271
Aiyaaaa!

209
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,406
Clancy's brown fancy
out in front

210
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,942
with little blue sue
moving to the inside,

211
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,911
but...What's this?

212
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,580
Royal medicine
is taking the lead

213
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,182
with 2 jockeys.

214
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,550
Please tell
royal medicine's owner

215
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,585
I will send him
a check, thank you!

216
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,220
Astonishing!

217
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,023
Royal medicine has now
left the course entirely

218
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,425
with...It would seem...

219
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,495
Circus clowns in pursuit.

220
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,497
Jade? Jade?

221
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,300
Jade!

222
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,706
Whoa!

223
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,410
(Big Ben chimes)

224
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:36,047
Well, at least I'm getting
to see lon--ohh!

225
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,588
You will pay for that!

226
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,127
Nice shooting,
part--naah!

227
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,815
Well, isn't that just dandy?

228
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,218
The one time
I want chan to win,

229
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,686
he makes a hash of it!

230
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,622
Ha ha ha!

231
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,691
With the power
of healing,

232
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,328
I shall become
invincible--eh?

233
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,567
Say hello
to my friend flicka!

234
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,170
Aah!

235
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,172
Grrr!

236
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,441
Ohh!
Aiya!

237
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,176
Jade?!

238
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,379
Whoa, there,
little fella. It's ok.
Shh.

239
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,515
Jade! What happened
to you?

240
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,783
Attack!

241
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,719
Talk later!

242
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,920
Wahh!

243
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:51,122
You're going down,
queen Kong!

244
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,659
The bigger they are,
the harder they--

245
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,628
they didn't
see that coming?

246
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,531
Honestly!
Why did I ever
want them back?

247
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,635
Just call me Jade-zilla.

248
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,637
You will give me
the horse.

249
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,939
Try and take it, <i> tiny.</i>

250
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,875
Oh?
Perhaps you should
be picked upon

251
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,478
by something
your own size.

252
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,691
Big trouble.

253
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,997
(Roars)

254
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,202
Jade, step away
from the ogre!

255
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,805
So you can take him
on, tom thumb?

256
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,475
With the healing
horse in my pocket,
I can't get injured.

257
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,846
Ok, handsome,

258
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,115
this town ain't big enough
for the both of us.

259
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,862
Be careful, Jade!

260
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,066
The best offense
is a good--ohh!

261
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,101
My kingdom
for that horse!

262
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:13,338
I will not endure
another moment
of immaturity.

263
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,672
Hee-yah!

264
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,678
Grrargh! Hmm?

265
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,349
(Chanting)

266
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,584
Stone magic?

267
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,556
I shall immobilize
you first!

268
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,692
(Chanting)

269
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,595
(Both chanting)

270
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,771
(Both mumbling)

271
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,917
In case of emergency,
use the fire escape.

272
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,355
Valmont, come down!

273
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,923
You are going
to get--ohh!

274
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,727
Ohh--oop!

275
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,996
Aah!
Aah!

276
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,435
Nngh!
Mmnhh!

277
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,842
Well, this is
a demolition site.

278
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,110
Got you!

279
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,912
Ohh! My paper cut!

280
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,180
Oh, sorry!

281
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,683
Tricked you! The wound
is on my finger.

282
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,325
Tsk! I'm packing
horse power, which means...

283
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:45,163
¶ You can't hurt me! ¶

284
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,066
aah! Unh!

285
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,135
Tally ho!

286
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,905
(Neighs)

287
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,508
(Gulps) Now you can
hurt me. Whoa!

288
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,213
(Both grunting)

289
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:10,254
Rrgh! Hands off
Mrs. ed.

290
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,023
Right then,
break the curse.

291
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,891
Make me big!
Squander my youth!

292
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,227
Come on, heal me!

293
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,740
That's it?
- You healed my paper cut?

294
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:33,411
I am still a child,
you incompetent nag!

295
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,048
Let me go!

296
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,375
(Muttering)

297
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,512
Looks like
you're gonna need
a bigger ogre.

298
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,885
And it looks like
you are going to need

299
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,786
an antidote, Jade.

300
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,221
Ohhhh.

301
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,923
(Mumbling)

302
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,324
I'm not
the only one.

303
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,692
Valmont: Hello!

304
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,528
Take your blasted pony!

305
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,397
Just get me down from here!

306
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,671
Sorry I got too big
for my britches, t.

307
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,473
Valmont:
Chop-chop, old man!

308
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,608
I'm not getting
any younger, you know.

309
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,146
Manners! Or uncle will
put you back in diapers.

310
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,515
Ohh, all right, then.

311
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,530
Daddy's little boy
is all grown up!

312
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,800
Ta-ta! Must make up
for my wasted youth.

313
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,236
Lead a life
of crime, perhaps.

314
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:08,139
Valmont...

315
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,607
You're under arrest.

316
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,443
What? No!
Reverse the spell!

317
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:16,514
Please! I demand
to be tried as a minor!

318
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,983
See, Jade? Sometimes,

319
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,052
it is not good
to grow up too fast.

320
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,193
Hey, Jackie.

321
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,261
Yes?

322
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,362
Do you like
to ride a horse?

323
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,563
Yes, the horse is good.

324
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,765
I just don't know
how they can train them.

325
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,034
It's not a horse anymore,
it's like a dog.

326
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,703
It just follows
wherever I go.

327
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,605
I run, he runs,
I stop, he stops.

328
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,241
