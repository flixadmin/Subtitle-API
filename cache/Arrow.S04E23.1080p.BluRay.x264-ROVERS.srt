1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,491
This season on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,844
<i>The only way I know how to fight
the darkness is to be darkness.</i>

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,162
And I don't wanna be
that type of person anymore.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,362
<i>I'm running for mayor.</i>

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,763
And I promise you that I will never
stop fighting to save this city.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,610
<i>So, you're all fretting
about this city dying.</i>

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,486
<i>I'm here on behalf of an organization
that wants you to let it die.</i>

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,681
I'm Damien Darhk.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,170
<i>The type of magic he's using,</i>

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,681
<i>I've seen it take good people
and turn them dark.</i>

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,965
If I don't make it off this island,
you will go to Russia and find my parents.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,887
<i>If Darhk wins,
Laurel died for nothing.</i>

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,885
If you can channel light and hope,

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,646
<i>you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.</i>

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,642
- Do you remember what I promised you?
- A new beginning.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,009
Darhk plans to burn the world
in a nuclear fire.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,690
I'm assuming you know what Rubicon is.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,882
And I'm assuming
it's under Mr. Darhk's control.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,363
Every NATO ally, Rubicon has control
over all their nuclear systems.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,527
<i>You mean HIVE does.</i>

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,051
<i>If even one of those nukes hits...</i>

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,401
<i>He'll be unstoppable.</i>

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,687
- I think it worked.
- It worked.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,723
Rubicon's offline.

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,526
<i>"DARHK". Do you need a moment?</i>

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,688
No? Good.
'Cause I need you to do me a favor.

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,325
Go to hell.

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,411
Why bother?

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,483
I'm going to bring it to us.

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,683
- Get the hell out of here.
- Mom. Stop.

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,207
- Oh, my God!
- Mom, get back!

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,767
This is your mother? Oh, goodie.

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,851
On!

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,687
Persuading you to help me is
gonna be easier than I thought.

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,166
Helping you do what?

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,560
Your underground city's
already been destroyed.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,727
I'm still going forward.

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,400
<i>So, what, you kill my mother
if I don't help you destroy the world?</i>

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,568
Newsflash, my mother lives in the world.

40
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,685
Dying instantaneously in nuclear fire,
rather painless.

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,282
And then there's having your life-force
slowly sucked out like this...

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,091
9h, my God! Mom!

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,606
What's it gonna be, Ms. Smoak?

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,524
Look, I know you don't live here anymore,
but those were nice windows.

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,883
So unoriginal.

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,091
I'm now powered by the deaths
of tens of thousands of souls.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,806
There is nothing you can do to stop me.

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,487
Or should I say, us.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,007
<i>Stop!</i>

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,449
You let them go, or I kill your daughter.

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,007
You think I'm bluffing?

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,686
(%GRUNTS) %GROANS)

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,081
Let my daughter go.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,440
It's okay, sweetheart.

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,281
Everything's gonna be all right.

56
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,361
You okay?

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,011
When did this become your life?

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,611
Oh, my God.

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,125
Oh, my God, it's gone.
He took it. It's gone.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,282
- What's gone?
- The laptop with the anti-Rubicon program.

61
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,441
If Darhk has that...

62
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,041
He can launch all of
the world's nuclear missiles.

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,120
Looks like internal bleeding.

64
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,806
And possible broken ribs.

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,080
Hemothorax.

66
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,171
We have to relieve the pressure. Thea.

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,367
Felicity, we need you at your station.
We have to stop Rubicon.

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,684
Is he gonna be okay?

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,401
Put the gun down, Reiter.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,081
Ahh!

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,210
You think you can kill me, Ms. Venediktov?

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,890
I'm going to kill you!

73
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,764
You'll only kill yourself in the attempt.

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,610
Without these runes, the idol's power
would overwhelm my mind.

75
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,249
I don't care. It's worth it to stop you.

76
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,601
You see that, Reiter?

77
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,922
That plane filled with all of those people
you were keeping prisoner?

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,004
They're getting away. This is over.

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,087
It's not all of them, Mr. Queen.
The plane is too small, and it's not over.

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,127
All those deaths.
They give me power. And her...

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,041
Only madness.

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,091
How is he?

83
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,362
Well, he's stable. John said the next
30 minutes should tell us...

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,648
- Whether or not he'll make it.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,770
Hey, can I ask you something?
I know it might not be the best time.

86
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,564
Back at our place... My place, the...

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,727
The place, the loft...

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,921
Yeah?

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,562
Darhk's magic, it worked on you.
I thought...

90
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,966
You thought I found a way to stop it?

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,400
But that was before he grew so powerful.
It was the...

92
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,960
The hope you had in me
was able to counteract his magic.

93
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,248
And now my hope's not enough?

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,411
So, where are we?

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,443
Um, good news, bad news time.

96
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,610
Uh, good news is, is that Darhk
hasn't launched the nukes yet.

97
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,490
I think his hacker is still trying to
break our fail-safes.

98
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,921
Okay. And the bad news?

99
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,287
Well, the bad news is
that, with Rubicon offline,

100
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,811
- there is nothing for me to hack into.
- Right.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,764
- But your laptop has to have a GPS...
- Yeah.

102
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,445
I'm sure that you've already
started to try and do that.

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,966
- Okay.
- Yeah.

104
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,924
I thought you had shut Rubicon down.

105
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,765
Yeah, Felicity is working on
locating the laptop.

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,169
- Where's Sara?
- She's fine.

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,840
She's in an A.R.G.U.S. bunker
in Coast City.

108
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,482
With Darhk's anti-nuke bunker destroyed,
why is he moving forward with Genesis?

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
Machin killed his wife.

110
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,447
Well, his daughter still lives
in this world. He must know that.

111
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,291
He knows. He just, he doesn't care.
He's lost all hope.

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,606
Yeah, just like all of us.

113
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,444
But I thought he was the cynic.

114
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,608
It's not like John doesn't
have a point, Thea.

115
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,610
We are not finished yet.

116
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,643
Kewvord being "yet."
I got a 20 on the laptop.

117
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,847
Downtown, abandoned office building.

118
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,280
Let's move.

119
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,005
<i>Oven/vatch, there's no one here.</i>

120
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,884
That's impossible.
You're right on top of the GPS signal.

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,961
She's right.

122
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,366
Oh, my God.

123
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,726
- Oven/vatch.
- I see it.

124
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,364
Just over 15,000 ballistic missiles,
and they all just launched.

125
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,846
How much time do we have?

126
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,520
Two hours. Maybe less.

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,047
Confirmed. 15,434 birds in the air.

128
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,881
We need to set Defense Condition One
and get the President down to the PEOC.

129
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,047
Felicity?

130
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,247
He's got me completely locked out.

131
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,441
Okay, how many missiles are there?

132
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,682
D.O.D.'s working on it,
but the targets are worldwide.

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,008
- You said that we have two hours.
- The world has two hours.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,368
But I'm tracking a Minuteman ICBM
heading straight for Star City.

135
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,363
<i>It just launched out of
Warren Air Force Base in Colorado.</i>

136
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,607
Okay. Well, that's close.

137
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,365
Which means we only have 45 minutes.

138
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,769
- Taiana.
- I'm okay.

139
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,401
I think

140
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,931
I'm okay.

141
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,761
Taiana?

142
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,885
All right, where's the fire?

143
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,129
- What's this?
- The safest place within 100 miles

144
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,243
to survive a nuclear attack,
based on wind patterns and...

145
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,602
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
What are you talking about?

146
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,410
The world is gonna end in two hours.

147
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,282
I need you to take my mother there.
Can you do that?

148
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,127
Yeah, I will.

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,170
<i>"SARA". Bye, Daddy. Bye, Mama.</i>

150
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,011
- We'll see you soon, sweetie.
- I love you, baby girl.

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,960
A.R.G.U.S. has a chopper
waiting to take us to Coast City.

152
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,922
So, at least we'll all be together,

153
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,364
if we can't stop the...

154
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,130
The end of the world.

155
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,605
In these situations,
you're usually the one offering hope.

156
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,966
I'm fresh out, Lyla.

157
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,810
Because of what happened with Andy?

158
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,205
It was self-defense, John.
It was a clean kill.

159
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,164
Lyla, are you having A.R.G.U.S.
move on City Hall?

160
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,681
John told me
the source of Darhk's power is there,

161
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,681
that he might be looking to harness
the deaths from the nuclear attacks.

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,645
No, he's already done that
with the first attack.

163
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,411
He will decimate your team.
You should pull them back.

164
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,806
And what if his hacker's
down there with him?

165
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,486
Cooper Seldon is not gonna be anywhere
that we think to look.

166
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,165
He'll be in a secure location.

167
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,682
If your team goes down there,
they will all die.

168
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,486
It's not your call, Oliver, it's mine.

169
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,371
I don't like this place. It's scary.

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,321
It's just a little bit longer, sweetheart.

171
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,526
I miss Mommy.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,411
I do, too.

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,604
But we're gonna see her soon.

174
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,081
<i>Assault Team
Sledgehammer has engaged target.</i>

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,566
<i>Switching you to their feed now.</i>

176
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,766
Turn it off.

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,966
With those missiles hitting, he's gonna
become even stronger, isn't he?

178
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,321
He already is with the souls of

179
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,925
all of those A.R.G.U.S. agents
that he just killed.

180
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,401
Wait. I'm in.
I'm through Cooper's firewalls.

181
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,011
- Well, shut it down.
- That's what I'm trying to...

182
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,684
Look at me, listen to me.
Don't let it control your mind.

183
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,609
You are a murderer!

184
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,682
You killed my brother! You are darkness!

185
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,847
Yes, lam...
But you don't have to be.

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,843
I am sorry.

187
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,366
It's okay.

188
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,682
I can feel it burning my mind.

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,521
Taiana, we will find a way
to work around this.

190
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,202
There is only one way.

191
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,368
You have to kill me, Oliver.

192
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,240
<i>With Mayor Adams
missing and presumed dead,</i>

193
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,882
<i>Deputy Mayor Remz called for calm
in the wake of unconfirmed reports</i>

194
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,890
<i>that a nuclear attack on our city
is imminent.</i>

195
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,885
<i>Newly installed
Police Captain Frank Pike...</i>

196
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,610
As if things couldn't get any worse.

197
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,767
Is everyone all right?

198
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,405
I think "all right" is a relative term.

199
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,601
How much time do we have?

200
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,087
I think, 27 minutes.
It's kind of hard to tell now.

201
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,444
I wonder what Laurel
would have thought of all this.

202
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,926
Well, she probably would've said

203
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,726
something about finding a solution,
no matter what.

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,604
Yeah. She was always stubborn like that.

205
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,485
Too bad she would've been wrong this time.

206
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,764
Hey, come on,
we can't just lose all hope here.

207
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,285
You have.

208
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,925
I can see it in your eyes.

209
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,766
I just can't believe that I thought

210
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,607
that I'd be the one to unite this city
while Damien Darhk was trying to kill it.

211
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,520
That was arrogant.

212
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,286
The same arrogance that made me feel like
I could be the Green Arrow

213
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,845
without descending into darkness.

214
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,963
Bottom line, it was foolish.

215
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,128
- You don't believe that.
- I didn't believe that,

216
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,286
until Laurel died.

217
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,528
I thought you weren't blaming yourself
for her death anymore.

218
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,121
We made a decision to come back here.

219
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,690
I tried to do things differently.

220
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,644
And, for a time, I did.

221
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,962
And now I am left here to wonder,

222
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,565
if I hadn't,

223
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,569
would Laurel still be alive?

224
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,488
Curtis. You shouldn't be up.

225
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,205
Tell me about it.

226
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,526
But someone's gotta provide
a little optimism.

227
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,170
It doesn't seem like anyone around here
is in the head-space to do it.

228
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,885
You know we've lost the city.

229
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,565
No, I know that you're running out of time
to get it back.

230
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,485
Look, living in Star City requires
a special kind of tenacity.

231
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,363
A sane person wouldn't live here.

232
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,167
It's a fact that Paul
likes to remind me of weekly.

233
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,168
We were this close
to leaving Star City last October.

234
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,565
After three terrorist attacks,
we were done.

235
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
But then,

236
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,848
the night before
we were gonna start packin',

237
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,520
the Green Arrow popped up on our TV,

238
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,524
and he reminded me
that this city is worth saving.

239
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,125
That my home...

240
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,406
That my home was worth fighting for.

241
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,369
That guy gave me inspiration.

242
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,611
He gave me hope.

243
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,086
And if he could give me hope then,
why can't he give it to others now?

244
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,291
Hey! Calm down! Stop!

245
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,767
Please! I know
what you're feeling right now.

246
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,602
I'm feeling it, too.

247
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,847
The sense of helplessness.
Of hopelessness.

248
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,806
I don't know how we even begin to process
what might happen to us right now.

249
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,484
But there are a few things that I do know.

250
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,171
I know that this city has been through
tough times before,

251
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,488
and we have pulled through.

252
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,683
We survived the Undertaking,

253
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,207
we survived the siege,
we survived the outbreak,

254
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,970
and somehow, someway we will survive this.

255
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,128
<i>A friend of mine told me
that living in Star City</i>

256
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,448
<i>takes a special kind of tenacity.</i>

257
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,880
<i>But we do live here
because this is our home.</i>

258
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,884
<i>This is our home.</i>

259
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,004
<i>It is our friends. Our family. Our lives.</i>

260
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,650
<i>And we will not, we will not
throw those precious gifts away</i>

261
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,401
<i>by descending into chaos.</i>

262
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,328
We will look to each other for hope.

263
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,561
We will cling to each other for strength.

264
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,491
If we do that, no matter what happens,
then we can all stand here united.

265
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,560
Oh, my God, it's here.

266
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,321
<i>"BURNS". That's terrifying.</i>

267
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,366
And also kind of great.

268
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,762
I think you got hit on the head
harder than you realize.

269
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,729
No. No, he's right.
I can't hack this system.

270
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,922
But if the nuke gets close enough,
which it is...

271
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,050
We could use the line-of-sight attack
on the missile itself and disarm it.

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,922
<i>I'm still not getting a signal.</i>

273
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,446
<i>Are you sure
you're pointing that thing at the nuke?</i>

274
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,727
It's pretty hard to miss, Felicity.

275
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,001
Okay, okay, okay! I'm just going...

276
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,287
Uh. Whatever you changed,

277
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,885
don't change it again, it's working.
I got the signal.

278
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,121
I didn't change anything.

279
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,408
Nukes are designed to detonate
100 feet above their actual target.

280
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,046
I'm uploading a GPS spoof
so it thinks it's already detonated.

281
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,204
Great! But, um,
it is still headed straight for us.

282
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,522
Just keep pointing
the IR receiver at the thingy.

283
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,291
I have perfect confidence
in your abilities.

284
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,681
- Thank you.
- But, just in case,

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,961
working with you and the rest of the team

286
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,362
has been the highlight of
my professional career and my entire life,

287
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,931
and I can't think of any better way
for it to end...

288
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,602
Curtis. As sweet as this is,
the talking is really not helping.

289
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,721
Oh, my God. it worked.

290
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,405
Oh, my God, it worked!

291
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,403
Whatever you guys just did was incredible.

292
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,000
We only took down one nuke.

293
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,561
We still have 15,433 to go, give or take.

294
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,482
The code to the line-of-sight hack.
Can you distro it to everybody?

295
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,682
I'm on it.

296
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,843
All right, that's one, one nuke in 15,000.

297
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,127
The chances of us getting 'em all is...

298
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,651
One in 375 million.

299
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,605
Well, we need to find Darhk's hacker
and shut down Rubicon at the source.

300
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,922
When we disarmed the nuke,
we gained access to its on board computer

301
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,081
and cloned its hard drive remotely.

302
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,204
Then, we ran a backtrace to determine
the source of the initial launch signal.

303
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,205
He's holed up in a warehouse on
the corner of Cheswold and Crombie.

304
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,441
Let's get after him.

305
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,206
That was quite a speech, Oliver.
Made me long for a voting booth.

306
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,010
You and Thea need to
back up Curtis and Felicity

307
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,167
while they deal with Seldon.

308
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,647
- Okay, what are you gonna do?
- I'm going to City Hall.

309
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,440
Oliver, you yourself said going
after Darhk is a suicide mission.

310
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,965
Well, John, I'm not gonna die tonight.

311
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,610
Well, let me go with you, back you up.

312
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,968
If things go bad,
I need you to back the city up.

313
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,523
Oliver, things aren't gonna go bad.
Your speech

314
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,646
inspired all of us, too.

315
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,881
Let's move.

316
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,565
TAIANAI Do it, Oliver.

317
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,564
Please do it quickly.

318
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,689
Taiana, I'm not gonna kill you.

319
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,245
- Then I will kill you!
- Hey!

320
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,960
Don't you understand?

321
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,651
Please!

322
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,531
Before I kill
whoever is left on this island.

323
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,369
Before I become worse than Reiter, please.

324
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,165
Please don't ask me to do this.

325
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,331
If you ever cared for me,

326
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,170
then you would do this.

327
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,681
Okay.

328
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,007
Don't forget your promise.

329
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,561
I won't.

330
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,365
Taiana, I'm sorry.

331
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,201
You killed her!

332
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,051
I thought you were staying behind.

333
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,360
Yeah. It doesn't mean
I shouldn't be prepared.

334
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,203
I'm not gonna ask if you're all right.

335
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,771
I think I know the answer.

336
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,042
Lyla, this isn't the right time
for this conversation.

337
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,203
When the Ghosts attacked, you froze.

338
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,131
I've never seen you do that before.

339
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,925
- Lyla, I can't talk about this.
- Was it Andy?

340
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,247
He was a Ghost.

341
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,408
- Lyla...
- If the world's going to end,

342
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,723
then let's at least go out
being honest with each other.

343
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,769
Yes. it was Andy.

344
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,806
But not like I said.
And not like you think.

345
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,846
Earlier you said it was a good kill.

346
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,250
It wasn't, Lyla.

347
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,483
I said it was self-defense. it wasn't.

348
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,649
You must think I'm a monster.

349
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,329
Fog of war, Johnnie.

350
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,285
You did what you had to do.

351
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,805
It's that simple.

352
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,762
Lyla, there's nothing simple about this.

353
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,804
Darhk!

354
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,484
What does a guy have to do
to end the world in peace?

355
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,324
<i>"NORA". Why is he here, Daddy?</i>

356
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,443
Oh, he came here to die, sweetheart.

357
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,880
Clearly.

358
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,968
Fifteen minutes till the end of the world,
and you want to spend them with me.

359
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,685
I am touched.

360
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,846
Thea, look out ahead of you.

361
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,682
Thanks, unless you were aiming at me.

362
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,047
At this point, I honestly can't tell.

363
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,885
<i>"DARHK". Even if you stop me,</i>

364
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,605
even if you could,

365
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,525
those missiles are finding their targets.

366
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,531
This is a mercy killing

367
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,530
on a global scale.

368
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,125
I'm sparing my daughter the pain

369
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,850
of growing up without her mother.

370
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,530
Or Mr. Lance living without Laurel.

371
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,286
And don't get me started on your pain.

372
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,202
Let him go!

373
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,121
Get out.

374
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,282
For real?

375
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,607
- Get out of here.
- Get out!

376
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,245
Get out of our town!

377
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,926
We don't want you here!

378
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,884
Get out of this town!

379
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,725
- Get out!
- "Get out."

380
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,246
Get out of here!

381
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,562
This heartwarming display

382
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,245
would mean a whole lot more

383
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,804
had I not just seen you all tearing
yourselves and your city apart.

384
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,243
That is why I did this.

385
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,249
Humanity is feckless.

386
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,761
And I wanted to cleanse it
of a millennia worth

387
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,491
of rot it has been infected by,

388
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,603
and I will do it.

389
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,404
No, you won't.

390
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,087
Okay,

391
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,602
just for fun, how are you gonna stop me?

392
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,765
Because it won't be just me
who's gonna stop you.

393
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,125
It's not so easy without the magic, is it?

394
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,169
Oh, I don't need magic.

395
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,484
I'm a former member
of the League of Assassins.

396
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,642
Or have you forgotten that?

397
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,325
Remind me.

398
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,881
- Oh, my God.
- Cooper?

399
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,082
Hey, Felicity. How you doing?

400
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,481
Who shot you?

401
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,841
Guess.

402
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,010
He's moving the bullet
closer and closer to my spine.

403
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,841
Said it'd hurt so bad
I'd do anything to make him stop.

404
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,007
Like blow up the planet.

405
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,000
Sorry, I'm a selfish bastard.
But she knew that already.

406
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,846
I need a moment alone with him.

407
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,445
- Felicity, I don't think right...
- Now!

408
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,569
I'm sorry, Felicity.

409
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,764
I know I should be strong enough
to pull myself away from this keyboard,

410
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,361
but I think we both know that I'm not.

411
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,760
You are.

412
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,688
He's powerful. He's so powerful.

413
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,887
And if I stop Rubicon, he'll know.

414
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,884
And he'll kill me
in the most painful way possible.

415
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,401
You're better than this, Cooper.

416
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,287
You're stronger than this.
You can still do the right thing.

417
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,282
You can still be the man that I loved.

418
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,927
I haven't been that guy in a long time.

419
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,891
Remember what we wanted to do
seven years ago

420
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,605
in that cockroach-infested dorm room?

421
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,451
Save the world.

422
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,650
Now's your chance.

423
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,530
Mr. Seldon, you weak-willed dust mite.

424
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,807
I'm sorry, Coop.

425
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,327
Ah! You brought friends.

426
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,651
That's okay. So did I.

427
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,490
- What the hell happened?
- Darhk!

428
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,563
We have three minutes
to take down 15,000 nukes.

429
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,848
Why isn't this a simple matter
of flicking off a switch?

430
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,209
Rubicon has safeguards for their
safeguards. I can't disarm a warhead.

431
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,367
Then don't.

432
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,846
I don't think you understand
how this works.

433
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,486
It's not the warheads, it's the missiles.
If we invert their horizons...

434
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,330
They'll explode in space.

435
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,685
Now you know how it feels.

436
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,609
- Wait, I thought you and Donna...
- Don't worry. She's safe.

437
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,086
But I had to come back
to stand with my city.

438
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,408
'Cause this Oliver Queen guy
gives a hell of a speech.

439
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,690
You two were supposed to stay as backup.

440
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,211
I already lost one brother.

441
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,727
You two put down the Ghosts.
You keep people safe.

442
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,531
- What about Darhk?
- Darhk's mine.

443
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,762
What are you gonna do now, Oliver?

444
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,651
Stop posturing.

445
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,241
We both know you can't do it.

446
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,284
You spared the life of the man
who killed your own mother.

447
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,602
You killed a friend of mine.

448
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,090
You've killed tens of thousands
of innocent people.

449
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,286
With Slade Wilson, I had a choice.

450
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,446
This time, I don't.

451
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,521
It's gonna take forever
to clean this place up.

452
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,168
Well, I wish you guys
the best of luck with that.

453
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,640
You going home to my mama?

454
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,328
Uh, yeah, and to pack.

455
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,811
We're leaving town for a while.

456
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,007
Wait, why?

457
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,641
LAB reached out.

458
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,730
My suspension is no longer a suspension.

459
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,083
But, uh, it's funny, you know,

460
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,166
'cause being a cop is all I ever wanted,
but when I got that call,

461
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,362
I didn't feel a thing.

462
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,048
All I could think about was Laurel.
You know?

463
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,730
But you got herjustice, Oliver,
and you got me some closure.

464
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,170
And I'm never gonna forget that.

465
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,171
Well, it's gonna make me feel
like I'm piling on...

466
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,521
What do you mean?

467
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,449
Well, l...

468
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,210
I jumped straight out of the Lazarus Pit
right into this and to...

469
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,841
To Speedy.

470
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,886
But, um, I've just been wondering
if this is even who I really am?

471
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,445
And then I threatened
to kill a little girl, and I, uh...

472
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,684
I realized I'm my father's daughter.
So, I...

473
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,888
I thought about Laurel and...
And what she'd say to me if she were here.

474
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,361
I think she'd tell me to get out.

475
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,366
Before I lost too much of myself.

476
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,967
- I'm sorry, Ollie.
- Hey. Come here.

477
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,885
You don't have
to apologize to me, ever.

478
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,490
Well, it looks like
it's just the three of us.

479
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,722
Team Arrow. The original gangsters.

480
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,400
Up top?

481
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,647
You Okay?

482
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,765
Not really.
I told Lyla the truth about Andy.

483
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,444
What did she say?

484
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,524
She's a soldier, she understood.

485
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,123
But I don't,
and I don't think I ever will.

486
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,601
What are you gonna do?

487
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,442
Take some time away from this team,

488
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,969
away from the city.

489
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,885
Figure out where I went off track
and how to get back on.

490
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,885
John, I have never done this without you.

491
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,443
You're the one who keeps me in line.

492
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,644
Oliver, I don't know
if you've watching lately,

493
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,280
but it's been the other way around, man.

494
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,051
She begged me to do it.

495
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,845
So, I know that this is not gonna
make a ton of sense,

496
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,646
but all of this has to do with that.

497
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,010
It is darkness!

498
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,326
And Taiana had...
She was succumbing to that darkness.

499
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,525
They destroyed the plane.

500
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,726
That was Reiter.

501
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,283
There's another way off the island.

502
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,202
<i>And here I thought
you'd never use the comm gear I gave you</i>

503
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,289
to radio for a trip home.

504
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,364
Well, I lost it for a while.

505
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,042
- And the job wasn't done.
- And now it is.

506
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,049
I sent you here
to break up Reiter's operation

507
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,607
and free his prisoners. You did both.

508
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,041
- You saved a lot of lives.
- And took some, too.

509
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,810
Do you remember what I told you?

510
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,211
That the only way out is through?

511
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,570
Well, I'm not out, Amanda.
I'm still filled with darkness.

512
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,726
This was never about
expunging your darkness, Mr. Queen.

513
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,446
That darkness
will always be a part of you.

514
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,322
- Then what was the point?
- To show you

515
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,484
that sometimes killing
is the only path to justice.

516
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,245
Director Waller,
what do you wanna do with the artifact?

517
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,090
Have it transported to The Slab.

518
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,651
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,326
That's it?

520
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,490
Just gonna bag and tag everything
and pretend like nothing ever happened?

521
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,810
You've seen what that idol can do.
How large the world truly is.

522
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,445
Speaking of...

523
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,442
What am I gonna do with this?

524
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,769
Our business here is concluded, Mr. Queen.

525
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,651
Unless it's not.

526
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,325
As I said, justice requires killing.

527
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,321
A man of your talents could be useful
in hot spots across the globe.

528
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,445
Or you could just go back
to playing vigilante.

529
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,290
Neither.

530
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,962
I have a promise to keep.

531
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,244
I know you wouldn't approve of what I did.

532
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,211
I mean, I know that it's not
what you would have wanted.

533
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,367
Me killing Darhk.

534
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,120
<i>But you were always
better than me, Laurel.</i>

535
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,806
That is what I loved most about you.

536
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,526
You okay?

537
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,326
No.

538
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,684
It's Thea and John. It's...

539
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,842
Them leaving has to be a blow.

540
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,406
And they're leaving
because of their own personal darkness.

541
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,924
I just can't help but think that
maybe they were infected by mine.

542
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,366
Maybe.

543
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,369
Like you said,
maybe you can't become a hero

544
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,245
without succumbing to the darkness,
even a little bit.

545
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,725
But you were able to defeat Darhk
by giving the city its hope back.

546
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,325
You're saying it's not black and white?

547
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,688
I'm saying that there is a man
who killed Darhk in cold blood.

548
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,162
And that same man stood on top of a car
and gave the city its hope back.

549
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,410
What you're feeling isn't darkness,
it's a schism.

550
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,327
<i>You're at war with two sides of yourself.</i>

551
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,001
Hello?

552
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,403
Mr. Queen, this is Thomas Kemp.
I chair the City Council.

553
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,688
Yes, of course, Councilman.
What can I help you with?

554
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,564
That impromptu speech you gave

555
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,242
during the city's latest crisis
got a lot of people's attention.

556
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,846
And there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

557
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,687
It's only an interim appointment.
A proper election will be held in August.

558
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,561
But given that you got 48% of the vote
before as a write-in candidate,

559
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,209
- well, I think that's just a formality.
- I appreciate the optimism.

560
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,484
Are you sure about this?
You look, well, conflicted.

561
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,089
Well, someone very close to me
recently told me that I am.

562
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,971
- But I am ready for this.
- Good.

563
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,287
Shall we?

564
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,927
Put your left hand on the Bible.

565
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,010
Raise your right hand and recite the oath.

566
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,644
I, Oliver Queen, do solemnly swear

567
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,485
to support the charter
and laws of Star City,

568
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,127
and to faithfully and impartially perform

569
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,760
and discharge the duties
of the office of mayor,

570
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,487
according to the law
and to the very best of my ability.

571
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,001
Congratulations.

572
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,602
I didn't know you'd be here.

573
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,247
You thought I was leaving, too?

574
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,605
Not a chance.

575
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,801
English - SDH
