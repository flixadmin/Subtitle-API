00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,985
How is Hyun-su?

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,072
Doesn't remember anything.

4
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,074
Are you sure, though?

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,368
No, I'm not entirely sure.

6
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,081
If he doesn't remember
anything that happened,

7
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,001
I hope all his other negative memories
were gone as well.

8
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,339
I don't think he'd want that, you know.

9
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,676
If his memories of the past are lost,

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,305
he could potentially transform
into a monster.

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,730
Ji-su.

12
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,358
I have a request for you.

13
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,154
What do you need?

14
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,576
I don't think I'll be able to stay
with you all for much longer.

15
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,956
And when that happens, I want you to...

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,918
safeguard this place.

17
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,796
Protect Eun-yu

18
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,632
and everyone.

ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON <i>SWEET HOME</i>

SWEET HOME

00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,049

GREEN HOME APARTMENTS

23
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,073
Damn it!
Why the hell are we returning here?

24
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,327
This is absurd!
Have you completely lost it?

25
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,330
What are you trying to do here?
Let's just go back.

26
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:26,998
Where to?

27
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,957
What?

28
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,417
You saw for yourself.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,169
Did it look safe to you back there?

30
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,339
Is there even such a thing as a shelter?

31
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,758
If there is, why won't you tell us
where it is then?

32
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,135
It's because I don't know
if you pose a threat.

33
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,887
Anybody out there could be infected.

34
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,805
It's not like you're immune
to monsterization.

35
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,725
You never know who, when, or how someone

36
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,311
could become a monster.

37
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,777
Flat tire.

38
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,696
We can't go any further.

39
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,117
Wait for me here. I won't take long.

40
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,286
I'll be right back.

41
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,002
He may no longer be the Lee Eun-hyeok

42
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,214
that you remember.

43
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,798
You're wrong.

44
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,885
He promised me he would return, so...

45
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,429
He said he'd return no matter what.

46
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,392
So till I see him with my own two eyes,
that only then...

47
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,938
I won't believe anything or anyone.

48
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,338
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

49
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,632
Think this through.

50
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,010
It's a mistake to do this to us.

51
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,012
Is that a threat?

52
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,848
I've got nothing to lose.

53
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,144
And I'm the one with the gun.

54
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,480
Goddamn it.

55
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,771

00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,301
<i>I'll come back safely.</i>

63
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,429
Just kill them.

64
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,183
Without them, we'd just be considered
innocent survivors.

65
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,477
So let's just kill them both and go back.

66
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,561
It's as simple as that!

67
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,771
Choose wisely.

68
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,690
Don't you want the vaccine?

69
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,900
You mean, a vaccine exists?

70
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,344
He's right. It does say here
that they're working on a vaccine.

71
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,619
You people took Hyun-su away.

72
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,329
That means you can make a vaccine now.

73
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,081
There's not enough for everyone.

74
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,709
But someone who saved a soldier
might get it, though.

75
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,804
- Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing?
- I'm not gonna fucking die like this!

76
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,185
Drop the gun!

77
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,567
Drop it!

78
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,333
You bitch!

79
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,128
Look at me! Come here, come here!

80
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,047
You little bitch.

81
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,216
Get up! Get up! Get the fuck up, bitch.

82
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,718
Come here.

83
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,346
Follow me. Come here, you fucking bitch!

84
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,685
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

85
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,064
Come here. Come here. Bitch!

86
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,710
- What are you doing, you son of a bitch?
- I think you should see this, sir.

87
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,194
See what? They're all fucking dead.

88
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,946
These people...

89
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,823
they're Crow Platoon.

90
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,167
They're still warm, sir.

91
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,585
It hasn't been long.

92
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,712
There seems to be...

93
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,675
a monster in the vicinity.

94
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,150
Tie them all up.

95
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,485
We're heading back to camp.

96
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,487
Even the survivors, sir?

97
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,364
You think these assholes
look like survivors?

98
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,616
I wanna kill all of them
but I'm holding back.

99
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,951
They'll live if they're lucky.

100
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,120
But if they die, that's their fate, right?

101
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,288
I helped you, sir. You know that.

102
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,641
- Please take me.
- Get the fuck off of me!

103
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,749
I'm begging you!

104
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,337
Please!

105
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,714
You heard me!

106
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,340
Tie them up and get in!

107
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,886
What the hell are you doing?

108
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,222
Do you want to die with them?

109
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,195
The knot should come off easily.

110
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,949
As soon as we leave,
you need to find a place to hide.

111
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,764
Uh, Ms. Im?

112
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,145
What's wrong with Ms. Im, huh?

113
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,815
I guess she became a monster.

114
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,825
What the hell is that?

115
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,453
Holy shit, I'm fucking sick and tired
of these monsters.

116
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,622
I'll see you in hell, bitch.

117
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,674
Oh, shit.

118
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,678
Why did you do that, sir?

119
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,765
I'm just doing my job.

120
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,100
That was a human being.

121
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,183
That's it.

122
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,855
This thing was a monster
because I said so.

123
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,565
And that's the end of it.

124
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,818
Monster, monster, monster, monster...

125
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,486
It's a monster. It's a monster.

126
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,739
Hurry.

127
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,458
So what if you're human?

128
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,335
Do I even care?

129
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,755
Come on, Sarge.

130
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,964
We are at war here.

131
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,968
Humans have to win this battle.
And we'll kill every last one.

132
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,512
Go to hell. You deserve to die!

133
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,456
Let go of me. Huh?
Are you trying to murder us all?

134
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,458
<i>- Crow One. We got a man down.</i>
- Here, this way. Hurry.

135
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,042
<i>- Requesting medical support.</i>
- Move it!

136
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,736
Hurry!

137
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,363
<i>Patient's status is critical.
Requesting immediate support.</i>

138
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,037
<i>Third floor's clear.
Entering the fourth floor.</i>

139
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,082
<i>Minimize the station.
Rescue the Third Platoon and extract.</i>

140
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,003
<i>On your six! Monster!</i>

141
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,180
<i>Open fire! Open fire!</i>

142
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>This is Crow Four.</i>

143
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,311
<i>The monster's down, and we got
five injured men, two dead.</i>

144
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,443
Third Platoon, extract the entry team.

145
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,403
<i>Join the main element with the wounded.</i>

146
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,489
<i>Recon, do we have eyes
on the Second Platoon?</i>

147
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,458
You see anything?

148
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,962
The building is blocking the view.

149
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,007
Can't get a visual on target, sir.

150
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,217
Come down.

151
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,468
Moving to their location.

152
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,887
We're not going, sir.

153
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,847
Hey, UDT, pack your things up now.

154
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,557
We're going back to base.

155
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,888
What the hell are you doing?

156
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,195
They're all too worn out, man.

157
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,282
They're wounded, starving,
and half asleep.

158
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,866
Our vehicles have broken down,

159
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,994
and we're running low on ammo.
Have you not heard?

160
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,077
Then what?

161
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,664
We desert the Second Platoon?

162
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,837
Yeah, I'm done.

163
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,672
We have to leave now.

164
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,632
Troops in the Second Platoon
are all but dead.

165
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,956
Let's at least save these ones.

166
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,802
Hey, Seok-chan.

167
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,197
Yes, Sergeant. Kang Seok-chan.

168
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,515
Six hours ago,
what did Central Command tell us?

169
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,060
They told us to return to base forthwith.

170
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,062
Sir, you are defying a direct command.

171
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,776
Men who aren't UDT, you can come too.

172
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,953
When I return to base, I'll take
full responsibility for my defiance.

173
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,955
The question really is,

174
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,583
how will you take responsibility
for yours, Sergeant?

175
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,799
Shoot me, sir.

176
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,054
Either way, your obsessive devotion
will eventually lead to our demise.

177
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,432
Shoot me.

178
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,227
Like you did to your own flesh and blood.

179
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,495
UDT and wounded men,

180
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,789
return to base with Sergeant Kim.

181
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:02,963
Let's go.

182
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,636
Hey, help me.

183
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,142
That was Ms. Im back there, right?

184
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,437
I think so, yeah.

185
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,650
That lady, she was the mother
from Room 1504, wasn't she?

186
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah.

187
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,821
Didn't you say
she turned into a monster, though?

188
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,185
You said it yourself back there.

189
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,699
Yeah, she did.

190
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,368
You think she was resisting it
like Hyun-su did?

191
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,245
Oh, you're right.

192
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,498
Did you see her eyes?
It didn't turn black or anything.

193
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,181
They just seemed like normal human eyes.

194
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,060
In case you didn't notice,
she was also butt-naked.

195
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,920
You call that a person? It was a monster.

196
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,755
Well, Ms. Im is a nice monster!

197
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,882
She even protected us!

198
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,926
There's no such thing as a good monster.

199
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,010
They all deserve to die.

200
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,093
No, they don't!

201
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,763
They don't! You're wrong!

202
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,097
Disrespectful little brat.

203
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,141
Don't talk to him like that. He's a child.

204
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,603
Excuse me. Ma'am, are you okay?

205
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,745
Hey, Ji-su.

206
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,748
Ji-su, are you okay?

207
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,502
I'm far from okay, thanks to you.

208
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,966
This time, you put us in a lot of danger.

209
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,346
Eun-yu.

210
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,147
We didn't make it this far
because we're lucky

211
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,267
or better than the others.

212
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,478
Others gave their lives
so we can make it out alive.

213
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,647
Don't let that be for nothing.

214
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,194
I'm really sorry,

215
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,363
but I'm never giving up.

216
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,574
I haven't seen him for myself.

217
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,118
So, to me, Eun-hyeok is still alive.

218
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,958
And I'm gonna keep looking for him
whatever the cost.

219
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,682
Oh! Oh!

220
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,351
What... What is it?
What is this? What's this?

221
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,353
Why... why are you stopping? Why?

222
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,523
There's a survivor.

223
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,904
God, no. You don't plan
on letting him on, do you?

224
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,239
Please, we can't do that.

225
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,963
My mission is to provide
survivors with a safe ride to the shelter.

226
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,993
Oh, for Christ's sake.

227
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,679
Do you really have to do everything
by the book?

228
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,997
I'm scared, okay?
We can't just put ourselves at risk.

229
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,309
- Don't try to be a hero.
- All right, all right, all right.

230
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,419
She's right. Let's just go, please?
We'll keep this a secret.

231
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,920
No one will ever find out.

232
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh, God. Let's just go.
No one will know.

233
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,923
I will, won't I?

234
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,135
Oh, well, I... No.

235
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,153
Where are we going?

236
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,738
Our final stop is the shelter.

237
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:15,353
{\an8}BAMSEOM EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT BUREAU

238
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,192
<i>So we meet at last.</i>

239
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,739
<i>Thank you for coming all the way here,
Cha Hyun-su.</i>

240
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,036
What, uh...

241
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,832
do I have to do now?

242
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,962
<i>You'll find out soon enough.</i>

243
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,381
<i>I take it you're willing to cooperate?</i>

244
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,135
Yeah.

245
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,473
If it means we can...

246
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,643
put an end to all this.

247
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,104
<i>All right, Cha Hyun-su.</i>

248
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,188
<i>I believe in you.</i>

249
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,185
<i>Type Red.</i>

250
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,105
<i>They show aggressive behavior
toward blood.</i>

251
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,945
<i>Show us
that you're the true savior</i>

252
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,281
<i>who can put a stop to this destruction.</i>

253
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,869
<i>Begin the first experiment on MH-5.</i>

254
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,259
So you're telling me that
MH-6 here was the special infectee

255
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,177
- who captured MH-5?
- Yes, sir.

256
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,929
But he died of gunshot wounds?

257
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,640
Are you sure he's dead?

258
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,393
He doesn't have any
vital signs and I've double-checked.

259
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,439
I mean, it's definitely a monster,
so how is it dead?

260
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,397
Could it be something
similar to what we have with MH-1?

261
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,826
MH-1 didn't die,

262
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,454
but it also had no vital signs
as a monster.

263
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,082
Extract whatever you can from the blood,
bone marrow, skin tissue,

264
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,250
and pituitary gland.

265
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,545
We'll have to do some tests
to compare with the samples from MH-1.

266
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,881
In any case, MH-5 should be arriving soon.

267
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,674
Make sure that we're prepared.

268
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,760
This could be our last chance
to solve this.

269
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,221
We need to aggregate all the data,
experience, and test findings

270
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,683
from MH-6 and MH-1
to further investigate MH-5.

271
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,234
What are you doing? Come on.

272
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,570
Muster up your strength, Cha Hyun-su.

273
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,280
I know you can do this. Come on.

274
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,637
Stop!

275
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,349
I order you to stop!

276
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:15,089
I just... I don't want to hurt anymore.

277
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,613
Help me.

278
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,831
Don't do this.

279
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,044
He's human.

280
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,217
He's human, please.

281
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,848
Don't do this!

282
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,266
Was it you

283
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,810
the voice telling me to cooperate?

284
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,354
Was that your voice?

285
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,734
Why did you kill him?

286
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,112
Why the hell did you kill him?

287
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,282
He was just in agony.

288
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,658
He wasn't a threat, whatsoever!

289
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,286
You didn't have to execute him.

290
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,123
I simply disposed of a test subject
that has served its purpose.

291
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,919
You killed him because he was a monster?

292
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,922
'Cause monsters deserve to die?

293
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,887
What makes you different
from these monsters?

294
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,767
You think you're better?

295
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,689
That bastard would go into a frenzy
at the slightest sight of blood.

296
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,777
Did you know that he killed
dozens of troops?

297
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,615
But after a brief battle with you,
he abruptly seized attacking.

298
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,661
Until today, no monster
had ever self-regulated its behavior

299
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,829
in such a manner.

300
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,000
It's a breakthrough.

301
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,644
You...

302
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,651
What did you do to him?

303
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,697
I know you did something to it.

304
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,452
I don't know what happened.

305
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,039
If you don't, who does?

306
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,917
Try to remember

307
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,461
that you were brought here
for that reason.

308
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,800
Answer me first and I will.

309
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,096
Can you use me to...

310
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,182
develop a vaccine or a cure?

311
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,311
I saw the flier that said you could
make a vaccine using special infectees.

312
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,273
Is that why you turned yourself in?

313
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,900
- Is it true?
- We've already made one.

314
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,570
Though it's all gone now.

315
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,866
Then why don't you

316
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,869
use me to make it again, Doctor?

317
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,247
You might end up dead, though.

318
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,624
Are you okay with that?

319
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,628
I wouldn't have stepped foot in here
if I wasn't.

320
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,421
What I meant is, you'll probably
end up begging us to kill you.

321
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,590
You should know better than anyone

322
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,050
the regenerative abilities of the MHs...

323
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,221
which I see is a blessing, are nothing
more than a curse to you people.

324
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,558
Monster humans are creatures
who have been denied

325
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,018
the beautiful relief of death.

326
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,395
Decent name, don't you think?

327
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,606
I came up with it.

328
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,443
Call me whatever you want to.

329
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,945
MH, monster, creature.

330
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,323
I couldn't care less.

331
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,411
I'm sure you'll do well unlike the others.

332
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,540
I get the feeling we're about to witness
the birth of a very special MH, you see.

333
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,919
Get plenty of sleep.

334
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,131
Starting tomorrow, it won't be easy.

335
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,710
The alarm will go off
if you get it wrong again.

336
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,342
Ms. Seo Yi-kyung?

337
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,973
This is the C5 research facility.

338
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,060
Follow me.

339
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,772
Where would that be?

340
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,274
Do you know me?

341
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,110
Ah.

342
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,489
I don't believe we've met,
but I've heard about you.

343
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,865
I'm Sang-won's friend.

344
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,450
Are you coming or not?

345
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,160
Why are you helping me?

346
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,122
Guess I've grown attached.

347
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,501
<i>He's headed to research.</i>

348
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,464
Come on, time's up. Let's go.

349
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,514
Damn it.

350
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,529
So you are still here.

351
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,534
In this...

352
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,789
sorry state.

353
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,293
How'd you get in here, anyway?

354
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,589
It can't have been easy getting this far,
but I doubt you'll be able to talk to him.

355
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,883
I highly doubt it.

356
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,219
But then again, who knows?

357
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,012
He might talk to his fiancée.

358
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,957
Were you waiting for me?

359
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,778
In statistical terms, the truth is dark.

360
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,827
Wouldn't you rather live
in blissful ignorance instead?

361
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,666
Are you sure
you want to see him?

362
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,670
Even if he's a monster?

363
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,258
Ms. Seo Yi-kyung, I have to see
how Sang-won will react

364
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,719
to your reunion.

365
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,518
It's a rare unique stimulation, you know.

366
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,728
You crazy motherfucker.

367
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,359
What brings you soldiers
all the way down here?

368
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,701
Mr. Soldier?

369
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,392
Mr. Soldier?

370
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,354
What is it?

371
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,608
I can't pee because I'm too scared.

372
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,888
There's nothing wrong with how I look.

373
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,307
Nothing's wrong with my face.

374
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,605
I'm pretty.

375
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,036
How do I look?

376
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,417
I said, "How do I look?"

377
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,046
Do I look pretty?

378
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,090
Do I?

379
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,051
Mister...

380
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,014
There's something wrong with your face.

381
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,859
What's wrong with my face, huh?

382
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,946
Take a good hard look.

383
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,585
Don't like my face?

384
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,519
Get out.

385
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,369
Get out!

386
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,305
Don't shoot my face.

387
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,025
Fucking shit.

388
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,276
Where's my face?

389
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,553
My face...

390
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,812
My damn face!

391
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,774
I'm not pretty!

392
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,915
Am I pretty?

393
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,102
You are hideous as hell.

394
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:30,457
My face, my face, my face!
No, no, my face!

395
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,003
Not... not my face!

396
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,613
Su-yeong, why won't you wake up?

397
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,325
Su-yeong!

398
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,203
Su-yeong!
