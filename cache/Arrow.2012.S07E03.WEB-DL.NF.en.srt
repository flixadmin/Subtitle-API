OF BEING A VIGILANTE,

THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE MY GOAL

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,593
AND SAVE MY CITY WAS TO CONFESS
TO BEING THE GREEN ARROW.

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,388
NOW MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS MUST
CARRY ON MY MISSION WITHOUT ME.

TO ATTACK ME
IN THE SHOWER FOR DIAZ.

00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,819
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
HOW I CAN FIND HIM?

12
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,196

YOURSELF WORTHY
OF MY FRIENDSHIP.

00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,615

WITH MY HUSBAND.

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,629
AND HE'S IN PRISON
BECAUSE OF IT.

22

HAVEN'T CAUGHT HIM.

STILL A PRIORITY,

MUCH CHOICE, NOW, DO YOU?

92
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,763
WHEN?

93

TONIGHT, CELL 3-B
AFTER LIGHTS OUT.

94

BUT ADVENTURE WAS
ALWAYS WHAT KEPT
US STRONG.

-DANGEROUS OPS.
-ROMANCE ON THE FRONT LINE.

WE GOT IN MONTHS,

WE CAN'T LET THAT
SLIP AWAY.

143
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,400
THEN BRING ME SOMETHING

IS AIRTIGHT.

DROPPED TO NUMBER 27

149

ON OUR
MOST WANTED LIST.

150
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,374
THAT, TOO.

151
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,084
TELL THE CDC THEY'VE
BEEN HACKED.

152
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,544
THEY CAN HANDLE IT
AS THEY SEE FIT.

153
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,589
I NEED YOUR FOCUS
ELSEWHERE, AGENT.

154
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,056

ISN'T COMPLETELY
MADE OUT OF STONE.
