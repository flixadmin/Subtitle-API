1
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:04,368
Sunshine keeping quiet?

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:08,343
Our source confirms she hasn't
said a word since her arrest yesterday.

3
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,845
But Captain West
won't stop making noise.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:16,226
He is obsessed with connecting you
to Sunshine, Ultraviolet and Dr. Light.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,644
That won't matter much longer.

6
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:22,107
When will our guest arrive?

7
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:27,112
Thanks for coming on short notice.
This is your target.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,159
Kill him, please.

9
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,182
And... go!

10
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,268
I can't wait. Oh.

11
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,855
- Like, a map of some kind?
- No.

12
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,690
- That's a flux capacitor.
- Hold... No.

13
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:06,419
No, that's speed-drawing. Yeah.

14
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:07,569
They are not gonna get this.

15
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,131
- Oh, this is...
- Okay. Hold on. All right.

16
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,243
It was gonna be the Eiffel Tower.

17
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,580
Oh, yeah, it looks just like
the Eiffel Tower.

18
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:19,974
Maybe, like, a radio tower?

19
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:22,000
It actually does look like that.

20
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,836
I've gotta take this. Hey, David.

21
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,254
Joe, I know you think we can tie

22
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:29,382
this assassin Sunshine to Carver,
but she is just not talking.

23
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,259
Okay, so, let me take a crack at it.

24
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,554
Actually, I need you to take
a step back from this case.

25
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,223
You're too close to it.
Besides, you're the captain now.

26
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,285
David, it's because I'm close,
that I can rattle her.

27
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,109
Come on.
There's nobody else that can do this.

28
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,315
- Okay.
- Okay.

29
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,902
- Is that the Carver case?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,571
- How can I help?
- You just conserve your energy.

31
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,783
I'll call you if I need anything.
I gotta go, guys.

32
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,866
- Take care.
- Okay.

33
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,118
Bye.

34
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,518
I think I found a way out of here.

35
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:09,172
- What? How?
- I started focusing on the monitors.

36
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,758
At first, when I tried,
I couldn't read them.

37
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,135
- I would get all these headaches.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,598
But today,
it started to come into focus.

39
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,559
Perfectly clear.

40
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,313
- You're adapting to this place.
- I read your theory

41
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,649
that says that someone could pass
through the mirror

42
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,818
if their molecular structure
was destabilized.

43
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,861
- Yes.
- If I could

44
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:34,823
just contact my husband,
I think he might be able to help us.

45
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:39,619
Eva, my husband, Barry Allen,
is the Flash.

46
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,705
What?

47
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,542
And with his speed,
I think he could phase us out of here.

48
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,004
If his instantaneous velocity

49
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:52,799
correlates with the limit
of the fractal surface...

50
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,718
then he'll become intangible.

51
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:59,931
- So... it could work.
- Yes.

52
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:03,142
I just... I need to recharge.

53
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:07,313
I've been controlling the mirror
all morning, and I'm exhausted.

54
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,652
Yeah. Take all the time you need.
I will, um...

55
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,737
keep trying to decipher more.

56
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:18,533
Yeah, you do that.
You're on the right path.

57
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,089
She just did exactly what
I knew she would do.

58
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,091
She even told me the truth
about her husband.

59
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:38,595
Eva, Joe West is still looking
into your husband's activities.

60
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,718
He knows about Black Hole.

61
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,182
Then it's only a matter of time
before Barry Allen helps him.

62
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,817
You have a new mission.
The Flash is losing his speed.

63
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,193
Drain him of the rest.

64
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:59,449
- Why do you care about the Flash?
- I don't. I care about my husband.

65
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,410
The Flash is not gonna
take that away from me.

66
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:04,996
Success is assured.

67
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,190
I got your text. What's up?

68
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,004
Okay, Carrie Mathison. Red string much?

69
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,889
I've been tracking Sue
since she disappeared.

70
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,133
She's hit five banks in five locations.

71
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:18,718
Every single one of them was doing

72
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,929
some schmoozy cocktail party
when she did it.

73
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,265
And while everybody was sipping
champagne and eating an overpriced meal,

74
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,684
bam, server rooms get hacked.

75
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:27,894
Oh.

76
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,314
I know that look.
You found her next target.

77
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,066
Of course I found her next target.

78
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:40,031
First National CC Bank is holding
an investors brunch

79
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,783
for their biggest clients.

80
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:44,118
Fits Sue's MO to a T.

81
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,454
Now, here's where
you come in, my friend.

82
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:49,290
I need a hacker who can set up
a net to help catch her.

83
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,668
Somebody who can monitor
the security feeds.

84
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,129
Somebody who speaks bandwidth
and knows binary.

85
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,298
Mmm, I'm not sure you know
how hacking works.

86
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,842
Please. I've seen <i>You've Got Mail</i>
several times.

87
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:04,889
But I know you've been working on
the artificial Speed Force, so...

88
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:08,184
I have,
but I'm running simulations all day.

89
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,436
Simulations I don't need
to be there for.

90
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,691
Look, here's the deal. I know
how hard this case has been on you.

91
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,987
I should've been there to help you
from the beginning.

92
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:20,904
So...

93
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,448
So, you're in?

94
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,702
Will there be waffles?

95
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:28,830
There better be waffles.

96
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,601
No!

97
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,491
Okay? Thank you.

98
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,829
It was crazy. It was like
it was accelerating by itself.

99
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,707
I know you won't believe this,
but it was like somebody

100
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,113
cut the brakes while I was driving.
Is that even possible?

101
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,130
- I don't know. I'll find out.
- Are you sure you're okay?

102
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,937
I'm fine.
It's Carver that needs to worry.

103
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,842
You think Carver's the one behind this?

104
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,761
He knows
I took down one of his assassins,

105
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,679
Millie Rawlins, AKA Sunshine,

106
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,524
and he knows I'm the lead on the
RICO case we're building against him.

107
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:14,143
If that's true, we have to
get you in Witness Protection.

108
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,231
- You're just not safe out here, Joe.
- David, I'm not going anywhere.

109
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:21,692
Look, if Carver is coming after me,
that means he is scared.

110
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,611
What do scared people do?
They make mistakes.

111
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,054
We need to take advantage of that.

112
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:30,660
Fine. You have my complete support, Joe,
as always.

113
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,746
But if anything happens,
I'll never forgive myself.

114
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,699
I need to go talk to Rawlins.

115
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:51,389
Okay. The investors brunch
is in full swing.

116
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:55,476
Now, you go get us eyes
on that server room. I gotta tinkle.

117
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,706
- Yeah, I heard what I said.
- Mmm-hmm.

118
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:14,829
Okay. The doctor is in.
Say "aah."

119
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,382
What? You call this
an encryption scheme?

120
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,885
I could do this with one hand
tied behind my back.

121
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,087
Prove it.

122
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,098
Uh, Good morning. Don't mind me.

123
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,475
I'm just doing
a routine software update.

124
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,728
Can I have my hand back, please?

125
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,439
You dress well... for tech support.

126
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,608
I have a good work ethic.

127
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:48,404
Funny. It looked like you were tampering
with the facility's security system...

128
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,071
not repairing it.

129
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,532
Tampering?

130
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,534
Oh!

131
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,245
- You mean all this?
- Yes, all of that.

132
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:57,329
No, I'm...

133
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,710
It's... This is a procedure we follow
to make sure that your money's secure.

134
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,505
That is, if the safety of your money
is important to you, Miss...

135
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,758
Ms. January Galore.

136
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:14,222
And the safety of my money
is very important to me.

137
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,265
I'm sure it is.

138
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:19,685
So, what do those
little green lights do?

139
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:23,689
The green lights,
they, um...

140
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:29,237
they are not important.
I'm actually all done here. Um...

141
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,156
- Enjoy the waffles.
- Oh, I will.

142
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,373
I think they only have
apple fritters here.

143
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,087
- Are we live?
- Yeah, we're live.

144
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,506
We got eyes.
We almost didn't get 'em, though.

145
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,342
I ran into one of the donors,
some rich British lady.

146
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,011
What was her name? June? April?

147
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,388
April Gabor.

148
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,432
- Wait. January Galore?
- That's the one.

149
00:09:58,891 --> 00:09:59,934
That's not good.

150
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,436
She's an arms dealer
that Barry and I met in Midway City.

151
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,856
I don't know.
She seemed kind of charming to me.

152
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,340
Very forward, but charming nonetheless.

153
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:10,819
Uh-oh.

154
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,907
We're in trouble.
The security feeds are dead.

155
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,994
Servers are
on the fifth floor. Let's go.

156
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,707
Ew! Ew, ew, ew!

157
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,126
What is that?

158
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,795
- A perfect disguise.
- A disg...

159
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,756
I think I just lost my appetite.

160
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,931
Hi, slick. You miss me?

161
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,311
Almost as much as I miss Fredrico,
my tapeworm.

162
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,106
Hello, Sue. Or is it January?

163
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,481
What can I say?

164
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:52,153
Collateralized loan obligations
are deliciously robust.

165
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,948
Although... not half as delicious
as you in a tux.

166
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,328
Still up to your old tricks,
swiping diamonds and pearls?

167
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,705
You like Prince?
Me, too.

168
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,208
Yes! Me three.

169
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:11,213
I'm Cisco, by the way. We met
back when you were January Galore.

170
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,442
That was an excellent accent,
by the way. Do you have any training?

171
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,843
Oh, thank you.
I did my senior year abroad.

172
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,553
- London, no doubt.
- Italy, actually.

173
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,764
It... She fancy. You fancy.

174
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,768
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay. Sue, you're trapped.

175
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,270
- And you're going down.
- Actually, I'm going up.

176
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,314
Ah!

177
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,005
- Did you see that?
- What are you...

178
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,030
Damn it!

179
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,032
Uh-oh.

180
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,658
Dibs.

181
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:48,167
If this is what she used, she has access
to all the bank's financial holdings.

182
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,047
Oh, well, it's only several...

183
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,509
billion... dollars.

184
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,265
Millie Rawlins.

185
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,605
This man, he worked for Joseph Carver.

186
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:16,404
This is what happens
to those who fail Carver.

187
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,280
Incentive for the rest of us to succeed.

188
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,574
But you didn't succeed.

189
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,452
So, that probably means you're next.

190
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:28,707
Now, look. I can offer you protection,
but this is a one-time deal.

191
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,334
Are you interested?

192
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,921
No, thanks.

193
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,507
The only way
somebody could accelerate the car

194
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,069
and simultaneously cut the brakes
is from inside the car's engine,

195
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,847
which is... I mean, obviously,
no person could fit inside there.

196
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:47,977
Ray Palmer could. Only he's not
a murderous sabotaging type.

197
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,607
How about a meta-human
who could squeeze into tight places?

198
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,278
Likes to watch
his victims suffering up close.

199
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,362
Rag Doll.

200
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:00,572
Now...

201
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,535
what would...

202
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,373
First Lieutenant Millie Rawlins...

203
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:13,419
a soldier who rescued 14 friendlies
from an insurgent labor camp...

204
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,297
think of what you've become now?

205
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:17,840
You were honorable.

206
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,261
Legion of Merit. Medal of Valor.

207
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:27,057
Millie, restore that honor.

208
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,644
Help me stop Joseph Carver
before it's too late.

209
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,190
Get down!

210
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:40,945
What the hell?

211
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,645
Joe? Hey.

212
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,195
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,497
I'm fine. I'm all bandaged up.

214
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,291
All right, Joe, that's twice now.

215
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,294
And that's twice
I've gotten a clean bill of health.

216
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,590
- All right.
- Wait. Hold on. Where are you going?

217
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,260
Barry, I am still the lead
on this investigation

218
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,471
and I was this close to getting a deal
with Rawlins. If it wasn't for...

219
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,557
He's a dangerous psycho
and he's got your number.

220
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,561
All right, look.
I hate to say it, but I don't know,

221
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,647
it feels like maybe Singh was right
and you should let this go for a while.

222
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,566
So, you're gonna
take me off the case now?

223
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,752
No, I just...
I'm trying to keep you safe, all right?

224
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,529
I'm not fast enough to do that anymore.
I mean, look at your arm.

225
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,781
Barry, you know I'm not gonna stop
if I'm this close.

226
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:09,577
Look, I get it, but will you please
just stay here at S.T.A.R. Labs?

227
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,140
At least until I've stopped Rag Doll?

228
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,791
- Fine.
- Joe...

229
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,336
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm good.

230
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,134
- What happened?
- There was gunfire.

231
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:28,429
And... I wasn't fast enough
to stop all the bullets.

232
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:32,057
He's fine,
but it's my fault that he got hurt.

233
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,895
- Barry, your speed.
- Yeah.

234
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,565
- It's getting worse.
- I know.

235
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,275
What are you gonna do?

236
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,444
I'm gonna use
facial recognition algorithms

237
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,322
and meta-human trackers.
I'm gonna find Rag Doll and stop him

238
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,758
if I have to use every last resource
in S.T.A.R. Labs to do it.

239
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:49,862
Except the one that counts.

240
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,662
Barry, you promised me
that you would keep him safe.

241
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:54,997
- I know.
- I can't lose my dad.

242
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,916
You won't. I swear. I...

243
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,292
Come in!

244
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,593
When my private security said
I had a guest,

245
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:53,681
the last person I expected to see
was Captain Joe West.

246
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,267
I suppose you're here
on urgent police business.

247
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,811
Personal.

248
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,689
You made it that way
when you tried to kill me. Twice.

249
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,900
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

250
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,070
Peter Merkel. Rag Doll.

251
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,365
The last he was seen was
breaking into McCulloch Technologies.

252
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,284
- That was about a year ago.
- Yes.

253
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,372
We have had a number
of security issues lately,

254
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,124
as I'm sure you're aware.

255
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,420
You know, the strange thing is,
the C.C.P.D. never apprehended him.

256
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,503
He just vanished.

257
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,300
Until today.
Do you know anything about that?

258
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,738
Sounds like you've crafted some
very interesting narratives

259
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:34,847
about me, Captain West.

260
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:35,888
Mmm.

261
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,933
It even sounds like you're saying
I hired someone

262
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,561
to pop out of a box to assassinate you.

263
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:47,651
I didn't say that Rag Doll
popped out of a box.

264
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,364
Damn.

265
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,744
And I was doing so well.

266
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,040
You've been a pain in the ass, Captain.

267
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,126
And you've taken up
far too much of my time.

268
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,171
So, I'm gonna make you
a one-time-only offer.

269
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,881
I will call off Merkel,

270
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,177
and all you have to do is walk out
that door and leave me alone forever.

271
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:14,678
I'll make you a counteroffer.

272
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:22,394
You spend 80 years in Iron Heights

273
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,022
for attempting to assassinate
a precinct captain.

274
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,860
Technology is a fickle mistress.

275
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,579
A localized EMP pulse.

276
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,030
One of the advantages of owning

277
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,085
the most advanced
technological institution in the world.

278
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,922
Whatever you think I've done...

279
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,550
it's a million times worse.

280
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,180
I can eliminate anyone, anywhere.

281
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:02,017
And that includes you.

282
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,687
Your lovely companion, Ms. Horton.

283
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,609
Even that precious little baby of yours.

284
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,136
You took your badge off,
just walked right in there,

285
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,597
knowing what could happen.
What the hell were you thinking?

286
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,600
Do you think I went over to
Carver's house for some macho BS?

287
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,352
You know I'm not proud like that.

288
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,312
I'm just terrified
I can't protect my family.

289
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,040
But you're the one
who needs protecting right now.

290
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:53,151
I'm not worried about me, Barry.
I can't lose Cecile and Jenna.

291
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,319
And we can't lose you.

292
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:58,490
Listen. Carver has
unlimited resources, right?

293
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,576
First, it was Dr. Light,
then it was Sunshine.

294
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,495
Today, it's Rag Doll.
And tomorrow, it's... Who knows?

295
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,539
And now, if I can't protect you...

296
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,749
What do you want me to do?

297
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,961
Think about Witness Protection.

298
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,006
Joe, you need to stay alive.

299
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,600
Committing to a five-year investment

300
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,477
will guarantee you
a 5% return, Miss Genoa.

301
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,812
As for security,

302
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,524
our server room is reinforced
with military-grade steel alloys.

303
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,235
Hmm, sounds wonderfully
impenetrable.

304
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,863
Yeah,
but nothing is impenetrable.

305
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,992
Isn't that right, Ms. Dearbon?

306
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:47,664
Dearbon? You said your name was Genoa,
like the salami.

307
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,897
Yeah, she lied
about that. It's kind of her thing.

308
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,673
She is stupid rich, though.

309
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,550
Oh...

310
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:03,889
In that case... how do you two
know each other? Are you married?

311
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,014
- Gross.
- Gross.

312
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,727
Uh...

313
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,288
Do you mind excusing us for a moment?

314
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,775
I would love to speak to my friend
about possibly investing here as well.

315
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,278
By all means. Take your time.

316
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:28,038
So, slick, you here to make
a super-citizen's arrest?

317
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:32,751
- I know what you're up to.
- Really? I'm all ears.

318
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,508
The files on this
are your parents' bank accounts.

319
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,887
They've been wiring money every week
like clockwork to a coded account.

320
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,807
Your parents are being extorted.

321
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,645
What? No snarky comeback?

322
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,814
Oh! Means I'm right.

323
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,258
Are you going somewhere with this?

324
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,236
My guess is, that your parents
are being blackmailed

325
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,780
by the same person
who owns every single banking system

326
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,615
that you've hacked into
since we last met.

327
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,994
- Joseph Carver.
- Careful, slick.

328
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:12,582
You weren't stealing anything
in Paris, Shanghai or Central City.

329
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,043
You were investigating Carver.

330
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,755
He must have found out
their ugly little secret.

331
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,384
What? Did they lie on their tax returns?

332
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,636
They bribe their way
into that yacht club?

333
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,472
Enough. Assume
whatever you want about me,

334
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,099
but don't do it about my parents.

335
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:31,809
They're good people.

336
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,396
Then let me help you.

337
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,648
I barely know you.

338
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,012
You know everything that matters.

339
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,781
For the record...

340
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,952
I didn't enjoy tricking you.

341
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:52,747
Okay, I enjoyed it.

342
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,712
But honestly,
I felt pretty crappy afterwards.

343
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:00,922
Why is that?

344
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,343
'Cause you are a good person...

345
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,388
just like your parents.

346
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,682
You just have some...

347
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,309
issues.

348
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,439
You're so decent. It's nauseating.

349
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,193
Oh, boy, you should have seen me
about two years ago. I was a...

350
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,986
I was a real crapbag.

351
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,191
Actually, you probably
would have liked that, though.

352
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,616
I don't know.

353
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:31,286
This whole good guy thing
you got going on?

354
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:35,749
It's... tolerable.

355
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,168
Tolerable.

356
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,377
Which is why...

357
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,254
I'm giving you this.

358
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,138
Look into that.

359
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,850
You might find something interesting.

360
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:55,935
I did.

361
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:08,824
I just talked to Iris. She said
someone tried to kill Captain West.

362
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,826
Yeah. Joseph Carver.

363
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,619
So, what do we do?

364
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,789
Uh, I sent Jenna to stay
with her sister Joanie,

365
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,833
so, we know she's safe and, uh...

366
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:20,876
I don't know.

367
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,797
Cecile, if you're helping Joe,
and Carver finds out...

368
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,885
What? Do you think
he's gonna come after me, too?

369
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,928
If he does, he'll have to go through me.

370
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,388
Come here.

371
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,267
Me, too.

372
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,354
Sorry. I couldn't help but overhear,
but I'm here to...

373
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,331
help keep everyone safe. You feel safe?

374
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,442
We're safe. You, not so much.

375
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,661
Allegra. Hey, Allegra. Come on.

376
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,664
Hey, what can I do to fix this?
I feel terrible.

377
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:58,874
What about how I feel?

378
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,878
I've been lied to before. A lot.

379
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,881
By pretty much anyone
who has ever said they cared about me.

380
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:10,302
And now, you expect me to smile and
say it's all okay because you feel bad?

381
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:12,887
No. I...

382
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,891
What am I supposed to do?

383
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,935
Walk away.

384
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,450
Great.

385
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,439
Allegra!

386
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,122
Argh!

387
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,552
Ahhh!

388
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,223
It's too much pain.

389
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,692
You will bring

390
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:53,488
so much suffering.

391
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,789
Barr. Rag Doll took Cecile.
He sent this.

392
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,252
<i>So much delicious suffering.</i>

393
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,795
<i>See you soon, Captain.</i>

394
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:12,007
All right. I can track Cecile's phone,
but, Joe, he wants you to find her,

395
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,818
just like he used me to lure Iris.
It's a trap.

396
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,403
If something happens to her, it's on me.

397
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,487
No, we're gonna bring her home.

398
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:17,989
- But what about your speed?
- Don't worry about my speed.

399
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,431
I'll do whatever I can, all right?

400
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,316
I won't hold back until she's safe.
Let's go.

401
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,479
- You okay?
- I'm okay. I'm good.

402
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,031
Joe, find Cecile. I'll hold him off.

403
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,074
Run, Captain. Run.

404
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,201
Cecile!

405
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,463
Babe!

406
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,931
Babe!

407
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,351
Babe, I'm coming.

408
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,359
Okay.

409
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:22,035
Careful. Don't touch me.
It's a pressure bomb.

410
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,718
If it's not weighted down,
it'll explode.

411
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:25,496
How do you know that?

412
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,209
He told me to tell you.

413
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,335
Okay.

414
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,800
I see you.

415
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,051
Missed me.

416
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,473
Almost. Getting closer.

417
00:28:56,986 --> 00:29:00,615
Suffer. Nice and slow.

418
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,372
Ow.

419
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,878
Captain West, Rag Doll was here.

420
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,089
<i>Yeah, I know. He took Cecile.
I'm here with her now.</i>

421
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:19,467
Listen, I need your help
defusing an explosive.

422
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,469
What kind of device is it, Captain?

423
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:25,265
It is a Michael 112

424
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:28,643
composition Charlie four,
block demolition charge.

425
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,395
C-4. Block demolition charge.

426
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,897
Yeah, got it.

427
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:38,153
Okay. So, easy. Open the outer panel.
You're gonna see four wires.

428
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,236
Pull the green one.

429
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:47,036
There are more than four wires
and they're all green.

430
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,293
- I got this.
- But how? Captain...

431
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,376
Okay.

432
00:29:56,087 --> 00:30:01,342
Babe, do you remember dancing
at your cousin's wedding?

433
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,804
When you were stepping
on my toes until we finally got in sync?

434
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,557
- Yeah, we're gonna do that now.
- What? No.

435
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,268
Shh! We do not have time.

436
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:12,395
- I can't let you do that.
- Follow me.

437
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,608
- On three, move. Okay?
- Okay.

438
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,278
One, two, three!

439
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,204
We lost a minute.

440
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:54,103
You're not gonna make anyone
suffer anymore, Merkel.

441
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,451
No matter how much
Black Hole's paying you.

442
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:00,443
Pay? Don't care about money.

443
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:04,447
If you're not trying to kill Joe
for money, why are you doing this?

444
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,950
For release.

445
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,285
Mother's dead. Heart attack.

446
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:14,749
No one left to suffer now,
except myself.

447
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:18,795
Thank you, Flash, for helping me suffer.

448
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:23,925
Any second now,
release comes with kaboom.

449
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,146
Joe, what did you do?

450
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,108
What I had to do.
Please, get Cecile out of here now.

451
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,609
No. I don't wanna leave you.

452
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:44,529
Cecile, please.
Make sure that Jenna is safe.

453
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:48,408
- Joe, I'm not...
- Barry, go. Now.

454
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,165
Okay. All right. Come on. Let's go.

455
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:06,175
- Barry!
- I have to try.

456
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,936
I should go into WITSEC.

457
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,768
Federal agents will be here any minute.

458
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,872
They'll be the only ones
who know where you're going.

459
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,253
They'll keep you safe, Joe.

460
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,673
At least till we get
this Carver mess sorted out.

461
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,884
Thank you, David. For everything, man.

462
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,974
Iris isn't answering her phone.
She needs to know this is happening.

463
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,058
They're here.

464
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,732
I can maybe...

465
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,443
Just tell Iris I love her, okay?

466
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,535
Okay, I don't think I can do this.

467
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:58,996
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

468
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,793
Yes. Listen. I have to go. It's the
only way to keep our family safe.

469
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:06,587
You just tell little baby Jenna

470
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:07,940
that her daddy's gonna come home

471
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,591
as soon as he possibly can, okay?

472
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,766
- I love you, Cecile Horton.
- I love you.

473
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,477
I love you.

474
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:27,108
Listen. Iris and I, we're gonna
take down Carver and Black Hole,

475
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,569
and then we're gonna bring you home.
I promise.

476
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,948
- Keep Iris safe.
- I will.

477
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,972
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

478
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,909
Joe West is out of the way,
as requested.

479
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,495
Success is assured.

480
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,666
Good. If anyone's gonna make my husband
pay for what he did, it's gonna be me.

481
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,343
Looks like Captain Joe West
will no longer be a problem.

482
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,905
<i>Someone else must
have heard the good news, too,</i>

483
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,890
<i>because they sent you a gift.
I had it delivered.</i>

484
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:46,746
Hello, Joseph.

485
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,585
You're a hard man to get a hold of.

486
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,712
That's on purpose.

487
00:36:55,131 --> 00:37:00,303
Wait. I just have one little thing
I need from you.

488
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:02,762
An apology.

489
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,267
Seriously?

490
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,771
- That's what this is about?
- I wanted to help the world.

491
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,733
Now, you're destroying it.

492
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,652
I am keeping it safe.

493
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:21,073
You let me rot in here,
while you took everything I created.

494
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:24,410
- I had a vision for humankind!
- So did I!

495
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,836
And now, I'm making it a reality.

496
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,173
This is your last chance, Joseph.

497
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,676
Threats are for real people, Eva.

498
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,555
Not phantoms.
Because that's what you are.

499
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:46,473
And me?

500
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:52,438
Darling... I'm untouchable.

501
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,122
Literally.

502
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:40,527
I just talked to David.

503
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:46,534
- Is my dad really gone?
- I tried calling you.

504
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,456
That's your excuse?
My dad is in Witness Protection, Barry.

505
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,043
- You should have come to get me.
- Yeah. Iris, there wasn't enough time.

506
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:00,381
You're the Flash, Barry.
You can make a second last an hour.

507
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,340
Where is he?

508
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,886
- I honestly don't know.
- When is he coming back?

509
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,304
The second that we catch Carver.

510
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,933
Carver's pockets are lined
with politicians and lawmakers, Barry.

511
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:14,395
Not to mention assassins.
It could be years before we catch him.

512
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:19,567
Iris, I'm so sorry, but Cecile
was almost killed, and then Joe.

513
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:21,777
He had to leave right away,

514
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,071
or else Carver may come after
Jenna or you next.

515
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:28,200
- Carver already came after me.
- And I wasn't here to protect you.

516
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,788
Look, I'm trying to keep
this family safe.

517
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,268
I want you to take me to him right now.

518
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,017
I told you.
I don't know where he's going.

519
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:43,049
You don't need to, Barry.
They left, what, like, 30 minutes ago?

520
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,468
They're probably still within
a 50-mile radius.

521
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,054
With your speed, you could search
the entire area in seconds.

522
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:51,432
- You know I can't. Not anymore.
- Can't or won't?

523
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,977
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is, Barry!

524
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:56,061
No, it isn't!

525
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,356
Look, Iris, I'm barely hanging on.

526
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,525
I can't catch my breath.

527
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,445
I'm getting dizzy, my feet are numb,
my fingers tingle.

528
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,907
It feels like with every step I take,
I'm getting ripped in two.

529
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:11,368
All I can think about is if I'll be fast
enough tomorrow to save another life.

530
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:14,497
- I trusted you, Barry.
- Iris, I...

531
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,751
Now, we have something else in common.

532
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,296
We both lost our parents.

533
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,425
I hope that was worth it.

534
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,184
Where are you going? Iris?

535
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,145
I want you to leave.

536
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,775
- You can't be serious.
- Barry, you always do this.

537
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,652
You always make all of these decisions,

538
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,855
and then the rest of us
have to deal with the fallout.

539
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:50,157
Flashpoint, going into the Speed Force,

540
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:53,786
taking Nora into the future,
and now, this? I am done, Barry.

541
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,579
- Iris...
- I want you to get out.

542
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,833
Please. Okay, look,
we can work through this.

543
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,001
- You're my home.
- Not anymore.

544
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,173
Leave.

545
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:14,197
