1
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,825
I made a deal for you
to keep your ungrateful head

2
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,576
on your ungrateful neck
a little while longer.

3
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,119
I'm sorry, what am I grateful for?

4
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,747
The opportunity to live and die
at the Wall as punishment

5
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,332
for a crime I did not commit?

6
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,959
You threw your life away.
You threw it away.

7
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,753
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

8
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,589
Of course, it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

9
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,760
I couldn't...

10
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,971
I couldn't listen to her

11
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,808
standing there telling her lies.
I couldn't do it.

12
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,021
-You fell in love with a whore.
-Yes, I fell in love with a whore.

13
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,733
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

14
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,531
That deal you made,

15
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,742
it was everything Father wanted.

16
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,204
You do see that?
He gets you back as his heir.

17
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,456
The future Lord of the Rock.

18
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,586
And he ships me off to Castle Black,
out of sight at last.

19
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,755
All so perfect.

20
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,677
It felt good to take that from him.

21
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,308
He knows I'm innocent
and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.

22
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,977
-He's willing to sacrifice any of us.
-Not you.

23
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,646
You're the golden son.

24
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,274
You could kill a king, lose a hand,

25
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,902
fuck your own sister,
you'll always be the golden son.

26
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,944
Careful.

27
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,488
I'm the last friend you've got.

28
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,913
At least, I got to tell them
what they really are.

29
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,664
Yes, brilliant speech.

30
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,459
They'll be talking about it
for days to come.

31
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,502
I thought you were a realist.

32
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,466
-Didn't realize you'd die for pride.
-Don't give up on me just yet.

33
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,802
I survived one trial by combat,

34
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,640
-even though you weren't there to save me.
-I can't save you this time either.

35
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,727
My training has proved

36
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,438
that I can't beat a stable boy
with my left hand.

37
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:53,733
Where's your sense of adventure?

38
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,613
Even if you lose, imagine the look
on Father's face when you fall.

39
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,533
Our family name snuffed out
with a single swing of the sword.

40
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,662
It is tempting.

41
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:22,971
Well...

42
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,057
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,518
If he wins...

44
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,814
I expect I'll be in his debt
for the rest of my life.

45
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,440
If he wins.

46
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,359
Will you find him for me?

47
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,490
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

48
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,493
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

49
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,746
I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel
that pompous child beater.

50
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,915
No.

51
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,126
Not Ser Meryn.

52
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,804
Go on, move it.

53
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,973
And you.

54
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,975
Come on.

55
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,569
Mercy.

56
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,699
Please, please. Mercy.

57
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,171
Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital.

58
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,924
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

59
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,346
You seem to be in good form.

60
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,891
Who am I fighting?

61
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,268
Does that matter?

62
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,418
Could be food.

63
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,337
Could be soldiers.

64
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,322
You shouldn't be sitting
out here like this.

65
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,908
Where else to sit?

66
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,786
Tried to walk back to my hut...

67
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,080
hurt too much.

68
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,750
Then I remembered they burned my hut down.

69
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,252
Who were "they"?

70
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,004
I stopped asking a while ago.

71
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,678
That's not going to get better.

72
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,557
-Doesn't seem so.
-A bad way to go.

73
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,893
Haven't you had enough?

74
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,979
Of what?

75
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,483
I know.

76
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,777
Time to go.

77
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,322
Take matters into my own hands.

78
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,326
The thought has occurred to me.

79
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,082
So, why go on?

80
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,835
Habit.

81
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,673
Nothing could be worse than this.

82
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,135
Maybe nothing is worse than this.

83
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,308
Nothing isn't better
or worse than anything.

84
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,854
Nothing is just nothing.

85
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,611
Who are you?

86
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,281
My name's Arya.

87
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,950
Arya Stark.

88
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,164
You her father?

89
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,208
Her captor.

90
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,419
Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.

91
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,173
A fair exchange, that is.

92
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,388
Always held to the notion of fair exchange
in all my dealings.

93
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,976
You give me, I give you.

94
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,604
Fair.

95
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,106
A balance.

96
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,444
No balance anymore.

97
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,785
Could I have a drink?

98
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,454
Dying is thirsty work.

99
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,508
Wish it were wine.

100
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,969
So do I.

101
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,323
That's where the heart is.

102
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,121
That's how you kill a man.

103
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,505
The fuck you doing?

104
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,259
There's a price on your head.

105
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,220
Guess that's what the king does
when you tell him to fuck off.

106
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,516
The king's dead.
He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.

107
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,602
The bounty on you is for killing
Lannister soldiers.

108
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,563
A hundred silver stags.

109
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,481
And you thought
you were going to collect it?

110
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,692
Didn't think very hard, did you?

111
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,113
You were Yoren's prisoners
when he was taking me to the Wall.

112
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,616
He told me,
he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.

113
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,287
This day's really not working out
the way you planned.

114
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,039
He on your little list?

115
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,207
He can't be.

116
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,960
I don't know his name.

117
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,047
What's your name?

118
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,467
-Rorge.
-Thank you.

119
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,600
You're learning.

120
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,484
Rangers returning!

121
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,237
They return!

122
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,075
-Rangers returning!
-Greetings.

123
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,036
All right, Jon?

124
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
Welcome back, brother.

125
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,465
Lord Snow.

126
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,848
This is no place for wild beasts.

127
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,769
Lock him away or I'll let Hobb
throw him in tonight's stew.

128
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,198
Come on, Ghost.

129
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,496
Mance's army was closing
in on Craster's Keep when we left.

130
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,791
We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill.

131
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,584
They'll reach the Wall
before the next full moon.

132
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,711
I'm surprised you didn't ride over
and say hello.

133
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,297
The King-beyond-the-Wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

134
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,842
-We need to prepare.
-We've been preparing.

135
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,385
We should seal the tunnel.

136
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,598
Plug it with rocks and ice.
Flood it and let it freeze.

137
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,100
And how would we range north?

138
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,810
-We wouldn't.
-Coward.

139
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,689
You would cut off our legs,
pluck out our eyes,

140
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,317
leave us cowering behind the Wall
hoping for the storm to pass?

141
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,279
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men.

142
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,531
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

143
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,076
The Night's Watch
has defended her for thousands of years.

144
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,121
And in all those centuries,
we have never sealed the tunnel.

145
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,956
Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?

146
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,377
I have. The tunnel's gate won't stop them.

147
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,671
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

148
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,716
-Cold-rolled steel.
-And they won't stop them.

149
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,762
Remind me which order you belong to,
Lord Snow.

150
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,556
The stewards.

151
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,517
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

152
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,146
-No.
-Who would that be?

153
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,567
-The builders.
-Ah, the builders.

154
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,069
First Builder Yarwyck,

155
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,906
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

156
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,994
leaving us unable to carry out our duties
as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.

157
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,497
Do you agree with him?

158
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,840
No.

159
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,678
Given your deep knowledge
of the wildling army, Lord Snow,

160
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,600
you and Tarly will take night duties
atop the Wall until the full moon.

161
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,438
Moving on.

162
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,900
First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels
of pitch brought atop the wall.

163
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,802
My lord.

164
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,100
-You have new clothes.
-Do you like 'em? Eh?

165
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,938
Gloves are doeskin.
Softer than a virgin's thighs.

166
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,815
I sent for you days ago.

167
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,942
-I've been a bit busy.
-Doing what?

168
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,823
My lonesome bachelor days are over.

169
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,785
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

170
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,414
Lollys Stokeworth?

171
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,625
She doesn't strike me
as your sort of girl.

172
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,004
I wouldn't say
I had a single sort of girl.

173
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,631
-She's dim-witted.
-If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

174
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,093
When my sister arranged this love match,

175
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,096
did she mention
that Lollys has an older sister?

176
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,558
Falyse. Aye, I did know
about the older sister.

177
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,685
And you understand
the rules of inheritance?

178
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,355
-Falyse is 40 and barren.
-She still gets Castle Stokeworth

179
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,274
-when her father dies.
-She does.

180
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,152
Unless she happens to perish
before her father.

181
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,070
Then Lollys gets the castle.

182
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,201
What? Ladies fall from their horses
and snap their pretty necks all the time.

183
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,829
You and my sister deserve each other.

184
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,624
Why did you bother to come here?

185
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:28,218
You once said if anyone ever asked me
to sell you out, you'd double their price.

186
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,138
-Is it two wives you want or two castles?
-One of each will do.

187
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,018
But if you want me to kill
the Mountain for you,

188
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:40,022
-it'd better be a damn big castle.
-I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.

189
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,815
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

190
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,027
I have gold.
What can I buy with gratitude?

191
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,362
You might be surprised.

192
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,033
-A Lannister always pays his debts.
-Your sister's a Lannister, too.

193
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,160
My wife is heir to Winterfell.

194
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,081
If I emerge from this
with my head still on my shoulders,

195
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,501
I may one day rule the North in her name.

196
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:05,464
-I could carve you out a big piece of it.
-"If" and "may" and "could".

197
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,553
It's bloody cold up north.
Lollys is soft and warm. And close.

198
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,056
If I gave you the choice

199
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,517
between fucking Lollys
and fighting the Mountain,

200
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,811
you'd have your britches down
and your cock up before I could blink.

201
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,604
Does he frighten you so much?

202
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,690
I'd be a bloody fool
if he didn't frighten me.

203
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,608
He's freakish big and freakish strong.

204
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,070
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man of that size.

205
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,156
Maybe I could take him,

206
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,243
dance around until he's so tired
of hacking at me.

207
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,954
He dropped his sword.
Get him off his feet somehow.

208
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,541
But one misstep and I'm dead.

209
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,127
Why should I risk it?

210
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,715
-Because you're my friend.
-Aye, I'm your friend.

211
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,759
And when have you
ever risked your life for me?

212
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,312
I like you...

213
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,815
pampered little shit that you are.

214
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,235
-I just like myself more.
-I understand.

215
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,822
-I'm sorry it has to be this way.
-Why are you sorry?

216
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,201
Because you're an evil bastard
with no conscience and no heart?

217
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,912
That's what I liked about you
in the first place.

218
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,964
-We had some good days together.
-Yes, we did.

219
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,356
-What will you do?
-I suppose...

220
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,193
I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.

221
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,863
Won't that make for a great song?

222
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,702
I hope to hear them sing it one day.

223
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,265
-How did you get in here?
-Your door is well guarded,

224
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,934
but your window is not.

225
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,027
I swam to an island
a mile offshore for these.

226
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,988
Don't do that again.

227
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,492
Never met a woman
who didn't like wildflowers.

228
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:43,413
These are my private quarters.
If I want you here, I will summon you.

229
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,835
Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.

230
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,968
Tell me why you're here.

231
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,265
I came to ask a favor.

232
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,476
I only have two talents in this world...

233
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,603
war and women.

234
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,690
You are staying here in Meereen to rule.

235
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,608
That is a wise decision.
I respect it, but...

236
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,069
here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

237
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,240
I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol
the streets to stop the revenge killings.

238
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,993
-You've ordered us to be night watchmen--
-And as for women,

239
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,080
there are thousands
in Meereen you can pursue.

240
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,416
There's only one,

241
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,793
and she does not want me.

242
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,799
-You swore me your sword.
-My sword is yours till the day I die.

243
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,887
So, if I command you to stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets?

244
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,471
I'll stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets.

245
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,102
Send me to kill your enemies.
Any enemy, anywhere.

246
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,147
Let me do what I do best.

247
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,734
Very well.

248
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,783
Do what you do best.

249
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,880
Take off your clothes.

250
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,373
Come in, my queen. Please.

251
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,793
-I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.
-You could never disturb me.

252
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,920
I just wanted to speak with you
before we left.

253
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,965
Could you bring me that vial over there?

254
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,219
The blue one.

255
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,348
No, no, no. Not that one.

256
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,310
You don't even want to touch that one.
Next to it.

257
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,563
That's the one.

258
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,836
When I looked into the flames
this morning, the Lord spoke to me.

259
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,629
He said...

260
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,010
"Tonight, you will have
your last good bath in a long while."

261
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,886
"Make it count."

262
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,225
A joke.

263
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,688
-Not a very good one, I'm afraid.
-It was. I...

264
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,315
humor isn't my strength.

265
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,860
That's because most jokes are lies.

266
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,446
And you're devoted to the truth.

267
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,198
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

268
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,242
Not always.

269
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,757
Most of these powders and potions...
are lies.

270
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,218
Deceptions to make men think
they witnessed our Lord's power.

271
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,347
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was...

272
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,267
a trick that led them to the truth.

273
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,520
A pinch of this powder in a bonfire

274
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,066
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

275
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,069
And this one creates a black smoke

276
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,362
that will make the bravest man
piss himself with fear.

277
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:49,743
And a drop of this in any man's wine
will drive him wild with lust.

278
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,249
-Did you use it with Stannis?
-No.

279
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,049
Don't be upset.
Men never crave what they already have.

280
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,511
It's only flesh.

281
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,555
It needs what it needs.

282
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:19,856
No act done in service of the Lord
can ever be called a sin.

283
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,235
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

284
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,403
And Stannis to you.

285
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,367
He wants to bring Shireen with us.

286
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,955
I think that would be ill-advised.

287
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,917
My daughter has heretical tendencies,
as you're well aware.

288
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,712
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

289
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,799
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

290
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,305
I understand how you feel.

291
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,475
But that is impossible.

292
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,188
Why?

293
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,568
You don't need powders and potions,
my queen.

294
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,653
You don't need lies.

295
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,574
You are strong enough
to look into the Lord's light

296
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,242
and see his truth for yourself.

297
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,041
However harsh it is.

298
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,878
However hard for us to understand.

299
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,008
You don't need my help,
but I will need yours soon.

300
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,511
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

301
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,267
The Lord needs her.

302
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,235
Jorah the Andal.

303
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,780
Are you here to see our queen?

304
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,451
She's in a good mood.

305
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,550
Khaleesi.

306
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,887
-You're here early.
-Later than some.

307
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,142
-You don't approve?
-It's not a question of approval,

308
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,312
-it's a question of trust.
-You neither approve nor trust.

309
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,481
Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

310
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,816
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company
before pledging your sword

311
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,735
-to my brother?
-I did.

312
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,281
-I trust you.
-Daario Naharis killed his captains

313
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,201
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

314
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,536
How could you ever have faith
in a man like that?

315
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,248
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

316
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,211
That's why I've sent him
and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

317
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,840
-You have?
-I have.

318
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,801
Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,

319
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,178
I fear the masters
will simply bide their time,

320
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,514
wait for the invaders to leave
and reassert control.

321
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:01,309
That is why I've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

322
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,689
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

323
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,941
They mutilate little boys
by the thousands.

324
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,568
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

325
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,655
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

326
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,158
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

327
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,160
is also treating men like beasts.

328
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,790
The slaves you freed,
brutality is all they've ever known.

329
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,210
If you want them to know something else,
you'll have to show it to them.

330
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,880
And repay the slavers with what?
Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?

331
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,842
It's tempting to see your enemies
as evil, all of them,

332
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,511
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

333
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,724
Let the priests argue over good and evil.
Slavery is real.

334
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,353
I can end it. I will end it.
And I will end those behind it.

335
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,731
I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

336
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,569
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

337
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,739
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

338
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,657
what you want to do to the masters
of Yunkai.

339
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,124
The man who came to me
the other day about burying his father.

340
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,168
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

341
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,006
He will accompany the Second Sons
and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.

342
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,051
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

343
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,512
He will explain the choice
they have before them.

344
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:24,225
They can live in my new world
or they can die in their old one.

345
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,149
Well, go and catch Daario
before he leaves.

346
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,151
Tell him I changed my mind.

347
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,487
Yes, Khaleesi.

348
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,285
No.

349
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,791
Tell him you changed my mind.

350
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,388
Rat cunts.

351
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,308
Fucking whore.

352
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,895
You're doing it wrong.

353
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,065
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

354
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,401
Otherwise, it's gonna get infected
and fester.

355
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,240
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right--

356
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,324
No fire.

357
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,371
It'll only take a second.
It won't hurt that much.

358
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,580
No fire!

359
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,888
Shut up about it.

360
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,185
Shut up about everything.

361
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,147
Thanks to you,
I'm a walking bag of silver

362
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,857
anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.

363
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,193
Which is everywhere

364
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,778
between where we are now
and where we're going.

365
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,701
I'm as stupid as that hog you
stuck back in the village...

366
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,747
getting myself cut
and stabbed and bitten.

367
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,794
No reward's worth this much trouble.

368
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,130
Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

369
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,477
You say your brother gave you that sword.

370
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,772
My brother gave me this.

371
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,319
It was just like you said a while back.

372
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,032
Pressed me to the fire
like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

373
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,206
-Why?
-Thought I stole one of his toys.

374
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,166
I didn't steal it.
I was just playing with it.

375
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,006
The pain was bad.

376
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,342
The smell was worse.

377
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,682
But the worst thing
was that it was my brother who did it.

378
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,397
My father, who protected him...

379
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,486
told everyone my bedding caught fire.

380
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,209
You think you're on your own?

381
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,341
Let me wash it out
and help you sew it up at least.

382
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,203
Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.

383
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,706
We've been sleeping in ditches
the last few weeks.

384
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,667
I think we can treat ourselves
to a featherbed for the night

385
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,796
-and a hot meal not cooked by you.
-Couldn't agree more, my lady.

386
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,048
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

387
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,301
Not working for your former lord
any longer.

388
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,261
-Yes, my lady.
-Don't get drunk.

389
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,640
-No, my lady.
-Can I get you anything else?

390
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,559
No, this will do nicely, thank you.

391
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,227
Kidney pie is wonderful.

392
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,062
Thanks.

393
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,023
I do my best.

394
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,527
A good kidney pie
is all about the ingredients.

395
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,322
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.

396
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,534
Easy enough. But the meat,
peacetime or not, getting your hands

397
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,120
on a good bottom round steak
and calves' kidneys is not easy.

398
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,497
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

399
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,209
-Got no right to cook anything, them.
-Oh, and the gravy.

400
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:04,130
Don't get me started on the gravy.
Very difficult to get right.

401
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,800
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.
You cannot give up on the gravy.

402
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,887
No gravy, no pie. Simple as that.

403
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,224
That's nice armor. You a knight?

404
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,936
No.

405
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,315
Oh, it's just... people with armor
is usually knights...

406
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,151
generally speaking.
From King's Landing, though, aren't you?

407
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,528
From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.

408
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,364
What brings you to these parts?

409
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,283
We're looking for someone.

410
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,118
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

411
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,663
A lot of people come in here.
I mean, just the other day we had 17--

412
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,706
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.

413
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,584
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

414
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,003
Starks?

415
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,759
What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?

416
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,598
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

417
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,769
I heard they was all traitors.
Don't need no traitors in here.

418
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,230
I pledged my life to their mother,
Catelyn Stark.

419
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,816
I swore to her
I'd bring her daughters home.

420
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,823
Sure I can't get you
a bit more kidney pie?

421
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,090
-What?
-It's nothing, my lady.

422
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,552
You wouldn't be screwing your face
up like that if it was nothing.

423
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,929
Don't want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

424
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,681
You're not interesting enough
to be offensive.

425
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,893
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.

426
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,020
The Lannisters have money.

427
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,106
People kill for money.

428
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,027
I don't think we should be telling people
we're searching for Lady Sansa.

429
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:04,917
-M'lady. M'lord. Could I have a word?
-What about? Not kidney pie.

430
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,171
You seem like a proper lady.
You know, someone who could be trusted.

431
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,300
I never met no Sansa Stark.

432
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,844
But I know her sister...

433
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,430
Arya.

434
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,894
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

435
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,604
She's presumed dead.

436
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,149
-She weren't when I last spoke to her.
-When was that?

437
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,110
Heading up north with the Night's Watch.
She was all dressed up as a boy.

438
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,155
Well, like Your Ladyship,
only without the armor.

439
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,782
Going by the name Arry.

440
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,201
-So, what happened to her?
-Well--

441
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,243
The quick version.

442
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,038
The Lannisters took us prisoner.

443
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,332
We escaped.

444
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,835
Then the Brotherhood took us prisoner.
They sold me to the innkeep.

445
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,588
They were gonna sell Arya
to her mother at Riverrun

446
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,632
along with another prisoner.
Big ugly fellow.

447
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,967
Foul mouth
and a face like a half-burnt ham.

448
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,595
-Not friendly.
-The Hound.

449
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,222
That's the one.

450
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,809
Look, if you find her,
could you give her this?

451
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,729
She liked the last one I gave her,
but, well, this one turned out better.

452
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,242
Um, you were saying?

453
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,249
Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead,

454
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:30,503
Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.
The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.

455
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,213
They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

456
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,551
-Why the Eyrie?
-Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

457
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,594
Catelyn Stark's sister.

458
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,806
She's Arya's last living relative
with money.

459
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,225
She hates the Lannisters.

460
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,855
Lord Tyrion made sure I knew

461
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,023
which house married
which and who hated who.

462
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,609
Sansa could be there too.

463
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,446
Aye, my lady. Could be.

464
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,788
You sure about this?

465
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,918
No.

466
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,202
I imagined you'd be back
at the brothel at this hour.

467
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,999
I did spend some time with an absolutely
stunning blonde the other day.

468
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,418
Do tell.

469
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:57,757
I've got every kind of filth down here
except the kind I like.

470
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,508
Your sister.

471
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,353
Cersei approached me.

472
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,856
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.

473
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,193
How worried your sister is about her.

474
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,031
She was trying very hard to pretend
she had not come to sway me against you.

475
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,575
I think she may have
even believed it herself.

476
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,163
Making honest feelings do dishonest work
is one of her many gifts.

477
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,458
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

478
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,964
It is rare to meet a Lannister

479
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,467
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

480
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,430
She desperately wants to see you killed.

481
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,766
She didn't need to bother you.

482
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,520
It looks as though
I've taken care of that myself.

483
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:57,274
The joy she will feel
when my head leaves my neck.

484
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,569
She's wanted this for a long time.

485
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,030
Yes, I know.

486
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,367
We met, you and I.

487
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,286
Many years ago.

488
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,583
-I think I would have remembered that.
-Unlikely. You had just been born.

489
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,672
Our father brought me
and my sister Elia with him

490
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,340
on a visit to Casterly Rock.

491
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,509
My first time away from Dorne.

492
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,761
I didn't like anything about the Rock.

493
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:32,268
Not the food, not the weather,
not your accents. Nothing.

494
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,397
But the biggest disappointment...

495
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,108
you.

496
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,113
You and my family have more
in common than you might admit.

497
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,952
The whole way from Dorne
all anyone talked about was the monster

498
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,371
that had been born to Tywin Lannister.

499
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,458
A head twice the size of his body,

500
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,545
a tail between his legs,
claws, one red eye,

501
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,131
the privates of both a girl and a boy.

502
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,425
That would have made things
so much easier.

503
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,179
When we met your sister,
she promised she would show you to us.

504
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:12,183
Every day we would ask.
Every day she would say, "Soon."

505
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:18,397
Then she and your brother
took us to your nursery and...

506
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,110
she unveiled the freak.

507
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,615
Your head was a bit large.

508
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,826
Your arms and legs were a bit small,
but no claw.

509
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:36,123
No red eye. No tail between your legs.
Just a tiny pink cock.

510
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:42,004
We didn't try to hide our disappointment.
"That's not a monster," I told Cersei.

511
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,882
"That's just a baby."

512
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,428
And she said, "He killed my mother."

513
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,766
And she pinched your little cock so hard,
I thought she might pull it off.

514
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,643
Until your brother made her stop.

515
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,270
"It doesn't matter," she told us.

516
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,274
"Everyone says he will die soon.
I hope they are right."

517
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,069
"He should not have lived this long."

518
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,449
Well...

519
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,623
sooner or later,
Cersei always gets what she wants.

520
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,503
And what about what I want?

521
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,924
Justice...

522
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,053
for my sister and her children.

523
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,599
If you want justice,
you've come to the wrong place.

524
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,601
I disagree.

525
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,821
I've come to the perfect place.

526
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,117
I want to bring those
who have wronged me to justice.

527
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,870
And all those who have wronged me
are right here.

528
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:03,544
I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane,
who killed my sister's children

529
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,797
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

530
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,841
before killing her too.

531
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,144
I will be your champion.

532
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,325
Hello, Robin.

533
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,289
-What are you doing?
-I'm building my home, Winterfell.

534
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,794
At least, I think I am. I haven't been
back there in a very long time.

535
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:31,465
-Why did you leave?
-It's a long story.

536
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,762
I stay here in the Eyrie.
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads

537
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,765
and I have to keep myself safe
because I'm the Lord of the Vale

538
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,976
and the Lord of the Vale
is a very important person.

539
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,936
Yes, you certainly are.

540
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,563
When will you go back?

541
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,358
Probably never.

542
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,362
My family doesn't live there anymore
and someone burned it down.

543
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,620
-Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
-No, I'm afraid not.

544
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,913
It's not high up in the mountains.

545
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,207
-It's down on the ground.
-That sounds dangerous.

546
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,460
-How do you make people fly?
-We don't.

547
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,962
What do you do with all the bad people

548
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,506
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

549
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:14,133
I never did anything with them at all.

550
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,510
Girls didn't take part
in that where I came from.

551
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,180
Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.

552
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,350
When I grow up, I'll be able to fly
anybody who bothers me.

553
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,271
Or you. When we get married,
you can tell me if you don't like somebody

554
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,732
and then we can bring them back here,
and whoosh!

555
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,275
Right through the Moon Door.

556
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,905
-I like the sound of that.
-Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

557
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:40,576
-All right.
-It can go in here in this big tower.

558
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,619
Be careful! You've ruined it.

559
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,413
Now I'm going to have to rebuild
the whole thing.

560
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,664
-I didn't ruin it.
-You did.

561
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,666
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

562
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,294
-I was fixing it.
-Knocking things down isn't fixing them.

563
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,087
-It's ruining them.
-I didn't ruin it!

564
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,631
-You're being stupid.
-I didn't ruin it!

565
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,770
Robin, I'm sorry, I--

566
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,147
Children.

567
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,403
-I hit him.
-Yes, I saw.

568
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,529
I shouldn't have done that.

569
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,991
No... his mother should have

570
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,285
a long time ago.

571
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,663
Consider it a step in the right direction.

572
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,835
-If he tells Aunt Lysa...
-Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

573
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,131
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

574
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,301
I'll never see it again.

575
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,181
A lot can happen between now and never.

576
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,271
If you want to build a better home,
first you must demolish the old one.

577
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,360
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

578
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,324
Tell me why.

579
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,374
I loved your mother
more than you could ever know.

580
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:17,589
Given the opportunity, what do we do
to those who've hurt the ones we love?

581
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,641
In a better world...

582
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,018
one where love...

583
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,106
could overcome strength and duty...

584
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,651
you might have been my child.

585
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,073
But we don't live in that world.

586
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,087
You're more beautiful than she ever was.

587
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,342
-Lord Baelish...
-Call me Petyr.

588
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,164
You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?

589
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,417
Come here, Sansa.

590
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,184
Do you know how far the fall is?

591
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,731
-No.
-Neither do I, precisely.

592
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,399
Hundreds of feet.

593
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,946
It's fascinating what happens to bodies

594
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,781
when they hit the rocks
from such a height.

595
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,450
The impact breaks them right apart.

596
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:13,705
Like eggs dropped on the floor.
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

597
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,708
You'll find the head sitting on its own.

598
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,797
Every hair in place.
Blue eyes staring at nothing.

599
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,308
I know what you did.

600
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,646
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

601
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,940
I never should have hit Robin,
I know it. I promise it won't--

602
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:44,820
Don't be coy with me, you little whore.
You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.

603
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,072
-I didn't. You don't understand.
-I saw you.

604
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,200
You can't lie to me
because I saw it with my own eyes.

605
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,327
-He kissed me. I pulled away--
-Liar!

606
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:58,041
Whore! He is mine!
My father, my husband, my sister,

607
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,960
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

608
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,880
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

609
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,759
Look down! Look down! Look down!
Look down!

610
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,760
Lysa!

611
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,515
Let her go.

612
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,061
You want her?

613
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:23,650
-This empty-headed child?
-Let her go.

614
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,403
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

615
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,158
I lied for you. I killed for you.

616
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,411
-Why did you bring her here? Why?
-I'll send her away.

617
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,124
I swear on my life.

618
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,544
I swear to all the gods.

619
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,048
Let her go, Lysa.

620
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,150
Oh, my sweet wife.

621
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,782
My sweet, silly wife.

622
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,416
I have only loved one woman...

623
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,544
only one,

624
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,546
my entire life.

625
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,720
Your sister.
