1
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:30,316
NOGRADY: Today really
marks the first stage

2
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:33,826
of an unprecedented
technological advancement.

3
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:38,162
We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.

4
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:40,907
These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun

5
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:42,248
as we have with ours.

6
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:45,173
If a planet's too far away
from its sun, it's too cold.

7
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:46,965
If it's too close to
its sun, it's too hot.

8
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:50,217
But for an Earth-like planet,
the distance is just right.

9
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,877
Potentially perfect
for sustaining life.

10
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:57,059
We have finally managed
to identify one planet

11
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:00,809
that is the right distance
from its star to hold water

12
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:03,815
and is the right mass
to sustain an atmosphere.

13
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,850
Every 24 hours,
our station in Hawaii

14
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:12,690
will transmit a signal to Landsat
7, our deep orbiting satellite,

15
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:16,994
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet

16
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,326
which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.

17
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,544
If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here

18
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:27,713
it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.

19
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,626
Only, we're the Indians.

20
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:35,345
Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.

21
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:37,633
Start transmission.

22
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:07,160
JACKIE: It seems as though
NASA is setting up shop

23
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,997
right here in
our own backyard.

24
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,256
Today, the Beacon International
Project was launched.

25
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,381
Satellite dishes
here on Oahu

26
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:17,589
sending out very powerful
signals into deep space

27
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:19,969
with an attempt to
communicate with anyone...

28
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:21,588
STONE: Another round,
birthday boy.

29
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,344
JACKIE: ...or anything that
might be out there listening.

30
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:24,764
A toast.

31
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,229
Happy birthday,
little brother.

32
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:29,683
I'm wishing you success and
growth, and happiness.

33
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:32,349
May this be
a great year for you.

34
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:33,855
It's going to
be a great year.

35
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,023
I love you.
I love you, too.

36
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:40,988
So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,

37
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:44,328
this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.

38
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:45,951
Johnny.

39
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:49,292
"Adversity is
the state in which man

40
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,702
"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself

41
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,417
"being especially free
of admirers then."

42
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,706
Cheers.

43
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,917
I'm not cheers-ing that.

44
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,127
It's a very
good quote for you.

45
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,890
"I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?

46
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:04,135
Will you shut up?

47
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:05,553
Light your cupcake
and raise your glass.

48
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,055
Did you get me that?

49
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:08,555
Yes, I got you that.

50
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,058
Thank you,
that's very sweet.

51
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:11,558
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.

52
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:18,149
I got this guy, Tony.
He said he can get you a construction job.

53
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:19,520
All you need to
do is call him.

54
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:22,236
Could I get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?

55
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:24,533
Sorry, kitchen's closed.

56
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:25,825
STONE: You're not going
to call him, are you?

57
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:28,612
Give Tony my best,
but I don't need you

58
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:30,581
or Tony's help,
for that matter.

59
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,242
You can call him or
join me in the Navy.

60
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,751
No.
Great. All right.

61
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:39,374
Happy birthday.
Blow out your candle and make a wish.

62
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:43,169
Do not waste
a wish on a girl.

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,338
Wish for a job,
an apartment.

64
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,006
A new alternator belt, so I don't
have to drive you everywhere.

65
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,425
A job, or...
You said "job" twice.

66
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:54,099
It's my birthday and my wish.

67
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,062
All right?

68
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,060
Please don't waste it.

69
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,360
You just wasted
that wish, didn't you?

70
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,480
I'm going in.
You're not going in.

71
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,855
How do I look?

72
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,778
Wait, let me
just fix that.

73
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,026
Awesome!

74
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,496
All right, princess,
go get 'em.

75
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,746
Great start.

76
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,745
Ugh.

77
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,135
What seems to
be the problem?

78
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,344
I want a chicken burrito.

79
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,553
Johnny, chicken burrito her.

80
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,431
BARTENDER: It ain't happening.
Chicken burrito her.

81
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,801
Kitchen's closed, Hopper.

82
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,141
What's your name?

83
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:36,766
I'm hungry.

84
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,144
That's not your name.

85
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,935
If you give me five minutes

86
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:46,189
I will get you
your chicken burrito.

87
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,317
Five minutes,
starting now.

88

Chicken burrito time, I'm out.

89
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,540
Chicken burrito,
roger that.

90
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,006
HOPPER: Wait! Hi!

91
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,003
No! Let's just...

92
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,133
Just one twist of the key
and we will be good.

93
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,501
How are you, ma'am?

94
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,803
How you doing?
Burritos, right there.

95
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,931
It's closed.
Too late, pal.

96
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:15,300
Okay.

97
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:16,674
It's right there. Please?

98
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:19,605
It's too late to eat a burrito.
Too many complex carbs.

99
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,065

How is it that you
screw everything up?

By the way, that girl you were
trying to impress last night,

do you know who
her father is?

118

He runs the whole damn fleet!

120
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:22,924
So, now you're messing
with my job. My life!

I've always stayed out of
your business, haven't I?

00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:32,018
Because I was hoping
that maybe one day

00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,438
you would learn
from your mistakes.

As from now,

as from right this second, there
is a new dynamic at play.

And this dynamic
is the following.

From here on, until I state otherwise,
there will be no more debate,

no more discussion,
no more compromise!

this is Hawaii News Now.

149
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,976
Thousands of sailors
on dozens of ships

150
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,686
are coming to
Hawaii for RIMPAC.

NEWSCASTER 3:
20, 000 Navy personnel.

155
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,318

amongst the countries is the goal.

as the scrappy U.S.A. team
is butting heads with Japan.

163

The score is 2-nil, Japan.

164
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,046
The U.S. has been
trailing all day.

165
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,223
Team leader Alex Hopper has got to do
something to rally the troops here.

166
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,424
Turn it up!

167

ANNOUNCER 1: Stone Hopper
has placed it perfectly.

183
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,014
It takes a fortuitous bounce.

184
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:21,644
Hopper is underneath it
and on-side.

ANNOUNCER 1: A penalty kick has
been awarded to the United States.

188
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:30,692
Nagata made contact with
Hopper inside the box.

189
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:33,488
ANNOUNCER 2: And by "contact, " you
mean Nagata kicked him in the face.

190

STONE: You all right?

191
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:35,908
Yeah, I'm fine.

has come up the field.

I don't need your help.

194

Bronson is going
to take it.

195
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:43,039
Bronson!

196
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,205
What do you mean, "Bronson"?
No, negative.

197
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,627
I'm fine.
Bronson, you're gonna take this.

198

Bronson, don't move.
Bronson, come here.

Bronson, you move one
more step, you're dead!

200

Do you want to die today?
Do you want to die?

201
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:55,801
Good choice.

202
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,469
He is definitely concussed.

203
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:00,143
You just threatened
one of my sailors.

be his little brother, Alex Hopper.

ANNOUNCER 2: If I was Stone, I
would have picked another shooter.

206
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:06,353
I'm skeptical that
Hopper is 100 percent.

207

Engage, engage.
Impose will, impose will.

208
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:12,407
There are two kinds
of idiots, Hopper.

209
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:14,401
One looks where he kicks,

210
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:17,114
the other looks
where he doesn't kick.

211
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,906
Which idiot are you?

212
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:23,866
I'm the idiot that's going to kick
it through your keeper's face.

Get ready for overtime.

214

ANNOUNCER 2:
All eyes on Hopper.

215
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,756
He could send this
into overtime.

(BLOWING WHISTLE) ANNOUNCER

221
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:56,902
Typical.

ANNOUNCER 1: It was a very poor attempt
by the obviously injured Alex Hopper.

225
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:13,422
He refused to
come out of the game

226
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:16,213
and his stubbornness
cost the United States.

Congratulations to Japan,

Japan, 2.
The United States, 1.

230

Are you ready for this?
Born.

231
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:44,527
Are you sure?

232
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:46,531
Never been more sure
of anything in my life.

What are you going to say?

I'm going to walk up
to him, man to man,

and look him
straight in the eyes.

236

like destroyers.

268

What's the difference between
a battleship and a destroyer?

269

Battleships are great ships.

But they are kind
of like dinosaurs.

They're designed to take hits,
like a floating punching bag.

272
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,833
But then there's destroyers,
which are just awesome.

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,930
They're designed to dish it
out like the Terminator.

No, he's not a Captain because
he's always late. Come on.

Hey, Mike.
Admiral.

317
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,300
You remember Sam?

318
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:29,182
It's an obsolete tradition,
this asking for permission.

319
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:30,851
Tell me where this came from.
Stop.

320
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,435
Sam's a physical
therapist now.

321
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:35,438
Stop worrying about this and walk
up and do what you got to do.

322
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,811
Hello, Hopper.

323
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:38,483
Why are you here?

324
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:42,652
This is going
to be sweet.

325
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,571
I was within the rules.
Really?

326
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,074
Were you in the rules when
you kicked me in the face?

327
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,288
Isn't there something more important
you should be doing right now?

328
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,619
He hates the man.

329
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,785
That seems a bit juvenile,
wouldn't you say?

330
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:53,580
Go mess with him
and see what happens.

331
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,000
Why?
CORA; Do if.

332
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:56,714
Would it be funny if I
punched you in the face?

333
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:57,998
Would that be funny?
Stop it.

334
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,833
Chicken.
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

335
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,802
Yeah, I love it.
A two-piece meal.

336
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,632
You look like Colonel
Sanders, actually.

337
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:05,838
He was a handsome man.

338
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,184
Good job out there, Dad.

339
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,634
What do you want?

340
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,603
Hopper needs five
minutes of your time.

342
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:14,686
That's enough.
What do you mean?

343
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:17,100
Don't you have something more important
you should be doing right now?

344
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:18,475
Three minutes, tops.

345
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:21,061
Thank you. I love you.
Thank you, Daddy.

346
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,735
Love you, too.

347
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:24,153
He's going to
smash my face in.

348
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,571
He's not going to
smash your face in.

349
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,659
Oh, my God.

350

Sir, it would be an honor.

351
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,385
Sir. Sir. Sir.

352
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,129
Give me your permission.

353
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:48,967
It would be an honor
to have your permission.

354
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,885
Sir, give me your permission.
What's your deal?

355
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,436
It would be a thankful honor

356
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:56,435
to have your permission
to honor your hand.

357

may I please
marry your daughter?

361
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:10,570
She's everything I have,

362
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,454
and I love her.

363
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,169
Talking to yourself,
Mr. Hopper?

364
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:22,039
Yeah, I was.

365
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,791
I was actually talking
about you, Nagata.

366
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:29,212

Sir, it was a fluke accident.
The bathroom floor was wet.

375
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:56,784
I began to fall.

reached out to help.

We fall back.
Bang, again.

379
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:07,208
Just like the great
Jerry Lewis.

380
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:08,333
Jerry Lewis?

381
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:09,880
Did he just say
"Jerry Lewis"?

Yes, sir.

The Bellboy and original

Very good movies.

He is a great
humanitarian, sir.

You both think this is a joke
and you are very much mistaken.

388
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:28,192
This will not happen again.
Do I make myself clear?

389
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:29,656
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

with Mr. Hopper, here.

What is wrong with you?

392
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:53,710
You've got skills, but I have never
ever seen a man waste them like you.

The fact that you know that
infuriates me beyond words.

What my daughter sees in you
is a great mystery to me.

398

You are a very
smart individual

399
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:27,121
with very weak character, leadership
and decision-making skills.

Do you have anything
to say to me? Anything?

to be your last.

Good afternoon, Sampson.

415
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,640
Welcome to Day One of
the RIMPAC naval war games.

416
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:07,802
We are here to sharpen
our skills as a team.

HOPPER: As your
weapons officer,

418
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:15,431
let me remind you
that this is a combat vessel

419
00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:19,985
and we will excel
in our command and control.

420
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:22,858
STONE: I want everyone
to stay frosty.

421
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,523
We're going to be close-maneuvering
with 13 nations out here.

422
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:28,870
We are here to
crush every other ship.

423
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:30,414
I'm excited to
see what we learn.

424
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,702
We are not here in this
weapons room to learn.

425

Be safe out there, look out for
each other and keep charging.

every other ship on that ocean,

428

Yo, Saunders, we've ended
up in a department

Trump/Mike Tyson mutant combo.

CORA: Nothing, sir.

433
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:58,187
I swear you said, "Donald Trump.
" Want to clarify?

434
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,643
I think I heard a "Mike
Tyson," as well.

435
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:04,144
If you did, it was only
in reference to the fact

436
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:07,573
that you both project
great physical intensity, sir.

437
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:09,233
That's flattering.

438

headed for the Sampson.

I don't know why!

Who do I call to
teach you humility?

I am sorry,
I don't have that number.

456

I just don't get it, man.

457

You have got so
much potential.

I'm sorry you have
to deal with this.

And I am sorry
I let you down.

I want you to focus
on that green marker,

462
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,371

feet together.

My feet can't
get any closer.

466
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,666
Stand up tall. All right.
I had enough of this.

467
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:34,383
Keep going.
Just a little bit more.

468

00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,980
Is there anything besides
anger in there, Mick?

475

Not much.

Your last therapist says that
you lost the will to fight.

477
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,331
Is that accurate?

478
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:09,867
I lost my fight
when I lost my legs.

Do you realize you're still the same
man that won the Golden Gloves at 22?

A Bronze Star in Afghanistan?
The same man.

481
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,057
I am half a man.

482
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:30,264
And half a man ain't
enough to be a soldier.

483
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,897
That's all I have ever known.

484
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:40,111
All right. Let's go.

485

We are going
to take a walk.

guy who doesn't want to be hiking.

489
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:52,999
My dog, Mustard,
could climb this mountain.

490
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:56,206
Great, you and Mustard can go and
make some memories on Mauna Kea.

491
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,756
Sounds like fun.

We are tracking something
splintering off of the main group.

That's not splitting off.
That thing is breaking apart.

542
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:22,991
Has anyone called the Chinese?
Because this is no meteor.

543
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:26,001
Yes, we have checked.
It's not the Russians, it's not the Chinese.

Maybe we should
call the Air Force,

to fuel up their jets.

objects landed in the Pacific Ocean.

00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,873
The fifth one appeared
to have broken apart

making significant
contact with Hong Kong,

558
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,545
but other places
were also affected.

So, what is it?

Sir, at this point we are working
on a couple of theories.

And you are who, sir?

in this room for?

at the very real possibility

566
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:25,362
that this is legitimate
extraterrestrial contact.

567
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,656
It appears that it originated
from the Gliese solar system.

impact with Hong Kong,

573
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,933
has also made impact
with the Pacific Ocean.

of where we are right now, sir.

I can't explain this.

Right now, our navy is effectively
trapped outside the area.

So we have nobody in there?

Sir, we have three guided missile
destroyers still unaccounted for.

So, it's conceivable
we do have somebody inside.
