TYRION: Fine, fine. I
suppose he can join us.

330
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:12,884
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

331
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,276
If I ever kill you, your
eyes will be wide open.

332
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:19,038
DAARIO: Forgive me,
but why would we bring you?

333
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:21,794
Pardon me?

334
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,796
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

335
00:33:24,073 --> 00:33:26,804
Not precisely, but I have other
skills that would be useful.

336
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:28,363
Can you fight?

337
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,284
I have fought.

338
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:31,957
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

339
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,239
Are you good on a horse?

340
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:35,554
Middling.

341
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:36,873
So mainly you talk.

342
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:40,114
And drink. I've survived so far.

343
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:44,039
Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.

344
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:47,202
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

345
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:51,475
None of us have experience
governing a city except for him.

346
00:33:51,553 --> 00:33:54,796
You want to prove your value to the queen?
Prove it right here in Meereen.

347
00:33:54,873 --> 00:33:57,479
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

348
00:33:57,553 --> 00:33:59,123
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

349
00:33:59,193 --> 00:34:00,683
They wouldn't.

350
00:34:01,193 --> 00:34:02,877
They will listen to Grey Worm.

351
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,603
I'll come with you.

352
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:06,602
I'll find our queen.

353
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,114
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

354
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:11,560
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

355
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:14,076
But you still can't go.

The people believe in you.

357
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:18,241
They know you speak for the queen.

358
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:20,079
It's true.

359
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,235
Only the Unsullied
can keep the peace in Meereen.

360
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:25,682
If you leave,
half this city will consume the other half.

361
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:27,204
And Missandei.

362
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,957
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

363
00:34:31,273 --> 00:34:32,843
Certainly not me.

364
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:35,683
The queen's closest confidante,

365

Try not to ruin her.

me, Jorah the Andal.

They tell me you've already found favor
with the Mother of Dragons.

379
00:35:50,993 --> 00:35:53,758
Well, she didn't execute me,

380
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,995
so that's a promising start.

381
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:59,444
Now the heroes are off to find her,

382
