1
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,485
Hey, ladies.

2
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,112
Are you looking for something?

3
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,491
We're just taking a ride.
Can't we pass?

4
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:16,327
No, sweetheart.
You have to go back.

5
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:28,339
Listen... do you want to hang out later
back in town?

6
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,800
- What?
- I said...

7
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,869
- Julio.
- Pacho, you motherfucker.

8
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,579
Motherfucking dog!

9
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,502
Let me go!

10
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,302
Let go of me!

11
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,721
- Let me go!
- Let's go.

12
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,181
Let go...!

13
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,892
You.

14
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,562
Mrs Salazar.

15
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,317
Do you know what makes me happy,
Pacho?

16
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,319
Makes me very happy?

17
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:17,740
That my sons didn't kill
your brother Alvaro.

18
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,744
Because he's going to live
the rest of his life

19
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,705
as half a man.
Half man, half...

20
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,858
Help!

21
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,237
Help!

22
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,928
<i>...the great event of the surrender
of Helmer Herrera,</i>

23
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,597
<i>to Colombian justice.</i>

24
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:34,269
<i>And this incident marked the end
of the Cali cartel</i>

25
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:38,357
<i>who were responsible,
according to international sources,</i>

26
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:44,279
<i>for more than 80%
of the cocaine trafficking in the world.</i>

27
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,534
<i>Throughout my campaign
and presidency,</i>

28
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:55,165
<i>I committed to dismantling
all narcotrafficking networks,</i>

29
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,334
<i>and we're doing it.</i>

30
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,668
Gilberto. How have you been?

31
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,589
Good, brother.
Grateful that we're all together.

32
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:47,176
The investment we made in our friends
can bear fruit.

33
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:51,889
And then all this will pass away like
some old joke you can't quite remember.

34
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,975
For this, gentlemen,
I propose a toast.

35
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,768
Of course you would.

36
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,479
Fucking Chepe.

37
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,065
Gilberto, I'd like to say a few words.

38
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,028
You all know
this wasn't what I wanted.

39
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:11,992
So it's very hard for me to admit
that I know this is for the best.

40
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,245
Thanks to you, we're on the verge of...
What do you call it?

41
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,372
"A great victory."

42
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,045
We believe in you.

43
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,007
To my brother, Gilberto.
Our leader.

44
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,426
Gentlemen of Cali... cheers!

45
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,090
Hello.

46
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,307
Go ahead, sir.

47
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,184
Director.

48
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,562
Don Miguel...
Please, go ahead.

49
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,159
- Hello.
<i>- It's me.</i>

50
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,371
- Where are we on Pallomari?
<i>- We put Navegante on it, Dad.</i>

51
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:06,750
I'll find him, don't worry about it.
And fucking Salcedo too, you'll see.

52
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,003
David, don't take your eyes off Henao.

53
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,883
That motherfucker might see this
as an opportunity. Keep a low profile.

54
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,512
Sure, don't worry.

55
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,266
- How's María?
<i>- I really don't know.</i>

56
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:27,145
<i>How come you don't know?
Make sure she's taken care of.</i>

57
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,398
It's very important
that you handle Pallomari.

58
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,025
That motherfucker
could ruin everything.

59
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,569
Call me when it's done.

60
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,089
- Guillermo?
- I need your help, Gonzalo.

61
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,633
You know I can't get involved.

62
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,428
Nothing's going to happen to you.
When has anything ever happened to you?

63
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,431
I'm asking you for legal advice,
and quickly.

64
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,436
I've decided that the best way
to get out of this situation

65
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,646
is to turn myself in
to the authorities.

66
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,732
Yes, normally that would be the case.

67
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:15,068
But the problem is, you already have
a warrant out for your arrest.

68
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,987
An arrest warrant?

69
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,198
The police won't protect you.
In fact, they'll probably kill you.

70
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,243
I'm the head accountant.

71
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,579
And every dollar in this organisation,
and every secret,

72
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,622
has been through this head.
It's all in here.

73
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,708
So tell whoever needs to know
that I'm willing to negotiate.

74
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,755
Guillermo, my advice to you
is to get your family and leave Cali.

75
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,799
My wife's very attached to her work.

76
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,970
- What? I don't understand.
- You know her, she's stubborn.

77
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,307
She built her business
from the ground up.

78
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,480
I can't leave without her.

79
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:57,360
Look, Guillermo... this is not
my legal advice, but as your friend.

80
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:02,199
Talk some sense into your wife.
Immediately.

81
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,497
Can you get me a gun?

82
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,630
We'll have to look out for ourselves
the rest of our lives, but if I help them,

83
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,090
maybe one day we can come
back to Colombia.

84
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,927
Are you insane? They almost killed us.

85
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,890
They almost killed us, and now you're
telling me you want to go back to Cali?

86
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,309
Do you really think
we can come back to Colombia?

87
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,855
The moment we come back to Colombia,
they'll kill our daughters.

88
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,609
Are you doing this to make up
for the last four years of your life?

89
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,282
I'm a good man.

90
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,915
I was a good man.

91
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,086
I'll leave with the girls tomorrow.
I'm not waiting for you.

92
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,017
Wait for me, OK? Thanks.

93
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,658
That way.

94
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,000
Keep looking for him.

95
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,168
No more fucking excuses.

96
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,005
OK.

97
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,888
Yeah?

98
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,141
Have you heard from your father?

99
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,644
Yes.

100
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,777
David, I've been wondering about
the arrangement I had for my son and...

101
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,112
Arrangement?

102
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,699
I thought it was true love.

103
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,786
Your father knows I care about him.

104
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,501
That's beautiful. Seriously.

105
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,921
But here's the thing...

106
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,215
You don't mean anything to me.

107
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,843
You're not my mother.

108
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,387
You're not my fucking problem.

109
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,556
- David...
- What?

110
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,934
What the fuck do I owe you?

111
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,693
Open your legs for someone else.

112
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,570
You're good at that.

113
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,407
OK?

114
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,271
Good afternoon, Mr Salcedo.

115
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,275
Mr Espinosa's still at lunch.
He should be back soon.

116
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,652
- We'll wait for him inside.
- OK, sir.

117
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,448
Another drink?

118
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,787
I need to go.
See you next week.

119
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,549
Excuse me.

120
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,051
How are the girls here?

121
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,011
The best of Cali.

122
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,138
Open it!

123
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,351
Get in.

124
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,020
Get in, motherfucker!

125
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,076
ACCESS RESTRICTED
PASSWORD REQUIRED

126
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,624
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

127
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,377
- I'm looking for Fredy Moya.
- Yes.

128
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,796
- The one wearing purple.
- Thanks.

129
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,055
Excuse me.
You work with Patricia Pallomari?

130
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,351
Javier Peña, DEA.

131
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,146
I'll call you back.

132
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,790
<i>- Hello.</i>
- It's me.

133
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,211
Baby, I can't talk right now.
Call me back later.

134
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,255
<i>No. Wait, I can't call you back. Wait.</i>

135
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,673
Yes.

136
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:21,095
Yes, I'd have to check my records
in the office.

137
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,640
I can't talk.

138
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,601
- Wait.
<i>- Patricia, the DEA was just here.</i>

139
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,854
The DEA. Asking questions.

140
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,357
<i>- What did you tell them?
- To go fuck themselves.</i>

141
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,067
<i>They want Guillermo, not you.</i>

142
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,152
<i>I can't talk now. We'll discuss it later.</i>

143
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,988
<i>Patricia, they talked about a reward.</i>

144
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,208
We need to take advantage.

145
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,962
I need to use the bathroom.

146
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,480
Work again?

147
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,773
Yes.

148
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,275
Excuse me.

149
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,609
Excuse me.

150
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,820
Open the window this time.

151
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,970
This way.

152
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,652
I'd offer a drink,

153
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,573
but I don't pour liquor for Cali whores.

154
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,579
Have a seat.

155
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,590
Don Orlando,
I'm here to ask for your protection.

156
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,801
Why?

157
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,554
You don't feel safe?

158
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,935
I did what I had to
after my husband died.

159
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,772
Now I'm in your home...

160
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,067
ready to do what I have to again.

161
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,783
So what is it you're offering me?

162
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,292
In here.

163
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,337
- How was the drive?
- It was easy.

164
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,006
Nice place.

165
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,938
Let me start by thanking you
for the meeting.

166
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,191
We're both busy men.
I won't waste your time.

167
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,528
But I'm a business man, like you.

168
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,326
The information you seek
may be in my possession.

169
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,748
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

170
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:36,999
You feel me?

171
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:43,506
On the phone, you told me
you know where Pallomari is.

172
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,967
Correct?

173
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,012
Look, let me put it this way...

174
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:53,975
Patricia and I are in love.

175
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,227
We want to be together.

176
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,400
So Guillermo's a problem for me.

177
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,321
From what I've heard,
he's a problem for you, too.

178
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,866
Am I right?

179
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,243
You are correct.

180
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,292
So maybe we can help each other.

181
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,087
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

182
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,019
- Let me fix you a drink. OK?
- Sure.

183
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,899
By the way...
are you guys running Windows 95 yet?

184
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,151
Think we're going to wait for next year.

185
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,905
Where the fuck is Pallomari, you faggot?

186
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,199
Did you hear me?

187
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,049
Here's the milk.
Just a few minutes and then you go to bed.

188
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:16,974
- Get in your room.
- Who is it?

189
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,935
I don't know.
Get in your room. Quickly.

190
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,904
- It's OK.
- They're the gringos.

191
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,697
- Calm down.
- Do you know them?

192
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,699
- They came to my office.
- Put the gun down.

193
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:34,825
Close the door.

194
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,163
Close the door.

195
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,869
No, Guillermo.
We can't leave for at least a week.

196
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,789
- You heard them.
- The company. I can't just leave.

197
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,624
- We must go.
- I need at least a week.

198
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,634
Put the radio on the dash...

199
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,970
and your hands on the wheel.

200
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,825
How are you, Jorge Salcedo?

201
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,469
I know about Fredy Moya.
It's none of my business.

202
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:44,223
- You're right. It's not your problem.
- You realise what happens if they find you?

203
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,351
And your kids?

204
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,233
I have to say goodbye to him.

205
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,069
We're in love.
I can't leave like that.

206
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:00,239
Mrs Pallomari, if you stay, you die.

207
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,700
Understood?

208
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,661
I'll be honest with you.

209
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,913
The truth is...

210
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,668
I was very disappointed to hear
you were the fucking rat.

211
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,923
But I still like you.

212
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,471
It's all good.
I'm not going to kill you.

213
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,934
David Rodríguez...

214
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,897
he wants to do it himself personally,
you know?

215
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,734
That's fine by me.

216
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,655
That way,
our friendship will remain intact.

217
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,128
- Let's go.
- Come on, dammit!

218
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,882
- The jacket...
- OK, that's it. Let's go.

219
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,498
Tell them to come out.

220
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,551
Tell them to come out, Jorge Salcedo.

221
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,956
Let's finish this.

222
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,796
Put the gun down.

223
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:24,967
I don't want to kill you.

224
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,848
We both know that's a lie.

225
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,148
The children!

226
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,840
Don't look, don't look!

227
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,967
Don't look, don't look!

228
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,095
Don't look!

229
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,806
What the fuck is he doing here?

230
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,519
- What the hell?
- Open!

231
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,022
Be careful!

232
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,649
We're in.

233
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,290
What happened?

234
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,627
They killed Navegante.

235
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,922
And Pallomari?

236
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,966
The motherfucker's gone.

237
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,218
You sure?

238
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,600
We're going to the airport.
We're going to catch those...

239
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,477
We're leaving, now!

240
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,020
Motherfuckers!

241
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,402
You, come with me.

242
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:11,699
We're going to the airport.
Take the guys. Now, now, now!

243
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,959
That's the North Valley, fuckers.

244
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,461
Who do they think they're messing with?

245
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,672
You just got smoked, bitches.

246
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,931
Boss!

247
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,684
Boss!

248
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,867
Let's go. Out.

249
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,374
Patricia, get out this way.
Careful, my love.

250
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,055
Do you see that?
We have a private plane.

251
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,390
We have a plane just for us.

252
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,917
Get on the plane. Go.
Everything is going to be fine.

253
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,336
Come on. Let's go.

254
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,801
Goodbye, Salcedo.

255
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,711
<i>And we have total agreement
in that these testimonies</i>

256
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:16,341
<i>that we have heard from Mr Pallomari
are ridiculous and grotesquely false.</i>

257
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,593
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

258
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:23,403
You know what it means
if you go on the record, right?

259
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,822
There'll be a price to pay.

260
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,452
Press the button.

261
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,250
Let's start with your name and occupation.

262
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:46,802
Javier Peña,
DEA attaché in Colombia.

263
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,417
<i>An exclusive interview
with this news channel.</i>

264
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,878
<i>He accuses the country
of being a Narco-Democracy.</i>

265
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,047
<i>He said the country has fallen
into the abyss.</i>

266
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,093
<i>His words have not been well received
by the Colombian people.</i>

267
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:31,680
<i>The public is demanding
an official response from...</i>

268
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:53,303
<i>Recordings that link the president
with narcotrafficking have been leaked.</i>

269
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,555
<i>The reality is that
they need five million.</i>

270
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,807
<i>- Uh-huh.
- We're missing three, see?</i>

271
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,809
<i>- We have it.
- Yes?</i>

272
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,311
<i>Yes, that's done.</i>

273
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,523
<i>This scandal threatens elected president
Ernesto Samper's career</i>

274
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:08,360
<i>if the authorities confirm his campaign
was funded by narcotrafficking money.</i>

275
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:12,239
<i>President Samper,
the only solution is your resignation!</i>

276
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,409
<i>Colombians can be certain...</i>

277
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:25,794
<i>that if they prove any money transfer
of any kind,</i>

278
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:31,007
<i>the deposit would've been made
behind my back.</i>

279
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:16,886
Don Chepe.

280
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,765
I was happy to get your call.

281
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,194
All right, fellas.
Let's move. Keep going.

282
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,781
Keep going.

283
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,541
Stubborn.

284
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:05,925
So...

285
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:09,596
do you have to fix the fence
every time a storm hits?

286
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,099
Someone has to do it.

287
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,351
That's how life works.
