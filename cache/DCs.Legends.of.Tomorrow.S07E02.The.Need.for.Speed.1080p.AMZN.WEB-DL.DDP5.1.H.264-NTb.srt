1
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,138
- Any chance of getting
this thing running again?

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,662
- The simplicity
of the thermosiphon cooling

3
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,229
is sheer elegance.

4
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,188
The capitalist dictate
of constant improvement

5
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,320
often pushes us past
the pinnacle of achievement

6
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,540
into inferior products.

7
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,368
- And this is your brain
off of drugs?

8
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,935
- Hey, don't weed-shame me.
I know stuff.

9
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,415
- Okay, so is that a yes?

10
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,851
Because soon enough,
someone's gonna see

11
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,331
that J. Edgar Hoover's missing

12
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,680
and the timeline's
gonna start changing.

13
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,030
- If I can find some water,
yes.

14
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,727
- Oh! Uh, Gary,

15
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,337
can you check the back seat
for some water please?

16
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,860
I think I saw something
under Hoover's coat.

17
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,341
-
Please don't mention his name.

18
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:39,691
This guy's giving me
terrible indigestion.

19
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,954
- That's probably
all the cigars. Ugh.

20
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,087
- Or all the bigotry.

21
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:46,655
- Oh!

22
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:50,702
Uh, we've got some soda.
Does that work?

23
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:53,879
- We'll find out.
- Oh, how about this?

24
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:56,056
A radio.

25
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,059
- Oh, we can pick up
some newscasts.

26
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,715
<i>The lovely and
lethal Bullet Blondes</i>

27
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,587
<i>remain at large,</i>

28
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,937
<i>last seen driving east
on the Bankhead Highway.</i>

29
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,591
<i>Caution advised.</i>

30
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,723
<i>They are considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

31
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,725
- Huh, I can't believe
the name stuck.

32
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,118
- Yeah, and they didn't
mention Hoover,

33
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:17,251
which means they think
he's still alive.

34
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:19,079
- Yeah. Well, he's not.

35
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,864
- Wha...

36
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:25,259
Hey. What's up?

37
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:27,261
We've gotten out
of tighter spots than this.

38
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:28,784
- Have we?

39
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,786
Mick's gone.
Astra's down for the count.

40
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,919
Zari is nursing a broken heart
in a pocket dimension,

41
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:36,574
and I killed J. Edgar Hoover.
- And it was an accident.

42
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,620
And it could have happened
to any man of steel.

43
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:40,012
- That's not funny.

44
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:42,014
I spent my whole life
studying history

45
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:43,973
and making sure
it's preserved and passed on.

46
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,496
By killing Hoover,

47
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,455
I personally messed up
the entire 20th century.

48
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:48,804
- Look,
we're gonna fix it, okay?

49
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,153
- Are we?

50
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,633
Because without Gideon
or the ship,

51
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,243
there's no way you can
guarantee that.

52
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,767
- Nate, you are spinning.
- I murdered a man, Sara.

53
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:58,422
And for the first time
in our lives,

54
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:01,121
we have to accept that
that could be permanent.

55
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,297
- Okay, look--
- Uh, wife? Nate?

56
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,776
We got a big problem.

57
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,169
Hoover was supposed
to be on a train

58
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,866
to New York from Midland
this afternoon.

59
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,347
- If he's not there,
the whole timeline's screwed.

60
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:12,610
- No, it won't be.

61
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,178
Nate, history needs saving,

62
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,267
and you are
just the man to do it.

63
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,487
So long as the world thinks
that Hoover is still alive,

64
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,532
then the timeline
remains on track.

65
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,621
- No, no, no.
I know what you're thinking.

66
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,145
No, there's no way
I can impersonate Hoover

67
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,798
all the way to New York.

68
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,583
I could barely do it
in some Podunk Texas town.

69
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,977
- Gary!
- Huh?

70
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,372
- Can you do some kind of spell
and make him look like Hoover?

71
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,809
- Uh,

72
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,638
technically, yes.
But, um...

73
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,989
I'd need some of
Hoover's spit or fingernails...

74
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,084
- Or hair.

75
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,871
- We're mobile, people.

76
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:57,394
- Well, good.

77
00:02:57,438 --> 00:03:01,311
Because J. Edgar Hoover has
a train to catch.

78
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:11,365
<i>♪</i>

79
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,251
- I did a spell
to resurrect a machine.

80
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:29,861
I don't know what this is.

81
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,734
- I'd recognize that smug
little smile anywhere.

82
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:34,518
It is Gideon.

83
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,346
- She doesn't look
like a machine.

84
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,044
- Well, not a machine
exactly, Mami.

85
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:42,352
A computer who speaks.

86
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,788
Usually.

87
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,269
- Hello, computer.

88
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,229
- Well, on the upside,

89
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,969
looks like you got
your magic working again.

90
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,929
- My magic is clearly garbage.

91
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,278
Stop that.

92
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:57,976
- She's still Gideon
though, right?

93
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,108
What's two plus two?

94
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:04,069
There you go.

95
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,467
Wow, computers are--are
very exciting.

96
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,731
- Uh--sorry.

97
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,566
- Is it ready?
- Not yet.

98
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,568
It needs to fully ferment.
This is just the primary stage.

99
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,178
- Okay, well,
we need to come up

100
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:27,571
with some kind of distraction
or something,

101
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,659
because that train leaves
in five minutes,

102
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,270
and Hoover needs to be on it.

103
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:33,098
- And to the public eye,
he will be.

104
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:34,970
Look, because they're not
gonna be looking at him.

105
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:36,624
No. They--
- What are you doing?

106
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,278
- Are going to be looking

107
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,411
at the most wanted women
in America.

108
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,283
- What?

109
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,285
- Oh, I'm not sure about this.

110
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,157
- Just follow my lead. Come on.

111
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,333
- My safe word
is core competency.

112
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:54,946
- Coming through here.

113
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,644
Look out,
we got the Bullet Blondes.

114
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,123
- This isn't the last
you're gonna hear

115
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,603
of the Bullet Blondes.

116
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,039
- That's right, coppers.

117
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,432
- Who you calling the cops?

118
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,825
We're the Bureau
of Investigation.

119
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,522
- That's right,

120
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,132
and J. Edgar Hoover
always gets his man. Or woman.

121
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,831
Or gender non-conforming
individual.

122
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:13,138
- I need four extra tickets
for my associates.

123
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,793
- Are those the Bullet Blondes?

124
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,795
- Well, we're not a pair
of canceled stamps.

125
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,623
- Pleasure.

126
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,017
- Mr. Hoover, let me find some
seats for you and your men.

127
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:30,504
Our most secure cabin
is the honeymoon suite.

128
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:38,468
In the name of J. Edgar Hoover,
I'm commandeering this cabin.

129
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,644
- Oh, no.
No need to commandeer.

130
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,342
We don't want to spoil
your honeymoon.

131
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,344
- Spoil? Phonus balonus.

132
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,997
- Well, after them
Palmer raids,

133
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,391
we'd be proud to help out
a patriot like Mr. Hoover.

134
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,355
- Squeeze on by here.
- Congratulations.

135
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,357
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, best wishes.

136
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:04,059
- Whew. That was close.

137
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,235
- Can you please
take these off now?

138
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,369
- What are the Palmer raids?

139
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,718
- After World War I,

140
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,373
America was freaking out
about Communism,

141
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,377
so Hoover and the DOJ arrested
thousands of immigrants,

142
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,249
union workers, anything that
smelled like organized labor.

143
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,382
- Real champion
of civil liberties.

144
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,296
- Oh, he pretty much codified
racial bias

145
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,863
into our judicial system.

146
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:29,127
Okay, look, morally,
he's repulsive.

147
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,521
Historically, however,

148
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,045
he's one of the most important
men of the 20th century.

149
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,700
He founded the FBI.
He ran it till he died.

150
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:39,747
- Yeah, well, great men
aren't usually good guys, so.

151
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,055
And that is our cue
to disappear.

152
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,449
Oh, B, key me.

153
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,103
- The key.

154
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:51,193
Time Bureau manual
and some honeymoon chocolates.

155
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:53,761
Say hi to Z for me.

156
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,903
- Capi-tans, hey.

157
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:09,167
Are we home yet?
How did your bank robbery go?

158
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,561
Did we find out who blew up
the Waverider yet or no?

159
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,955
Am I talking too much?
Am I talking not too much?

160
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,174
- I think she's a little high.
- I'd say very.

161

162

anybody really going?

I thought you didn't partake.

I know, but you see
I found myself on a journey.

168

And that journey is
with these tiny, little bears.

And I'm going on that journey
a la carte.

A la carte.
"Allah" carte.

Well, we'll be upstairs.

172

please don't hesitate
to come and find us.

Actually, hesitate a little.

Only his closest friends
call him that.

Junior, of course.

How long does the spell last?

187
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,033
- Uh, it depends
upon your metabolism.

188

Could be an hour. Could be 24.

my mess, B.

Don't drink it in front of us.

anything to drink?

319
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,251
- She doesn't need
anything to drink.

320
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,166
She's not a person.

321
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,779
- I may not know
what a computer is,

322
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:57,434
but I know a heartbeat.

323
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,132
And you made that, Astra.

324
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:04,528
You are not only
a very powerful witch.

325
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:06,791
You're also a mother now.

326
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:09,969
- I am nobody's mother.
- Dang.

327
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,623
Now, what will the team do
with a human Gideon?

328
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,712
- Probably just give her
Rory's old room.

329
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,976
There's always space
for one more with the Legends.

330
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,021
- And where are
your Legends now, anyway?

331
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,371
- They went to New York,
to meet this time travel guy.

332
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,765
Once they find him,
they're gonna come get us.

333
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,377
- Okay. I'm no expert,
but seems to me,

334
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:31,120
if you have a machine
that can travel through time,

335
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,643
wouldn't you just
go back to right

336
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:36,343
after the moment you left?
I mean, unless...

337
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,171
- It didn't work.

338
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:47,658
- What was the word from HQ?
- Not a lot of detail.

339
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,270
The Dallas field office
intercepted a telegram.

340
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,492
- "Hoover on tren, northbond."

341
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:57,233
"Train" and "northbound"
are both misspelled.

342
00:16:57,277 --> 00:17:00,367
- So he's a foreigner.
- Or a bad speller.

343
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,587
- Men in Little Rock
are gonna alert D.C.

344
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:04,936
Plan to have agents at
every station along the route.

345
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,503
- Good.

346
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,766
- Mr. Hoover says
we're looking for a foreigner.

347
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,551
- I didn't say that.
- Stay put in here, Mr. Hoover.

348
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,031
We'll turn this train
upside-down,

349
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,250
till we find our man.

350
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:16,557
- Hoover doesn't run
an investigation from behind.

351
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,602
All right.

352
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,169
All we got to go on
is this telegram,

353
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,432
which doesn't give us
a motive or a means.

354
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:26,262
But its timing does narrow down
the list of possible suspects.

355
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,742
- Donovan, Rodgers.

356
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,396
Get me a list
of all the passengers

357
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:32,094
that got on this train
since Midland. Go.

358
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,530
On it, sir.

359
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:34,705
- The three of us
are gonna start

360
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,098
at the front
of the train,

361
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,273
and we're gonna
work our way back.

362
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,535
We're looking for anyone

363
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,450
who has a reason
to hurt Hoover.

364
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,238
- Who would possibly want
to hurt that guy?

365
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,850
- "Please" would have been
nice.

366
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,376
- Is there anyone on this train

367
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,075
you may suspect of having
anti-government sentiment?

368
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,815
- Anti-government?

369
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,730
The government is the only
thing keeping this country

370
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,384
from going to the dogs.

371
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:04,518
- Have you heard anyone talk
about anarchy or...

372
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:07,869
socialism?

373
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,437
- Well, that depends.

374
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,744
Would you call
a working wage socialism?

375
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:16,617
Then yeah. I'd say
we're all talking about it.

376
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,664
- Lovely to see America
by train car.

377
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:24,146
- Be a lot lovelier
if I wasn't being spied on

378
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,148
by a bunch of dicks.

379
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,933
- By "dick" do you mean cop?
- Hmm.

380
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,283
- Well, you think someone

381
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,589
on this train
is a ne'er-do-well?

382
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,591
Well,
good luck pulling one over

383
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,637
on America's finest law man.

384
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,682
- That's very nice of you.

385
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:43,122
- Hoover?
That man is cursed.

386
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,863
- You have no idea.

387
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,343
- Hoover?

388
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,128
Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

389
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,305
- Ugh, tell me about it.

390
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,178
- Everybody on this train
loves Hoover.

391
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,137
- Yeah, everybody
with first-class tickets.

392
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,183
The people we talked to would
be happy to kill "Hoover."

393
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:04,012
- If we're looking for motive,
we got it.

394
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,622
Lots of it.

395
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,450
- Yeah, which is as good
as finding none at all.

396
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,148
We're switching
this investigation away

397
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,716
from the "why"
and onto the "how."

398
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,502
And with agents in every city,
it'll be pretty hard

399
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,460
pulling off a kidnapping
in any of the stations.

400
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,809
They'd get caught immediately.

401
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,681
- Or congratulated.

402
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,467
- But if you could get
the train off the main route--

403
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,034
- No one would be
guarding the track.

404
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:28,210
- And if you can redirect
the train,

405
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,211
you have control of the train.

406
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,213
- Ooh! Ooh! Inside job.

407
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,997
- Inside job.
- Inside job.

408
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,349
- Director Hoover,
meet Igor Lewandowski.

409
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:37,741
Train's engineer.

410
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,482
- A Russian
and a labor organizer.

411
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,875
- He wasn't scheduled
to work today,

412
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,311
but had a change of heart.

413
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:43,921
Joined the crew
back in Midland.

414
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,314
Awfully convenient.

415
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,707
- Did he confess?
- He won't say diddly,

416
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,491
but he's our guy.
I'm sure of it.

417
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,014
Trust you can get the...

418
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,756
confession we need.
Do your worst, boss.

419
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,585
- Yeah.

Very sad
party of one happening here.

423

Doesn't matter.

424

Zen in ten, here I come.
Starting with the fridge.

425
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,260
See, even I know you don't keep
whiskey in the fridge.

Aves.
- Hi, Z.

428
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,369
- How many bottles of whiskey
are there on the table?

429
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,415
- Um, two.

430
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,243
- Two!

431
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,114
The fridge is making whiskey.

432
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,072
- What? That's fantastic.

433
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:50,901
- The Waverider.
- Yeah?

434
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:53,774
I guess it's kind of
like the Waverider.

435
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,950
Although the fridge doesn't
take requests like Gideon.

436
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,953
- No, no, no, this bottle--
this bottle is the Waverider.

437
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:02,565
And this bottle is the mystery
Waverider that blew us up.

438
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:08,267
So if there's two Waveriders,
who's to say there isn't...

439
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,141
third Waverider?

440
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:17,798
And a fourth.
It will never end.

441
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,975
- Oh, I get it.

442
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:22,933
You're still really stoned.

443
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,935
- So--so, let's say we go back
and stop the mystery Waverider

444
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,415
from blowing us up.
That's great.

445
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,199
But that Waverider came
from somewhere.

446
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:29,592
Which means if one showed up,
then another one could.

447
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:31,115
And another,
and another, and another.

448
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,335
- Okay. Wait. Let's just
slow this train down.

449
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,120
Take this. Remember this?
Here. Grab this. Hi, hi, hi.

450
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:39,036
Look, squirt. Squirt, squirt.
Squirt and wipe!

451
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,212
Squirt and wipe, and the
gummies are gonna wear off,

452
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:42,692
and then you're gonna be

453
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,433
feeling the natural
high of a job well done.

454

Look. Show me. Show me.
I'm watching.

00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,002
- Aves, I--
- Squirt and wipe.

456
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,791
- You got this. You got this.
You can be mean.

457
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,619
You can be mean as hell.

458
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,496

- Uh, "sir," quick word?

461
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,241
How are you gonna
swing this, Nate?

462
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,331
- I don't know. I don't want
to hurt the guy, but...

463
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,810
- No way, man.

464
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,638
- Look, those two agents
are expecting Hoover.

465
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,205
- They have all the evidence
they need.

466
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,338
That's more than enough.

467
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,817
- It's not enough.
I need a confession.

468
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,384
- Look, Nate,
I know you feel like this is

469
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,081
the end of the world,

470
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,388
but you're just a good guy
who made a bad mistake.

471
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,259
What was the alternative?
Let him kill you?

472
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,044
You're worth
a thousand Hoovers.

473
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,699
- By comparison to Hoover,
I am nobody in the timeline.

00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,023
- Two weeks.

788
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,503
Maybe that explains
why they're not back yet.

789
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,244
- But we have to get
to Dr. Davies first,

790
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:06,507
or the Legends will die.

791
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,161
- Or maybe that's why.

792
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,382
- Pack up that ranch wear.

793
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,734
We've got some Legends to save.

794
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,846
- Greg, move your head.
