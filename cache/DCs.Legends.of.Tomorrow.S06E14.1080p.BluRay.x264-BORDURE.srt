1
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,183
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,353
John, what happened in there?
There's a glass and blood in...

3
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,352
Are you okay?

4
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:20,688
Oh, I'm never better, love.

5
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:23,858
I'm finally feeling
like my old self again, you know?

6
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,070
What is up with you?

7
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,406
Aw. Were you looking forward
to playing the nursie maid?

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,909
I'm really sorry to disappoint ya.

9
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:36,663
Where the hell is Bishop?

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
I'm sorry, what now?

11
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,249
Bishop stole Rory's comms.

12
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,334
Because he knew
John was ripe for the picking.

13
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:45,046
So he smooth-talked your boyfriend
into springing him.

14
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,464
Isn't that right, weasel?

15
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,883
Oh, don't you worry your
pretty little heads about Bishop.

16
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,760
Everything's in hand.

17
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:54,639
Uh, John, things feel decidedly
not in hand right now.

18
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:55,974
Do you know where Bishop is?

19
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:59,435
Just... tell us what happened.
We can help you.

20
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:02,355
How many times do I have to tell you
I don't want your help?

21
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,109
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

22
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:10,196
You said you wanted to start a new life,
sans evil magical potion.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,657
Do you remember
that conversation we had?

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,117
Oh, yeah, I remember, you see,

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,078
but I had a really good
chin wag with Bishop

26
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,289
and then I finally saw the way forward.

27
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,041
John, you have no idea
how manipulative Bishop is, all right?

28
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,711
Please, just tell us where he is
before it's too late.

29
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,522
He's promised to help me
unlock the Fountain.

30
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:28,631
And that is a promise
that I intend to make him keep.

31
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:30,609
So you're just gonna
turn your back on all of us?

32
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,803
Oh, let's be honest, I was never
one of you lot really, was I?

33
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:35,597
A Legend.

34
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:40,768
Nah, I'm a nasty piece of work,
and I walk my path alone.

35
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,522
John, this isn't like you.

36
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,985
Deep down, I know
you truly care about this team.

37
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,404
Oh, come on.
Grow a pair, will you, Gary?

38
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:55,408
I'm not that pathetic little bastard
that you used to know.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,830
Yeah, you keep saying that
over and over again in different ways.

40
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,790
He's stalling.

41
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,629
A ghost!

42
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,840
Astral projection. He's not here.

43
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,967
If he's not here, then...

44
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,515
The Legends are onto our ruse.
We need to leave now.

45
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,017
Almost there.

46
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,394
If you reroute
my directory protocols

47
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,813
you'll short-circuit
all communications and navigations...

48
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,153
Okay, that's weird.

49
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,030
Yeah, what the hell's going on?

50
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,528
Well, that ain't
England out there.

51
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,554
Gideon, who's flying the ship?

52
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,102
Sara? Ava? Anyone?

53
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,229
Comms are down.

54
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,648
All right, let's talk
about the ruddy plan.

55
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,484
Well, I'm more of a
fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of guy.

56
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,236
That's John and Bishop.

57
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,448
No, no, no. If it's us against
John's dark magic, we're gonna lose.

58
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,532
Yeah, but...

59
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,746
All right, lay it on me.
What's next, J-Co?

60
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,499
You're gonna help me
find another place and time

61
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,377
where the Fountain of Imperium
exists in history.

62
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,839
Ooh! I've always been intrigued
by the legend of the Fountain.

63
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:37,802
Supposedly an enormous source of power,
gifted by a benevolent alien being.

64
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:42,849
I encountered the Fountain once,
before it deemed me... unworthy.

65
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,476
But then, if anyone can unlock

66
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,812
an ancient alien artifact,
that's you, isn't it?

67
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:48,813
Well...

68
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:51,524
I mean, it is the only reason
I set you free.

69
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:55,820
Oh, and here I thought
you just wanted some company.

70
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:04,328
I want my magic back
without having to rely on pesky drugs.

71
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,206
Now, are you up to the task?

72
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,208
Or not?

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,128
Easy with the fire hands, Johnny.

74
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,262
I've spent a lifetime hacking
and editing alien genetics.

75
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:25,266
Believe me, I am just
the super genius you need.

76
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,144
Good, let's get on with it then,
shall we?

77
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,410
Abracadabra, JC!

78
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,580
You've unveiled

79
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,208
sub layers of alien text
hidden within the map itself.

80
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,876
Nice.

81
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,754
Lucky you, I'm versed
in dozens of alien languages.

82
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,089
Just read the bloody thing, will you?

83
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,966
- Now that's interesting.
- What?

84
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,719
This symbol here...

85
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,597
it might just give us
the location of the Fountain.

86
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:09,602
You see,
you are up to the task, sunshine.

87
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,064
- Let's chart a course.
- Mmm.

88
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,787
Okay. Those two working together
to find the Fountain is bad news.

89
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,097
We have to go and get the others.

90
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,583
How? I can't drive this ship
without Gideon. Can you?

91
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,148
I don't even have a driver's license.

92
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,129
Then I guess it's up to us to stop them.

93
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,934
Where the hell are we?

94
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,605
- 1925?
- And we're in Texas.

95
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,857
No wonder it seemed familiar.

96
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,942
Definitely explains
the "yippie-ki-yay" vibe.

97
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:07,660
Someone help, please!
Henry will lose his leg.

98
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,584
- Anyone?
- Well, I can help.

99
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,586
What? Aliens?

100
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,754
No, something else.

101
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,550
Let me through. I can help. I can help.

102
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,468
There's something familiar about her.

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
What is it?

104
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,393
Okay, okay.

105
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,854
I can't explain it.

106
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,565
I think that's my mom.

107
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,657
The drilling line snapped.

108
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,618
I tried to move fast, but...

109
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,661
Just try and hold your leg still, okay?

110
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,890
I'm gonna take care of you.
I have something that will help.

111
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,040
You're gonna be okay.

112
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,434
It's gonna get worse if you keep moving.

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,467
Oh, my Lord.
It feels better already.

114
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,012
Get out of my way. Get!

115
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,390
You look good to go, Henry.

116
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,351
Back on the rig now.

117
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,562
- He needs to rest, Doc.
- After his shift.

118
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,107
Need that derrick up and running
by the end of the month. Let's go!

119
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,907
Let me pay you for your services.

120
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,408
No, I don't need compensation.

121
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,369
Sure you do, sweetheart.

122
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,455
Would me buying your land cover it?

123
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,083
You know my answer.

124
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,920
If I don't buy your land,
someone else will.

125
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,172
And they may not offer as much as me.

126
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,299
Or be as polite.

127
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,553
I have already told you,
my land is not for sale.

128
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,848
Maybe you ought to reconsider.

129
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,605
She said no.

130
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,693
So, why don't you get going, sweetheart?

131
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,825
I'll see you ladies around.

132
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:17,039
Thank you for your help.
That man is a menace.

133
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,917
Happy to. Dealt with plenty of men
like him in my lifetime.

134
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,502
I'm Gloria.

135
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,173
Have we met?

136
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,426
- We're just passing through.
- Oh.

137
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,554
Let me thank you with a hot meal.

138
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,723
Wouldn't be a proper
Odessa welcome otherwise.

139
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,223
Hmm? Come.

140
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,228
Where are you going?
We have to find John and Bishop.

141
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,773
Nah, I can't.
That woman, she's my mom.

142
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,109
We're in Odessa, Astra.
My hometown.

143
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,503
I thought your mom
was abducted by aliens

144
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,444
when you were a kid.

145
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,739
- How could that possibly be her?
- I don't know. Maybe...

146
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,118
Maybe they wiped our memories
and they sent her back in time.

147
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,038
That would explain
why I could never find her.

148
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,622
But hey, hey. Hey.

149
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,876
I know you feel like you gave up
on finding her too easily,

150
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,170
but I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

151
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,381
If there was a chance
that this was your mom,

152
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,905
wouldn't you wanna talk to her, too?

153
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,600
Fine. But maybe she knows something
about the Fountain

154
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,226
that can help us find John and Bishop.

155
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,519
Are you coming?

156
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,153
The Fountain's near.

157
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,244
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

158
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,454
Bollocks!

159
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,665
Looks like it's already dried up,

160
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,085
and that's because you got us
here too late, didn't you?

161
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,046
Or we've arrived in the nick of time.

162
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,757
Look at these beautiful mushrooms.

163
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,634
What about the bloody mushrooms?

164
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,877
Right, right, right.
Okay, uh, you don't know this yet.

165
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,138
Earthlings eventually discover
that mushrooms

166
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,516
are actually an ancient alien species.

167
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,477
So you're telling me I've had aliens
in my mushroom masala this whole time?

168
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,605
Think about how weird mushrooms are.

169
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,288
There's nothing else like them on Earth.

170
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,401
And the caps on the ground,
just the tip of the iceberg.

171
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,779
Most of the organism is underground.

172
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,323
What if...

173
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,406
Go with me on this.

174
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:21,038
What if these mushrooms
are connected to the Fountain?

175
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,291
That could mean the Fountain is,
in fact, itself,

176
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,377
an actual alien being.

177
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,312
All of the Fountain's mythology
is connected to caves and grottos.

178
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,901
I thought I was looking
for a body of water,

179
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,094
but perhaps,
just like their alien cousins,

180
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,847
the Fountain can arise from the ground.

181
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,850
Finally, someone who can keep up.

182
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,021
If you can summon the Fountain,
I can make sure it chooses you.

183
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,234
I just need to take some samples
back to the ship and <i>voilà,</i>

184
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,403
we'll be synthesizing
with the Fountain in no time.

185
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,785
All right, let's get on
with it then, shall we?

186
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:15,885
Please, sit down.

187
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:17,803
I will get us some tea.

188
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,691
Have you been here a while?

189
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,694
Since I was about your age.

190
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:36,739
I built this house myself.

191
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:39,992
And this Doc guy,
why is he so interested in your land?

192
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,578
He says there's a fountain of oil
underneath it.

193
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,206
My house is the last parcel of land
he hasn't scooped up yet.

194
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,585
Speaking of fountains,
do you know if there's one nearby?

195
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,088
No. I'm sorry, dear, no.

196
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,424
Where were you from originally?

197
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,052
Los Arenales in El Salvador.

198
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,679
That's my mother.

199
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,765
She was a healer, too.

200
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,934
Taught me everything I know.

201
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,603
I never thought I would leave...

202
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:13,525
but my husband Celso, he died suddenly,
and it was too painful for me to stay.

203
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,779
So I came here to make a fresh start...

204
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,114
with my daughter.

205
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,701
Your... Your daughter?

206
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,462
Hello, there.

207
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,174
I'm warning you.
Mama taught me how to fight.

208
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,718
Ah. Did she now?

209
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,762
Your mama's somewhere nearby, is she?

210
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,472
We live just over that way.

211
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,748
I was just looking at those mushrooms
you're gathering there.

212
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,978
Why? Are you a healer?

213
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,563
You could say that, yeah.

214
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:54,275
My mom's a healer.
That's why I'm gathering these for her.

215
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,486
She's expecting me. I better go.

216
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,738
Can I show you a trick?

217
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:10,791
Wow!

218
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,297
- You're magic!
- Yeah, I am.

219
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,507
Now tell me.

220
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:22,177
Have you noticed anything else
growing in this forest,

221
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,638
even more magical than those mushrooms?

222
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,767
You're sure about that?

223
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:32,438
Damn it!

224
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,358
Here. This is for you.

225
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:41,946
Are you okay?

226
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,158
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

227
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,787
What's your name?

228
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,166
Esperanza Cruz.

229
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,637
Look, your mom doesn't know
anything about the Fountain.

230
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,473
Spooner, we have to go.

231
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,057
I can't leave yet.

232
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,684
If Gloria has a daughter,

233
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,687
that's gonna mean that
aliens abducted me from here,

234
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:16,148
wiped my memory
and sent me to the future.

235
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:22,654
Look, if I'm right, then any second now
kid me is gonna walk through that door.

236
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,949
Okay, well, maybe it's best
if kid you doesn't see you-you

237
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,160
for, I don't know, timeline reasons.

238
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,790
Mama.

239
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:42,108
Mama, I met this man
who says he can heal people,

240
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,132
just like you can.

241
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,552
Good afternoon, ma'am.

242
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,389
Another healer? What a coincidence!

243
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,850
What a coincidence indeed!

244
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,529
Don't worry. We'll get John back.

245
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,990
It'd be a lot easier if we had
a Time Courier. Why do we even bother

246
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,301
- taking those things off?
- Don't even...

247
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,536
My eggs are gonna hatch without me.
We need a plan.

248
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,375
Actually, we do know somebody with
a Timeship that could help us. Gary?

249
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,628
- Me?
- No, not you, dummy.

250
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,338
Kayla. I need you to contact her.

251
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,009
No, no, no, no. That's a terrible idea.

252
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,971
Are we taking a vote on this?
I vote nay.

253
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,722
Hey, Gary, listen to me.

254
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,755
We need to stop John from doing

255
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,144
something more colossally stupid
than he already has.

256
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,061
Go!

257
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,609
Okay. If we really want to
get Kayla's attention,

258
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,153
this is how we do it.

259
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,030
- What the hell is that?
- It's called an IGCOM.

260
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,030
A what?

261
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,867
It's intergalactic communication device.

262
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,703
So... Sorry,
you're just gonna call Kayla?

263
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,956
Are you kidding?
She would never answer my call.

264
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,709
No. But there's something else
we can do with it.

265
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:04,339
Okay, Mick, let's try to make
this a little more dynamic.

266
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,050
Move your body a little to the right.
Other right. Yeah.

267
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,385
Okay, just chin down.

268
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,219
Too much.

269
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,098
- Fake eggs coming in hot.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

270
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,602
This is worse
than giving birth.

271
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,645
Just sit still, okay?

272
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,814
Are you sure
this is gonna work, 'cause...

273
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,900
Oh, 100 percent.

274
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,403
Kayla likes to pretend she's never
on Galixipost, but she totally is,

275
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,906
and once we tag her,
she's gonna lose it.

276
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,072
Okay, thank you, Gary.

277
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,327
Okay, Mick, I think
the only thing left to do is, um, smile.

278
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:34,994
Be happy...

279
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,414
Okay, center him in the photo.

280
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,707
- There we go.
- Okay.

281
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,335
And... picture!

282
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,630
Tag Kayla...

283
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,510
and... post.

284
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,181
And now we wait.

285
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,933
Wait? For how long?

286
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,351
Eh...

287
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,829
You know, sometimes reception on Earth
can be a little spotty.

288
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,853
Oh, God!

289
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,983
Oh, my goodness, how rude of me.
I never got your names.

290
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,068
I'm Astra.

291
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,279
Esperanza. But I go by Spooner.

292
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,823
Esperanza? That's my name, too.

293
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,825
Yes, and a beautiful one at that.

294
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,705
Tell me, what were you
looking for in the forest?

295
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,832
John. Oh, I was just foraging
for some medicinal herbs.

296
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,794
You sure you weren't looking for
something more poisonous?

297
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,549
<i>"War of the Worlds"?</i>

298
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,968
Mama and I read it together every night.

299
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,886
That's a pretty scary book.

300
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,888
Space creatures aren't scary.

301
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,101
I want her to stay curious
and keep her adventurous spirit alive.

302
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,144
And I want to travel to other worlds.

303
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,064
I have a feeling you will.

304
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:49,152
Okay, come help me in the kitchen and
tell me all about the plants you found.

305
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,214
This is honey locust.
The pods help with...

306
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,532
You seem... different.

307
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,076
What? You mean not
overburdened by guilt and remorse?

308
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,495
Why'd you show up here with kid me?

309
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,082
I found her
while I was looking for the Fountain.

310
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,268
And do you know what?
It's a good thing that I did.

311
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,169
Because our chance encounter
gave me a wee glimpse

312
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,838
into your past and her future.

313
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,215
- Don't trust a word out of his mouth.
- I don't.

314
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:11,882
Is everything all right?

315
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,095
- Everything's fine.
- You know, this can't wait.

316
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,057
Like hell it can't...

317
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,852
- What did you do?
- Never mind them. Come with me.

318
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,358
Boys!

319
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,988
Esperanza! Run! Run, <i>mi amor!</i>

320
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,787
Mama!

321
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,726
- Those men, they...
- They kill your mum tonight.

322
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,354
But you get saved
by the Fountain of Imperium.

323
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,481
You see, it's not just
a source of raw power.

324
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,400
It's an alien being that whisked you off
to keep you safe.

325
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,069
It protected you, Spooner.

326
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,447
My whole life, I thought those aliens
took my mom away. But really...

327
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,160
- It was those oil men.
- You have a choice.

328
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,580
You can let history play out
as it did before.

329
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,376
Or you can save your mother
and your younger self from those men.

330
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:32,130
Esperanza never has to leave here.
She can have a normal life.

331
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,718
So what do you want from me?

332
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,938
My goodness. I don't know...
I don't know what came over me.

333
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,774
Where did our guest go?

334
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,653
He sends his apologies.
He has some business to attend to.

335
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,736
Outside!

336
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,848
What the hell did John do in there?

337
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,828
He showed me the truth about my past.

338
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,497
The oil men come back
and kill Gloria for her land

339
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,375
while kid me escapes and is saved
by the Fountain of Imperium.

340
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,297
So I'm staying here and protecting them
both to make sure that never happens.

341
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,177
Look, whenever John is involved,
things tend to go south.

342
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,223
This is my only chance to make sure
my younger self has a life with my mom.

343
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,184
I can finally get her back.
That's all I've ever wanted.

344
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,355
I thought you of all people
would understand that.

345
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,650
Of course I understand that, Spooner.
But...

346
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,676
But you just gave your blood
to John to open the Fountain,

347
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,286
which is the one thing
we're trying to stop.

348
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:49,332
You can go after him if you want,
but I'm staying here.

349
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,966
Are you sure it actually posted?

350
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,260
Well, maybe we need
to check the Wi-Fi...

351
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,891
She's here.

352
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,105
Kayla.

353
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:22,032
- What do you mean they're fake?
- We will explain.

354
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,241
Look, chill.

355
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,537
We're sorry about the way
we had to contact you,

356
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,872
but Bishop stole our ship

357
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,195
and you are the only person
that can help us get it back.

358
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,709
And why would I help you guys?

359
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,836
Because the eggs on that ship are real.

360
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,260
And how did you survive?

361
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,845
Miracle of childbirth.

362
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,681
Bishop acted as midwife
and saved Rory's life.

363
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,660
Those eggs are going to hatch soon.
I have to go and protect them.

364
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:53,813
Wait.

365
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:58,860
Ever since that night on the planet,
I've never stopped thinking about you.

366
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,074
The eggs might be fake,
but my feelings for you are...

367
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,075
real.

368
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,808
The only thing I care about right now
is getting back my babies.

369
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:17,629
Well, if you want to get your eggs back
from Bishop, you're gonna need our help.

370
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:29,140
What were you little fellas doing
in the MedBay all by your lonesome?

371
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,977
Good thing you have me
to keep you company.

372
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,358
I do hope that that's
a victory dance, squire.

373
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,736
The groove is all part of the process.

374
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:43,864
Don't you worry.

375
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,907
I got the science covered, emo boy.

376
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,909
You just make sure
your hocus is pocused.

377
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:51,204
Oh, don't you worry about that. I have
a surefire way to summon the Fountain.

378
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,246
Mmm.

379
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,457
What's all this malarkey then?

380
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,041
This...

381
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,129
This serum will temporarily
make every cell in your body

382
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,090
mimic those of the most
angelic, selfless child.

383
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,010
Which will make the Fountain
think that I am worthy.

384
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,343
Bingo.

385
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,014
The serum will go into this.

386
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,892
Which I will hold onto for safekeeping.

387
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,226
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

388
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,478
You just let me know
when it's all good and ready.

389
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,980
All right, squire? Good.

390
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,243
John, do you really think Bishop

391
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,929
is just going to let you
use the Fountain?

392
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:32,954
Oh, don't be daft.

393
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,765
I know he wants to use
the powers for himself.

394
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,417
But old John Constantine
always has a plan. So, do me a favor.

395
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,919
- Stay out of my way...
- No.

396
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,147
Let me bring you back to the team
before it's too late.

397
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,649
"Oh, let me bring you back to the team
before it's too late, John."

398
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,342
Don't bloody kid yourself.

399
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,679
Come on. You of all people
understand what I'm doing, don't you?

400
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,891
You know what it feels like
to be powerless.

401
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,477
To desperately need magic.

402
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,896
You've always had this
selfish streak in you.

403
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,940
And my mom knew it was dangerous.

404
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,359
And what would your mom
think about you now, eh?

405
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,612
Her very own daughter,

406
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,657
dabbling in the very dark arts
that she ran away from.

407
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,244
I think she'd be turning in her grave.

408
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,132
Damn it, John.

409
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,430
So what's your plan?

410
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,307
Just going to shoot them all?

411
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,951
How do you know they're coming tonight?

412
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,811
Trust me, I know.

413
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:48,905
Oh, Gloria.

414
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,826
I've been playing nice, Gloria.

415
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,204
But now I've come to the edge.

416
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,748
So, I'm gonna give you
five whole minutes

417
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,208
to come on out here

418
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,752
and sign your place over to me.

419
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,130
Just let me go talk to him.

420
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,717
It's a trap. They don't want to talk.

421
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,138
Is this the only gun you have?

422
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,889
I never used it. It belonged to Celso.

423
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,058
I don't believe in fighting
with violence.

424
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,228
I'm sure Doc and I
can come to a civil agreement,

425
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,471
and nobody needs to get hurt.

426
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,816
Mommy, what's going on?

427
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,276
Oh, here.

428
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,462
Esperanza, why don't you read this
in the bedroom, okay?

429
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,863
You'll be safer in there.

430
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:34,701
No, there will be no bloodshed tonight.

431
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,038
- There will be if you don't fight them.
- Why is this even your business?

432
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,581
Because I'm your daughter.

433
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,625
I lost you once, Mom.

434
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,878
I'm not going to lose you again.

435
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:49,673
My daughter?

436
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,886
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's me, Esperanza.

437
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,095
Just all grown up.

438
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,306
And because of some
insane circumstances,

439
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,309
I've traveled from the future
to this moment in time.

440
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,270
And I know that tonight
you and my younger self

441
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,105
get separated for the rest of our lives.

442
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:05,565
Separated? How?

443
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,401
When those men attack,
I lose you for good.

444
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,821
And I escape into the woods
only to end up in a different time.

445
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:16,993
Please believe me.

446
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,704
I can fix history.

447
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,374
I can save you and little Esperanza.

448
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,592
Esperanza.

449
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,137
It's me. It's me.

450
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:41,309
And now that... now that I'm here...
you two can stay together.

451
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,020
I'm going to protect you.

452
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,190
I'm going to protect you.

453
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:58,909
Spooner.

454
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,080
Remember, if Esperanza
doesn't go to the Fountain,

455
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:04,165
then you never come back to save Gloria.

456
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,014
I'd rather protect her now
so I can become

457
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,836
the person my mom always hoped I'd be.

458
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,899
If she does that, then my little girl
and I, we can stay together, yes?

459
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,550
Yeah, you'll stay together,

460
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,635
but history will be completely changed.

461
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,181
And you'll never meet the Legends
or help us save Sara.

462
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,685
You'll never become you, Spooner.

463
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,228
Which means that...

464
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,898
Which means we never become friends.

465
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:32,402
And I really
don't want to lose my friend.

466
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,448
I can't let that innocent girl
go through what I went through.

467
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,076
If Esperanza does go...

468
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,247
she will grow up without me,
but she becomes you?

469
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,792
And history will be preserved, yeah?

470
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,882
Then Astra is right
and we have no choice.

471
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,176
Esperanza has to go.

472
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,181
Losing you was the worst moment
of my life, Mom.

473
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,851
I spent every day trying not to think
about what happened to you.

474
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,353
And it only made me angry and bitter.

475
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,515
I didn't become the kind of person
you wanted me to be.

476
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,401
Not even close.

477
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,154
Yes, you did. You became that person.

478
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:19,115
You are brave. You have a big heart.

479
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,659
You are a time traveler.

480
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,997
Whether it's aliens
or the universe at play,

481
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,833
you being here now is not a coincidence.

482
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,212
We were meant to find each other again.

483
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,548
Whatever powers took you away

484
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,967
also brought you back to me.

485
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,770
"We are saved by faith alone."

486
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:55,943
Stay with Gloria.

487
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,404
I'll get Esperanza to the Fountain.

488
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,870
Well, what do we do now, magic man?

489
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,706
Dance naked around a bonfire.

490
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,667
Ooh, make a blood sacrifice perhaps.

491
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,629
We don't need a sacrifice,
but we do need blood.

492
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,778
Ancient light show.

493
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,281
You must have started
a chemical reaction

494
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,032
which induced a bioluminescent response

495
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,876
in the cellular structure
of these mushrooms.

496
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,246
Would you stop your incessant bloody
commentary for one minute?

497
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:07,639
Finally.

498
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,726
There she is.

499
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,611
Oh, Gloria!

500
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,241
Everything's going to be all right,
<i>mi amor</i>. Hmm?

501
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,368
We've got to do what's right.

502
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,004
Listen to me, <i>maní.</i>

503
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,396
Astra, she's going
to take you somewhere.

504
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,673
Where?

505
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,052
Somewhere where you'll be protected.

506
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,764
I need you to be brave, okay?

507
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,850
And to remember
everything I ever taught you.

508
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,394
Why do I have to go without you, Mommy?

509
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,812
I don't want to go by myself.

510
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,190
I know, honey. I don't want to either.

511
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,776
But it's what we've got to do.

512
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,197
And before you know it,
we're going to see each other again.

513
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,200
And I know you can do it.

514
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,162
My strong and fearless girl.

515
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,041
We're going to see each other again.

516
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,710
I love you the most, Esperanza.

517
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,387
Time is up. You better come on out.

518
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,931
Okay, we have to go. Come here.

519
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,098
Astra...

520
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,476
take care of me.

521
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:35,769
Always.

522
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,449
I've been doing this dance far
too long, Gloria.

523
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,202
Just sign these papers...

524
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,454
and we'll be on our way.

525
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,289
I'll say this once.

526
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:00,002
This land belongs to me
and to my daughter.

527
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,547
And it is not for sale.

528
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,094
Why you ladies have to be
such a pain in my ass?

529
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,388
Boys!

530
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,176
What are you doing?

531
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,889
Showing you what real pain feels like.

532
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,058
<i>Because of your greed,</i>

533
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:00,938
<i>you forced a young girl
to leave her mother and her home.</i>

534
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:08,070
I want you to feel the anger,
the isolation, the anguish...

535
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,909
of losing everything you've ever loved.

536
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,663
What the hell are you waiting for?

537
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:27,381
Who are you?

538
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,801
I am my mother's daughter.

539
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:35,014
And this will never be your land.

540
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,751
John must have opened the Fountain.

541
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,711
Is that where I'm going?

542
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,673
Yeah, sweetie,
that's where you have to go.

543
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,217
Will it be scary?

544
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,345
At first, yeah.

545
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:19,809
But eventually you're going
to find friends and... a family.

546
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,601
And guess what?

547
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,437
You're even gonna see me again.

548
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:24,688
Okay?

549
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,645
Esperanza, I need you to stay here
for a second, okay?

550
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:34,656
Esperanza.

551
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,577
I told you to stay out of my way.

552
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:46,544
Hey, John boy. Is she part of the show?

553
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,524
What is it?

554
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:11,443
I can feel it.

555
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,865
She's gone now.

556
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,371
No, she's right here. With me.

557
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:44,351
All right, losers.

558
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,313
I've located your ship.
Odessa, Texas, 1925.

559
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,024
And the Fountain of Imperium
is in Texas.

560
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,692
I only care about my eggs.

561
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,880
The tracker says your ship should be
in front of us, but I don't see it.

562
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,739
Oh, hold on. Wait.

563
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:00,076
And, bingo!

564
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,703
- Oh, my God! I missed her.
- There she is.

565
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,166
- Yeah.
- There she is.

566
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,377
- Let's go.
- Nate, wait.

567
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:11,671
John's not gonna be on that ship.

568
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,255
All he cares about is the Fountain.

569
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:19,970
Okay, so how do we find an evil genius
and a crazed wizard in 1920s Texas.

570
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,307
Well, we, uh, follow the weirdness.

571
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,139
We need to act quickly
before the Fountain disappears.

572
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,569
John, you snake,
you swiped the serum from me?

573
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,756
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna bloody well
let you take it

574
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,616
and have all those powers
to yourself now, was I?

575
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,674
Yeah, I can feel it.

576
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:59,218
I can feel the Fountain.

577
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:10,604
That's not exactly the Fountain
you're feeling, my friend.

578
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:15,317
You see, the serum I cooked up
did indeed make you worthy.

579
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:20,823
But I also added
just a touch of deadly poison.

580
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,415
There are the eggs.

581
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
It's locked.

582
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,546
There's got to be another way in.

583
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:36,839
Gideon, are you there?

584
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,426
Guys, what is that thing
attached to the incubator?

585
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,847
<i>Congratulations, Legends.</i>

586
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,308
<i>You found your ship
and triggered this message.</i>

587
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,185
<i>Now, I knew the first thing you'd do is</i>

588
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:52,521
<i>try to save these wonderful
inter-species eggs.</i>

589
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,817
<i>But if you want them, you'll have to
play a game I call 48 pickup.</i>

590
00:37:57,026 --> 00:38:00,738
<i>Now, when I open the door,
you'll have a scant few moments</i>

591
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,032
<i>to gather as many of the eggs
as possible</i>

592
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,950
<i>before the incubator goes</i>

593
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,118
<i>boom boom.</i>

594
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:07,244
<i>Starting...</i>

595
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,704
<i>now.</i>

596
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,470
Grab anything you can
to put the eggs into.

597
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:16,921
Guys, hurry up.

598
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,597
Egg!

599
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,695
You bastard.

600
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,283
Oh, look, I'm sorry, John.
It's nothing personal.

601
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,700
You're just collateral damage.

602
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:52,289
Now that you're linked, killing you
means I destroy the Fountain.

603
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,210
Why?

604
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:01,048
To destroy the planet, of course.

605
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,425
You see, once upon a time...

606
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:06,595
benevolent aliens
gifted the Fountain to Earth

607
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,264
so it would act as an invisible shield

608
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:11,684
to protect the planet
from invasive alien species.

609
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,271
I forgot to mention that, didn't I?

610
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:21,485
Once it dies...
it's open season on Earth, baby.

611
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,197
I've tried saving the planet, twice.

612
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:29,910
And humans just keep getting in the way.

613
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,582
Now, I'm fast forwarding
to the inevitable end

614
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,001
so I can finally start anew.

615
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:47,720
So long, Johnny.

616
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,734
Something's wrong.

617
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,164
John?

618
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,170
- John?
- Astra.

619
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:23,463
I'm so...

620
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:25,841
I'm so bloody sorry.

621
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:27,927
Just tell me what to do.

622
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,690
There's gotta be a spell
that can help you.

623
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:31,137
Not this time.

624
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:32,513
No.

625
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,892
You're John Constantine.
You always have a plan.

626
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,577
You... You have a trick up your sleeve.

627
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,105
As luck would have it,
I'm all out of tricks this time.

628
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,944
You know, you're my greatest failure.

629
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,656
And my biggest accomplishment.

630
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,661
God, you look like your mom.

631
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,789
She would be so proud of you.
So proud of...

632
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,249
No. No. John.

633
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,627
John, I need you to try.

634
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:03,796
I need you to stay alive.

635
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,177
Screaming...

636
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:14,306
It's the Fountain.

637
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,476
I killed it.

638
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,818
I killed it, Astra.

639
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:30,196
John.

640
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,286
I killed...
