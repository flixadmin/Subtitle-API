1
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,438
Terrific.

2
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,881
What's up, numb-nuts?

3
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,285
Read 'em and weep.

4
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,051
Van Halen at the centrum.

5
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,216
Third row!

6
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,121
You should take jolene, man.

7
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,957
I heard she got big nipples.

8
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,724
This is van freakin' Halen, man.

9
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,288
Get serious.

10
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,096
Besides, I'm just not into girls anymore.

11
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,769
Dude, I'm into guys, too!

12
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,098
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,401
That's not what I meant.

14
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,603
I'm into women.

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,196
Hey, Mary.

16
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,432
I got two tickets to van
Halen this weekend.

17
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,635
What time should I pick you up?

18
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,504
It is miss mcgarricle, Donny.

19
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,038
And that's cute,
but I am your teacher, not your girlfriend.

20
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,608
Whoa, miss mcgarricle,
who said anything about girlfriends?

21
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,244
Let's just start with a summer fling,

22
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,447
couple of hand jobs,

23
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,280
no expectations.

24
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,322
Don't get all psycho on me right away.

25
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,993
That is a month's detention.

26
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,257
What's a hand job?

27
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,858
I don't know, but I think I want one.

28
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,772
Can I go to the bathroom?

29
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,741
No. No talking in detention, Mr. berger.

30
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,706
All right, I'm sorry for what I did.

31
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,245
I promise I won't do it again.

32
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,011
You're in a lot of trouble, Donny.

33
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,479
Wait, you're not gonna
tell my dad, are you?

34
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,779
He'll kick my ass. He's crazy.

35
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,050
What were you trying to do, anyway?

36
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,318
Impress your friends?

37
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,919
Well, you know, you're...

38
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,828
You have a little crush on me?

39
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,259
No.

40
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:40,498
"No. " So, you...
You don't want me.

41
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,373
No. Yeah.

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,001
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say right now.

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,205
Is that gum in your mouth, Donny?

44
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,225
You know,
I've been watching you all year, Donny.

45
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,455
When you hit that shot to beat Fairfield

46
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,193
and you were jumping up and down
in your little Larry bird short-shorts

47
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,793
and sweating like ajar of pickles
in the hot sun...

48
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,662
Oh, God.

49
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,331
That was so hot.

50
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,443
Is this really happening?

51
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,674
This is happening.

52
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,977
It's happening right now.

53
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,518
In my office.

54
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,548
Okay. Awesome.

55
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,816
So, I'm totally in.

56
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,516
How do you want to do it?

57
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,686
'Cause I made sex before, lots of ways.

58
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,161
So you want to go straight to hand jobs

59
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,291
or eating me out or taking me from behind?

60
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,663
I'll teach you.

61
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,532
I'm a virgin.

62
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,004
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

63
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,839
Oh, my God.

64
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,143
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

65
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,198
Who? Me?

66
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,255
Hey, Donny, what'd you get?

67
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,956
And if I'm elected
eighth grade class president,

68
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,054
I promise to...

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,327
You're getting so good at this!

70
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,933
I promise to do my best to lower prices at
the school stores and...

71
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,739
All of our practice is really paying off!

72
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,403
I like the sound of that.

73
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,319
Timmy, stop. Hold on a second.

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,903
My dad's gonna kick my ass.

75
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,215
Calm down!

76
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,569
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

77
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,798
Who's the man?

78
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,501
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

79
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,806
Yeah! You want some of me? Who's the man?

80
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,981
All right, everybody!

81
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,315
Enough!

82
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,414
I am aware that a lot of people think

83
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,853
that this young man

84
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,823
is not really a victim,
but someone that's living

85
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,796
the ultimate teenage boy's fantasy.

86
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,160
Absolutely.

87
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,064
But this is a serious crime.

88
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,799
Mary Beth mcgarricle, rise for sentencing.

89
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,636
The fact that this relationship

90
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,170
has resulted in a pregnancy
and you show absolutely no remorse,

91
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,677
saying, and I quote,

92
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,687
I would fuck that kid again and again.

93
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:56,091
"He makes me feel like there's a rainbow
coming out of my beaver."

94
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,392
Leaves me absolutely no choice

95
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,762
but to Levy the maximum penalty.

96
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,328
Thirty years
in the Massachusetts women's penitentiary.

97
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,066
And furthermore, the court grants custody
of the unborn child

98
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,575
to Donald berger's father...

99
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,242
Dumb-ass.

100
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,405
Until Donald turns 18,

101
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,416
at which time he will assume full custody.

102
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,983
Take care of our baby, Donny!

103
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,246
Miss mcgarricle!

104
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,255
I'll never stop loving you!

105
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,750
That is just fucking mental.

106
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,280
The kid is young, he's attractive,

107
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,328
he can probably keep a hard-on
longer than this fucking guy.

108
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,935
Made you flinch, pansy.

109
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,700
Go ahead! I don't need you!

110
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,675
I'm Donny freakin' berger!

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,913
I'm wicked famous
and I got a wicked big sch-long!

112
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,074
Hey, here's something.
Donny berger's back in the news.

113
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,277
That kid who got his teacher pregnant?

114
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,649
- Exactly.
- I love that guy.

115
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,450
Seems like he bought a round last night.

116
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,114
Okay... For everybody
in Boston garden.

117
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,285
Oh, my God, he's my hero.

118
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,491
That kid is burning through that money,
but he's having a good time doing it.

119
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,779
So, guy, how'd we do?

120
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,012
What them fuckers at the IRS say?

121
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,417
Well, they said a lot of stuff.

122
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,887
The thing that really jumped out

123
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,323
- was "three years in prison."
- Three years?

124
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,793
Yeah, you haven't paid taxes
since '94, Donny.

125
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,729
What... I thought they were
taking it out automatically!

126
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,390
I told them that's what you thought,

127
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,365
and they said
it's the stupidest thing they ever heard.

128
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,992
But there is some good news.

129
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,628
If you can pay
the balance off by the end of the weekend,

130
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,934
they'll suspend the sentence.

131
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,507
Oh, okay, there you go.

132
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,975
What are we talking about? Hit me.

133
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,236
Forty-three thousand.

134
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,506
Forty-three grand?

135
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,740
No!

136
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,847
Come on, Donny!

137
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,578
Don't screw up my tom Brady poster.

138
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,085
It's my favorite one.

139
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,780
Look at that jaw line.

140
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,346
Just the right amount of scruff.

141
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,620
I'm sorry! I'm just freaking out here!

142
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,252
I don't got 43 grand!

143
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,125
Well, look, hey, good news.

144
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,789
Monday's Memorial Day,

145
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,730
so you don't need
to get the money till Tuesday.

146
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,134
All right. That'll give me time to
sell my diamond lamborghini!

147
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,937
Hey, hey, hey! You're killing me, man!

148
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,975
Don't mess with the genius.

149
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,909
Jimmy, I got $28 to my name.

150
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,378
Twenty-eight, huh? Okay.

151
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,109
I got a hot tip on a long shot
that just might come in.

152
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,614
- What is it, a horse?
- No.

153
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,743
This is tubby tuke, fat guy.

154
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,221
Fat guy?

155
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,816
Gonna run the marathon.
Odds on him winning are 8,000-to-1.

156
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,918
But this cat's got wheels on him.

157
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,930
I think he's gonna win, I really do.

158
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,456
All right, I'll put 20 on the fat fuck,
but I can't count on that.

159
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,593
It's a long shot, you said it yourself.

160
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,830
But what about your kid?

161
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,200
Maybe he can come up with the dough.

162
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,936
We don't talk no more.

163
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,976
He kind of moved out when he turned 18,

164
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,977
and that's the last I seen of him.

165
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,842
- What happened?
- I don't know.

166
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,314
I loved that little han solo
more than anything in the world, too.

167
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,082
- You named your kid han solo?
- Yes, sir.

168
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,621
Han solo berger?

169
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,157
Coolest name in the world, right?

170
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,692
Why don't you just Facebook him?

171
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,251
I can't afford that shit.
What am I, a billionaire?

172
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,423
I don't think he wants
to be found, anyways.

173
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,489
Especially by me.

174
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,505
Hey, look! It's us!

175
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,811
- On the cover!
- Don't we look great?

176
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,113
Yeah, well, you look good.

177
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,710
I kind of look like a ventriloquist.

178
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,620
I don't know, it's still
kind of weird, right?

179
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,626
I mean, it's got our faces and our names.

180
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,559
It just seems like anyone could find us.

181
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,155
"Find us"?
Honey, did you take your Xanax today?

182
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,290
Yeah, two.

183
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,766
I always double down
when your parents are in town.

184
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,029
Do you have your security undies?

185
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,504
- Yep, right here.
- Good.

186
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,972
I know that makes you feel better.

187
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,031
There's stranger things than walking around

188
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,544
with an extra pair of underwear
for emergencies.

189
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,548
Look, just this once, don't be so weird.

190
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,379
We're gonna have the best wedding ever.

191
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,577
Okay.

192
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,796
Holy shit. What the hell happened
to my life, champale?

193
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,265
Don, honey, no way to come up
with that money, huh?

194
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,132
No. The only thing
I'm good at is being Donny berger,

195
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,900
and no one wants to pay for that anymore.

196
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,599
Aw, Donny.

197
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,541
Wow!

198
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,339
My face is your toilet!

199
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,006
Show some fucking respect
over there, Kenny.

200
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,412
Hey, whoa.

201
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,047
Hey, mom, did you want
some breakfast after you finish your dance?

202
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,484
Give it to me now, honey.

203
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,613
Donny doesn't mind, do you, Donny?

204
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,023
Holy cow, that's my son!

205
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,381
Who, han solo?

206
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,690
I thought you said he was a fatty.

207
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,163
No, no, no.
He must have lost the weight or something,

208
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,097
'cause I swear to God, that's my boy.

209
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,927
It says, "Todd Peterson to
wed Jamie Martin this Sunday"

210
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,993
"at all saints church on Cape COD."

211
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,733
Todd Peterson?

212
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,069
He changed his name!

213
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,200
Why?

214
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,777
What was wrong with han solo berger?

215
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,939
It's the coolest fucking name of all time.

216
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,380
"Peterson is one of the youngest"

217
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,112
"large-cap hedge fund managers
in the financial industry."

218
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,051
He got rich on us, huh?

219
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,217
"All the more impressive
considering he was orphaned"

220
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,786
"at age nine, when both his parents died
in a horrific explosion."

221
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,962
He fucking blew me up and his mother?

222
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,229
Donny, maybe your son could
help you, financially.

223
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,804
I don't know. This kid changed his name.

224
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,931
He doesn't even want
to be a berger anymore.

225
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,532
He's not gonna want to talk to me.

226
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,775
That was the incomparable champale.

227
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,276
And now, looking hot
and ignoring doctor's orders,

228
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,078
let's welcome Amber.

229
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,450
What the fuck happened to her?

230
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,488
Fuck you, Kenny!

231
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,524
Hey, what's up, robe-cop?

232
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,490
This is where your boss lives?

233
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,792
It's actually just his summer home.

234
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,493
- Summer home. What a dick.
- Dad!

235
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,562
Oh, my goodness.

236
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,867
Todd, it's just breathtaking!

237
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,872
Hey! There he is.

238
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,238
Hey, Mr. Spirou.

239
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,277
There's my golden boy.

240
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,676
Come over here, champ.

241
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,304
Come on, get over here.

242
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,507
Hi. Yeah.

243
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,107
Look at you.

244
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,383
Look at you, the lovely bride.

245
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,386
What a couple!

246
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,084
Mr. Spirou, it's so amazing
that you're letting us all stay here.

247
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,319
Seriously, thank you so much.

248
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,292
Steve, these are
my parents, Gerald and Helen.

249
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,727
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi.

250
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,059
Your daughter's a sweetheart.

251
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,664
You can tell she likes Todd for Todd,

252
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,793
not because he's gonna be rich.

253
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,963
I wouldn't want
my boy to end up with some gold digger

254
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,937
like the last three whores I married, huh?

255
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,104
True story. All three? Whores.

256
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,077
Well, guys, this weekend,
mi casa es su casa.

257
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,414
You know, every member of my staff
are lucky to be in this country,

258
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,284
so feel free to abuse the shit out of 'em.

259
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,258
Go get the fucking bags!

260
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,688
Well, Mrs. Spirou,
I've always said that if the finance game

261
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,992
was an amusement park,
your son would be a roller coaster,

262
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,694
and I would just ride him all day long.

263
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,832
That came out weird.

264
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,429
Yeah, well, Stevie likes to think

265
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,701
that he's the star of the family.

266
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,404
But before he was born,
I modeled a bathing suit

267
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,107
for a woolworth advertisement.

268
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,776
Well, you still have
quite a figure on you there, delores.

269
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,411
Yeah, I can see
where Steve got his rocking bod.

270
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,612
Why, thank you.

271
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,049
Chad's here!

272
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,389
- Oh, my God.
- Hooray.

273
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,484
Fantastic.

274
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,190
I guess they didn't want to see it.

275
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,426
Yay, Chad!

276
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,230
- Come here.
- Mom.

277
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,770
- Sweetheart.
- I'm home.

278
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,236
Dad, how are you, sir?

279
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,773
- You look great.
- Thank you, sir.

280
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:30,966
Hey, Chad, I'm Todd.

281
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,441
Oh, my God.

282
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,671
Oh, God, I missed you, sis.

283
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,144
That's a good hug.

284
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,481
Chad, this is my fiancé, Todd.

285
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,709
Pleasure to meet you, chadwick.

286
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,979
Are you a soldier?

287
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,646
No.

288
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,383
- Sailor?
- No.

289
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,482
- Airman?
- No.

290
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,651
Girl scout?

291
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,216
No.

292
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,890
Well, then I'd prefer if you take
your fingers away from your forehead

293
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,764
and you shake my hand
like the civilian you are.

294
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,963
Yeah, sorry, I'm stupid.
I don't know why I did that.

295
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,131
Honest mistake. Come here,
I want to show you this.

296
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,335
Look, if you ever do anything

297
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,572
to hurt my sister, I will take
my government-issued service revolver,

298
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,015
stick it straight up your fuppin'
poop chute, and empty the clip.

299
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,313
Do you feel me?

300
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:19,015
Yes, I totally feel you... dawg.

301
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,258
Randy Jackson, right?

302
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,253
I've got 10 ways
to kill you with my bare hands right now.

303
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,058
Don't. Don't.

304
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,833
Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

305
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,931
Can I see Randall Morgan possibly?

306
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,601
Yeah, you're gonna need an appointment.

307
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,268
I knew you were gonna say that.

308
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,077
But you know what?
Tell him Donny berger's out here.

309
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,945
He'll be pretty psyched
to see an old friend.

310
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,781
You know what? Mr. Morgan's
on vacation right now. I'm sorry.

311
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,648
- He's on vacation? That son of a...
- Oh, hey!

312
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,847
Vanilla ice.

313
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,686
Randall's just getting makeup.
Go ahead to the green room.

314
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,129
Vanilla, what's up, guy?

315
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,861
It's been a long time. How you been?

316
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,397
Are you seriously giving me
the silent treatment still?

317
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,698
You know that hurts me.

318
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,103
Yeah? Well, that's why
I'm giving it to you.

319
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,196
How's it feel, chump?

320
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,865
It's breaking my heart.

321
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,171
We were friends for 20 years, guy.

322
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,008
We were friends until you banged my mother!

323
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,048
I didn't know it was her, I swear to God!

324
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,014
It's not like her last name is ice.

325
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,510
You should've known by the haircut!

326
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,349
Aw, come on, vanilla bean latte.

327
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,753
- Will you just...
- What?

328
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,585
I'm just saying, I'm in big trouble, guy.

329
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,683
This, like, monetary thing.

330
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,594
I'm going to prison
if I don't get 43 large, so...

331
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,892
What, do you think I got
that kind of money?

332
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,398
Of course you got that kind of money.

333
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,061
Royalties from ice ice baby,
you must be fucking loaded!

334
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,536
Man, listen, queen took 50%.

335
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,231
Suge took the other 60%.

336
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,070
I fucking owe money when
that shit gets played, man!

337
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,270
Dude, come on, will you please
stop, collaborate and listen?

338
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,040
- Oh, here...
- What? No, I love that song.

339
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,206
You know that shit.

340
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,772
I was on top of that, fucking day one.

341
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,382
Listen, man. I work at a ice rink now.

342
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,284
I deep-fry chicken nuggets, man.

343
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,253
I'll get you a deal on
a barbecue sauce packet.

344
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,585
Fucking a, buddy.

345
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,354
Both of us. This sucks.

346
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,417
Broke. Who'd have thought
this would happen to us?

347
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,892
Maybe I should call your mother.
She'll give me the money, I know that.

348
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,128
- What?
- What? What? What?

349
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,933
Hey, dude.

350
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,235
Didn't spill my beer, fucker.

351
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,435
Fuck you.

352
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,068
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

353
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,108
Nobody comes in here
and starts busting up my joint

354
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,240
unless I got cameras rolling.

355
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,813
Look, Donny,
nobody remembers what Tiger Woods did,

356
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,718
let alone something
that happened 25 years ago.

357
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,381
I'm telling you, when I
walk down the street,

358
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,924
people are like, "there's that guy!"

359
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,516
I'm still fucking big, dude.

360
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,394
All right, how about this?
I'm doing a show on '80s train wrecks.

361
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,830
Maybe I slip you in
after that milli vanilli guy, all right?

362
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,334
- Who, fab? He's a fucking buddy of mine.
- Yeah.

363
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,233
That would be huge, dude.
How much money?

364
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,534
Maybe 400 bucks.

365
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,904
Four hundred bucks?

366
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,434
Dude, I need 43 g-birds.
What are we talking about right now?

367
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,572
You need $43,000?

368
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,081
Are you back on drugs?

369
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,378
- Yeah.
- It's never...

370
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,180
This is never going to happen. Never.

371
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,686
Little bit more blush if you can.

372
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,814
Just like you did that John Wayne bobbitt
in his penis reunion show.

373
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,923
That's actually a good idea, a reunion.

374
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,996
Me and miss mcgarricle, together again,
live from a women's prison.

375
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,407
A women's prison.

376
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,435
Very sexy.

377
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,673
We could shoot it this weekend.
You could give me the money.

378
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,608
Very sexy.

379
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,049
You know, you could eat that ass
after I leave the room,

380
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,018
but I need an answer right now.
What do you think?

381
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,247
What about your kid?

382
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,017
My kid? What about my kid?

383
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,081
He's got to be a walking gong show.

384
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,355
No. What are you talking about?
He's doing great.

385
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,124
He's, like, a hot shit now.
He's getting married

386
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,132
- down at the cape this weekend.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

387
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,725
"Horny teacher baby makes good."

388
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,862
Smell that? Smell it, Donny?

389
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,535
What? That's not me.
She probably cut the cheese.

390
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,372
No, no, no. No, ratings.

391
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,103
I smell ratings.

392
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,405
My kid is very publicity-shy, so I...
You know, to be honest,

393
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,075
I don't think he'd do
a piece of shit show like this.

394
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,584
All right, here's the deal.

395
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,314
You get yourself and your actual kid

396
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,118
up to the women's
prison this weekend, I will shoot it,

397
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,056
I will give you 50 grand in cash.

398
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,123
'Cause I'm going to guess, Donny,
you want to be visiting a prison,

399
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,857
not living in one.

400
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,163
So, Todd, how does one get into
the hedgehog business anyway?

401
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,297
Oh, it's actually hedge funds.

402
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,034
You think you're better than me?

403
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:32,833
No.

404
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,374
Chad, did you know
that Todd is really great with numbers?

405
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,778
- You got to see this.
- Jamie, no. Don't make...

406
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,611
What's 452 times 77?

407
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,047
84,304.

408
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,486
Oh, he could just be making that up.

409
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,647
No, he's not!

410
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,453
There's a calculator on my cell phone.

411
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,516
Okay.

412
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,195
What is 94

413
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,531
times 312, Todd?

414
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,005
29,328, Helen.

415
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,768
Freaky.

416
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,310
I don't know. It's just something I can do.

417
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,345
Are you sure you're not a chinaman?

418
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,971
Oh, that's inappropriate.

419
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,174
White whore.

420
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,484
I'll get it.

421
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,958
Oh, my God. You must be Jamie.

422
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,918
You're, like, even hotter
than you looked in the paper.

423
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,427
Look at your hair,
blowing in the wind like tawny kitaen

424
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,490
when she was fucking dry-humping that car.

425
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,194
Okay.

426
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,431
And you must be...

427
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,001
Donny.

428
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,601
What's the matter?
Chubby never even mentioned me?

429
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,733
Chubby?

430
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,176
Oh, I mean Todd Peterson.

431
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,105
Why do you say it like that?

432
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,012
It just comes out that way.

433
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,381
Where are my manners, right?

434
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,421
Could you hold that?
Take a chug if you'd like.

435
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,748
I got you a fucking great gift.

436
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,351
Here it is.

437
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,958
I'll take the brew back.

438
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,654
Just, you got to read it, though.
It's fucking...

439
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,056
Yeah!

440
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,928
I don't know where they
come up with this shit,

441
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,596
but it's pretty fucking funny.

442
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,435
Spencer's gifts never fucking fails me.

443
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,133
I want to meet Mr. Spencer one day and say,

444
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,801
"thanks, motherfucker, for all the laughs."

445
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,470
Hey, I also made you a mix tape.

446
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,310
Who the fuck is rich in this house?

447
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,405
Jeezum, it's huge.

448
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,251
Todd, your old man is here?

449
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,515
'Wassup!

450
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,659
Helen, oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

451
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,817
No, it's... Let me
just get that for you.

452
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,953
- That's...
- What? No.

453
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,497
Oh, sorry, those are yours. I...

454
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,796
Donny, what... what the fuck, man? Sorry.

455
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,899
What are you doing here?

456
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,396
What do you mean?

457
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,734
I thought you said your parents were dead.

458
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,701
No, they are. Super dead.

459
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,300
He's hilarious.

460
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,606
My old man.

461
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,970
My old man friend.

462
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,144
From...

463
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,217
'Wassup!

464
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,409
Right?

465
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,122
Well, aren't you going to introduce us?

466
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,482
- No.
- Yes.

467
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,956
Yes. Here we go.

468
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,261
This is my future father-in-law, Gerald,

469
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,527
and his lovely wife, Helen.

470
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,628
And Jamie's brother, Chad.

471
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,831
- Hey-0!
- Don't. That's...

472
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,198
What?

473
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,332
I like the look of this. Who's this?

474
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,244
Okay. This is my boss Steve's mother,
delores, who's awake now.

475
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,044
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where you
get all the looks from, huh, sweetie?

476
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,547
Yeah, no, we're not related.

477
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,880
Oh, yeah? Well, she wishes,
'cause you got the fucking...

478
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,889
You're stacked pretty good.

479
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,993
Anyhow, jame, this is my old friend, Donny.

480
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,590
Your best friend.

481
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,157
I'm his best friend.

482
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,396
Your best friend.

483
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,930
Yeah, no.

484
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,972
Remember I told you we met...

485
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,495
Where'd we meet?

486
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,235
- We met...
- Where?

487
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,271
- Come on.
- It's coming to me.

488
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,569
I saved his life.

489
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,245
Well, more metaphorically.

490
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,314
No, no, no, no, no. Here's what happened.

491
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,818
It was, like,
one of them train track kind of deals.

492
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,611
My man over here, I see him,

493
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,656
he drops his burrito on the tracks.

494
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,448
I'm like, "all right, that happens."

495
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,326
Next thing you know,
homeboy leaps down there,

496
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,294
and he tries to retrieve the burrito.

497
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,164
Okay? I see a train whizzing at him.

498
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,758
I'm like, "this guy's about to die,
and he don't know it."

499
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,202
I fucking leap down there myself, right,

500
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,000
and I give him a little
shove on the heinie.

501
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,631
"Get out of the way, buddy!"

502
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,004
Next thing you know, I realize

503
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,768
this thing's going to hit me.

504
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,470
I fucking remember, though,

505
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,740
I had a kung fu instructor

506
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,112
who taught me
how to tighten the diaphragm,

507
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,980
and I bring it in there.

508
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,314
And I feel the train go by.

509
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,409
My eyes are closed.

510
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,252
Rips my shirt off my body, okay?
I open my eyes.

511
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,316
I see all these chicks just kind of looking
at me, going, "what is that?"

512
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,883
"That's the fucking
most chiseled guy I've ever seen."

513
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,725
I worked out at the time.

514
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,322
Anyways, the place goes bananas for me,
I sign a couple of titties,

515
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,094
and I started hanging out
with this guy ever since.

516
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,726
Best friends, right? Here you go, my boy.

517
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,397
I just can't believe
I've never heard that story before.

518
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,967
Why wouldn't you just
get another burrito, Todd?

519
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,073
Wouldn't it be dirty?

520
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,080
Great questions.

521
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,942
It's one of the many things about this
story that's pretty hard to believe.

522
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,683
So, where are you staying, Donny?

523
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,149
He's not staying.

524
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,210
No.

525
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,723
I can't stay. Yeah, no, he's right.

526
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,988
Oh, pshaw. I mean, invite him to stay here.

527
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,530
You have to stay.

528
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,862
He's your best friend.
You're his best friend.

529
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,367
Sheesh, I'm not messing with her.

530
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,903
I mean, you are my best friend, guy.

531
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,439
And, Jamie, you can be my breast friend.

532
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,076
Breast, with an with an.

533
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,577
By the way, dude, you look fantastic.

534
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,376
You lost all the weight, homeboy.

535
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,647
I miss the titties.

536
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,985
You saved my life? Seriously?

537
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,956
What? They ate that up.

538
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,688
You came up with a whole lot of nothing.

539
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,657
That's a nice suitcase, by the way.

540
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,788
What is that, Louis Vuitton?

541
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,730
This is a hefty bag.

542
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,566
What the fuck are you talking about?

543
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,532
What do you want, Donny? Money?

544
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,163
You heard I was doing well,
so you came looking for a handout?

545
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,606
I don't want none of your money.
How is that? Okay?

546
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,109
I get it. You don't like me.

547
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,576
I exploded.

548
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,768
I wish you had exploded.

549
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,007
That way, I wouldn't have to
see your stupid face anymore!

550
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,071
Did you happen to notice

551
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,175
I created a whole fake life
just so I could get away from you?

552
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,952
Your mother's sick, by the way.

553
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,579
I don't believe you.

554
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,956
They don't know how long she's got.

555
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,322
What is that, nunchucks?

556
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,823
I told her you would
visit her up at the prison.

557
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,268
I'm kind of thinking you're the kind of guy
who would pull through for mumsie.

558
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,068
Know what I'm saying?

559
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,130
She'd do the same for you.

560
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:40,799
Really?

561
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,569
Yeah. Saturday's the last visiting day
before the big surgery, so...

562
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,007
So let me get this straight.

563
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,244
You want me to go visit my "sick mom"

564
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,445
that I haven't talked
to in years, in prison,

565
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,987
the day before my wedding.

566
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,313
Correct.

567
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,755
Not happening, asshole.

568
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,918
What the fuck did I do to you

569
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,120
to make you hate me so much?

570
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,685
I am fucking baffled right now.

571
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,664
Well, maybe you don't remember, but you
were basically the worst parent ever.

572
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,860
Me? I did everything for you, buddy,

573
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,426
and I never gave you
an ounce of shit about nothing.

574
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,137
You never gave me nothing.

575
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,467
I gave you a snake.

576
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,134
Yeah, and then it died
after it ate all your quaaludes.

577
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:17,470
That was the only time
any body's ever seen a king cobra laugh.

578
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,305
And I take pride in that, so fuck you.

579
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,145
Yeah, great. You know what?

580
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,278
I basically had to raise myself, Donny.

581
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,719
I never learned how to swim.

582
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,279
I don't even know how to ride a bike.

583
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,824
You know how fucking humiliating that is?

584
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,924
What about Mr. mitty? Remember him?

585
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,286
What? No. What's that?

586
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,331
Mr. mitty. I used to put
an oven mitt on my hand.

587
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,867
He would cheer you up
all the time when you were sad.

588
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,560
"Don't be upset, young man."

589
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,467
"I'm your best friend."

590
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,199
"Even though I'm an oven mitt."

591
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,106
No, I don't remember that, okay?

592
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,198
You know what I do remember?

593
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,509
You making me
drive you home from the beach

594
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,636
'cause you got too drunk.

595
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,205
It makes sense to me.

596
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,579
When somebody's hammered,
they have another guy drive home.

597
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:54,939
I was eight!

598
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,148
Well, you looked 14
'cause you were such a huge fat fuck.

599
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,210
I'm sorry.

600
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,823
You are such an asshole.

601
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,221
Dude, you're a millionaire now,

602
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,318
and you're marrying that hot chick.

603
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,789
I must have done a pretty decent
job as a dad, don't you think?

604
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,624
Oh, yeah? You want to check in
on your pretty decent job?

605
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,094
Oh, my God.

606
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,934
You're a junkie? 'Who's your supplier?

607
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,831
'Cause I'll smack that motherfucker around.

608
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,600
It's Insulin, you dick.

609
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:23,237
I'm a diabetic 'cause you let me eat
cake and lollipops for breakfast every day.

610
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,941
But that's what you fucking asked for.

611
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,777
Yeah, you're supposed to say no.

612
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:30,044
You know, I weighed 400 pounds
by the time I was 12.

613
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,883
You know how hard it was
to take that weight off?

614
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,451
All right, all right.

615
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,849
I didn't know what I was doing.
I had no one helping me.

616
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,526
Grandpa was a psycho. You know that.

617
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,927
Han solo, don't be like this.

618
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,192
I'm a good person.

619
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,733
Okay, don't call me that, all right?

620
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,927
My name's Todd now.

621
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,493
Call yourself han solo.
You're dressed like him.

622
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,068
Good one.

623
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,905
I'm just saying, buddy, give me a chance.

624
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,410
Do you have any axe body spray?

625
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,107
No, Donny, I don't have any axe body spray.

626
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,311
Because I'm not a fucking douche bag.

627
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,080
That's a douche bag thing?

628
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,919
When did that become a douche bag thing?

629
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,118
Todd, the guests are arriving. Let's go!

630
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,352
All right, can you lighten up a little bit?

631
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,657
We got a party to attend.

632
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,719
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

633
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,598
Good person, how about
you put on a tie, okay?

634
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,726
It's a cocktail party,
not a quiznos opening.

635
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:24,003
'What? I haven't worn a tie
since my mother's funeral when I was three.

636
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,336
I'm not going to start that up again.

637
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,803
That's great. Put on a tie.

638
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,305
- No.
- Put on a tie!

639
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,810
I'll never sell out.

640
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,477
I'll give you 100 bucks.

641
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,938
Where's the tie?

642
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,015
Look at this.

643
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,578
Jamie is going to have it all.

644
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,150
By the way, Mr. Spirou,

645
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,285
I read the opec report, and I was thinking,

646
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,261
if we hedge our position on oil,
we could really...

647
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,867
If we were to short the euro, we could...

648
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,436
Come on, Todd.
This is your wedding weekend.

649
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,800
You are marrying a real workaholic.
You do know that.

650
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,600
Yeah, but isn't that
what you want in a partner?

651
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,803
She's good, this one.

652
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,176
She's good.

653
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,042
All right, all right.

654
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,381
I haven't made that decision yet,

655
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:11,913
but I love this kid.

656
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,450
You lost your dad in that explosion,

657
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,918
and I lost my son.

658
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,318
I thought your son
was a ski instructor in vail.

659
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,929
He's a pot-smoking bum!

660
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,096
Not like you, Todd. Oh, no.

661
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,031
You're the type of boy
a father can be proud of.

662
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,528
Yeah, we'll never know, will we?

663
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,272
- Who's that?
- I'm not here.

664
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,708
That's Donny.

665
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,135
Donny, come on. Say hi to everyone.

666
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,639
Oh, God, hang on.

667
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,206
Let me swing these free.

668
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,210
Glad all the children saw that.

669
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,683
Donny.

670
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,222
This is Steve Spirou, Todd's boss.

671
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,057
'Wassup!

672
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,523
Is that back?

673
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,694
Because I've been dying
for that to come back.

674
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,792
'Wassup!

675
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,131
Yeah!

676
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:03,966
That's my boy! Look at him!

677
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,268
He ain't a tight-ass.

678
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,434
'Wassup!

679
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,545
- 'Wassup! - 'Wassup!
- 'Wassup! - 'Wassup!

680
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,209
- 'Wassup!
- 'Wassup!

681
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,140
'Wassup!

682
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,149
What's up?

683
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,456
Boo!

684
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,862
That was terrible, Todd.

685
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,686
So, I see the train coming,

686
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,790
and something
kind of like takes over me, you know?

687
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,160
- Here you go, Abigail.
- Thank you.

688
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,365
And so, I decide to jump
off the platform, right?

689
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,399
Snaps my legs in two.

690
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,968
What did I expect?
It was a 25-foot drop, you know?

691
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,541
Twenty-five feet?

692
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,873
So I grab burrito bandito over here,

693
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,279
and I just roll him out of the way.

694
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,580
The train missed our skulls by inches.

695
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,813
Why would you do
something like that, Todd?

696
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,621
You know, I really don't know, Steve.

697
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,859
I mean, why wouldn't you
just buy another burrito?

698
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,558
Yeah, no, I know.

699
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,254
I don't know what I could
have been thinking.

700
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,628
Maybe he was high on the hashish.

701
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,930
Hey, how about I
get you another beer, huh, Donny boy?

702
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,393
Twenty's my limit.

703
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,995
No! No, no.

704
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,837
But, Donny boy
has got to go to bed, though, right?

705
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,871
Oh, fiddlesnatch.

706
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,537
It's the afternoon.

707
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,510
Remember you told me
you wanted to get to bed early?

708
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,074
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no, no.

709
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,142
Todd's right.

710
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,209
Oh, my God.

711
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,954
You're right, it is him.

712
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,513
- You're Donny berger.
- It's him.

713
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,260
Do you remember that kid who got
his teacher pregnant in somerville?

714
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,985
Wait a minute, that is you.

715
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,223
Donny berger.

716
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,490
Didn't you and your teacher have a kid?

717
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,999
Wait a minute. What was his name?

718
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,797
Indiana Jones, huh?

719
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,993
It was something fantastic like that.

720
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,368
Yeah, han solo berger.

721
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,665
Yeah, han solo, han solo.
What ever happened to him?

722
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,067
What happened to him?

723
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,804
He actually became a dick.

724
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,745
A private eye, I mean.

725
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,608
One of the biggest
and hairiest dicks in the world.

726
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,175
Okay.

727
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,682
Hey, look, this might seem weird,
but do you think you would ever...

728
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,256
Bone your wife? Yeah, I mean, I'd love to.

729
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,052
She's a hot little number.

730
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,089
'Well, you know, I was just
going to ask you for an autograph, but...

731
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,633
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. On her tits or...

732
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,331
- Or a piece of paper would be fine.
- Yeah, or a photo.

733
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,034
Okay, well, this has been fun.

734
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,341
- But, Donny...
- Not to toot my own horn,

735
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,069
but I got kind of close once.

736
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,509
Mrs. weiss, freshman geometry.

737
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,910
And I think she would have done it, too.

738
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,743
I just didn't know how to make the move.

739
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,482
You know what? I would have killed

740
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,280
to bang my eighth grade
biology teacher, Mrs. cohn.

741
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,117
I used to dream of
dissecting her with my penis.

742
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,057
It's so weird what goes on upstairs
when you hit puberty.

743
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:41,862
I actually stole
my middle school librarian's glasses

744
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,160
to wear while I masturbated.

745
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,923
What is that about?

746
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,602
In my day, when I got into trouble,

747
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,773
the headmaster would
slap your hand with his dick.

748
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,371
She wins.

749
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,475
You know, Todd was working at the cubicle

750
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,949
next to mine one year,
12 weeks and one day ago

751
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,350
when he met a pretty girl
at the gym named Jamie.

752
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,014
How many days is that, Todd?

753
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,622
Computing, Steve.

754
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,820
451.

755
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,621
It's actually 450.

756
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,599
Battle of the brainiacs!

757
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,199
Yeah, this guy forgot
about leap year, I guess.

758
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,700
He's smarter than Todd!

759
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,408
Okay, we're talking a lot about numbers,
but let's get back to love.

760
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,033
What's the matter, hot stuff?

761
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,135
Where do you think you get it from?

762
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,440
Your mother was a math teacher,

763
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,311
and I was pretty much a whiz kid myself.

764
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,976
The ability to make a bong
out of a taco bell cup

765
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,383
doesn't make you a whiz kid, Donny.

766
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,253
Leap year, motherfucker.

767
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,355
I think it's kind of a magical moment.

768
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,055
You know, Todd's oldest friend, Donny,
miraculously appearing like this.

769
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,119
What?

770
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,793
So I am graciously
going to step aside and allow Donny

771
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,792
to take over as the best man.

772
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,893
Give it up for Donny!

773
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,369
Oh! No; No,

774
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,031
Phil, you don't have to do that.

775
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,238
No music. No, no, no, no.

776
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,603
Kill the music. Phil, Phil, you...

777
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,404
That's so nice of you,
but you don't have to do that.

778
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,806
Oh, I don't mind. You two are very close.

779
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,181
We are. We are very close,
but you and I are close, too.

780
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,952
Well, we work together,
but I wouldn't call us close.

781
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,325
I mean, I was actually kind of surprised
when you asked me to be your best man.

782
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,019
Made me feel a little sorry for you.

783
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,756
That's true. He had no idea who he was.

784
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,059
No.

785
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,326
I accept. I do. I love it. It's an honor.

786
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,164
- Way to go, Donny!
- Are you kidding me?

787
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,227
You got Fenway park in your backyard?

788
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,534
I had that built
when my son started little league.

789
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,666
He never used it.

790
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,437
The little douche bag
just sat in his room listening to reggae.

791
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,043
Well, let's lose these ties
and hit some dingers.

792
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,545
What do you say? Come on!

793
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,376
No, no, no.
Please, don't let this be happening.

794
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,548
Don't let this be happening, please.

795
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,057
No sports.

796
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,883
All right, guys,
let's see what we got out there.

797
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,191
Please don't hit it to me. Please don't
hit it to me. Please don't hit it to me.

798
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,023
Get under it, kid.

799
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,330
Yeah!

800
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,295
Moron.

801
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,139
Here we go! Taking down two there!

802
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,241
All right, Gerald, kid! Here we go, guy!

803
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,803
Stay on it!

804
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,779
Oh. My God!

805
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,051
Grandma, what's up, honey?
Are you awake, sweetheart?

806
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,314
Here we go.

807
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,583
Get under it! Get dirty!

808
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,453
What the fuck?

809
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,054
- Got it.
- Nice catch, mama!

810
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,421
Let's let Todd-0 get this one, huh?

811
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,063
Oh, no, that's okay.

812
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,665
Todd, come on!

813
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,460
No, no. Hit one to that two-year-old.

814
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,968
He hasn't gotten one yet.

815
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,300
Here you go, big man.

816
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,974
- What?
- Quit showing off

817
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,806
for the girls, buddy. They're mine.

818
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,671
Come on, now.

819
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,448
You got it. You got it.

820
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,881
Okay, Todd, you all set, buddy?

821
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,184
Don't hit it to me.

822
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,349
Coming to you, homie.

823
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,156
Holy shit.

824
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,394
Oh, my God. Are you all right, guy?

825
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,869
Come on. You're fine.

826
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,506
Throw it in there, guy.

827
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,404
I think the ball's broken.

828
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,136
Throw it in, Todd.

829
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,374
Todd, throw the ball.

830
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,111
Come on, Todd!

831
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,117
Throw it, you big vagina. Do it.

832
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,015
Todd, we want to keep playing, buddy.

833
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,215
We need a ball, kid.

834
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,313
Just throw it.

835
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,414
Such a pussy.

836
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,750
On a rope!

837
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,091
Holy fuck!

838
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,326
We now return to the Donny berger story,
starring Ian ziering.

839
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,697
- Yo!
- Donny.

840
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,566
- I'm in a jacuzzi. Hang on one sec.
- Yeah.

841
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,802
Fucking... here.

842
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,241
- Who'll take the cigar?
- Oh, no.

843
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,367
- Donny.
- Keep that lit for me.

844
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,639
Take my fucking shades.

845
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,975
- Wear them if you want.
- Yeah!

846
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,208
All right. So, hang on.

847
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,272
I want to wear them.

848
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,476
I'll be back.

849
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:00,912
All right.

850
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:01,979
My goodness!

851
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,384
Yeah, what's going on?

852
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,225
Guess what's on TV?

853
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,190
Hey, there, little buddy.

854
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,921
I'm Mr. mitty.

855
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,960
I will always love you.

856
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,232
What is that, the Donny berger story?

857
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,294
Hell, yeah.

858
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,598
Don't you get money
every time that shit is shown?

859
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,767
This could be your "get
out of jail free" card.

860
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,842
Last check I got for that was 85 cents.

861
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,513
Is han solo gonna do
the show at the women's prison with you?

862
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,310
You know, I haven't
discussed any particulars with him yet.

863
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,355
I am actually just trying
to be a dad right now.

864
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,381
You're gonna go to prison on Tuesday.

865
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,323
You have got to get that money somehow.

866
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,220
Kenny, what the fuck?

867
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,887
I thought this was a bathroom!

868
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:42,987
Fuck you!

869
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,125
- Honk!
- Oh, nobody squeezes my titty

870
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,327
for free, honey!

871
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,097
Okay, good luck with that.

872
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,099
God, you're such an idiot!

873
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,232
Todd, you already messed up my flowers!

874
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,506
- I'm sorry.
- Just get the cake!

875
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,040
No walnuts! No fucking excuses!

876
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,540
I love you! Do you love me?

877
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,842
What?

878
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,715
"You screwed up my cake!"
"You screwed up my cake!"

879
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:07,949
What?

880
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,685
It's me, it's me. Can I come in?

881
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,124
- Yeah, sure.
- What's up, buddy?

882
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,129
What was she yelling at?
What'd you do wrong?

883
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,557
She's just stressed out
'cause of the wedding.

884
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,031
Oh, really?

885
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,569
You sure she's not stressed out
about maybe sex or something?

886
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,399
Have you been going down on her?

887
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,338
- What?
- No, I'm just saying,

888
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,466
a lot of times, girls
I've met over the years,

889
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,771
when they've been
ragging on me and yelling at me and shit,

890
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,279
if I kiss their pussies, they kind of go,

891
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,474
"you're right, you're a good guy."

892
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,979
Yeah, that's personal, Donny.

893
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,982
Yeah, no, no.
You know her better than me, fine.

894
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,813
So...

895
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,122
You wear a bathing suit in the shower?

896
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,926
- You know that's fucking nuts, right?
- Are you serious?

897
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,554
I can't even take my shirt off
in front of other people because of you.

898
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,026
Because of me. What did I do this time?

899
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,925
Let me jog your memory.

900
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,441
The new kids on the block!

901
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,868
Holy shit!

902
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,071
Their heads are all warped now!

903
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,580
Oh. My God!

904
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,843
Yeah, it's 'cause I got it
when I was in third grade.

905
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,009
My body grew.

906
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,178
I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine.
Let me see it again.

907
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,552
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh.

908
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,818
You got a back tattoo.

909
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,690
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh.

910
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,524
Their heads are fucking warped.

911
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,994
- You suck.
- Come on, dude.

912
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,259
Why you getting so serious?

913
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,459
I still got the tattoo I got when I was...

914
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,266
'When I was a teenager.
And I'm fine with it, you know.

915
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,933
"De plane! De plane!"

916
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,836
"De plane!"

917
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,873
Yeah, I remember it.
I still don't know who that is.

918
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,911
It's fucking...

919
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,178
"De plane, de plane" guy
from fantasy island.

920
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,275
Tattoo.

921
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,287
I got a tattoo of tattoo.
I thought that was funny.

922
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,748
Well, it's not.

923
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,353
Lighten up, dude. Come on.

924
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:50,824
- "De plane!"
- Don't. Donny, don't.

925
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,353
- I'm serious.
- "De plane!"

926
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,451
- No.
- You're still ticklish.

927
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,121
No, I'm not ticklish!

928
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,400
- Come on, now!
- The tickle monster.

929
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,698
- I tickle you like that.
- No.

930
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,897
Stop! No, stop it!

931
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,371
Watch yourself.

932
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,571
Stop it! Stop it, no!

933
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,871
Give me that, hansie.

934
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,840
Why is your dick in my face?

935
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,608
And why is it kind of hard?

936
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,216
What are you two homos doing?

937
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,017
Just rasslin'.

938
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:22,747
All right.

939
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,850
'Cause you're looking at an all-state
fucking wrestling champion,

940
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,155
and I got the winner.

941
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,625
Okay. Well, he won.

942
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,096
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. You won.

943
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,188
What? No, I didn't.

944
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,961
You're gonna love it, buddy. Wrestle him.

945
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,524
- Yeah, Chad.
- No, no.

946
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,032
It's actually a funny story.

947
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,230
We were having a tickle fight.

948
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,328
We weren't wrestling at all.

949
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,203
I was losing, admittedly.

950
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,869
Aw, God, I got to start doing
some crunches or something.

951
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,070
Look at this.

952
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,079
Oh, you don't like him?

953
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,682
Oh, we don't like you.

954
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,214
He's talking to his dick, buddy.

955
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,248
Now he's hitting it.

956
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,879
No! Why?

957
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,616
You got to puff that fucker up!

958
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,085
Oh, what? No.

959
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,129
You don't have to puff that fucker up.

960
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,390
Let's do this.

961
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,466
Chad, I'm sure you're
very athletic... okay!

962
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,694
Okay!

963
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,095
I tap out. You win, you win. I tap out.

964
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,638
Do you like fucking my sister, Todd?

965
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,701
I mean, do you like
sticking your dirty booger fingers in her?

966
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:15,867
Whoa, what was that?

967
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,571
Let's all just keep our heads, okay?

968
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,943
We've all been drinking a lot tonight.

969
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,014
I'm gonna skull-fuck you...

970
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,751
And that is the end of that.

971
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,156
What, you're mad at me?

972
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,558
How am I the fucking bad guy right now?

973
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,996
You're gonna fucking give me shit
with that tattoo on your back?

974
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,033
Look at that stupid fucking thing.

975
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,089
Good buddy, he'll be fine.

976
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,864
Yeah, so we got Chad
all tucked in, safe and sound.

977
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,971
I never heard of him
passing out drunk before.

978
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,199
Yeah, it was crazy. It was like,

979
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,504
one second, he was with us, totally awake.

980
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,273
Next thing you know, he's face down,

981
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,938
birds a-chirpin'.

982
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,307
What do you think?

983
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,010
You look amazing.

984
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,615
Oh, wait! Isn't it bad luck

985
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,451
for me to see the dress
before the wedding, though?

986
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,014
This is a $12,000 vera wang dress.

987
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,319
I'm gonna wear it whenever I want.

988
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,025
You'd look hot in a $12 wang chung dress.

989
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,323
That sounds like a line Donny would say.

990
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,728
Yeah, except he'd say,

991
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,998
"you'd look friggin' hot
in a wang dang sweet poontang dress."

992
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,269
Just think he's, like,
trailer park-y or something, you know?

993
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,997
- Yeah.
- That's probably why his son ran off.

994
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,639
His what? What? Who? His son about...

995
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,470
What'd he say?
What did you hear? Did he say something?

996
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,413
Just look at the first page of that book
he's been handing out to everyone.

997
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,108
He has? What? No.

998
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,048
Head in the class?

999
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:35,017
He said it's like head of the class,
only with blowjobs.

1000
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,053
It's gross.

1001
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,123
Yeah, it's gross. Blowjobs are gross.

1002
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,321
We don't do those.

1003
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,898
"Dear Jamie,
I know you'll make Todd very happy"

1004
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,455
"if you bleach your little brown eye."

1005
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,330
Oh, no, not this part.

1006
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,343
Wow, that's sad.

1007
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,713
That weirdly got me.

1008
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,983
I don't know why it got
me, but it just got me.

1009
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,754
Can I get a hug right now, or...

1010
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,155
No, no, no, no! We can't wrinkle the dress.

1011
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,161
Hey, if you don't want
to wrinkle the dress,

1012
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,096
may I suggest we just remove it?

1013
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,493
Did you take two Xanax?

1014
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,933
I actually took three Xanax.

1015
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,198
And you know that the Xanax makes me.

1016
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,634
"H" to the "o" to the "r"
to the "n" to the "y."

1017
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,767
So horny for my fiancée.

1018
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,504
No! Down.

1019
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,404
I don't want to have sex
with my family in the house.

1020
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,704
No, I know.

1021
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,149
I don't want to have sex
with your family, either.

1022
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,480
In the house.

1023
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,316
Came out weird.

1024
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,784
Possibly my last night of
spanking the hell out of it

1025
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,520
without having a roommate
watching me, so...

1026
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,419
What do we got to work with here?

1027
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,258
Rich people magazines.

1028
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,373
Let's see what we got.

1029
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,072
If I hadn't partied with her husband
so many times, I would.

1030
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,977
But it's disrespectful to him.

1031
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,349
I don't know.

1032
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,444
Hello.

1033
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,986
Jeezum crow, you really were a model,
weren't you, grandma?

1034
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:23,495
Yeah, old Mr. woolworth really, really knew
how to pick them, didn't he?

1035
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,329
I love that old-time bathing suit.

1036
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,270
I could take you
to the speakeasy, and we could,

1037
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,599
we could do the naked Charleston.

1038
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,370
I have to ship out in the
morning to fight the Nazis,

1039
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,381
so you better give me
something to remember.

1040
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,509
What's that?

1041
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,308
Oh, my God.

1042
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,288
Old lady grandma wants to
get in on the action, too.

1043
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,387
Should we let her?

1044
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,723
I think we should.

1045
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,427
Oh, my God.

1046
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,623
Why do I like her better right now?

1047
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,330
Oh, you bad... What
have you done to me?

1048
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,234
What have you done to me?

1049
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,336
We got to go for round two,
but give me a little bit of time.

1050
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,977
Give me a little bit of time.

1051
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,713
Oh, lovely.

1052
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,685
Just lovely.

1053
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,354
Goodness.

1054
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,896
Oh, my word.

1055
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,000
Best man, wedding rehearsal in an hour.

1056
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,046
There's so many tissues.

1057
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,614
Oh, God. You know,
don't touch those, okay? Let's...

1058
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,220
Okay.

1059
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,913
I'm gonna just clean that up.

1060
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,451
Yeah, Donny's sick.

1061
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,756
You don't want to touch these
'cause you'll get sick.

1062
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,019
He's got post-nasal drip, so...

1063
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,638
The tissue's stuck to my picture.

1064
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:11,900
Here, let me.

1065
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,240
I'll grab that from you. I got it.

1066
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,006
Oh, look at that!
There's a little tissue beard there.

1067
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,208
No, don't touch it, please.
Don't worry about it.

1068
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,750
Oh, that poor dear.

1069
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,178
I'll just get him some nice, fresh juice.

1070
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,111
Juice. That's a great idea.

1071
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,713
Thank you, grandma d. Thanks.

1072
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,760
You know, hon,
if he's really under the weather,

1073
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:36,093
maybe it's best
if he doesn't masturbate so much.

1074
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,962
That's good advice.

1075
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,592
I'll tell him that, thank you.

1076
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,974
Okay, you can stop
pretending to sleep, sir jizz-a-lot.

1077
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,970
The old broad knew I was whacking to
her the whole time, didn't she?

1078
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,336
That's so funny.

1079
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,747
But your improves were awesome.
"Post-nasal dick," or whatever you said.

1080
00:47:55,973 --> 00:48:00,217
You know, I can't believe
your balls produce that much stuff.

1081
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,315
Dude, at least I got balls.

1082
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,819
What's that supposed to mean?

1083
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:08,156
Let me just crack open
some happiness first, yeah.

1084
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,856
All I'm saying is the Chad thing,

1085
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,662
when that dude came at you last night,

1086
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,925
you kind of, like,
looked like a deer in headlights.

1087
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,272
Your whole aura is
actually that of a pussy.

1088
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,534
Or a kiss-ass.

1089
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:20,939
It is not.

1090
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,034
It is, too.

1091
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,269
What the fuck am I doing?

1092
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,645
No, I'm just saying
you got to stand up for yourself

1093
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,979
every once in a while, buddy,
or she's never gonna bang you.

1094
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,911
I'll have you know, she
bangs me all the time.

1095
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,622
All right? She bangs.

1096
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,758
Does she live the LA vida loca, too, or...

1097
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,582
Very funny.

1098
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,356
Well, good day, everyone.

1099
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,526
Father.

1100
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,866
Father McNally, thank you so much
for coming out to the cape.

1101
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,060
My honor.

1102
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,197
Very cool.

1103
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,262
Oh, yes.

1104
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:53,967
Chad.

1105
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,570
You'll excuse me, won't you?

1106
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,210
While you're in this church,
you'll show the proper respect.

1107
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,605
No e-mailing, no texting,

1108
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,247
no face-booking,
no sky-ping and no angry birds.

1109
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,220
That one hurts.

1110
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,857
No, no. I get it.

1111
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,817
It's the 2010s.

1112
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,162
Everyone's having sex and drinking lattes.

1113
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:16,921
No, father.

1114
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,031
But, you see, this is my world.

1115
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,028
We'll abide by my rules while we're here.

1116
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,308
Maybe we should start
with the father of the groom.

1117
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,544
His father passed away.

1118
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,475
He died in an explosion.

1119
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,285
Sounds fishy, but it really happened.

1120
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,753
I'm truly sorry to hear that, son.

1121
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,217
Thank you, but it's fine.

1122
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:46,884
He deserved it.

1123
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:50,029
So... What is that
supposed to mean?

1124
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,298
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it.

1125
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,495
He just, you know, wasn't a great dad.

1126
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,746
So your father, he abused you, did he?

1127
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,714
No, nothing like that.

1128
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,211
Was he a murderer? Rapist?

1129
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,254
No. Father, I'm sorry, I...

1130
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:18,259
My father beat me every day with a rake.

1131
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:23,160
But you don't hear me smack-talking him
like some baby little princess.

1132
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,995
Not here in the House of the lord.

1133
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,137
You know, I can't hear
a word you're saying.

1134
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,345
All I can focus on is your shit breath.

1135
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,852
I'd like to show you the
garden for a minute.

1136
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,460
Now, then.

1137
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:02,865
Okay, you know what? Let's just...

1138
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:09,867
Fucking old guy's got

1139
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,276
- a Cannon on him.
- What happened?

1140
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,336
What happened
is I think he's having a mini-meltdown.

1141
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,580
- Yeah, he's taking his shirt off now.
- Oh, my God.

1142
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,086
And he's pretty ripped for an old fuck,
so we're in trouble right now.

1143
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,782
What is going on here?

1144
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,083
All right, all right.

1145
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,180
Go time, go time.

1146
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,316
No, think about what you're doing!

1147
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,620
Be careful.

1148
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,391
He bit me!

1149
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,823
Did you see that? That was amazing!

1150
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,954
This could get ugly.

1151
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,159
The father actually
killed a guy in the ring.

1152
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,530
That's why he became a priest.

1153
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:35,734
Just keep your hands up, kid!

1154
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:36,827
Get 'em down!

1155
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,372
Hang in there, guy!

1156
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,470
He keeps punching him!

1157
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,871
Come on, guy.

1158
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,839
That's my boy!

1159
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,816
Why, you came right back
with your own shit. Nice, kid.

1160
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,611
What the fuck is that?

1161
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,748
Okay, he's going to
a whole other place right now.

1162
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,289
You know what? Maybe just run.

1163
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,456
Get the fuck out of here.
Go, go, go, go, go.

1164
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,256
No.

1165
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,126
I'm not gonna run.

1166
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,702
Finish him, father McNally!

1167
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,135
Finish him!

1168
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,813
Geez. He went down
like a sack of potatoes, huh?

1169
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,054
What is the matter with you?

1170
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,560
You know, we've known
father McNally for 30 years.

1171
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,120
- Thirty years! Thirty years.
- Thirty years.

1172
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,557
I ought to rip off your head!

1173
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,090
Gerald!

1174
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,397
I'm sorry.

1175
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,098
Sorry's not gonna keep you
from burning in hell, Todd.

1176
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,931
Hey, this is all my fault.

1177
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,839
I shouldn't have hit the
guy with the bottle.

1178
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,275
I'm, like, a moron over here.

1179
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,468
No, now, Donny,
I will not let you take the blame for this.

1180
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,742
You had to do it. You saved his life again.

1181
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,048
And you looked very sexy doing it.

1182
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,219
Why was the sound of
that bottle so familiar?

1183
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,220
Todd is such a loser.

1184
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:03,952
Here comes your girl. Here we go.

1185
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,819
Jame, I'm sorry, but, look,

1186
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,418
you got to admit,
I stood up for myself back there.

1187
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,756
Do you have fucking rocks
in your head, Todd?

1188
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,254
No.

1189
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,322
Well, where are we gonna get married now?

1190
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,766
We got kicked out of the church!

1191
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,029
Jame...

1192
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,564
What is everybody's problem?

1193
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,401
You were awesome out there.
You kicked ass.

1194
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,236
- You should be proud of yourself.
- Proud of myself?

1195
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:21,870
For what?

1196
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,412
I got my ass kicked,
and everyone's pissed off at me.

1197
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,879
And, by the way,
thanks for the fatherly advice, guy.

1198
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,245
That's the last time I listen to you.

1199
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,047
- I'm gonna choke him out!
- He's an asshole!

1200
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,486
I'm gonna choke him out.

1201
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,048
I'm just gonna choke him out.

1202
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:39,453
Hey, guys, guys?

1203
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,258
Can I just say
something before we all turn on Todd?

1204
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,063
Churches freak the kid out,

1205
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,998
ever since his father's funeral.

1206
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,769
After the explosion,

1207
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:55,674
all that was left of his dad was, like,
a kneecap and a little bit of nut sack.

1208
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,676
It was supposed to be a closed casket,

1209
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,943
but there was a foul-up at the mortuary,

1210
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,007
and he actually saw a squirrel

1211
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,180
run into the coffin and kind of

1212
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,456
squeak out of there with his
dad's ball bag in his mouth.

1213
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,584
You know, that's gonna
fuck any of us up, so...

1214
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,188
So you actually knew Todd's father?

1215
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,088
Of course I knew the guy.

1216
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,962
He was handsome, he had fucking great hair,

1217
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,130
a jedi with the chicks.

1218
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,839
Went down on girls for a wicked
long time 'cause he was a giver

1219
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,430
and he wanted to see others be happy.

1220
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,736
I wish I could have met him.

1221
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,339
Sounds like a gentleman.

1222
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,443
Was he there enough for the kid?

1223
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,778
No, maybe not. But,

1224
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,519
you know, he probably felt bad about it.

1225
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,788
You know, and there's nothing
he can do about it now, so...

1226
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:43,950
Toddsy.

1227
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,125
Oh, Todd.

1228
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,627
I had no idea.

1229
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,323
Poor thing. Are you okay?

1230
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,387
Yeah, yeah.

1231
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,688
It's fine, but

1232
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,066
sometimes I do still have nightmares.

1233
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,158
Oh, boy.

1234
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,929
That squirrel and its demonic eyes.

1235
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,306
Tiny piece of skin flapping in its mouth.

1236
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,243
One lone scraggly hair.

1237
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,670
A pubic hair.

1238
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,208
I mean, maybe this is
a blessing, though, guys.

1239
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,309
Do we really want
father mcnutty to be the one

1240
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,411
who brings these two guys together?

1241
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,750
I mean, I don't think so.

1242
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,251
I'm pretty tied into the church crowd.

1243
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,191
Rageaholics anonymous and whatnot.

1244
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,626
I could find a priest for you.

1245
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:21,992
I mean, what type are we looking for?

1246
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,392
Maybe a younger guy.

1247
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,454
Younger guy.

1248
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:25,625
How about a black guy?

1249
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,324
Now, I like that.

1250
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,267
It's very urban, very street.

1251
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:30,593
Okay.

1252
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,797
But that still doesn't get us a church.

1253
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:36,805
Well, I'll tell you where I would tie
the knot if I was these two sexy kids.

1254
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,883
Donny, this is just such a great idea.

1255
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,386
- Thanks.
- Don't you love the pergola?

1256
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,649
They're gorgeous!

1257
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,590
You know what, maybe a little
more girly shit up on the arch.

1258
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,784
You know, you're right.

1259
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,852
Excuse me, sir,
put some more girly shit up there.

1260
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,158
Calling all ladies!

1261
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,199
The bus for the bachelorette party is here!
Come on!

1262
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,266
Honey, you guys have fun
at the bachelor party!

1263
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,528
Okay.

1264
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,299
Don't get too crazy. Know your limits.

1265
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,200
- Okay.
- We're having a bachelor party?

1266
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,535
That's, like, my thing, man.

1267
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,672
Hookers, blow, balloons filled with piss.

1268
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,772
I mean, the sky's the limit, kid.

1269
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,879
No, no, no. Donny, we're all set.

1270
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,749
I have arranged
a very special evening for us tonight.

1271
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,679
This is gonna be awesome!

1272
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,855
I read about this place
in Oprah's magazine.

1273
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,002
I don't know if she writes
the articles herself,

1274
00:56:27,003 --> 00:56:29,090
but there's some real
good stuff in it.

1275
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,632
Hi, we're for the Todd
Peterson party, please.

1276
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,992
Good evening, gentlemen.

1277
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,793
Mrs. Ravensdale.

1278
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,303
Phil, what a blessing.

1279
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:41,137
Welcome to your bachelor party package
here at he time spa for men.

1280
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,004
Woo-hoo, motherfucker!

1281
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,205
Okay. All right.

1282
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,509
We're gonna set you up
with some nice plush robes,

1283
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,641
and then we have
a wonderful full evening planned

1284
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,913
with massage, facial and nail treatments,

1285
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,548
and then we're going to send you home

1286
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:59,390
with a special gift
of our house-made lavender scrub.

1287
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,130
Confucius say,
"what the fuck are you talking about?"

1288
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:04,923
No, Donny,

1289
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,457
Phil thought
it would be nice before the wedding

1290
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,061
for us to all take a little time
to just chill and mellow.

1291
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,204
My wife and I have been
burning it on both ends all week

1292
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,742
with the preschool applications,

1293
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,573
and I am ready to be pampered!

1294
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,480
All right, all right. Now we're talking.

1295
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,449
Hey, thanks, honey.
What the fuck's your name?

1296
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,917
- Jessica. All right.
- Yeah.

1297
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,248
Hey, come on. Here's to the kid.

1298
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,313
He's fucking getting all fucked up tonight!

1299
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,414
Last night!

1300
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,824
Fucking last night of
poontang for this kid.

1301
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,122
What the fuck is this?

1302
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,866
It's water infused with cucumber,
rose petal and harvest sandalwood.

1303
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,642
It tastes like fucking
dick infused with balls.

1304
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,440
And a side of fucking rod Stewart's jizz.

1305
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:57,041
Wait a minute. What are we drinking water
at a fucking bachelor party for, Phil?

1306
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,720
You got to show my son your tits later.

1307
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,154
Promise me. Promise me.

1308
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,061
That's nice. Yeah, good.

1309
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,895
This is great, sweetheart.

1310
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,590
Really good.

1311
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,326
Nice work. You're going deep on us, huh?

1312
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,068
That's it.

1313
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:16,862
What's this, sir?

1314
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:21,272
That's just a little tip, you know,
if you give me a full package.

1315
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:24,473
Okay. That's a $150 additional charge.

1316
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,645
You're talking to the wrong guy.

1317
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:27,841
That's a little out of my price range.

1318
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,748
It includes scalp treatment, reflexology.

1319
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,684
How much is it to tickle my pickle?

1320
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:36,247
To yank my crank?
To give me a ho-Jo to go?

1321
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,453
Sweetheart, I'm not asking
for a finger up the ass.

1322
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,792
I just want you to just
jerk it a little bit.

1323
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,664
Donny, this isn't a brothel.

1324
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:49,026
Then I'm completely confused
what the fuck we're doing here right now!

1325
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,533
So, what, you're just going to
get a hand job in front of all of us?

1326
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:53,232
I don't know. Am I?

1327
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,609
I guess not!

1328
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,104
You know, I have worked
very hard on this night, don,

1329
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:02,379
and you're being just plain rude.

1330
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,877
- Phil, no! Phil!
- No, no. Don't do this.

1331
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,021
Nice. That's nice.

1332
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,485
That's good. That's good.

1333
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:15,691
It tickles.

1334
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,527
Just fight through it, man. It's worth it.

1335
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:20,227
If you stop, I swear I will kill you.

1336
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,973
You know what,
if I don't see a tit in five minutes,

1337
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,339
I'm going to strangle this motherfucker.

1338
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:33,339
You should be ashamed of yourself
for fucking arranging this bullshit!

1339
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,373
Well, I feel very relaxed,

1340
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,714
and I think this was
a good use of a groupon.

1341
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,544
You fucked us, buddy!

1342
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,747
Five more minutes till you
get to choose amongst four

1343
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,156
artisanal house-blended
chocolates, gentlemen.

1344
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:48,653
We can't let tonight end like this, boys.

1345
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:49,788
We got to go out.

1346
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,025
I'm telling you, I can't
let my son have a...

1347
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,796
My son of a gun best friend
have his bachelor party be this.

1348
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,970
You fucking... you guys got your
face covered in leprechaun shit.

1349
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,301
We should be getting whacked off,

1350
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,366
all of us, as a fucking team!

1351
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:07,171
Donny, I think
we've had enough excitement for one night.

1352
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,483
Besides, it's not like you can throw
together a whole other party this late.

1353
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:14,578
I could have six chicks making out
with each other on our laps in 10 minutes.

1354
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:16,823
I could stay out a little later.

1355
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,448
Bam!

1356
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,589
We gonna get our dicks sucked.

1357
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:23,555
There it is.

1358
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:26,156
Unless, Mrs. Ravensdale,
you want to whip them knockers out?

1359
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,257
We'd love to see them.

1360
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,425
All right, you know what?

1361
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,529
You are an imbecilic,
immature, asinine, childish,

1362
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:34,131
caveman-like, hairy-knuckled,
single-chromosomal,

1363
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,700
obnoxious, uneducated, ignorant asshole

1364
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,542
who I would like to fuck hard and long!

1365
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,348
So, I'm going to go put a dent in that.

1366
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,009
You guys get that green jizz off your face.

1367
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,144
I'll be back in 20.

1368
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:46,612
We're going out, boys!

1369
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:48,884
Hey, this is the shit,
this place, I'm telling you.

1370
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,289
The hottest chicks, the
best Denver omelets.

1371
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:52,519
- You have to eat one.
- All right.

1372
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,583
Donny!

1373
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:54,584
Yeah, this is who I
was telling you about!

1374
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,187
- What's up? Give me that.
- I'm so happy to see you.

1375
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,095
- You look so fucking cute!
- I know, right?

1376
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:02,096
And you brought a military man.

1377
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,728
What's your name, soldier?

1378
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,430
Chad Martin, private first class,
United States marine corps.

1379
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:09,904
You think you can keep that dick
at attention for a couple hours?

1380
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,104
That's an order!

1381
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,306
Already on it.

1382
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,275
Look at my man!

1383
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,648
You guys, let me get in here
and introduce myself.

1384
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,880
Hello. I'm Phil.
I'm married with four children,

1385
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,890
and I have actually
only seen three vaginae in my entire life:

1386
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,152
My wife's, my baby's

1387
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:27,354
and my aunt's once by accident
on the back of a tandem bike.

1388
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,956
Well, here's number four, baby!

1389
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,458
I'm going to count that
as numbers four and five.

1390
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,717
Champale would like to dedicate this

1391
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,987
to Mr. Todd Peterson.

1392
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,253
- Yeah, baby. Yeah.
- Here you go.

1393
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,790
Oh, hey.

1394
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:05,958
Do you want any eggs?

1395
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,332
No. I really have to watch what I eat.

1396
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,029
No fatty foods. But thank you.

1397
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,500
I'm brie.

1398
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,972
I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.

1399
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,908
I know who you are, han solo.

1400
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:18,507
No, you can't...

1401
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,343
Don't worry, your secret's safe.

1402
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,338
Who did that?

1403
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,911
- Gerald, get in the car.
- I love you, Donny!

1404
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,041
Yeah, I love you. Get in there.

1405
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,550
Man, you got to give me the recipe, man.

1406
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,177
Can't buy everything, Spirou!

1407
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:33,812
Bro, but they use olive oil, not butter.

1408
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:34,947
That's the big secret.

1409
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,319
Okay, Chris, get him in there.

1410
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,689
Be gentle, he's protecting our country.

1411
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:39,851
All right, good night, guys!

1412
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,994
Gerald, you're a sick man, buddy!

1413
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,427
Whoa.

1414
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,626
Hey, what... where's everybody going?

1415
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,260
I sent them home, guy.

1416
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,430
I thought we could have a little

1417
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,202
best man/groom alone time.

1418
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,972
But shouldn't I go with them?

1419
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:57,875
'Cause Jamie's gonna get mad at me.

1420
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,406
Easy, guy.

1421
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:03,611
You're gonna have plenty of time for her
to be mad at you when you're married.

1422
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,155
I got you a wedding gift, and I want
to give it to you alone, all right?

1423
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:09,281
You got me a gift?

1424
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:10,653
Of course I got you.

1425
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:13,216
And I think you might dig it.

1426
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,356
An earring.

1427
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:24,202
Yeah, I know, but that's an earring
that your mom gave me,

1428
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,706
and I thought maybe we could
keep it in the family, you know?

1429
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:30,040
Just kind of keep it going,
generation to generation, actually.

1430
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,311
Yeah, but I don't have
a pierced ear, Donny.

1431
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:36,344
Yeah.

1432
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:38,711
No.

1433
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,548
Yeah.

1434
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:44,785
All right, fuck it, fuck it.

1435
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,053
Do it, just do it.

1436
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:47,718
It's not gonna hurt, buddy.

1437
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:49,058
You got a nice buzz going.

1438
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,426
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

1439
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:51,726
Hang on.

1440
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,261
Yeah.

1441
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:54,357
Liquor it up.

1442
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:55,732
Fuck!

1443
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,135
Come here. Come here.

1444
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,237
Hang in there! Go ahead,
just sit still, homie.

1445
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,705
Yeah!

1446
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,809
How we doing?

1447
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,204
Oh, God.

1448
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,182
That's it. That's the way to man up.

1449
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,448
- That wasn't so bad.
- Let me see it.

1450
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,646
Am I bleeding?

1451
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:17,886
- I don't think so.
- No?

1452
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:19,588
Does it look good?

1453
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:22,424
You look like you could be playing
drums for foreigner or some shit.

1454
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,589
You look like a bad-ass.

1455
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,422
- Really?
- Yeah.

1456
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,931
'Cause it makes me feel kind of...

1457
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,131
Dangerous.

1458
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,568
There he is, man!

1459
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,371
That's your personality,
like when you were seven years old,

1460
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:39,709
me and Uncle vanny used to
laugh our asses off from you.

1461
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,145
Uncle vanny, that's right.

1462
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:43,946
What happened to that guy?

1463
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,553
Dude, you know what it's time for?

1464
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,753
To get you back together with the old gang.

1465
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,287
Come on.

1466
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,362
I just hope the guy will talk to me.

1467
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:55,921
Phil!

1468
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,192
Come on, you're gonna get arrested, buddy.

1469
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,958
I shouldn't be doing this.

1470
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,599
No, don't stop, don't stop.

1471
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,881
All right, look.
I came here to tell you I'm sorry

1472
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,421
about what happened
with me and your mother.

1473
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,788
It was an accident,
and it will never happen again.

1474
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,459
That's all I've been waiting for
all these years, man, a simple apology.

1475
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:30,725
It's water under the bridge.

1476
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,164
Don't sweat it. Holla.

1477
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,400
Wait, are you vanilla ice?

1478
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,869
Was Uncle vanny vanilla
ice this whole time?

1479
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:40,200
'Who did you think I was?

1480
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:43,608
I don't know, a friend of my dad's
that wore a lot of parachute pants?

1481
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,504
Man.

1482
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,172
I want to be honest with you, too.

1483
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,006
I never did knock boots with your mother.

1484
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:51,510
- No?
- No.

1485
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,178
I think she whacked me
off outside the pants.

1486
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,414
- No.
- But I didn't finish.

1487
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,185
- Vanny, I didn't finish. I couldn't.
- Yeah?

1488
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,154
- Mom.
- Yeah.

1489
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,489
You know, she did like to fuck.

1490
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,020
That's fucking... look at him.

1491
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,792
Back to it. Fuck, yeah.

1492
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,499
Hey, han solo, you're looking great, man.

1493
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:06,590
Thank you.

1494
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:07,964
- You lost some weight.
- Is this kid all right?

1495
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,833
- You're not a little fat kid no more.
- No, no, no.

1496
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,030
- Remember this one?
- No, no.

1497
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,664
Yeah, we used to do this
to you all the time.

1498
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,469
- Remember, back in the day?
- Hey, nugget pocket.

1499
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,339
- Nugget pockets.
- No, I'm not a nugget pocket.

1500
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,276
- What's up, nugget pocket?
- No.

1501
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,109
No, but seriously, iceberg,

1502
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,910
me and my boy got a
little head start on you,

1503
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,611
but you got any desire
to get wasted with us?

1504
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:26,449
More than life itself.

1505
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,955
In fact, I might have
a little head start on you guys.

1506
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:31,448
What?

1507
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,051
- Yeah.
- It's so illegal.

1508
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,192
I don't want to do that in front of my kid.

1509
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,129
Turn around for a minute. Just turn around.

1510
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,866
Give me that fucking shit.

1511
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,600
What?

1512
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,534
Hey, let's get out of here.

1513
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:46,767
I did not do that.

1514
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,740
- Let's go have some fun.
- Hey!

1515
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,135
Hey, where you think you're going,
Mr. vanilla ice cream?

1516
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:52,741
I'm going out for the night, man.

1517
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,749
Hell no, man! You know I don't know
how to fry no damn chicken nuggets!

1518
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:56,875
It's Todd Bridges.

1519
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,475
Yeah, yeah, watch this.

1520
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,043
What you talking 'bout, Willis?

1521
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,620
You come back and say that to my face,

1522
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,350
you fake white rapping motherfucker!

1523
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:04,854
Todd, seriously, though, you look great.

1524
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,587
How's Mr. drummond doing, huh?

1525
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,120
Mister... fuck you!

1526
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,562
"Mr. drummond. Mister..."

1527
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,163
Man, I... what you want?

1528
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,326
Bowl of chili nuggets.

1529
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,391
A what?

1530
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,529
You know, that shit ain't on the menu, man!

1531
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,768
Shit, it is. Damn it.

1532
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,909
Fucking skate! Just fucking skate!

1533
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:25,979
The berger boys are here!

1534
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,708
Come on, look out! Look out, now!

1535
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,942
What the fuck?

1536
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,181
Hey! Give me my hat back!

1537
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,988
- Do it, do it!
- Give it back!

1538
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:43,864
Hey, it's a fucking lovely night, ain't it?

1539
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,091
Oh. My God!

1540
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,166
You fucking assholes!

1541
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:56,737
Go, go!

1542
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:01,573
What the... go!

1543
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:03,377
Go, go, go!

1544
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,077
What the fuck? Get out of here!

1545
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,912
Holy shit!

1546
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,721
You know, they seem like fun guys.

1547
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,819
We're all gonna dive! Let's go!

1548
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,090
What are you doing?

1549
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:27,904
Oh. My God!

1550
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,103
I didn't... I didn't spill my beer!

1551
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,509
I fucking love it.

1552
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,642
- Fuck!
- You fucking hard-ons!

1553
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,323
"You fucking hard-ons."

1554
01:09:58,728 --> 01:09:59,900
Fucking...

1555
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,167
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no!

1556
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,437
You don't fucking do
that, you fucking idiot!

1557
01:10:07,438 --> 01:10:08,939
Yeah!

1558
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:11,849
Look at this, fuck face. Look at this.

1559
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,212
What the fuck?

1560
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:15,812
Come on.

1561
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,789
- You fucking guy. I say, take it.
- I can't.

1562
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,915
- Just go, go, go, go, go.
- No, wait, wait.

1563
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,255
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

1564
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,626
I changed my mind. I'm scared.
I don't want to do it.

1565
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,062
- Oh, man.
- I can't do it.

1566
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,932
You're rubbing your underwear.

1567
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,064
What is that? Why are you doing that?

1568
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,032
I suppose I'm the reason.

1569
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,704
Yeah. Yeah. Remember in first grade

1570
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,298
when you were supposed
to pick me up after school,

1571
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:35,842
you left me waiting for five hours?

1572
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,378
I had detention myself, guy.

1573
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,970
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

1574
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,749
- Yeah, well, I shit in my pants.
- All right.

1575
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,125
Then I had to walk all
the way home alone.

1576
01:10:44,126 --> 01:10:45,445
All right.

1577
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:46,612
With shit in my pants.

1578
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,689
Dude, I promise you,
I'll never forget you again.

1579
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:51,156
I swear to God.

1580
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:52,283
Throw the fucking things away.

1581
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,383
- Don't fuck with me.
- Throw them away.

1582
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:58,695
Throw them away. Throw them away.

1583
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,631
Get rid of the fucking underwear,
you don't need that.

1584
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:01,997
You're better than that, guy.

1585
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,960
Okay, fuck it. Okay, fuck it.

1586
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,101
Squeeze it out and fucking... yeah.

1587
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:10,770
You're a good kid.

1588
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,609
Come on, fucking hit this thing
and let's get it rocking.

1589
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,411
- All right. All right?
- Here we go.

1590
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,075
- Come on. Push, push. I got you.
- Okay.

1591
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,777
- I'm not good at it.
- All right.

1592
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,115
It's balance, it's just balance.

1593
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:21,746
You got this, kid. You're an athlete.

1594
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,757
You got it. No, it's in you, buddy.

1595
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:24,848
- Straight.
- I don't know how.

1596
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:26,086
I got you. I ain't gonna let you fall.

1597
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,821
- Don't let me go.
- I won't let you fall.

1598
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:29,123
- Don't let go.
- All right, I'm still with you.

1599
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:30,186
- Okay.
- I'm still with you.

1600
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,391
Let's pick up some speed, though.
I'm with you, guy.

1601
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,763
I'm with you. I'm with you.

1602
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:34,961
- I'm not letting go.
- Don't let me go.

1603
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,197
I'm not letting go. I'm with you, my boy.

1604
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:38,795
- Wait...
- I'm with you, my boy!

1605
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,307
- Yeah, that's all you!
- I'm doing it!

1606
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,666
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, baby!
- I'm doing it!

1607
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,536
Oh. My God!

1608
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,374
Are you... Kid, are you...

1609
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,783
Are you all right, buddy?

1610
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,147
Sorry.

1611
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,121
- Dude, I'm trying to make love to my wife!
- What the fuck?

1612
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,953
- No!
- Fucking naked people.

1613
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,617
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1614
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,025
Oh, my God, they're chasing me!

1615
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,357
What the fuck? Get off him!

1616
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:03,619
Go!

1617
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:04,926
- Oh, my God! Look out!
- Go!

1618
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,100
Keep going, guy!

1619
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,636
Donny!

1620
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:12,800
- Yeah!
- You're the best.

1621
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,102
- You are, Jay.
- Good luck!

1622
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,608
I like your fucking hairdo!

1623
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,144
Good luck with the taxi business!

1624
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,202
- Love that guy.
- Classic. Classic.

1625
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,743
Classic.

1626
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,248
It's a classic night.

1627
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,945
No way! Party's not over!

1628
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,719
Come on!

1629
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,992
Dude, Uncle vanny's fucked up.

1630
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,593
I love you, son.

1631
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,259
I do.

1632
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:42,631
I've always loved you, all right?

1633
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:46,100
Sorry to spring that on you like that.

1634
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,530
It's all right.

1635
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,667
It's cool, Donny. That's nice, thank you.

1636
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:51,143
Hansie, hansie.

1637
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:55,909
Why don't you not call me
"Donny" when no one's around.

1638
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,507
You can call me "dad."

1639
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,151
Yeah, I know, I know.

1640
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,415
It's...

1641
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,917
I don't know if I'm ready for that, Donny.

1642
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,323
- You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

1643
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,153
No prob.

1644
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:23,903
Sorry.

1645
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,974
Sorry if you fucking don't like me.

1646
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,454
I probably would've fucked my teacher, too.

1647
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,957
Yeah.

1648
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,758
But...

1649
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:54,541
So, what time are we gonna
go to the prison tomorrow?

1650
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:58,136
Wait, you'll go to the prison?

1651
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,374
Yeah, I'll go.

1652
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,679
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1653
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,242
That's... they canceled that.

1654
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:12,350
I talked to the warden, and he says
that your mother was just pulling our leg.

1655
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,223
She's only got the chicken pox.

1656
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,989
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

1657
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:18,963
She said she was dying because

1658
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,831
they give you better food
if you're wicked sick like that,

1659
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:26,203
like beefaroni or microwave pizza
or some shit, so...

1660
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,300
That just made me hungry.

1661
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,502
Well, check your pockets.

1662
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,451
A treasure!

1663
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:40,977
Come on, eat it.

1664
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,613
- No, it's nasty.
- Come on, I'm telling you.

1665
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,680
Fucking Todd Bridges
worked hard on that thing.

1666
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:46,488
Yeah. You like that.

1667
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:47,619
Pretty good.

1668
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,487
Look at me, I'm a fountain!

1669
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:52,965
Throw a penny in here!

1670
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:55,024
Make a wish, motherfucker!

1671
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,584
What the...

1672
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,246
Grandma d, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

1673
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,583
Well, you've had the fantasy,

1674
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:22,622
so now it's time that
you try the real thing.

1675
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,131
No, no, no, I can't do that.

1676
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,534
I'm sorry.

1677
01:15:30,593 --> 01:15:32,197
I appreciate the offer.

1678
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,841
No, no, no, don't.

1679
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:37,377
I can't. Don't you... I shouldn't.

1680
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:41,577
Oh, God.

1681
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,715
You got the old-timey bathing suit on.

1682
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,884
Okay, I'm in.

1683
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:53,722
I'm going to ride you like a model T.

1684
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,368
Yeah.

1685
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,236
Jamie.

1686
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:16,149
You're wearing your dress again.

1687
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,284
You look beautiful.

1688
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,948
I want you so bad.

1689
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,213
Be nice to me.

1690
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,489
Make me feel good.

1691
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,162
All right, all right.

1692
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:36,766
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1693
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:51,351
Oh. My God!

1694
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,912
Help me!

1695
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,144
What happened?

1696
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,245
Are you okay?

1697
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,283
Do I sound okay?

1698
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,083
You puked all over my wedding dress!

1699
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,558
Prepare to get fucked up, motherfuckers!

1700
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,561
Sorry, I heard you scream.

1701
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,466
I thought Jamie was getting murdered,

1702
01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:11,436
so I was gonna fucking
smack someone around.

1703
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:13,464
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1704
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,332
I just found my wedding dress
covered in barf!

1705
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:19,675
And something else, something sticky.

1706
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,223
It's jizz.

1707
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:43,967
You puked on my dress and then fucked it!

1708
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:47,874
You're a madman.

1709
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,671
No, no, no, no. No.

1710
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,603
- Sweetheart, it wasn't my boy.
- You shut up.

1711
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,737
Donny, just shut up!

1712
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,144
Who wants a piece of this, huh?

1713
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,944
- Who wants a piece?
- Whoa, no, no, no!

1714
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:57,175
It's okay, buddy.

1715
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,946
Todd just fucked the dress.

1716
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,479
It's under control.

1717
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,351
What is vanilla ice doing in our room?

1718
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,792
He's my other best friend.

1719
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,619
Yeah. And a wicked good rapper.

1720
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,392
Give it up for him. Come on, now.

1721
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,824
- Let's give it up.
- My boy.

1722
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,091
I don't know what's going on here,

1723
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,636
but I don't have time to
deal with this, so...

1724
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,266
Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

1725
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,330
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I'm gonna go to pilates.

1726
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,342
You're gonna take that dress
to the dry cleaners!

1727
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,139
And then we're gonna have
rehearsal dinner tonight,

1728
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,146
and you're gonna be
the normal Todd from three days ago, right?

1729
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,815
And you can start by taking out
that stupid Duran Duran earring!

1730
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,483
I was thinking it's more foreigner.

1731
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,885
No? No, no,
Duran Duran's a good call, though.

1732
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,355
Guess I'm gonna go
finish up with grandma delores.

1733
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:42,486
- Yeah.
- Is that all right?

1734
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,621
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have fun, buddy. Have fun.

1735
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:44,823
Not too much, though. Don't hurt her.

1736
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,298
No, no. I get it right and keep it tight.

1737
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:47,766
Okay.

1738
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,826
Look, I need a couple hours to fix this.

1739
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:54,397
Hey, we've all been in that situation,
and you'll be fine, kid.

1740
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:57,142
I'll whip up some pancakes
for everyone else, all right?

1741
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,542
- All right.
- I love it.

1742
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,571
You jizzed on a mannequin.

1743
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:03,878
Respect it.

1744
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:07,848
But you were only 13.

1745
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:09,947
She took advantage of you.

1746
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:12,583
No, all right.
That's what the law says, su-Jin,

1747
01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:15,421
but I don't know...
We were kind of like soul mates.

1748
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,157
You know, there was...
There was a connection there.

1749
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,721
I never had it with anyone else.

1750
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,995
I'm getting a call. I'm sorry, guys.

1751
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:23,058
Do not touch these plates.
I'm cleaning them.

1752
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,126
Okay, su-Jin?

1753
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,264
Go for Donny B.

1754
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,039
'Wassup!

1755
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:31,171
Hey, big man. What's going on?

1756
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,234
How'd it go with the lady?

1757
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:33,803
You patch things up?

1758
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,705
Yeah, pretty much. It was amazing.

1759
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:39,617
The dry cleaner said they've
definitely seen that combo of fluid before.

1760
01:19:39,675 --> 01:19:42,747
You see? Yeah, those things
go together like gin and tonic.

1761
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:45,153
Hey, listen, while I got you,

1762
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:47,524
I left you a little
best man gift on your dresser.

1763
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:48,823
I think you'll get a kick out of it.

1764
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,461
You did not. Oh, my God.

1765
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,592
My whole body, like,
got a shocked feeling over that.

1766
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,135
Buddy, no one gets me a gift.

1767
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:58,327
- Where are you, anyways?
- I'm in the car.

1768
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:00,304
I decided to go see mom after all.

1769
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,433
You did what?

1770
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,343
Oh, my God. Dukes of Hazzard!

1771
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,326
Hansie.

1772
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,094
Donny, what are you doing here?

1773
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:28,725
We got to get out of here now.

1774
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,332
What? What are you talking about?

1775
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:31,837
It's your wedding weekend, dude.

1776
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:32,895
You come here after the wedding.

1777
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,201
You show your mother your new ring.

1778
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:35,640
That would make her happy.

1779
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,740
Wait, are you nervous to see her?

1780
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:41,641
Hansie, can we just blow this place off
and have a beer, please? I'm begging you.

1781
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:42,807
Look. Is that her?

1782
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,773
Oh, my God.

1783
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,871
There you are.

1784
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:19,548
My little hansie, you're all grown up.

1785
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,312
Hi, mom.

1786
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:23,418
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

1787
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:25,483
I know. I'm sorry I stopped visiting.

1788
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,548
It just got too hard.

1789
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,822
No, I totally understand.

1790
01:21:29,952 --> 01:21:31,295
Wow.

1791
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:32,692
You still have my eyes.

1792
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,129
Is that the earring that I gave
you after the lover-boy concert?

1793
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:43,400
Yes, it is, miss mcgarricle.

1794
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:46,442
You know, I think about you every day.

1795
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,482
Fuck, I love you so much, miss mcgarricle.
I never stopped.

1796
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,843
I love you, too.

1797
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:54,580
Do you remember...

1798
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:56,178
Oh, God, here we go.

1799
01:21:56,678 --> 01:22:00,717
All the nasty things
that I taught you, Donny?

1800
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course I do, miss mcgarricle.

1801
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,793
Are you still my dirty boy?

1802
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:12,672
Yeah, I'm the dirtiest boy
you'll ever know, miss mcgarricle.

1803
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,634
Donny.

1804
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:17,806
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1805
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,842
I'm hard right now. I'm hard.

1806
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:29,617
Okay. Yeah, I'm hating that, so...

1807
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:33,153
But it is really good to see you, mom. I...

1808
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:34,387
It's good to see you, too, baby.

1809
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:37,993
Can you describe
what you're feeling right now, han?

1810
01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:39,991
TV's Randall Morgan?

1811
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,201
What are you doing here?

1812
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:45,295
Must be quite emotional
for you to be face-to-face

1813
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,806
with the woman
who molested your father, isn't it?

1814
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,406
- What is going on right now?
- Who is this dude?

1815
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,376
Listen, before you get mad at me...

1816
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,107
This is why you came to see me?

1817
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,313
For some reality TV ambush?

1818
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,180
- No.
- How much they paying you, Donny?

1819
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,877
Nothing, I swear to God. I'm not getting...

1820
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:03,388
Fifty thousand dollars
to deliver you to this prison.

1821
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:06,249
All right, it was 50 grand, but I'm not...
I'm not...

1822
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,884
I'm not going to do it. I swear to God.

1823
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,428
I'm not... I would never take his money.

1824
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,690
Donny berger, what have you done?

1825
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,397
Hansie, dude, it's me.

1826
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,028
It's the guy from last night.

1827
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,432
We had fun. Don't fuck it.

1828
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:16,594
I'm telling you, this is...

1829
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,728
This is something that can be fixed.

1830
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:19,367
- You're unreal.
- Hansie.

1831
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:21,430
What...

1832
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,999
You go after him, Donny,
and you take care of our son.

1833
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,176
- Hansie.
- Come on, he is pissed. Fuck!

1834
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,641
- Take care of our baby, Donny!
- Hansie!

1835
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,882
Hansie, please, let me explain to you...

1836
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,817
I can't believe I let you
back into my life again.

1837
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:36,185
Guy, guy, just come on. Listen to me.

1838
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:38,388
I owe the IRS a lot of money.

1839
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,688
- Of course you do.
- I know, I know. I'm a fuck-up.

1840
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,958
But if I don't give them 43 g's by Tuesday,
I'm going to prison.

1841
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:46,027
Wait, so you're telling me,

1842
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:48,398
if I give you 43 grand,
you don't have to go to jail?

1843
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:51,638
I will pay you back, I swear to God.

1844
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,104
Would you loan me the money?

1845
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:54,899
No! Fuck you!

1846
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,000
- Get your shit out of my boss's house!
- Okay!

1847
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,341
No! Don't do that.

1848
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,381
That's my boy there.

1849
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:04,611
No.

1850
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:06,414
I think he just shit his pants.

1851
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:08,148
Tell me you got that on camera.

1852
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,390
You made me throw out my extra underwear!

1853
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:13,654
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were going to shit yourself again.

1854
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,691
That was awesome.
That was awesome.

1855
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:19,294
Donny, couldn't have gone any better.
Loved it.

1856
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,095
You know what I need from you, Todd,
is I need you

1857
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,465
- to sign the release form right...
- Fuck you!

1858
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:25,396
Get away from me!

1859
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,962
Get those cameras off me!

1860
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:31,471
I hate you, dad.

1861
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,780
Hansie!

1862
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:40,679
I can't pay you a dime
unless I got a release form.

1863
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:42,888
Fuck.

1864
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:44,514
Did I get any shit on me?

1865
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:16,049
Let me off here. Let me off.
Let me get off. I'll fucking run up.

1866
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:17,584
Keep it running.

1867
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,023
I got to pick my shit up.

1868
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,203
You're so adorable.

1869
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:44,446
No, I know, but I told you
not to call me on this line.

1870
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,008
What if Todd picks up?

1871
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:50,649
No, no, no, I want to.

1872
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:53,720
No, Steve.

1873
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:55,386
Todd doesn't know anything.

1874
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,087
I don't care if he finds
out after the wedding.

1875
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:59,563
There's nothing he can do
about it then anyway.

1876
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,167
You're so sweet.

1877
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:03,862
Steve, huh?

1878
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,463
Well, Steve Spirou, I'm
going to fuck you up.

1879
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:12,269
I'm going to fuck you up!

1880
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,007
Well, I got some great news.

1881
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:19,616
I've made my decision
on who my new partner is.

1882
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:23,253
Phil!

1883
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,257
Phil, I knew you could do it.

1884
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:26,792
Look at Phil's face.

1885
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,294
I'm just busting your balls, Phil.

1886
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,024
No, I'd never pick you.

1887
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:32,326
Oh, no.

1888
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,923
It's you, Todd. Partners.

1889
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:37,362
Partner.

1890
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:38,426
Oh, my gosh.

1891
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,803
It's going to be a lot more hours
and a lot more responsibility.

1892
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,068
You know that, right?

1893
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,474
And a lot more money!

1894
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,011
- Somebody's going shopping!
- Yeah!

1895
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:53,315
I thought he left.

1896
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,082
Yeah, that's what you wish, Steve.

1897
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,180
I need to talk to you, homeboy. Yeah.

1898
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:58,280
Hey, Jamie.

1899
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,017
Listen. Listen.

1900
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,925
Dude, this is not about
you and me, all right?

1901
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:04,987
You're not marrying the right girl.

1902
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,157
She is cheating on you.

1903
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,098
You are unbelievable.

1904
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:09,226
Can't you just let it go?

1905
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,599
This is my last chance to be normal.

1906
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:11,933
Are you determined to ruin my life?

1907
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:14,402
- Honey, what's going on?
- Nothing.

1908
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:16,840
Don't "honey" him,
you little snake in the grass.

1909
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:18,700
I heard your phone call.

1910
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:21,714
"Steve, why'd you call on this line?"

1911
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,181
"Todd could have picked up."

1912
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,475
That's right, Sonny boy.

1913
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,416
Your wife-to-be's fucking your boss.

1914
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:27,778
Right there.

1915
01:27:28,143 --> 01:27:29,247
Fuck you, buddy.

1916
01:27:29,511 --> 01:27:31,388
You are an idiot!

1917
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:32,584
Is that right, sweetheart?

1918
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,092
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah, yeah. Why?

1919
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:36,527
I was on the phone with Steve.

1920
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:40,858
Steve Goldstein,
the Boston herald wedding reporter.

1921
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:44,136
Yeah, he's doing a piece on
the most beautiful places to get married,

1922
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:46,695
and I didn't want Todd to know
because he doesn't like being in the paper.

1923
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:49,901
So, I am sorry
that I wanted everyone in the world

1924
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:51,966
to know I married the perfect guy.

1925
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:56,209
Honey, do you think you can forgive me
for keeping such a big secret from you?

1926
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:02,220
Okay, due to this newfound evidence,

1927
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:06,158
the conclusion might be
that I'm an asshole.

1928
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,285
Bye.

1929
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,955
Fine.

1930
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,158
Have a good wedding.

1931
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:16,859
I'll leave with pride.

1932
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:18,768
I'm a good person.

1933
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,135
Bye! I'll see you tomorrow!

1934
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:29,538
Wow, what a stressful day, huh?

1935
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:30,773
Can't wait to get back
to the beach house.

1936
01:28:30,774 --> 01:28:31,575
Thank you.

1937
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,619
- Bye.
- Just the two of us, you know?

1938
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:36,286
No, honey.
I'm staying in the city tonight, remember?

1939
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,184
- What? No.
- Yeah, the bride and groom,

1940
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,522
they're supposed to sleep separate
night before the wedding.

1941
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:41,822
So see you tomorrow, big guy.

1942
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:43,760
I'm going to drop Jamie
at the Fairmont copley.

1943
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,922
Mom and dad,
you guys got the hedgehog. Okay!

1944
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:47,291
- Love you.
- Watch the door.

1945
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,130
- Love you. Okay.
- Sleep well.

1946
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,266
Wait, but don't they not have a car?

1947
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,204
All right, Donny, go.
There's your chance. Go.

1948
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:01,178
I ain't got no more chances, buddy.

1949
01:29:01,236 --> 01:29:02,943
The kid hates my guts.

1950
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:04,808
Right? 'Cause you guys don't have a car.

1951
01:29:04,873 --> 01:29:06,409
I'm not talking about him, Donny.

1952
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,713
- Wake up, man.
- What?

1953
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:11,215
Jamie's the gatekeeper for your son.

1954
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,926
- Yeah?
- Win her over, then she'll convince han

1955
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,287
to give you another chance. Boom!

1956
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:21,692
How am I ever going to get her trust?
She freaking hates me.

1957
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,636
Donny, you want to know
what all women love?

1958
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:27,038
Ice cream.

1959
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,015
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

1960
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,417
No, you're not. You're Donny berger.

1961
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,386
You fucked your teacher
in the seventh grade.

1962
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,421
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

1963
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:49,189
Hi, Mr. Peterson. What can I do for you?

1964
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:51,564
What room was my fiancée in again?

1965
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:53,962
Let me check. 641.

1966
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:55,528
You're a fucking stud.

1967
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,304
Hey, when the legendary
Donny berger comes in here

1968
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,431
using a fake name, you go with it!

1969
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,032
All right, I will.

1970
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,842
641. 641.

1971
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,976
All right, come on, sweetheart.

1972
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,951
Oh, yeah!

1973
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,349
What, did Todd come out here?

1974
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,222
You're half the size of Todd

1975
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,989
but you use it so much better!

1976
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:25,190
I guess not.

1977
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,323
Oh. My God!

1978
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:27,866
Oh, my God.

1979
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,299
Oh. My God!

1980
01:30:29,357 --> 01:30:31,064
Oh, my God.

1981
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,730
Fucking shit!

1982
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:35,103
Fucking shit.

1983
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:36,233
Fucking shit!

1984
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:37,332
Fucking shit.

1985
01:30:39,234 --> 01:30:40,611
Yeah. Okay.

1986
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:42,912
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1987
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:06,838
Okay.

1988
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:11,239
Yeah!

1989
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,837
You do not deserve these treats.

1990
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,441
Are you finished, sweetheart?

1991
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:19,411
Oh, my God.

1992
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,947
Your fiancé's at home, you know.

1993
01:31:23,378 --> 01:31:25,016
This really gets me upset.

1994
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:26,490
You know why?

1995
01:31:26,548 --> 01:31:28,186
'Cause he's too good for you.

1996
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,423
He is.

1997
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,432
And you're sitting here
gallivanting with...

1998
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,559
I think I know who.

1999
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:39,161
Don't I, Mr. Steve Goldstein?

2000
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:46,775
Wait. Are you...

2001
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:48,978
What am I seeing?

2002
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,977
No... it...

2003
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:53,377
With each other?

2004
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:56,551
Am I... this is...

2005
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:02,491
Is he your stepbrother at least

2006
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,791
or adopted or something?

2007
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,356
No reply... So it's real.

2008
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:09,663
Oh, my God.

2009
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:11,169
Donny, Donny, you don't...

2010
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:12,636
You don't understand what's going on here.

2011
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:16,073
I don't think Charlie sheen
would understand what's going on here.

2012
01:32:16,397 --> 01:32:20,174
Look, I love Todd,
and we're going to get married,

2013
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:22,043
and we're going to have
a great life together.

2014
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:25,777
And yes, I've had sex with Chad
from time to time.

2015
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,482
It's what good-looking people do.

2016
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,648
They have sex with
other good-looking people.

2017
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:32,549
You know? Just so happens that

2018
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:36,255
this one particular good-looking person
is my little brother.

2019
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:37,921
Okay.

2020
01:32:37,986 --> 01:32:39,897
It's all making sense to me now.

2021
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,766
I know that sounded bad, but, Donny,
this was going to be the last time.

2022
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,101
I would never carry on
with a married woman.

2023
01:32:48,363 --> 01:32:50,866
I've got better morals than that, Donny.

2024
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,338
Chad, adultery is bad,

2025
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:00,981
but incest is fucked up!

2026
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:06,083
Please don't let him tell mommy
about our secret tickle time.

2027
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,123
"Secret tickle time"?

2028
01:33:08,182 --> 01:33:10,253
You got a name for it?

2029
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:15,732
And with a United States
military man, no less.

2030
01:33:16,057 --> 01:33:18,594
You are a disgrace to that uniform!

2031
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,105
No, he's not a marine.

2032
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:21,469
He buys those uniforms on ebay

2033
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:24,066
so dad doesn't find out
he's a modern jazz dancer.

2034
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:25,537
What?

2035
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,137
That's possibly worse
than the incest thing.

2036
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:31,082
This is an abomination. I'm telling Todd.

2037
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:33,449
- No, he won't believe you.
- Yeah, he will.

2038
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:36,712
No, he bought that Steve Goldstein story.

2039
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:39,924
Come on, you think he got
that partnership on his own?

2040
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:41,358
With that "beep boop beep" shit?

2041
01:33:41,416 --> 01:33:42,451
No, I gave him a boost.

2042
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,356
How many people have you fucked?

2043
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:48,058
Well, maybe he'll believe this.

2044
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:53,303
Nice. Save.

2045
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:56,799
You two have fun together.

2046
01:33:57,432 --> 01:33:58,604
Sickies.

2047
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,145
All right, how much?

2048
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:01,874
I'm going to be a very rich woman.

2049
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:03,472
I can write you a big fat check.

2050
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,749
What's it going to take
for this to go away?

2051
01:34:06,174 --> 01:34:09,621
Todd has to pop a Xanax
when he loses a contact lens.

2052
01:34:10,545 --> 01:34:12,991
What do you think he's going to do
when he finds out about this?

2053
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,457
Todd's happy...

2054
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:17,359
You really want to take that away?

2055
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:38,912
Hey, buddy.

2056
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,620
I got something to tell you, and...

2057
01:34:43,745 --> 01:34:46,021
I'm not expecting you
to believe this, but...

2058
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:49,718
I got the money.

2059
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:51,057
That's great, Donny.

2060
01:34:51,419 --> 01:34:53,023
Your son came through for you, didn't he?

2061
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:57,135
Yeah. His fiancée gave me $50,000

2062
01:34:57,191 --> 01:35:00,604
to keep quiet about her
having sex with her brother.

2063
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:02,299
Yeah, I've been there.

2064
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,670
We've all been there.

2065
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,679
She said it was her last time, so...

2066
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:09,075
Maybe things will work out.

2067
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:11,976
Then how come I feel like shit right now?

2068
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:14,445
Yeah, it's kind of a moral thicket.

2069
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,052
But the good news is

2070
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:18,681
you stay out of the slammer, right, Donny?

2071
01:35:20,248 --> 01:35:21,420
Donny?

2072
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:34,997
"Go do something."

2073
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:40,011
I don't know, Mr. mitty.
I don't know if I can fucking handle it.

2074
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:44,315
"Be a good person."

2075
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:47,474
Donny?

2076
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:56,293
- No, no, don't hit me.
- No, no.

2077
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,126
Just give me a moment, please, Todd.
Just a moment. Relax.

2078
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,791
You know, after praying with the monsignor,

2079
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:06,534
I realize that I committed the sin
of prideful anger in the church,

2080
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:09,868
and I hope that you'll accept my apology

2081
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:13,640
and allow me the honor
of being a part of this joyous day.

2082
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:15,908
Well, what about father Shakalu?

2083
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:18,949
Stupid bird.

2084
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:20,451
Come on, fly!

2085
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:23,055
Well, he's cool.

2086
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:25,456
Great. Sounds good.

2087
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:28,289
By the way, Todd

2088
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,127
was it you that hit me in the head
with the bottle?

2089
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:33,657
No.

2090
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:36,125
Well, then, who, then?

2091
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:38,595
It was Chad.

2092
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,737
Interesting.

2093
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,400
Two, three, four.

2094
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,602
Fosse, and fosse,

2095
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:46,802
- and fosse.
- Interesting.

2096
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,816
Yo! Donny berger! All right!

2097
01:36:50,872 --> 01:36:54,081
I'd sign something for you, buddy,
but I got no time right now.

2098
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,484
Ice!

2099
01:36:55,543 --> 01:36:57,045
Ice, you in there, buddy? I need you!

2100
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,018
You still got the 5.0?

2101
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,694
What does that mean? Is that a yes or no?
I don't understand the pose.

2102
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:06,595
Yeah? Let's go, let's go!

2103
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,342
Go. Baby, go!

2104
01:37:52,733 --> 01:37:53,905
No!

2105
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:20,665
Look at this fucking guy!

2106
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:23,698
Man!

2107
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,916
No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck!
We're stuck!

2108
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:41,085
To hell with the 5.0.
Let's run for it, man.

2109
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:43,389
- But we need great tunes!
- Come on, let's get them!

2110
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:45,797
Right here, I got a walkman.

2111
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:47,161
- The walkman!
- Yeah, baby.

2112
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,325
Let's go!

2113
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:55,373
- Damn it, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

2114
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:56,533
Oh. My God!

2115
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:00,835
Hey!

2116
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:13,391
You forgot to pay!

2117
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:16,857
So, Jamie, do you promise
to provide Todd here

2118
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:20,364
with unending empathy,
encouragement and honesty,

2119
01:39:21,222 --> 01:39:22,428
till death do you part?

2120
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,027
I do.

2121
01:39:28,396 --> 01:39:30,171
Hey, Donny. Come on!

2122
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:38,515
What are you doing, guy?

2123
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:40,408
You jumped?

2124
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:42,317
There was a door right here!

2125
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:44,378
Come on, we got to get there!

2126
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:48,485
And you, Todd, do you promise to love,

2127
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:52,258
honor and protect this special lady
for the rest of your life?

2128
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:56,661
Don't answer that question!

2129
01:40:02,563 --> 01:40:03,735
Oh, shit.

2130
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:10,144
We ran well over a mile.

2131
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,021
I object to these two getting married.

2132
01:40:26,887 --> 01:40:30,198
No, we're past that part already.

2133
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:32,231
What are my options, then?

2134
01:40:32,293 --> 01:40:33,328
How about leaving?

2135
01:40:33,461 --> 01:40:36,135
You shut the hell up, you satanic hose-bag!

2136
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:37,398
Hey!

2137
01:40:37,465 --> 01:40:39,877
Gerald! I'm sorry it sounded so harsh,

2138
01:40:39,934 --> 01:40:42,312
but you'll understand
why I said that in a few minutes.

2139
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:43,746
There ain't gonna be a few minutes,

2140
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:45,477
- you goddamn son of a bitch!
- Calm down!

2141
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:46,643
Calm down!

2142
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:49,778
Let the boy talk.

2143
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,686
I can't let you marry this chick.

2144
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:53,047
I can't believe you're doing this.

2145
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:54,616
Listen to me, buddy.

2146
01:40:55,116 --> 01:40:56,857
You don't love this girl.

2147
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:59,158
I'm telling you. I had
love, it's different.

2148
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,893
It's a different feeling.

2149
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:02,826
Love is like...

2150
01:41:03,591 --> 01:41:06,333
It just leads you to a special connection.

2151
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:09,931
It's full of, like,
feelings of awesomeness.

2152
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:13,034
And the feelings you...

2153
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,670
That wrap around you.

2154
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:17,273
It's deep in your stomach.

2155
01:41:17,338 --> 01:41:19,511
It's in your head.
It's in your fucking nut sack.

2156
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:22,177
It's in your dick when it gets hard.

2157
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:23,722
There's still love at the tip.

2158
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,754
And it fucking sprinkles out

2159
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:29,653
like morning dew
shooting all over the grass.

2160
01:41:30,151 --> 01:41:32,427
Okay, I've had just about enough of this.

2161
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:35,056
Phil, sit down before I tell your wife
what you did at the strip club.

2162
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:36,293
Okay.

2163
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,438
Son, I'm sorry, I just...
I can't let you marry this skank.

2164
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:43,697
"Son?"

2165
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:45,610
- Your son?
- Son?

2166
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,243
What is he talking about?

2167
01:41:47,701 --> 01:41:50,580
Honey? You can tell me.

2168
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:53,078
I'll forgive you.

2169
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:56,314
That's what love's about, right?
Forgiveness.

2170
01:41:57,745 --> 01:41:59,122
All right, fine.

2171
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:02,952
Donny's not my best friend.

2172
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:04,757
He's my father.

2173
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:06,254
Oh'

2174
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:09,130
my parents didn't die in an explosion.

2175
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:10,794
I lied because I'm the product of

2176
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:13,566
an inappropriate
teacher-student relationship.

2177
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:15,834
Teacher-student relationship?

2178
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:18,875
Do you know how gross that sounds?

2179
01:42:18,933 --> 01:42:19,934
You're disgusting!

2180
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,208
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

2181
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:24,346
She can still cancel that check, Donny!

2182
01:42:24,505 --> 01:42:25,506
Chad.

2183
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:27,013
Cancel what check?

2184
01:42:27,074 --> 01:42:28,075
I don't...

2185
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,782
She gave me 50 grand
to keep my mouth shut.

2186
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,955
Fifty grand? Jamie.

2187
01:42:34,014 --> 01:42:36,756
Yeah, it was... I was gonna hold on to it,

2188
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:38,854
you know, to get me out of jail, but...

2189
01:42:39,753 --> 01:42:41,562
Yeah, yeah. That's what I think of that.

2190
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:43,363
That's how much I hate this fucking whore.

2191
01:42:43,424 --> 01:42:45,267
Wait. Keep your mouth shut about what?

2192
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:46,464
Todd, don't listen to him.

2193
01:42:46,694 --> 01:42:48,469
He's a liar and he's crazy!

2194
01:42:48,529 --> 01:42:50,531
Father McNally, please continue.
I promise to do

2195
01:42:50,598 --> 01:42:52,305
all that shit you mentioned
and so does Todd, right?

2196
01:42:52,366 --> 01:42:53,936
Wait, what is going on?

2197
01:42:54,001 --> 01:42:55,036
Tell him.

2198
01:42:56,437 --> 01:42:58,314
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell him, don't tell him.

2199
01:42:58,572 --> 01:43:00,848
You tell him or I'll tell everybody here.
It's up to you.

2200
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:08,249
Come on.

2201
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:23,374
Okay. Well, that's not that bad.

2202
01:43:23,631 --> 01:43:26,771
What? You didn't tell him,
you fucking lying piece of shit!

2203
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:29,440
Get on it now or I'll fucking crush you!

2204
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:30,538
No.

2205
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:34,051
Jame, you can tell me.

2206
01:43:34,108 --> 01:43:35,746
I mean, how bad could it be?

2207
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:00,368
What?

2208
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:01,845
Okay, she told him.

2209
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:05,307
What?

2210
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:12,353
You fuck your brother?

2211
01:44:12,646 --> 01:44:14,216
Oh. My God!

2212
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:18,390
Fucking white people.

2213
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,925
I'm not looking so bad now, am I, dad?

2214
01:44:24,658 --> 01:44:25,966
I'm out of here.

2215
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:28,632
Mom, she started all this.

2216
01:44:28,696 --> 01:44:31,108
I didn't want to. I'm still
your little soldier, I...

2217
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:33,437
- Fuck!
- Take that uniform off.

2218
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,377
You're insulting us all.

2219
01:44:35,436 --> 01:44:37,143
No, no, no. Don't you see?

2220
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:39,173
It's gonna be even better now.

2221
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,817
You're a mess, I'm a mess.

2222
01:44:42,142 --> 01:44:44,952
Come on. Doc Shakalu, get your ass up here!

2223
01:44:45,012 --> 01:44:46,719
I got to be part of this shit?

2224
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:47,950
Todd?

2225
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:49,692
Please.

2226
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:58,434
Come on, baby. Come on,
Todd, let's do this.

2227
01:44:58,492 --> 01:44:59,527
Yeah, yeah.

2228
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:02,703
No! Let's not do this.

2229
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,438
Okay?

2230
01:45:04,898 --> 01:45:08,505
And for the record,
my name's not Todd Peterson.

2231
01:45:09,002 --> 01:45:10,913
It's han solo.

2232
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:14,942
Named after the man who made
the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.

2233
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:18,114
And I am a berger, like
my father before me.

2234
01:45:18,379 --> 01:45:20,882
Also, I want to tell everyone here
that I've got a pretty huge.

2235
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:22,985
New kids on the block tattoo on my back.

2236
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,291
The heads are warped,
but fuck you guys, it's funny.

2237
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:27,159
It is fucking hilarious.

2238
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:28,389
And Steve?

2239
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:32,360
Nothing personal, man, but I quit!

2240
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:35,070
No, no. Come on, Todd, don't be like that.

2241
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:38,036
We quit, too.

2242
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:39,168
Fuck you!

2243
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:40,772
Good call, han solo,

2244
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:42,973
'cause your fiancée banged him, too.

2245
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,037
What?

2246
01:45:44,104 --> 01:45:46,015
I didn't know
about the brother thing, though.

2247
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:48,451
I am as sickened as you, believe me.

2248
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,284
You know what? It's all right, Steve.

2249
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:51,482
'Cause guess what?

2250
01:45:51,545 --> 01:45:54,082
Donny and vanilla ice fucked your mom!

2251
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:57,420
Vanilla ice banged grandma?

2252
01:45:57,484 --> 01:45:59,794
That's fucking awesome!

2253
01:46:02,456 --> 01:46:03,935
Donny, look out!

2254
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,936
Word to your mother, brotherfucker!

2255
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:12,610
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to hit a chick,

2256
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:14,509
but I got to tell you, it felt good.

2257
01:46:14,568 --> 01:46:16,172
I mean, I wouldn't do it again,

2258
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:18,477
but with this psycho, you know,
it was warranted.

2259
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:20,143
Donny! I'm gonna kill you!

2260
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:25,446
At ease, bitch.

2261
01:46:25,512 --> 01:46:28,049
Dude! That's it! Nice!

2262
01:46:28,115 --> 01:46:29,287
Hang on, though. Hang on.

2263
01:46:29,349 --> 01:46:30,794
No, don't hurt me.

2264
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:36,557
Even Steven.

2265
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,627
Father, take off the collar.

2266
01:46:40,461 --> 01:46:42,634
That's right. You're not meant for this.

2267
01:46:43,831 --> 01:46:45,208
- Well...
- Yeah.

2268
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:46,909
Nicely done.

2269
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:48,412
All right, come on.

2270
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:50,277
Let's get out of here, dad.

2271
01:46:51,472 --> 01:46:53,884
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

2272
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:55,978
My son called me "dad!"

2273
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:57,918
He called me "dad!"

2274
01:46:57,978 --> 01:47:00,424
That's right!
The berger boys are back, bitches!

2275
01:47:00,481 --> 01:47:03,788
Wassup? Wassup?

2276
01:47:04,051 --> 01:47:05,655
Wassup...

2277
01:47:13,827 --> 01:47:15,033
Shut up.

2278
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,405
His boss and her brother?

2279
01:47:17,464 --> 01:47:19,068
It sounds like a Rodney dangerfield joke,

2280
01:47:19,132 --> 01:47:21,134
but it actually happened to my boy here!

2281
01:47:21,535 --> 01:47:24,106
Now we got to find han solo
one of them new girls.

2282
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:26,117
One that don't care about
all that money he make.

2283
01:47:26,173 --> 01:47:28,619
- No, no.
- Yeah, like a girl version

2284
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:30,780
- of Todd Bridges would be perfect.
- That's right!

2285
01:47:30,844 --> 01:47:32,187
Female version of me. That's right.

2286
01:47:32,246 --> 01:47:35,090
Well, you know, I actually might be
doing okay in that department, so...

2287
01:47:35,349 --> 01:47:36,384
What's that?

2288
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,622
What the fuck... what the heck?

2289
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:40,665
Todd and brie, sitting in a tree.

2290
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:43,401
I have balls down to my knee!

2291
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:45,928
- What?
- He said it! Yeah!

2292
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:48,066
- Donny!
- Yeah, buddy?

2293
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:50,966
You're my best friend. I'm gonna miss you.

2294
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:53,678
I know, I know.

2295
01:47:53,734 --> 01:47:54,804
But there's good news.

2296
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:56,939
You know what,
miss mcgarricle gets out in three years,

2297
01:47:57,004 --> 01:48:00,417
so the timing's kind of perfect
for us to start our lives together.

2298
01:48:00,674 --> 01:48:01,914
Dad, let me just give you the money.

2299
01:48:02,175 --> 01:48:03,984
No. No. I'm not gonna do that.

2300
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:08,015
It's time for Donny berger
to take responsibility for his screw-ups.

2301
01:48:08,348 --> 01:48:10,885
I made my bed, now I got to lie in it.

2302
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:13,153
Donny! Donny! Are you watching?

2303
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:14,858
Turn on the TV! Turn it on!

2304
01:48:15,122 --> 01:48:18,831
There he is, the fat guy we've been
talking about all day, tubby tuke,

2305
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:22,465
actually gaining on the Ethiopians
here in the final stretch.

2306
01:48:22,529 --> 01:48:24,805
Is this the fat guy I put the money on?

2307
01:48:24,865 --> 01:48:26,811
Twenty bucks at 8,000-to-1.

2308
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:29,539
- A hundred and sixty grand?
- A hundred and sixty grand?

2309
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:31,105
Come on, you fat shit, move it!

2310
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:32,774
Go, tubby! Go, tubby!

2311
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,675
Keep running! Keep running!

2312
01:48:35,609 --> 01:48:37,350
Pass those Ethiopians!

2313
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:39,749
Pass them skinny fucking Ethiopians!

2314
01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:44,955
This defies every law of science,
but it's happening!

2315
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:51,497
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!

2316
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,832
He's up! He's up! He's up!

2317
01:48:58,799 --> 01:49:00,085
That'll replenish him!
That'll replenish him!

2318
01:49:00,086 --> 01:49:01,370
No!

2319
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,015
Listen to the roar of that crowd.

2320
01:49:04,071 --> 01:49:07,449
Fat guy! Fat guy! Fat guy!
Fat guy!

2321
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:09,211
Can he possibly win it?

2322
01:49:09,443 --> 01:49:10,478
He's gonna do it!
