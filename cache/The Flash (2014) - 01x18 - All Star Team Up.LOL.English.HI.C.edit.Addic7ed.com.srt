1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,403
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,067
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:08,069
by something impossible.

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:09,440
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,413
My father went to prison for her murder.

6
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:16,365
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,802
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:21,709
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:23,879
and find others like me.

10
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,482
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,483
Mom!

12
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,652
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,855
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:33,092
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:35,762
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

16
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:37,999
Same. Well, as fast as I can run.

17
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:41,610
(Ray) Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism... A.T.O.M.

18
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:42,812
What are you gonna use it for?

19
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:44,214
To protect the people of this city.

20
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:46,519
You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?

21
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:47,823
(West) I don't know yet.

22
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,427
But I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

23
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,830
(Barry) The way that he described running...

24
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,701
feeling the wind and the power...

25
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:58,007
it's like he was talking from experience.

26
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,647
Harrison Wells is The Reverse-Flash.

27
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,017
[dramatic music]

28
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:05,156
Eddie, we need your help.

Pedal to the metal.

32
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:20,762
(female dispatcher)
We've got a 10-31 in progress.

33
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,098
Shiny Diamond, 18th and Olive.

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,570
That's only a few blocks from here.

35
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:25,773
Has every crook in Central City gone crazy?

36
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,778
This is the third attempted
robbery tonight.

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,684
Barry. We got another one.

38
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,595
Hello.

39
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,531
18th and Olive.

40
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:38,999
Got it.

41
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,168
Who's this?

42
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,974
Oh. Indecent exposure. Powell Park.

43
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:46,576
That ain't something
you should be showing people.

44
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,752
They're getting away, guys.

45
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:54,154
They're not getting away, Eddie.

46
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,994
Let's get these bozos up ahead of us first,

47
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,962
and then we'll worry about
the idiots at the Shiny Diamond.

48
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:59,197
All right.

49
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,567
We're gonna run out of room, though.

50
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,072
I'll take care of that.

51
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:05,577
What do you think he meant by that?

52
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:11,721
Oh. That's what he meant.

53
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:16,801
I think we lost them.

54
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,572
Oh, no, you didn't.

55
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:22,877
And by the way, you're under arrest.

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,578
[chuckles]

57
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:28,786
We need to go. Now. Come on!

58
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:29,687
[alarm wailing]

59
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:33,125
Uh-uh. Freeze.

60
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:34,528
You guys missing these?

61
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,799
(Thawne) On the ground. On the ground.

62
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,671
So, uh, I'm just curious, but...

63
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:42,843
have you guys not heard of me, or what?

64
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:46,014
[laughs]

65
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:49,186
Nice work, detective.

66
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,827
- Good night, Dr. Kang.
- Good night.

67
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:58,896
[lock beeps]

68
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:04,802
[bee buzzing]

00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:07,005
[engine turns over]

[bees buzzing]

00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,482
[dramatic music]

72
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,683
[yelps] Oh... ow!

73
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:19,720
[screaming]

74
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,300
Victim's name is Lindsay Kang,

75
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:31,206
engineering professor at Hudson University.

76
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,277
- Just got tenure.
- Hey.

77
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,779
So, her whole body's covered in
these puncture wounds

78
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:36,814
you see on her face.

79
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,483
Bite marks maybe.

80
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,655
Whatever it was, she must have
gone into anaphylaxis.

81
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,458
- Damn.
- Yeah.

82
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,691
The blood sample should tell us
everything we need to know.

83
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:46,260
I'll run tests back at my lab.

84
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,464
They can do it faster at S.T.A.R. Labs.

85
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:51,336
Well, yeah, but, I mean, it's just...

86
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:54,307
It's just what?

87
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:57,113
It's kind of weird being there right now.

88
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:59,481
Barry, you know we have to
play it cool with Wells.

89
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:00,715
If he finds out we suspect him...

90
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,218
I know. I get it.

91
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,354
I just think that we should tell
Cisco and Caitlin.

92
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,623
They could help us.

93
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,425
The more people who know, the more chance

94
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:08,758
Wells is gonna find out we're on to him.

95
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,792
I mean, what if one of them slips up?

96
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,493
Or panics?

97
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:14,527
- Or what if...
- What?

98
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,495
What if they're not on our side?

99
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:18,397
No. Absolutely not.

100
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,264
They're not involved in
whatever he's planning.

101
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,769
I mean, Wells is their boss, their mentor.

102
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:23,870
They've been with him for a long time.

103
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:27,942
I've seen plenty of people make
the wrong choice for loyalty.

104
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:32,713
Please do not include them
until we can be sure.

105
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:33,914
All right.

106
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,819
[dramatic music]

107
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:43,924
Death by apitoxin.

108
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,859
Honeybee venom.

109
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:49,662
Bees. Why did it have to be bees?

110
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,165
Y'all, I don't do bees.

111
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,934
Ain't nobody got time for bees.

112
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:54,267
But when a honeybee stings,

113
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,369
the stingers are literally
torn from their abdomen,

114
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:57,936
and they die.

115
00:04:57,938 --> 00:04:59,337
But there were no stingers in the body

116
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,604
and no dead bees in the car.

117
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:03,571
A honeybee can only deposit
.1 milligrams of apitoxin

118
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,806
when it releases its stinger.

119
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:06,171
(Wells) And yet, Ms. Kang was found

120
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,772
with enough venom in her system

121
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,540
to kill a herd of elephants.

122
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,242
It appears not only is a meta-human

123
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,174
controlling these bees but also
increasing their toxicity.

124
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,011
Bees communicate by releasing pheromones.

125
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:18,847
Maybe this meta's controlling
them through secretion?

126
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:21,214
Anyone want to join me
in getting a beekeeper suit?

127
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,283
I'm pretty sure I can outrun a bee.

128
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:24,886
Just don't run into a lake.

129
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:27,218
Bees will wait for you to come up for air

130
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,217
and then they'll sting you.

131
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,686
Discovery Channel.

132
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,755
Turns out there's a lot to discover.

133
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,690
Felicity, what are you doing here?

134
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,759
Can you guys come outside for a sec?

135
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:40,661
[gentle sweeping music]

136
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:49,169
What exactly are we waiting for, Ms. Smoak?

137
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:52,306
Up there.

138
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,839
Is that a bird?

139
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,208
It's a plane.

140
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,981
It's my boyfriend.

141
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,249
[sighs] Hi.

142
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,652
I'm Ray.

143
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:23,084
So he seems a little tall for you.

144
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,350
Barry Allen, are you jealous?

145
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,653
Je... no. No, I'm not jealous.

146
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,425
I just... I really wish you would've called

147
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,226
before flying in.

148
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:32,625
Oh no, he flew. I drove.

149
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:36,192
I'm serious, all right?
Now is not the best time.

150
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:40,765
Why? What's going on?

151
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,869
Ah, well, my ears popped,
so that's something.

152
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,304
You're lucky you didn't break your neck.

153
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:48,072
What is it with billionaires
being superheroes?

154
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,645
So have you... picked a name yet?

155
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:53,648
I'm kind of partial to The Atom.

156
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,083
Shoo.

157
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,985
You married to that, or...?

158
00:06:56,987 --> 00:07:00,388
Your A.T.O.M. suit...

159
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,090
it's quite the technological
achievement, Mr. Palmer.

160
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,053
(Wells) I'm impressed.

161
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,524
And he is never impressed.

162
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,825
Well, thank you, but I can't
quite seem to keep it up.

163
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,725
(Felicity) He means the suit.

164
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:14,527
- Yeah, I mean the suit.
- Yeah.

165
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,225
I can attest that
everything else works just fine.

166
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,258
There's nothing we need to fix in...

167
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,426
[clicks tongue] That area.

168
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:20,228
No, no, no. The sex is great.

169
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,629
God, there's two of them.

170
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,265
I know from Felicity that you have been

171
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,035
very helpful with Barry and the Flash suit,

172
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:28,140
and I was hoping to get
another set of eyes on my...

173
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:30,309
- Problem.
- Problem.

174
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:32,345
Any friend of The Arrow's is a friend...

175
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,146
- Hell, yes.
- Uh, guys.

176
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:38,384
We kind of have a lot going on already.

177
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,152
There's the meta-human killer

178
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,688
that can control a whole swarm of bees?

179
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,357
Cool. [chuckles]

180
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,224
I mean, awful.

181
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:49,492
I'm sure Caitlin and I will
provide ample support, Barry.

182
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:52,096
And I will be happy to sit this one out.

183
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,499
You...

184
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,135
Ray, why don't you stay here
and work on your suit

185
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:59,705
while Barry and I run to
Jitters for some java?

186
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,742
Sounds like a plan.

187
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:05,078
- Coffee?
- Sure.

188
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,783
[tense music]

189
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:12,689
[indistinct chatter]

190
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:18,498
- Hey, Detective.
- Iris.

191
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,600
What are you doing here?

192
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:21,437
I am following up on my story

193
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,773
about crime in Central City.

194
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:25,308
Or lack thereof.

195
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,448
Could someone be working with The Flash?

196
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,984
No. Of course not.

197
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:31,452
You caught a flasher,

198
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:32,687
armed robbers in a getaway car,

199
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:35,423
and two jewelry thieves last night.

200
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,825
I'm just that good.

201
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:39,929
What is going on with you lately?

202
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,065
You've been acting
really weird and withdrawn.

203
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,734
If I didn't know any better, I'd think that

204
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,470
you were hiding something from me.

205
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:49,573
Iris, I'm... I'm not hiding
anything from you.

206
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,512
[solemn music]

207
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:58,915
Do you ever go to work?

208
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,317
Oh, you're funny.

209
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:03,621
[laughs]

210
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:06,525
Okay, I can't keep lying to Iris
about The Flash.

211
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,562
You have to.

212
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:12,000
It's really starting
to affect our relationship.

213
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:15,232
We haven't had sex in two weeks.

214
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:16,733
Which you didn't want to know about.

215
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:20,569
Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe.

216
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:21,803
I don't agree.

217
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:22,769
Well, I'm her father.

218
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,903
And I'm her boyfriend.

219
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:26,672
When does my vote outweigh yours?

220
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:28,609
When you become her husband.

221
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,595
You know I left Starling City

222
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,262
to get away from the mood and brood,

223
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:43,332
but it looks like it followed me here.

224
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,701
I know. I'm sorry.

225
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,605
It's like I said before,

226
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:48,672
now is not the best time.

227
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:51,408
Barry, I have been through enough with you

228
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,577
to know when you're holding something back.

229
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:55,247
Is this because I told Ray your secret?

230
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,883
Because he is trustworthy, Barry.

231
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,718
He wants to help people, just like you.

232
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,519
I know, that's not what I'm worried about.

233
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:02,454
It's...

234
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:05,891
I really don't want to
put anyone else in danger.

235
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:09,728
In danger of what?

236
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,895
Barry, hey.

237
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,465
Eddie, hey.

238
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:13,934
- You remember Felicity.
- Of course.

239
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,103
- Hey.
- Great to see you.

240
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,640
Yeah.

241
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,041
What is wrong with you?

242
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,342
Is everyone in Central City in a bad mood?

243
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,512
I thought Central City was
supposed to be the fun one.

244
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:26,946
It's, um...

245
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:29,516
- It's not...
- Felicity knows.

246
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:30,784
- Wow.
- Yeah.

247
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,353
So everyone but Iris.

248
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:33,920
It feels that way.

249
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:35,788
How do you lie to everyone you care about?

250
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,556
(Felicity) For starters,

251
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:38,890
don't think of it as lying.

252
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:41,461
Think of it as protecting her
from getting hurt...

253
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:42,797
with a fib.

254
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,636
But Iris can tell I'm hiding something,

255
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:47,938
and it's putting this distance between us.

256
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,740
(Felicity) I have an idea.

257
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,675
Why don't we all go to dinner tonight?

258
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:55,044
A little wine and dine
is sure to bridge the gap.

259
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,713
Come on, we all had fun last time.

260
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:59,818
Sure. Why not?

261
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,986
Barry Allen, fifth wheel.

262
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:04,488
(man) Well, I can't make my
3:00 meeting this afternoon.

263
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,788
Also, confirm my dinner
reservation for tonight.

264
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,220
Last time, they couldn't find it,

265
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,419
and that was unacceptable. Thanks.

266

[tense music]

Tell your sisters it's time.

270
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:23,501
(Cisco) So you put solid oxide
fuel cells into the belt?

271
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:25,400
Yeah, it's the only place
to hide the hardware.

272
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:28,703
Hmm, well, they should be
generating enough energy

273
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,305
to power the suit.

274
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,873
It could be the operating temperature.

275
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,841
I mean, you're essentially...

276
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:36,275
Overheating the system, yeah. I figured.

277
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:41,445
But if we insulate them
with a ceramic compound...

278
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,714
We may improve the operating efficiency.

You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

How do you turn this thing on?

285
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:05,635
Cisco? You okay?

286
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,237
Yeah.

Where are the bees?

I don't know. There's no sign of them.

(Flash) How do I get out of here?

306
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:12,743
Take the northeast crossway.

307
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,846
It's the quickest way out of the building.

Cisco! Barry doesn't have a pulse.

- Step away from him.
- What? Why?

00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:43,937
You're lucky to be alive, Mr. Allen.

332
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,875
I was very specific that you not die.

333
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:48,510
Yeah, that's a pretty big thing for her.

334
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,881
Cisco, what happened out there?

335
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,283
I followed your directions exactly.

336
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:55,419
I'm sorry. I led you the wrong way.

337
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:59,059
The schematics that we had,
they... they weren't up to date.

338
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,529
(Barry) What, they weren't up to date?

339
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:01,830
What do you mean?

340
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,165
That's never happened before.

341
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,101
What, you think Cisco
was trying to get you killed?

342
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:07,038
No. Why would he do that?

343
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,237
That doesn't make any sense.

344
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,074
I know. That's why I was joking.

345
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,476
Barry, it's our job
to protect you, and today,

346
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,310
we failed, but that'll just
serve as a warning

347
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:17,911
for all of us to be
more vigilant in the future.

348
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:20,178
(Caitlin) Good news... the
apitoxin is out of your body.

349
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,813
Your levels are back to normal.

350
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:23,982
Terrific.

351
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,485
Ray, Felicity.
We're gonna be late for dinner.

352
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,888
Are you sure that's wise, Barry?

353
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,987
You just died.

354
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,855
Maybe you should order in tonight.

355
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,088
Yeah, we could totally cancel.

356
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,692
I'm fine. Alive. Hungry.

357
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:39,090
All right? Let's go.

358
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,195
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

359
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:45,797
Why didn't we get invited to dinner?

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,880
Oh. Thank you.

364
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,916
Hey, guys.

365
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:00,685
Wow, Iris. Check you out.

366
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,920
[chuckles] Hi, Felicity.

367
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,089
- Hello.
- Hi.

368
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:05,592
Hey. Guys, this is Ray Palmer.

369
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:06,993
Hi. Nice to meet you.

370
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,060
- Lovely to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

371
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:09,494
- Nice to meet you.
- Barry.

372
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,094
<i>Bienvenue chez Massimo Restaurant.</i>

373
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,062
(maitre d') Mr. Palmer,
your table is ready.

374
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:14,564
Great. Shall we?

375
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,700
Yes.

376
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:20,033
Hey, how did he get a reservation here?

377
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:21,600
We've been trying for months.

378
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:24,932
- I don't know.
- [laughs]

379
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,868
Here's your table, sir.

380
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:31,477
I thought it'd be nice if it was quiet,

381
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:36,181
so I bought out the entire restaurant.

382
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:39,185
- Too much?
- Just a tad, sweetie.

383
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:46,758
Joe.

384
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,663
Oh, Cisco. Hey.

385
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:51,430
You just saved me a trip to S.T.A.R. Labs.

386
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,964
I got some info on our second victim.

387
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,498
Name's Bill Carlisle.

388
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,932
(West) He was recently
hired at Folston Tech

389
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,101
to beef up their robotics division.

390
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,034
Robotics?

391
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,135
That's just like the first victim.

392
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:06,771
Wow. That is weird.

393
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:11,073
That's not why you stopped by.

394
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:15,045
No, I wanted to talk to you about Barry.

395
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,780
Okay.

396
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:19,720
[tense music]

397
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:25,665
Is there something going on with him?

398
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,767
Something he's not telling us?

399
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,069
What do you mean?

400
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:33,008
He hasn't really been himself lately.

401
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,643
Not that I'm aware of.

402
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:38,679
It's like something is just
really bothering him.

403
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:42,681
Well, I think he's got his mind trained on

404
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:44,217
catching the bad guys, Cisco.

405
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:48,222
And he's probably worried about

406
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:51,692
when The Reverse-Flash is gonna
show his face again.

407
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,463
(Reverse-Flash voice-over) Oh,
I'm not like The Flash at all.

408
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:00,199
Some would say I'm the reverse.

409
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,174
Hey. You okay?

410
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,611
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine.

411
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:10,649
It's just... I've got this crazy headache.

412
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,190
Thank you for the file and the talk.

413

[solemn music]

414
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:24,375
- So how did you two meet?
- Work.

415
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,280
Well, actually, I bought the company

416
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:28,514
where Felicity was employed,
and so she was forced

417
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,782
to join me at Palmer Tech.

418
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:31,482
It's not as creepy as it sounds.

419
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:34,153
So you two work closely together?

420
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,721
- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting.

421
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:37,555
I guess you guys share all of your thoughts

422
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:40,592
and feelings and...

423
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:44,361
Yeah...I share everything with Felicity.

424
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:47,967
It's nice that you guys have
that level of communication.

425

[lounge music playing]

426
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,038
Oh, well, no, not every-everything.

427
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,776
I mean, sometimes it's good
to just shut up.

428
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:56,943
[chuckles]

429
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:58,276
I get that.

430
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:00,378
Some things are better left unspoken.

431
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,547
Really?

432
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,953
I... I don't find that to be true.

433
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:07,988
Oh, thank God. It's the food.

434
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,790
(Barry) Food's here.

435
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,558
Our first course on the tasting menu

436
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,762
is a quail egg frittata.

437
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:15,797
Bon appétit.

I got to admit, I envy you

440
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:19,970
spending so much time at S.T.A.R. Labs.

441

Harrison Wells is, like,
a personal hero of mine.

442
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,876
I mean, it's amazing just to actually

443
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:25,243
be in the same room with him.

00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:34,952
Okay.

Okay, you've been acting super strange

ever since Ray and I got to Central City.

452

And don't say it's a bad time.

Laurel's the Black Canary, and
Thea's training with Malcolm,

456
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,647
so I know about bad times.

00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:06,349
Okay.

458
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:16,265
Joe and I found out that
Wells isn't who he says he is.

459
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,671
He... [sighs]

460
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:24,744
He is the man that killed my mother.

461
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:26,879
Oh, my God. But he's been helping you.

462

Get faster, stronger. I know.

- Why?
- I don't know.

464
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,014
I don't know anything anymore,

465
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,652
especially who I can and can't trust.

466
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:36,123
So you think Cisco and Caitlin
are helping him?

467
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,691
That's impossible.

468
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:39,223
- Is it?
- Yes.

469
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:40,659
They were trying to save you today, Barry.

470
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:42,061
- They did save you.
- Wells has also saved me.

471
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:43,362
Many times.

472
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:46,497
I thought that Wells was a great man,

473
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:49,698
and I was so wrong about him.

474

What if I'm wrong
about everything else too?

Please can't we just have a nice evening?

Okay, so it's my fault that
we're not having a nice evening?

I am your girlfriend. Who you live with.

I shouldn't have to beg you to talk to me.

If I could talk to you
about this, I would, believe me.

But I can't.

494
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,116
Uh, emergency at S.T.A.R. Labs.

495
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:44,984
- Go.
- Sorry.

496
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:47,117
[chuckles]

497
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,321
Well, only 17 more courses to go.

498
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,726
(male voice) Containment breach.
Foreign object detected.

[shouts]

500
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:00,331
Did I get it?

501
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,931
I think I got it.

502
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,966
Where is he?

503
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:06,936

[buzzing silences]

505
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:15,210
Thank you.

506
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,012
Let's see what makes this bee so poisonous.

507
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:18,247
[groans]

508
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,480
You saved my life.

509
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:28,355
That is one odd-looking bee.

510
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:30,591
(Cisco) That's 'cause
it isn't a bee at all.

511
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,993
It's a robot.

512
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:35,895
No way.

513
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,460
Unbelievable.

514
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:11,100
This bot's got a 360-degree vision system.

515
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:14,067
I mean, we're talking
multiple micro-cameras

516
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:17,137
all coming from various angles
at the same time.

517
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,406
Which means...

518
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:19,708
It can see all around the room at once.

519
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,676
That is...

520
00:23:20,678 --> 00:23:22,342
(both) Amazing.

521
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,541
Disturbing.

522
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:26,376
It's also next-gen hardware
that nowhere near the market.

523
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:28,380
So we're not dealing with a meta-human?

524
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:29,649
It's just a mad scientist.

525
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,351
Cisco, you said the second victim,

526
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:33,085
Bill Carlisle, was a robotics engineer.

527
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:34,786
Let's cross-reference
his previous employers

528
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,754
with those of Lindsay Kang.

529
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:37,456
Allow me.

530
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,757
Mama's been away from
a keyboard for far too long.

531
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,457
Okay.

532
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,396
[solemn music]

533
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:46,664
They both worked at Mercury Labs.

534
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,364
Let's call Joe.

535
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,931
I think it's time we paid
a visit to an old friend.

536
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,768
(McGee) Twice in one year, Harrison.

537
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,174
You really are vying for
comeback scientist of the year.

538
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:00,809
Always a pleasure, Christina.

539
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:02,143
To what do I owe this visit?

540
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:04,145
Did you finally find my tachyon prototype,

541
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:06,114
or are you here to
blackmail me for another one?

542
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:07,948
Do you have another one?

543
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,550
(West) We came here for information.

544
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:12,652
Bill Carlisle and Lindsay Kang.

545
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:17,423
Former employees who were
recently murdered.

546
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:19,727
My God. I wasn't aware.

547
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:24,501
Stung to death by robotic bees.

548
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,371
You're looking for Brie Larvan.

549
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:27,639
Brie Larvan?

550
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,608
A quite brilliant roboticist
who once developed

551
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,612
miniature mechanical bees
for agricultural use.

552
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:34,217
Kang and Carlisle warned me

553
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:36,455
that Brie was weaponizing
the bees for military use,

554
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:38,155
so I terminated her.

555
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:41,761
Well, it seems that you would be
on her hit list too, Doctor.

556
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,765
You've got to let us keep you safe.

557
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,233
[chuckles]

558
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,501
I'm all too familiar

559
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:49,369
with your inability
to protect things, Harrison.

560
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:52,072
I can take care of myself.

561
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:56,143
Good day, gentlemen.

562
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,677
Thank you.

[soft pop music playing]

564
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:07,319
Hey.

565
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:09,455
Okay, so we found our queen bee.

566
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:11,457
Brie Larvan. She's a roboticist.

567
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:13,361
Joe is running a trace
on her current location,

568
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:14,463
but so far nothing.

569
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:15,565
[clears throat] Good.

570
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,200
Where is Ray?

571
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:19,132
Oh, he's working on his suit with Cisco.

572
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,365
I like Ray.

573
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,433
He seems like he's a really good guy.

574
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:24,736
He is a good guy.

575
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,470
Just like Cisco.

576
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:29,038
And Caitlin. Girl.

577
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:35,479
Is that why you called me here?

578
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,616
I know that you're in a tricky situation,

579
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,352
but that's when you need
your friends to have your back.

580
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:41,721
And how can they if you won't let them?

581
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:43,421
It's not that simple.

582
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:46,624
What if Joe is right, and
I tell them, and it backfires?

583
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:48,960
Wells isn't just their boss, Felicity.

584
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:51,659
He is their mentor, their hero.

585
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:55,261
[sighs] My hero.

586
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,196
Look, it's...

00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:00,597

[sighs]

589
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:06,335
When I first met Oliver,

590
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:08,001
before I knew he was The Arrow,

591
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:11,134
he would... he would ask me
to do weird things for him

592
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,237
like decrypt a bullet-ridden computer

593
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,571
or hack some company.

594
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,274
And when I would ask him why,

595
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:20,311
he would come up these ridiculous excuses.

596
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:23,548
And I always knew he was lying,
but I would help him anyway.

597
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,381
- You know why?
- Hmm?

598
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:29,752
Because I knew Oliver was
a good person with a good heart.

599
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,155
And Cisco and Caitlin?

600
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:35,257
They're no different.

601
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:51,474
- Hey.
- Hey.

602
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,650
So you're really staying here tonight?

603
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:57,551
Tonight. Tomorrow night.

604
00:26:57,553 --> 00:26:59,284
The night after that.

605
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:05,289
Do you think that Eddie is cheating on me?

606
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,497
No. Eddie's not that kind of guy.

607
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:11,967
Well, then I don't know what else

608
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,437
he could be hiding from me.

609
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,774
Iris...

610
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,414
Remember when we were kids,

611
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:26,150
and Joe would come home from work

612
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:29,685
with that blank expression on his face?

613
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:31,620
[chuckles] Yeah.

614
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:33,456
The "Earth to Joe" look.

615
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,623
How could I forget?

616
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,259
(Barry) I never understood that look

617
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:41,132
until I started working for the CCPD.

618
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:45,206
Showing up at crime scenes and
seeing someone murdered...

619
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:48,742
it can be ugly work.

620
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:50,410
(Barry) And I'm lucky.

621
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:52,447
I get to hide behind the science of it

622
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:54,250
and just stay in my lab,

623
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:56,285
but Eddie,

624
00:27:56,287 --> 00:28:01,553
he's out there every day in the darkness.

625
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,389
I just... I think that maybe

626
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,359
if he doesn't want to talk
to you about his work,

627
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:11,065
it's probably because he wants
to keep you in the light.

628
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:15,471
What?

629
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:22,179
I'm just surprised.

630
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:23,713
You going out of your way like this

631
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:26,214
to help me see Eddie's point of view.

632
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:29,586
I mean...

633
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:32,652
Eddie makes you happy.

634
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:36,624
All I ever want is
for you to be happy, Iris.

635
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:43,366
Welcome home.

It is so fun to watch
grown men play with their toys.

638
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,182
(Caitlin) You're so lucky.

639
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:59,088
Ray is so nice and smart and hot.

640
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,721
Yeah, it's kind of like I'm dating Barry

641
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:03,358
but in Oliver's body.

642
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,029
A sentence you will never repeat to anyone.

00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,557
(Wells) She's got to be remotely piloting

660
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,791
those bees from somewhere.

661
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:02,163
We need to stop this bug-eyed
glasses woman.

662
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:04,500
And her mini bandits.

663

- Bug-Eyed Bandit.
- Bug-Eyed Bandit.

664
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,906
(Felicity) Got her. She's
in an abandoned greenhouse.

665
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,275
Barry, you have to take out Brie.

666
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:10,710
It's the only way to stop these nanodrones.

667
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,046
What about Dr. McGee?

668
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:13,882
The defibrillator in your suit is broken.

669

You cannot risk going near Mercury Labs.

670
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,857
Bees can't penetrate my suit.

671
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:23,093
- I'll go.
- Whoa.

672
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:25,262
We haven't tested out
the new power system yet.

673
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,065
We'll do it now.

674
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,235
- I'm following you.
- I'm driving.

675
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:30,635
(Felicity) And I'm kissing you.

Mr. Palmer will protect Tina. Go.

[dramatic music]

You fired me,
destroyed years of my research.

681
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:58,066
You took everything from me.

682
00:30:58,068 --> 00:31:00,299
What you were doing was wrong.

683
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:03,303
You wanted to harm people, not help them.

684
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:05,206
I did what I had to do.

685
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,308
You mean ruin my life?

686
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,842
Sure.

687
00:31:08,844 --> 00:31:10,843
Now I'm doing what I have to do.

Felicity, can you jam their frequency?

00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,693
I already tried, but I might
be able to redirect them

onto a new target.

We have the technology.

It's over, Brie.

(Flash) I know you're
trying to kill Dr. McGee.

698
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:04,978
You think that she betrayed you.

699
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,647
I can imagine how that feels.

700
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:11,086
You think you understand
the sting of betrayal?

Barry, I hacked into the bees' frequency.

I'm controlling them.

Oh, she's good.

She's like my nemesis.

I've never had a nemesis before.
I kind of like it.

I wanted to apologize.

you when you warned me about Brie.

what happened between you two?

I ask myself that same question
all the time.

15 years ago, Harrison and I
were thick as thieves.

We were promising young scientists

in Starling City.

791
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,760
He was such a kind man.

792
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:10,265
Then everything changed after Tess died.

They were gonna get married?

00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:15,404
but this was more than that.

It was like, after that day,

figure out the problem with your suit.

00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:06,430
- I already have, actually.
- Oh.

815
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:07,998
All this time, I've been looking at

816
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,233
the power source the wrong way.

817
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:10,701
I kept thinking we needed to go bigger.

818
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:13,271
But the solution, as always,

819
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:15,974
is simply to go smaller.

820
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:17,709
Oh. Great.

You okay?

823
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:23,716
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna be.

824
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,418
Thank you for your advice.

825
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,024

Bye, Barry.

Hey.

What's up?

00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:52,814
I, um...

831
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:55,652
I spoke to Barry last night.

00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:57,087
Oh, yeah?

00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:58,321
He was trying to help me understand

834
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:00,655
why you've been so off lately,

835
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:04,392
why you might be having trouble
connecting with me.

Really?

What did he say?

838
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:10,733
It was a good explanation.

00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:13,803
Valid.

But the truth is, it doesn't matter,

841

because when you love someone,

you tell them everything.

So if you love me, Eddie,

844
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:25,751
you'll tell me what is going on
with you, or...

00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:28,554
Or what?

You know what.
