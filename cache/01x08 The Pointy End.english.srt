1
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,780
Yah! Left high, left low.

2
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,510
Right low, lunge right.

3
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,390
You break anything,
the septa will have my head.

4
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,890
What is...

5
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,030
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

6
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,200
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

7
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,870
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

8
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,700
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

9
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,040
Hush!

10
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,670
Go back to your room.

11
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,210
Bar the doors and do not open them
for anyone you do not know.

12
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,260
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

13
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,390
Run!

14
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,640
This way!

15
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,570
Left, right. Rah!

16
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,910
- Now you are dead.
- You said right,

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,700
but you went left.

18
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,460
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.

19
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,710
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

20
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,090
- You were not seeing.
- I was so. I watched, but you...

21
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,340
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

22
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,100
The seeing, the true seeing,

23
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,600
that is the heart of swordplay.

24
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,990
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

25
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,280
And why is it that Lord Eddard
is sending Lannister men

26
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,990
in place of his own?

27
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,620
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.

28
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,920
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

29
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,260
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

30
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,640
Take her.

31
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,640
Are you men or snakes,
that you would threaten a child?

32
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,930
Get out of my way, little man.

33
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,270
I am Syrio Forel...

34
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,270
Foreign bastard.

35
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,820
...and you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

36
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,280
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

37
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,660
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

38
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,250
Run to your father.

39
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,850
Bloody oafs.

40
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,070
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me. Run.

41
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,650
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

42
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,830
What do we say

43
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,420
to the god of death?

44
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,260
Not today.

45
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,010
Go.

46
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Not today. Not today.

47
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,470
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.

48
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,300
I'll... I'll tell the queen.

49
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,010
Who do you think sent me?

50
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,110
Needle.

51
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,660
There she is.

52
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,080
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

53
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,790
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

54
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,580
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!

55
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,250
Stay away!

56
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,280
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

57
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,950
Varys.

58
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,210
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

59
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,420
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

60
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,350
Not so much, my lord.

61
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,640
I would save the rest, if I were you.

62
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,600
Hide it. Men have been known
to die of thirst in these cells.

63
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,650
What about my daughters?

64
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,150
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

65
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,860
Even my little birds cannot find her.

66
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,200
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

67
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,200
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

68
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,170
all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

69
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,670
You watched my men
being slaughtered and did nothing.

70
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,090
And would again, my lord.

71
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,390
I was unarmed, unarmored
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

72
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,640
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

73
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,190
What madness led you to tell the queen

74
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,820
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

75
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,150
The madness of mercy.

76
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,580
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.

77
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,910
It's always
the innocents who suffer.

78
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,080
It wasn't the wine
that killed Robert, nor the boar.

79
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,540
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

80
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,050
but it was your mercy
that killed the king.

81
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,800
I trust you know you're
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

82
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,690
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.

83
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,320
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.

84
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,320
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

85
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,700
If that's true,

86
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,870
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

87
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Not today, my lord.

88
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Tell me something, Varys.

89
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,590
Who do you truly serve?

90
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,510
The realm, my lord.

91
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Someone must.

92
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,620
It's Othor, without a doubt.

93
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,170
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord,
less the hand the wolf tore off.

94
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,710
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

95
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,800
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

96
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,590
- Mmm.
- The smell.

97
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,640
What smell?

98
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,690
There is none.

99
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,480
If they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

100
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,490
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.

101
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,860
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.

102
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,450
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

103
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,660
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

104
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,630
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

105
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,960
Lord Commander,

106
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,800
Maester Aemon
awaits you in his chambers...

107
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,680
A raven from King's Landing.

108
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Come on, move 'em out.

109
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,690
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

110
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,990
and pour one for yourself.

111
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,380
The king is dead.

112
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,020
Is there any word of my father?

113
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Sit.

114
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,400
Lord Stark has been

115
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,240
charged with treason.

116
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,120
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

117
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,160
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

118
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,220
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

119
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,760
Your duty lies here now.

120
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,720
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

121
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,230
I'm sure they'll be

122
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,020
treated gently.

123
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,030
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

124
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,030
King Robert's body was still warm

125
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,240
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

126
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,830
He wouldn't do that.

127
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,620
He knows how much
I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

128
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,670
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

129
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,340
Send for my father. He'll tell you -
the king was his friend.

130
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,340
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

131
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,930
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

132
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,310
How can I allow you to marry my son?

133
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,310
A child born of a traitor's seed

134
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,730
is no fit consort for our king.

135
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,310
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

136
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,860
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

137
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,990
No, I'm not. I'll be
a good wife to him, you'll see.

138
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,490
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.

139
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,210
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

140
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,330
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

141
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,010
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn
and your brother, the eldest,

142
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,720
- what's his name?
- Robb.

143
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,980
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

144
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,230
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

145
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,570
urge your brother
to keep the king's peace.

146
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,740
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

147
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,040
If... If I could see my father,
talk to him about...

148
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
You disappoint me, child.

149
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,550
We have told you
of your father's treason.

150
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,880
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

151
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I only meant that...

152
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,220
What will happen to him?

153
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,230
- That depends.
- On...

154
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,900
- On what?
- On your brother.

155
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
And on you.

156
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,040
Treason?

157
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,620
Sansa wrote this?

158
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,120
It is your sister's hand,
but the queen's words.

159
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,250
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

160
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,420
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his arse kissed?

161
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,430
This is a royal command, my lord.

162
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,220
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.

163
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,350
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.

164
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,350
But not alone.

165
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,190
Call the banners.

166
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,650
All of them, my lord?

167
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,660
They've all sworn to defend my father,
have they not?

168
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,620
They have.

169
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,870
Now we see
what their words are worth.

170
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
Yes.

171
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Are you afraid?

172
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,640
I must be.

173
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,180
Good.

174
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,890
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.

175
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,170
You've had this since dawn?

176
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,670
He sent it to me, not you.

177
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,010
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

178
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,220
My husband has been taken prisoner.

179
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,720
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?

180
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,180
Your son against the Lannisters?

181
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,730
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

182
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,980
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

183
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,650
He is your brother by law!

184
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,700
Does family mean nothing to you?

185
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,620
Family means everything to me.

186
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,450
And I will not risk Robin's life

187
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,250
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

188
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,580
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

189
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,500
You just ate.

190
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,420
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?

191
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,220
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

192
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,390
You're always welcome here, sister.

193
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,680
But if you're asking me
to send men from the Vale to fight...

194
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,890
That is what I ask.

195
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,860
Go on, sweet.

196
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
Time for your bath.

197
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,530
I'll feed you after.

198
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,120
If you fear for the safety of your son...

199
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,200
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

200
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,250
Are you an idiot?

201
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,790
They killed my husband.

202
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,250
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

203
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,880
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.

204
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,470
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

205
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,180
where they belong,

206
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,480
to protect their lord.

207
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,070
Will you shut up?

208
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,120
There's hill tribes all around here.

209
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,080
If I'm going to die, it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

210
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,550
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

211
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,260
Eh?

212
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,340
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.

213
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,060
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

214
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,640
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

215
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,770
Golden women?

216
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,060
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

217
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,230
for as long as I'm around
and not a moment longer.

218
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,200
But you knew that.

219
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,280
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honor.

220
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,540
Fair enough.

221
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,540
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

222
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,880
and "my lord" you
every time you take a shit.

223
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,460
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

224
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,800
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

225
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,090
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

226
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,890
And if the day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

227
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,560
remember this -

228
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,310
whatever their price,

229
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,020
I'll beat it.

230
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,190
I like living.

231
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,030
Tyrion.

232
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:10,370
Tyrion.

233
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,190
Come, share our fire.

234
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,520
Help yourselves to our goat.

235
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,110
When you meet your gods,
you tell them

236
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,790
Shagga, son of Dolf,
of the Stone Crows sent you.

237
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,120
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

238
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,250
How would you like to die,
Tyrion, son of Tywin?

239
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,170
In my own bed,
at the age of 80

240
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,800
with a belly full of wine
and a girl's mouth around my cock.

241
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
Take the halfman.

242
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,600
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

243
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,860
No, no, no, no, no!

244
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,940
My... My house is rich and powerful.

245
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,150
If you see us through these mountains,
my father will shower you with gold.

246
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,660
We have no use
for a halfman's promises.

247
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,160
Halfman maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

248
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,120
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver

249
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,670
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

250
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,750
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

251
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,760
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

252
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,970
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

253
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,020
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

254
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,330
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

255
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,870
But if you help us,
Shagga, son of Dolf,

256
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,210
I will not give you trinkets.

257
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,840
I will give you this.

258
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,300
What is "this"?

259
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,970
The Vale of Arryn.

260
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,350
The lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

261
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,600
The lords of the Vale want me dead.

262
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,400
I believe it is time
for new lords of the Vale.

263
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,200
Now there's a rare sight...

264
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,330
Not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

265
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,380
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

266
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,890
Blood will always tell.

267
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,970
You'll hang for this, bastard.

268
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,660
I told you not to do anything stupid.

269
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,080
You're confined to quarters. Go.

270
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,780
Ghost, what's wrong?

271
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,780
Is someone out there?

272
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,190
Commander?

273
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,030
Stay.

274
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,830
Hello?

275
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,930
Who's there?

276
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,520
Lord Commander?

277
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,800
Snow?

278
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,930
Commander!

279
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,900
Move!

280
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,800
What did they do?

281
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,170
Lamb men make good slaves.

282
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,930
Khal Drogo will make a gift
of them to the slavers,

283
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,050
and the slavers will give us gold...

284
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,600
...and silk, and steel.

285
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,650
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

286
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,860
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

287
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,700
ships to sail to Westeros.

288
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,220
Jorah, make them stop.

289
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,300
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

290
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,010
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

291
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,350
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

292
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,560
The riders do her honor.

293
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,940
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,

294
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,110
I will bring you her tongue.

295
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,030
Princess, you have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

296
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,030
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.

297
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,990
Do as I command
or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

298
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,260
Come.

299
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,220
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

300
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,690
And those women there.

301
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,110
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

302
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,400
I can,

303
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,360
and I will.

304
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,250
Moon of my life,

305
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,380
Mago says you haven taken his spoils,

306
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,930
a daughter of a lamb man
who was his to mount.

307
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,850
Tell me the truth of this.

308
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,690
Mago speaks the truth,
my sun and stars.

309
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,770
I have claimed many daughters this day...

310
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,440
...so they cannot be mounted.

311
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,990
This is the way of war.

312
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,030
These women are slaves now...

313
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,410
...to do with as we please.

314
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,790
It pleases me to keep them safe.

315
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,920
If your riders would mount them,
let them take them for wives.

316
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,130
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

317
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,140
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

318
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,640
You are a foreigner.

319
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,810
You do not command me.

320
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,810
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.

321
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,150
See how fierce she grows?

322
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,610
That is my son inside her,
the stallion that will mount the world,

323
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,110
filling her with his fire.

324
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,240
I will hear no more.

325
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,870
Mago, find somewhere else
to stick your cock.

326
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,540
A Khal who takes orders
from a foreign whore is no Khal.

327
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,520
I will not have your body burned.

328
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,440
I will not give you that honor.

329
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,070
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

330
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,320
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

331
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,370
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...

332
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,010
...until nothing is left of you but bones.

333
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,510
First you have to kill me.

334
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,680
I already have.

335
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,240
My sun and stars is wounded.

336
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,330
A scratch...

337
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,040
...moon of my life.

338
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,870
Where are the healers?

339
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,960
This is the bite of a fly.

340
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,550
I can help the great rider with his cut.

341
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,590
The Khal needs no help
from slaves who lie with sheep.

342
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,140
She is mine. Let her speak.

343
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
Thank you, silver lady.

344
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,060
Who are you?

345
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,270
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.

346
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,650
Witch.

347
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,030
My mother was
godswife here before me.

348
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,950
She taught me how
to make healing smokes and ointments.

349
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,950
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

350
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,030
The great shepherd sent me
to earth to heal his...

351
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,410
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.

352
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,960
Lamb or lion,

353
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,090
his wound must be washed
and sewn or it will fester.

354
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,220
Let her clean your wound,
my sun and stars...

355
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,760
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.

356
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,500
For 30 years I've been making
corpses out of men, boy.

357
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,170
I'm the man you want
leading the vanguard.

358
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,840
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

359
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,510
The bloody wall will melt

360
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,880
before an Umber
marches behind a Glover.

361
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,810
I will lead the van
or I will take my men

362
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,100
and march them home.

363
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,730
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

364
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,820
And when I am done
with the Lannisters,

365
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,700
I will march back north,
root you out of your keep

366
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,450
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

367
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,950
Oathbreaker, is it?!

368
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:28,540
I'll not sit here and swallow insults
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

369
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,730
My lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

370
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,850
against your liege lord.

371
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,980
But doubtless the Greatjon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

372
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,490
Your meat...

373
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,330
is bloody tough.

374
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,530
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

375
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,040
- Where are you going?
- South. For Father.

376
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,040
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

377
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,630
I don't want them to know
we're coming.

378
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,510
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.

379
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,680
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.

380
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,930
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...

381
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,600
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

382
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,930
Until I return that will be you.

383
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,730
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

384
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,780
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

385
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,990
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can,

386
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,120
but if you don't hear from me,
don't be scared.

387
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Until I return.

388
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,150
How long have you been
hiding out there?

389
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,320
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

390
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,330
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.

391
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,750
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

392
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,920
No, they won't.

393
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,880
Please watch over Robb.

394
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,090
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

395
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,390
And Theon too, I suppose.

396
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
You hear them, boy?

397
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,020
The old gods are answering you.

398
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,530
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.

399
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,990
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only gods.

400
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,540
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.

401
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,800
Well, your friend
did put a knife to my throat.

402
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,300
I'm not complaining, little lord,

403
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,470
just telling truths.

404
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,970
What did you mean
about hearing the gods?

405
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,390
You asked them,
they're answering you.

406
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,860
Shh.

407
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,360
Open your ears.

408
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,780
It's only the wind.

409
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,580
Who do you think
sends the wind if not the gods?

410
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,540
They see you, boy.

411
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,080
They hear you.

412
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,460
Your brother will get
no help from them where he's going.

413
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,130
The old gods have
no power in the South.

414
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,970
The weirwoods there were all
cut down a long time ago.

415
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

416
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,600
Well, there's a big man.

417
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,860
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the queen.

418
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,030
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

419
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,570
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

420
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,870
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

421
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,370
Giants and worse than giants.

422
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,170
I tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

423
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,670
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

424
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
North, not south!

425
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,470
The cold winds are rising.

426
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,860
They were touched by white walkers.

427
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,200
That's why they came back.

428
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,660
That's why their eyes turned blue.

429
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,830
Only fire will stop them.

430
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,380
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book...

431
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,460
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

432
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,050
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

433
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,470
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

434
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,440
And when they wake up...

435
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,230
And when they wake up, what?

436
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,700
I hope the Wall's high enough.

437
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,900
Summer snows, my lady.

438
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,610
Robb's brought the North with him.

439
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,580
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

440
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,160
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

441
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,830
Our scouts confirm
it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

442
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,130
One army or two,
the kings in the North

443
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,920
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

444
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,100
Mother!

445
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,140
You look well.

446
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,270
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight
in these troubled times.

447
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,320
We had thought not
to meet you here, my lady.

448
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,690
I had not thought to be here.

449
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,200
I would speak with my son alone.

450
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,530
I know you will forgive me, my lords.

451
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,830
You heard her!
Move your arses!

452
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,250
Come on, out.

453
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,290
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

454
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,000
Have no fear, my lady.

455
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,670
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

456
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,510
and then it's on
to the Red Keep to free Ned.

457
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,340
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

458
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,680
You're not wasting away, are you?

459
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,190
I remember the day
you came into this world,

460
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,820
red-faced and squalling.

461
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,070
And now I find you leading a host to war.

462
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,950
- There was no one else.
- No one?

463
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,120
Who were those men I saw here?

464
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,290
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

465
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,550
If you think you can
send me back to Winterfell...

466
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,010
Oh, would that I could.

467
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,300
There was...

468
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,430
a letter.

469
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,060
From Sansa.

470
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,350
From the queen, you mean.

471
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,530
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

472
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,920
How many men do you have?

473
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,960
18,000.

474
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,420
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

475
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,430
You would never
be allowed to leave. No.

476
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,260
Our best hope,
our only hope,

477
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,690
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?

478
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,310
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

479
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,650
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

480
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,070
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

481
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,700
And the years have not made him kinder.

482
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,240
If you lose,

483
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,330
your father dies, your sisters die,

484
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,500
we die.

485
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,960
Well, that makes it simple, then.

486
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,470
I suppose it does.

487
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,160
From here it might be best
if Bronn and I continue alone.

488
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,620
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

489
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,500
Not best for me.

490
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,670
If the halfman betrays us,

491
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,550
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut off his manhood...

492
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,420
And feed it to the goats, yes.

493
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,800
All right, then.

494
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,930
Time to meet my father.

495
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,010
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

496
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,970
Father.

497
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,600
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

498
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,020
Sorry to disappoint you.

499
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,440
And who are these...

500
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,690
companions of yours?

501
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,740
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

502
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,860
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

503
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,330
Timett, son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.

504
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:13,250
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk,

505
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,290
leader of the Black Ears.

506
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,830
And here we have Bronn, son of...

507
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,050
You wouldn't know him.

508
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,010
May I present my lord father,

509
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,760
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

510
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,100
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

511
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,230
Kind of you to go to war for me.

512
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,110
You left us no choice.

513
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,570
The honor of the house was at stake.

514
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,030
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

515
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,580
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

516
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,790
He's braver. I'm better-looking.

517
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,410
He's been covering himself in glory.

518
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,250
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

519
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,250
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

520
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,300
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

521
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,390
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

522
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:12,390
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

523
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,270
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

524
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,020
My sister rules, you mean.

525
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,230
Stark's son has called his banners.

526
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,700
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

527
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,620
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

528
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,370
Maybe. Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

529
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,170
You'd like him.

530
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:45,210
While we're on the subject of war,

531
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,340
I made promises to my friends here,

532
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,840
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

533
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,850
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

534
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,060
plus swords, pikes,

535
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,020
gorgets, maces...

536
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,350
If it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

537
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,980
that the northmen
have crossed the Neck.

538
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,740
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws. So be it.

539
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,030
Kevan, command
the drummers beat assembly.

540
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,450
And send word to Jaime
that I am moving against Robb Stark.

541
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,460
At once, my lord.

542
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,300
It is said that the men
of the mountain clans are great warriors.

543
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,180
Ride with me against my enemies

544
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,100
and you shall have
all my son promised you and more.

545
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,520
Only if the halfman fights with us.

546
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,310
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

547
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,860
the little lion's life is ours.

548
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,160
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

549
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,200
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

550
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:04,290
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

551
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,210
Do that and the river lords will join us.

552
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,920
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

553
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,430
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

554
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,760
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

555
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,640
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

556
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:25,690
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

557
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,450
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

558
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,620
So what's it going to be?

559
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,500
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

560
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:49,380
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

561
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,590
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

562
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,850
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

563
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,140
He looked to be counting.

564
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,900
How high did you get?

565
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,160
20,000. Maybe more.

566
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,700
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

567
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:26,790
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

568
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,460
And he understands honor...

569
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,090
and courage.

570
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,350
Let him go.

571
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,140
Robb.

572
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,660
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

573
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:02,160
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

574
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,540
Yes, my lord.

575
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,670
Thank you, my lord.

576
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,890
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

577
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,680
You call me boy again.

578
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,850
Go on.

579
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,450
Oi.

580
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,250
It is also the wish of His Grace

581
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,300
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

582
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,180
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

583
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,930
...be at once raised to the rank of lord...

584
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,350
Lord Gyles.

585
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,770
...and granted
the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

586
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,440
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honor

587
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:20,450
after him until the end of time.

588
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:28,000
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

589
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,420
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

590
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,960
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

591
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:40,300
be appointed Hand of the King.

592
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,340
Lastly,

593
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,220
in these times of treason and turmoil,

594
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,390
it is the view of council

595
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,560
that the life and safety

596
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,610
of King Joffrey

597
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,860
be of paramount importance.

598
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,030
Ser Barristan Selmy.

599
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,920
Your Grace,
I am yours to command.

600
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,000
Rise, Ser Barristan.

601
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,960
You may remove your helm.

602
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,640
You have served the realm
long and faithfully.

603
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,520
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

604
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,940
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

605
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,810
It is time to rest
and look back with pride

606
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,820
on your many years of service.

607
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,190
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

608
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,870
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

609
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:49,790
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

610
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,540
You let my father die.

611
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,460
You're too old to protect anybody.

612
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,460
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

613
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,050
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

614
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,890
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade

615
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,060
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defend!

616
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,060
Careful, ser.

617
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,270
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

618
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,900
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

619
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,730
with servants
to look after your every need.

620
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,820
A hall to die in
and men to bury me.

621
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,410
I am a knight.

622
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,540
I shall die a knight.

623
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,590
A naked knight, apparently.

624
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:55,690
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

625
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:01,940
Here, boy!

626
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,650
Melt it down and add it to the others.

627
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,250
If any man in this hall
has other matters

628
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,050
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

629
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,640
or go forth and hold his silence.

630
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,600
Your Grace.

631
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,810
Come forward, my lady.

632
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,650
The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

633
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,360
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

634
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,400
I do.

635
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,700
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

636
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,420
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

637
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,670
Treason is a noxious weed.

638
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,840
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

639
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,630
I want to hear what she says.

640
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,680
Thank you, Your Grace.

641
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,350
Do you deny your father's crime?

642
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:18,230
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.

643
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,980
All I ask is mercy.

644
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,730
I know my lord father
must regret what he did.

645
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,860
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

646
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,650
You all know he loved him.

647
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:32,490
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

648
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,370
They must have lied to him -
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.

649
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,330
They must have lied!

650
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,830
He said I wasn't the king.

651
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,170
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

652
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,260
Maester Pycelle
was giving him milk of the poppy.

653
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,180
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

654
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,220
A child's faith.

655
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,640
Such sweet innocence.

656
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:03,520
And yet they say wisdom
oft comes from the mouths of babes.

657
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,150
Treason is treason!

658
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,490
Anything else?

659
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:18,790
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

660
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,040
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

661
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,800
Your sweet words have moved me.

662
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,850
But your father has to confess.

663
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:42,440
He has to confess
and say that I'm the king...

664
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,440
or there'll be no mercy for him.

665
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,070
He will.
