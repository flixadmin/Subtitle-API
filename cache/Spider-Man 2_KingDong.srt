1
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,977
<i>She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.</i>

2
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:10,274
<i>Oh, boy. If she only knew 
how I felt about her.</i>

3
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,292
<i>But she can never know.</i>

4
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.</i>

5
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:18,096
<i>A life she can never be a part of.</i>

6
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:19,842
<i>Who am I?</i>

7
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,451
<i>I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.</i>

8
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:25,764
<i>And I'm Peter Parker, 
and I, too, have a job.</i>

9
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,373
Parker. Parker!

10
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,792
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

11
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,022
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

12
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,252
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

13
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,677
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

14
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:42,531
Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order.

15
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,247
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

16
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:49,263
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

17
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,441
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas,

18
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,294
but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

19
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,839
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

20
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,779
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

21
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:04,717
This is your last chance.

22
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:10,021
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

23
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,786
Go!

24
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,193
Hey, what, are you stupid?

25
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,301
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

26
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:12,587
I'm gonna get it!

27
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,589
Hey, you guys. No playing in the streets.

28
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:32,003
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

29
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,753
See you.

30
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,356
Way to go, Spidey!

31
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:30,573
Pizza time.

32
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,521
You're late.

33
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,948
I'm not paying for those.

34
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:01,573
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

35
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:06,885
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

36
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,871
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

37
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,249
You're fired. Go.

38
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:12,179
- Please, I need this job.
- You're fired.

39
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:14,018
Look, give me another chance.

40
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:24,602
You're fired.

41
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,507
Parker, hello. You're fired.

42
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,198
Why?

43
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:28,724
Dogs catching Frisbees?

44
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,259
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

45
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,300
- Boss.
- Not now.

46
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,448
I was thinking maybe the Bugle could
show another side of New York for a change.

47
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:38,362
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

48
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,111
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you because...

49
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,229
Still not now!

50
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,981
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

51
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,432
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.

52
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:49,932
A fact I'm very proud of.

53
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:53,751
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

54
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,483
It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.

55
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:57,786
Thanks for the good news.

56
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,307
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

57
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,501
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

58
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,378
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

59
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,256
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

60
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,299
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

61
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,522
Some food got poisoned?

62
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:13,802
I'm a little nauseous, yeah.

63
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,661
All right, Mr. Jameson.

64
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,647
It stinks.

65
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,432
Robbie, there's your page one.
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

66
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,136
I told you, he's not a menace.

67
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:23,837
And I told you...

68
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,964
I'll take care of it.

69
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:26,108
I'll give you 150.

70
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:26,909
Three hundred.

71
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,300
That's outrageous.

72
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,284
Done. Give this to the girl.

73
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,042
Thank you. Bye-bye.

74
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,612
Hi.

75
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,472
Hey, Pete.

76
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,925
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

77
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,565
- Right.
- Sorry.

78
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,026
Hey.

79
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,069
Chin up, okay?

80
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,667
Watch it, jerk!

81
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,401
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

82
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:17,968
Where were you headed, Parker?

83
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:19,618
To your class.

84
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,477
My class is over.

85
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,854
See me standing here?

86
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:27,917
I'm sorry. I'm trying. I wanna be here.

87
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,276
Then be here.

88
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:35,382
Look at you, Peter. 
Your grades have been steadily declining.

89
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:39,992
You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.

90
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,725
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

91
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,919
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

92
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:50,112
Planning is not a major at this university.

93
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,594
Octavius is a friend of mine.

94
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,875
Better do your research, Parker.

95
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,433
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

96
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,100
Surprise!

97
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,795
Well, say something.

98
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:28,603
What's the occasion?

99
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,213
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

100
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,550
Whether you want to remember it or not.

101
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,904
He lives in another reality.

102
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,363
Don't you, Pete?

103
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,305
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

104
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,182
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

105
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,654
Long time, no see.

106
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,865
So how's the play? I read a great review.

107
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,557
It's going fine. It's going good.

108
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,974
She's brilliant in it.

109
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,666
Harry sent me roses.

110
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,354
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

111
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,824
I've been busy.

112
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,578
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

113
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,848
The less you see of that man, the better.

114
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,567
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

115
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:09,936
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

116
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,193
So how are things going at Oscorp?

117
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,748
They're great.

118
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,326
I'm head of Special Projects. We're
about to make a breakthrough on fusion.

119
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:21,948
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

120
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,265
Thank you.

121
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:27,341
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

122
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,853
I'm writing a paper on him.

123
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:30,165
You want to meet him?

124
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,624
You'd introduce me?

125
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,822
You bet.

126
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,173
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map
in a way my father never even dreamed of.

127
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,157
M.J., could you give me a hand?

128
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,118
She's waiting for you, pal.

129
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:45,180
What do you mean?

130
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,903
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

131
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:49,786
However you want to look at it.

132
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,254
I don't have time for girls right now.

133
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,756
Why, are you dead?

134
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,281
I've been kind of busy.

135
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,114
Taking pictures of your friend?

136
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,302
Could we get off that subject?

137
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,807
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

138
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:05,458
Then be honest with me.

139
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:08,313
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

140
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,460
May.

141
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,310
Oh, what, Ben?

142
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,888
Wait.

143
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,138
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

144
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,722
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

145
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,852
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

146
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,979
Did they have a good time?

147
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,927
I'm sure they did.

148
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,888
- You okay?
- Of course.

149
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,419
But you go home.

150
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:05,246
And be careful. I don't like 
that scooter thing you drive around.

151
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:07,261
I'm worried about you.

152
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:12,666
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

153
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,151
Oh, my. You did?

154
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,508
Oh, well. So?

155
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,876
I'm a little behind.

156
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,552
Everybody is.

157
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,222
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

158
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,907
I'm tired, and you better start back home.

159
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,618
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

160
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,542
You need it more than I do.

161
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,067
No, I can't take that from you.

162
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:40,211
Yes, you can!

163
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,422
You can take this money from me.

164
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,286
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

165
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,813
And don't you dare leave it here.

166
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,610
Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,708
It's just that 
I miss your uncle Ben so much.

168
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:01,579
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

169
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,391
I think to myself at times...

170
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:11,712
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

171
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,853
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

172
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,876
Now...

173
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,498
...you better take 
the rest of your cake home.

174
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,729
Hey.

175
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,176
Hey. You're still here.

176
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,026
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

177
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,391
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

178
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,619
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

179
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,619
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

180
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,696
Oh, boy, yeah.

181
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,221
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

182
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,315
Nothing.

183
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,670
Do you want to say something?

184
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,877
I...

185
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,499
...was...

186
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,731
...wondering if you're still 
in the Village.

187
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,009
You're such a mystery.

188
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,640
Peter.

189
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,663
What?

190
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,597
Happy birthday.

191
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,692
I'm seeing somebody now.

192
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,389
You mean, like a boyfriend?

193
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,280
Well, like I like him.

194
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,826
What?

195
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,833
Nothing.

196
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,333
That's good, you know? Companionship...

197
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,679
May be more than that.

198
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:47,161
More?

199
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:49,509
I don't know.

200
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,095
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

201
00:16:56,273 --> 00:16:57,661
You're coming?

202
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,194
I'll be there.

203
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:01,832
Don't disappoint me.

204
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,653
I won't.

205
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:20,341
Rent.

206
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,599
Hi.

207
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:28,805
Hi. What's "hi"? Can I spend it?

208
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,609
I have a paycheck due this week and-

209
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,261
You're a month late again. Again.

210
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,238
I promise as soon as-

211
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,640
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

212
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,728
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All
I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.

213
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,082
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

214
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:51,184
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

215
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,400
Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.

216
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,532
Hi, Pete.

217
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,682
Hello?

218
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,729
Rent?

219
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,656
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

220
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,682
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

221
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:06,589
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

222
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:08,623
But you need money. You need Oscorp.

223
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,082
Who do we have here?

224
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,799
This is my good friend I called you about.
He got me through high-school science.

225
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:16,799
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

226
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:21,096
Yes, I know what you're doing here, but 
I don't have time to talk to students now.

227
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,846
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

228
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,349
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

229
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,894
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

230
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,276
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize.

231
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,846
We'll see you in Sweden!

232
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,870
Interesting fellow, your friend.

233
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,745
I won't take much of your time.

234
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,542
Parker. Now I remember you. 
You're Connors' student.

235
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:45,947
He tells me you're brilliant.

236
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,253
He also tells me you're lazy.

237
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,831
I'm trying to do better.

238
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,442
Being brilliant's not enough, young man. 
You have to work hard.

239
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,932
Intelligence is not a privilege, 
it's a gift.

240
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:00,125
And you use it for the good of mankind.

241
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:02,034
You want to try it back there?

242
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,428
So is that it?

243
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,873
Yes. My design to initiate 
and sustain fusion.

244
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,311
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

245
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,924
Sympathetic frequencies.

246
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,992
Harmonic reinforcement?

247
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,549
Go on.

248
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,238
An exponential increase in energy output.

249
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,930
A huge amount of energy.

250
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:28,409
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

251
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:31,789
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?

252
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,150
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

253
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,613
This is my life's work.

254
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,299
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

255
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:43,616
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.

256
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:47,019
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

257
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:49,307
You can sleep soundly tonight.

258
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,041
Otto's done his homework.

259
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,336
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

260
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,132
And you need to sleep soundly tonight, 
Otto.

261
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,456
Did Edison sleep 
before he turned on the light?

262
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,135
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

263
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:04,531
Did Beethoven sleep 
before he wrote the 5th?

264
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,917
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

265
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:10,443
Rosie, I love this boy.

266
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,339
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

267
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:16,955
Well...

268
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,737
I don't really know.

269
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,848
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

270
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,117
Leave him alone. Maybe it's a secret love.

271
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,203
Love should never be a secret.

272
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,893
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

273
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,000
...gonna make you sick.

274
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,419
I finally got lucky in love.

275
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:40,052
We both did. But it's hardly perfect.

276
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:41,726
You have to work at it.

277
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,678
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

278
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,099
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

279
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:52,409
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

280
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,105
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

281
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,501
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

282
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,877
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

283
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:03,446
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

284
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,987
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

285
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,619
Poetry.

286
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,331
Never fails.

287
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,759
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

288
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:22,374
Brightest green were all her garments

289
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:24,879
And her hair was like the sunshine

290
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,112
Day by day he gazed upon her

291
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,370
Rent!

292
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:30,364
Where is my money?

293
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,870
You seem jittery tonight.

294
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,230
You never know who's coming.

295
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,464
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

296
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,183
How'd you do that?

297
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,517
Work out, plenty of rest.

298
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:44,518
You know, eat your green vegetables.

299
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,003
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

300
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,116
Come on. Go.

301
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:57,453
Keep it steady.

302
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:21,515
It's a web.

303
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,190
Go, Spidey, go!

304
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,656
We got trouble!

305
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,018
Get me down!

306
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,764
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

307
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:01,083
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

308
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,519
Then you think we should forgive them?

309
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,982
Yes.

310
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,068
I mean, no.

311
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,660
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

312
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,662
Whatever.

313
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,584
Shoelace.

314
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,889
You might want to...

315
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:37,541
Can I help you?

316
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,697
Yeah, I've come to see the show.

317
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:44,701
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be seated 
after the doors are closed.

318
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:47,795
It helps maintain the illusion.

319
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:52,810
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

320
00:26:52,835 --> 00:26:54,336
But not to come late.

321
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,639
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the-

322
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,015
You sure you don't wanna come tonight?

323
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,416
Yeah, I'm sure.

324
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:50,535
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

325
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,269
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

326
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,191
May I have an autograph, please, miss?

327
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,300
What are you doing here?

328
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:16,579
You hungry?

329
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:17,855
Starved.

330
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:09,813
What was that?

331
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,126
Okay.

332
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,795
Cool Spidey outfit.

333
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:00,818
Thanks.

334
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,329
Where'd you get it?

335
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:06,920
I made it.

336
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,494
Looks uncomfortable.

337
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,935
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

338
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:22,223
And it rides up in the crotch 
a little bit too.

339
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,806
Hi. It's me. Sing your song at the beep.

340
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,835
Hi, M.J. This is Peter.

341
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,313
I was on my way to your show and...

342
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,109
Well, I was on my bike...

343
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,556
Are you there?

344
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:38,126
I really was planning on it all day.

345
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:40,912
And...

346
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,110
...I know you predicted I'd disappoint you.

347
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:46,227
Bingo.

348
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:49,556
It's amazing, isn't it?

349
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:53,199
How complicated a simple thing...

350
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:58,441
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

351
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:06,329
Actually, there was this obnoxious usher.

352
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:10,010
Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J.

353
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:16,126
Your time has expired. Please deposit 
50 cents for the next five minutes.

354
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,043
I wanna tell you the truth.

355
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,458
Here it is.

356
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:34,345
I'm Spider-Man.

357
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:36,719
Weird, huh?

358
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:41,056
Now you know why I can't be with you.

359
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:46,907
If my enemies found out about you...

360
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:52,801
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

361
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,729
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

362
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:14,676
Ladies and gentlemen,

363
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:18,557
my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

364
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:19,768
But first,

365
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:24,491
before we start, has anybody lost a large
roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

366
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:26,958
Because we found the rubber band.

367
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:32,959
It's a terrible joke.

368
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:34,735
But thank you for coming.

369
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:41,101
Today, you will witness the birth of
a new fusion-based energy source.

370
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:46,639
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

371
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,237
And now let me introduce my assistants.

372
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,037
These four actuators were developed

373
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:05,655
and programmed for the sole purpose of
creating successful fusion.

374
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,350
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

375
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:57,678
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

376
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:00,824
Nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum,

377
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:05,467
allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction

378
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:08,420
in an environment
no human hand could enter.

379
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:12,881
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence in
the arms is as advanced as you suggest,

380
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,282
couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?

381
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,715
How right you are.

382
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,389
Which is why I developed this inhibitor
chip to protect my higher brain function.

383
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:25,436
It means I maintain control of these arms, 
instead of them controlling me.

384
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,768
And now on to the main event.

385
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,711
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

386
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,026
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

387
00:35:54,162 --> 00:35:57,289
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

388
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:02,358
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp lndustries for providing it.

389
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:04,170
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

390
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:19,546
Ladies and gentlemen...

391
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:24,090
...fasten your seat belts.

392
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:45,262
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

393
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,728
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

394
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,962
Thank you.

395
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:57,121
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

396
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:09,512
The power of the sun...
in the palm of my hand.

397
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:35,298
Keep calm! 
It's only a spike! It'll soon stabilise!

398
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,144
Ladies and gentlemen, 
please clear the room.

399
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,229
We have a containment breach!

400
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,981
Otto, please get back!

401
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,818
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

402
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,821
It will stabilise! It's under control!

403
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,722
I'm in charge here!

404
00:38:04,955 --> 00:38:07,600
It's my money! I'm in con-

405
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,155
This doesn't change anything.

406
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:17,779
What are you doing?

407
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,014
Pulling the plug.

408
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,725
No!

409
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:40,874
Rosie!

410
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:13,212
Watch it.

411
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,786
That was too close.

412
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,624
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

413
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,696
I'm ruined.

414
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,009
I have nothing left, except Spider-Man.

415
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,702
He saved your life, sir.

416
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,436
He humiliated me by touching me.

417
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:37,433
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

418
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,376
What was he doing here anyway?

419
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:58,663
As you can see, molten metal
penetrated the spinal cavity

420
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,526
and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points,

421
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:03,217
including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

422
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,522
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there,

423
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:08,882
so I suggest we cut off 
these mechanical arms, slice up the harness

424
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,381
and, if need be, consider a laminectomy

425
00:40:11,406 --> 00:40:14,971
with posterior spinal fusion 
from C7-T1 to T12.

426
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,288
We're ready, doctor.

427
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,418
Anybody here take shop class?

428
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,311
Help me! Help me!

429
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:22,592
No!

430
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:15,628
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.

431
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,820
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

432
00:43:17,988 --> 00:43:20,782
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

433
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,809
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

434
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:29,082
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

435
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,357
Hoffman!

436
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:34,003
What are we gonna call this guy?

437
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,081
"Dr. Octopus".

438
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:36,380
That's crap.

439
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,989
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

440
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,342
- "Dr. Strange".
- That's pretty good.

441
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:45,247
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus".

442
00:43:45,962 --> 00:43:47,671
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

443
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:51,827
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town. 
"Doc Ock".

444
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:53,018
Genius.

445
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:55,460
What, are you looking for a raise? Get out.

446
00:43:56,272 --> 00:43:57,735
Chief, I found Parker.

447
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,098
Where you been all morning?
Why don't you pay your phone bill?

448
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:02,457
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

449
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:04,046
I heard Spider-Man was there.

450
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,727
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

451
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:09,358
Chief, the planetarium party.

452
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,207
You're un-fired. I need you, come here.

453
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,917
What do you know about high society?

454
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,315
Oh. Well, I...

455
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:15,419
Don't answer that.

456
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:19,006
My society photographer got hit in 
the head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

457
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,135
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

458
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,952
Could you pay me in advance?

459
00:44:32,907 --> 00:44:35,538
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

460
00:44:35,563 --> 00:44:38,190
The planetarium, tomorrow night, 8:00. 
There's the door.

461
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:55,003
My Rosie's dead.

462
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,987
My dream is dead.

463
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,992
And these...

464
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:09,497
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

465
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,710
...along with me.

466
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:24,155
Something...

467
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:27,132
...in my head.

468
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,520
Something talking.

469
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:37,947
The inhibitor chip!

470
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,837
Gone.

471
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:48,974
Rebuild.

472
00:45:52,356 --> 00:45:53,752
No.

473
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:56,643
Peter was right.

474
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,715
I miscalculated.

475
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,349
I couldn't have miscalculated.

476
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:12,402
It was working, wasn't it?

477
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,692
Yes.

478
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,759
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

479
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:25,077
Make it bigger and stronger than ever.

480
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,909
But we need money.

481
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,996
Steal it?

482
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,900
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

483
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:36,816
That's right.

484
00:46:38,697 --> 00:46:41,949
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

485
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,345
We'll do it here.

486
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:51,351
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

487
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:54,017
Nothing will stand in our way.

488
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,687
Nothing!

489
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,826
That's the social security.

490
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:03,921
Yes, I see.

491
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,697
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

492
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:11,083
Yes, but I'm afraid it's just not
sufficient to refinance your home.

493
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,165
Oh, but I'm giving piano lessons again.

494
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,502
You are?

495
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,805
We appreciate that you've just opened up
a new supersaver account with us today.

496
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:33,728
But the fact is you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

497
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,935
Well...

498
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,522
At least we get the toaster.

499
00:47:39,547 --> 00:47:43,479
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

500
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,906
Oh, yes, I see.

501
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,705
Okay.

502
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:56,069
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

503
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:14,849
Peter?

504
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:17,789
Don't leave me.

505
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:21,762
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

506
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,608
Hold it!

507
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,078
Put your arms up! All of them!

508
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,719
Here's your change!

509
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,148
Oh, no. Come on!

510
00:49:16,508 --> 00:49:18,654
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

511
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:19,904
Not anymore.

512
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:52,055
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

513
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,997
Hold your fire!

514
00:49:57,025 --> 00:49:58,099
Don't follow me.

515
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:03,216
Wait a second.

516
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,572
Hand her over.

517
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:23,677
Of course.

518
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,522
Easy, now.

519
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,458
Butterfingers.

520
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,263
Look out!

521
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,779
Help me!

522
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:49,591
Help me!

523
00:50:49,596 --> 00:50:50,669
I'm coming!

524
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,747
Hang on!

525
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,404
Help!

526
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,044
Thank you.

527
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,725
Aunt May.

528
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,037
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

529
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,106
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

530
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,747
Come on.

531
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,482
Shame on you.

532
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,068
There you go.

533
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,745
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

534
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,115
We sure showed him.

535
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,036
What do you mean, "we"?

536
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,542
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

537
00:53:18,953 --> 00:53:20,130
May I?

538
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,509
Sure. Go ahead.

539
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,523
Penny! Over here!

540
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,083
Leave it.

541
00:53:35,594 --> 00:53:38,068
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

542
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:39,599
Why? It's a party.

543
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:42,622
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot

544
00:53:42,647 --> 00:53:45,771
who you thought was gonna take you
with him to fame and fortune?

545
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:48,458
Not to mention your friend the bug.

546
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:50,068
Not tonight, Harry.

547
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,802
Every night! Until I find him, it's 24/7.

548
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,286
Parker!

549
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,390
Parker!

550
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,255
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

551
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,544
Think I'm paying you to sip champagne here?

552
00:54:03,842 --> 00:54:05,801
Get a shot of my wife with the minister.

553
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,118
Beautiful tie.

554
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,450
Get a shot of us with the DA.

555
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,331
Beautiful dress.

556
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,427
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

557
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,005
Wife.

558
00:54:19,404 --> 00:54:21,880
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

559
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:25,195
The committee for
the Science Library of New York

560
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,573
is pleased to present our guest of honour.

561
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:31,350
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

562
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:37,575
The handsome, the heroic, 
the delicious Captain John Jameson.

563
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,495
Hi.

564
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,265
You.

565
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:31,716
Listen, I'm sorry.
But there was a disturbance.

566
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:33,271
I don't know you.

567
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:39,474
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

568
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,022
I've been reading poetry lately.

569
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,537
Whatever that means.

570
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,385
Day by day he gazed upon her

571
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,737
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day-

572
00:55:50,762 --> 00:55:52,435
Don't start.

573
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,865
Can I get you a drink?

574
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,849
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

575
00:55:58,509 --> 00:55:59,958
John.

576
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:04,378
By the way, 
John has seen my show five times.

577
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,405
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

578
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:11,521
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.
Even my father.

579
00:56:12,554 --> 00:56:15,264
He came backstage to borrow cash.

580
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,621
But my best friend, who cares so much
about me can't make an 8:00 curtain.

581
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:26,928
After all these years,

582
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,928
he's nothing to me but an empty seat.

583
00:56:56,475 --> 00:56:59,995
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

584
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,353
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

585
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,243
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

586
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,423
Don't act like you're my friend.

587
00:57:08,065 --> 00:57:10,024
You stole M.J. from me.

588
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:12,407
You stole my father's love.

589
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:18,196
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

590
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,486
Huh? Isn't that right?

591
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,204
Huh, brother?

592
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,391
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know that...

593
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:42,458
...the beautiful Miss Mary Jane Watson
has just agreed to marry me.

594
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,428
What a surprise.

595
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:57,704
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

596
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,610
Oh, no. No!

597
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,099
Why is this happening to me?

598
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,396
You seem very okay to me.

599
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,482
My diagnosis?

600
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,442
It's up here.

601
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:20,199
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

602
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:24,008
There is one dream where...

603
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:25,996
...in my dream...

604
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,541
...I'm Spider-Man.

605
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,379
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

606
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:38,816
So you're Spider-Man.

607
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,094
In my dream.

608
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:44,640
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

609
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,561
Somebody else's dream.

610
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,066
What about this friend?

611
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,738
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

612
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,160
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

613
01:01:04,856 --> 01:01:08,651
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

614
01:01:08,676 --> 01:01:10,582
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

615
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,730
Listen.

616
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:18,183
Maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

617
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,176
That's why you keep falling.

618
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,597
You always have a choice, Peter.

619
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,517
I have a choice.

620
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,613
All the things you've been thinking about, 
Peter...

621
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,285
...make me sad.

622
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,619
Can't you understand?

623
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:49,567
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

624
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:53,500
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

625
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,004
...fairness, justice...

626
01:01:57,509 --> 01:02:00,433
Out of those times, I counted on you

627
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:06,348
to have the courage to take 
those dreams out into the world.

628
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,017
I can't live your dreams anymore.

629
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:13,163
I want a life of my own.

630
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,314
You've been given a gift, Peter.

631
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,860
With great power
comes great responsibility.

632
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,158
Take my hand, son.

633
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,048
No, Uncle Ben.

634
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,386
I'm just Peter Parker.

635
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,889
I'm Spider-Man...

636
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,308
...no more.

637
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,050
No more.

638
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,511
No more.

639
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:33,895
You punk!

640
01:04:33,914 --> 01:04:35,019
Sorry.

641
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:37,252
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

642
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,006
Hurry up!

643
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:59,583
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...

644
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:01,484
Someone, please?

645
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,859
.23 electron volts.

646
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,992
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

647
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,649
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

648
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,652
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all

649
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,779
in a very inexcusable manner.

650
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:35,115
I hope you have not been
leading a double life,

651
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,493
pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

652
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,269
That would be hypocrisy.

653
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,730
Of course, I have been rather reckless.

654
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,074
"I am glad."

655
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:53,723
"I am glad."

656
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:55,583
"I am glad."

657
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,955
Are you glad to hear it?

658
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,934
I am glad...

659
01:06:04,517 --> 01:06:05,976
...to hear it.

660
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:11,613
In fact, now you mention the subject,
I have been very bad in my own small way.

661
01:06:13,649 --> 01:06:16,823
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

662
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,891
You could've told me you were coming.

663
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,393
I was afraid you'd say, "Don't come."

664
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:26,713
You look different.

665
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:32,487
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

666
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,489
I do my homework now.

667
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,496
You wanna get some chow mein?

668
01:06:38,521 --> 01:06:39,897
Peter...

669
01:06:40,394 --> 01:06:41,978
...I'm getting married.

670
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:49,744
I always imagined 
you getting married on a hilltop.

671
01:06:50,165 --> 01:06:51,832
And who's the groom?

672
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,884
You hadn't decided yet.

673
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:00,955
You think just because you saw my play,
you can talk me out of getting married?

674
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:04,621
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

675
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:08,148
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

676
01:07:08,545 --> 01:07:10,129
You're too late.

677
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:12,746
Will you think about it?

678
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:14,105
Think about what?

679
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:16,252
Picking up where we left off.

680
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,967
Where was that?

681
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,494
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

682
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:22,180
I don't think it's that simple.

683
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,498
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

684
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:26,148
You don't understand.

685
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,078
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

686
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,213
I'm different.

687
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,799
Punch me, I bleed.

688
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,519
I have to go.

689
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,900
I'm getting married in a church.

690
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,201
You are different.

691
01:08:15,907 --> 01:08:19,301
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

692
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,699
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

693
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:25,816
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

694
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:29,247
Boss, I got a garbage man here says 
he's got something you might want to see.

695
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:33,191
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

696
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,235
Where the hell did you get that?

697
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,803
In the garbage.

698
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,497
In the garbage?

699
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,286
He must've given up.

700
01:08:44,594 --> 01:08:49,348
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

701
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:53,563
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

702
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:58,526
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

703
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,653
Give you 50 bucks.

704
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,636
I could get more than that on eBay.

705
01:09:01,661 --> 01:09:02,387
All right, 100.

706
01:09:02,411 --> 01:09:04,875
Miss Brant, give this man his money
and throw in a bar of soap.

707
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,642
Your wife is still on that line.

708
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:10,733
Flowers? How much?

709
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,649
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

710
01:09:14,674 --> 01:09:15,925
Get plastic.

711
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,508
Gotta go, big story.

712
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,643
Come on, man. Get the money.

713
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,742
Come on, come on.

714
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:56,875
Help!

715
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,197
Come on!

716
01:10:08,266 --> 01:10:13,291
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.
He was a peaceful man.

717
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,672
And it was all my doing.

718
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:54,058
Aunt May. 
You don't have to punish yourself.

719
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,126
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

720
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,656
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway

721
01:10:59,681 --> 01:11:01,848
and he wanted to drive you.

722
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:04,832
If only I had stopped him.

723
01:11:05,315 --> 01:11:08,484
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

724
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,945
I'm responsible.

725
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,994
For what?

726
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:34,166
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

727
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,767
But you were at the library.

728
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,793
You were doing your homework.

729
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,088
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

730
01:11:42,846 --> 01:11:44,602
What do you mean?

731
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,111
I went someplace else.

732
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,008
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

733
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:57,229
...to buy a car, because I wanted to
impress Mary Jane.

734
01:11:59,263 --> 01:12:01,305
It happened so fast.

735
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:06,263
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

736
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,324
The thief...

737
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,327
...was running towards me.

738
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:16,706
I could've stopped him, but I wanted...

739
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:18,960
...revenge.

740
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:22,625
I let him go.

741
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,342
I let him get away.

742
01:12:33,165 --> 01:12:37,435
He wanted a car.
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

743
01:12:38,695 --> 01:12:41,947
Uncle Ben said no...

744
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,610
...and then he shot him.

745
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,867
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

746
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,581
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

747
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,043
And I...

748
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,549
I held his hand...

749
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:09,718
...when he died.

750
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,270
I've tried to tell you so many times.

751
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,953
Just one more little chore.

752
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:27,962
Where are you?

753
01:14:30,064 --> 01:14:32,591
I'm leaving for the night, sir.

754
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:33,900
Fine.

755
01:14:33,925 --> 01:14:36,904
Your father only obsessed over his work.

756
01:14:36,929 --> 01:14:38,513
Good night, Bernard.

757
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:33,349
Hello, Harry.

758
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,697
Otto. What do you want?

759
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,005
That precious tritium.

760
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,498
But I need more of it this time.

761
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:46,207
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

762
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:52,051
Hey! Hey!

763
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,521
Stop! Stop! All right!

764
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:59,213
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

765
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,685
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

766
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:17,427
On second thought, bring him to me alive.

767
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:18,974
How do I find him?

768
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:21,127
Peter Parker.

769
01:16:21,151 --> 01:16:22,013
Parker?

770
01:16:22,038 --> 01:16:24,289
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

771
01:16:24,314 --> 01:16:25,959
Make him tell you where he is.

772
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:32,921
Have it ready.

773
01:16:36,579 --> 01:16:38,163
Don't hurt Peter!

774
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,983
Somebody, help!

775
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,443
Fire!

776
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,705
Alisa, the Chens can't find their daughter.
Have you seen her?

777
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,709
Somebody call the fire department! Help!

778
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,300
Help!

779
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:14,880
Is anybody in that building?

780
01:17:14,905 --> 01:17:17,380
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

781
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:19,388
Hey, where you going?

782
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,031
I'm coming!

783
01:18:06,553 --> 01:18:09,577
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

784
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,230
Come on. Come on.

785
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:13,649
Mama.

786
01:19:26,339 --> 01:19:27,923
You got some guts, kid.

787
01:19:27,948 --> 01:19:32,535
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

788
01:19:32,807 --> 01:19:34,266
Oh, man.

789
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,733
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

790
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,779
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

791
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,454
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

792
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,957
What I need?

793
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,712
What am I supposed to do?

794
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,053
I shouldn't have without...

795
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,805
...knocking.

796
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,978
Come in.

797
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,133
Hi.

798
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:22,567
Hi.

799
01:20:26,144 --> 01:20:28,729
Would you like a piece of chocolate cake?

800
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,219
Okay.

801
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,711
And a glass of milk?

802
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,126
That would be nice.

803
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:43,485
Okay.

804
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:05,763
Thank you.

805
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,700
You got a message.

806
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,369
It's your aunt.

807
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,740
Thanks.

808
01:21:33,365 --> 01:21:34,698
What's going on?

809
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,559
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

810
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:42,287
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

811
01:21:42,749 --> 01:21:44,166
Why didn't you tell me?

812
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,485
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

813
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:52,740
And Henry Jackson across the street is
giving me a hand and I'm giving him $5.

814
01:21:52,765 --> 01:21:54,224
That's Henry Jackson?

815
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:57,554
Yes. It's funny what happens in two years.

816
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,998
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

817
01:22:02,574 --> 01:22:05,943
Listen, about my last visit...

818
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,466
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

819
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:13,078
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

820
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:20,521
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

821
01:22:20,546 --> 01:22:22,422
And I'm proud of you.

822
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:25,948
And I thank you, and I...

823
01:22:27,098 --> 01:22:29,433
I love you, Peter.

824
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:33,201
So very, very much.

825
01:22:52,775 --> 01:22:55,404
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

826
01:22:55,952 --> 01:22:59,154
Those dreadful things? I gave those away.

827
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,900
I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.

828
01:23:03,924 --> 01:23:05,404
Thank you, Henry.

829
01:23:05,429 --> 01:23:06,971
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

830
01:23:06,996 --> 01:23:08,545
You're getting tall.

831
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:12,698
Henry, why don't you put those cookbooks 
in with the mixer?

832
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:13,932
Okay.

833
01:23:13,957 --> 01:23:16,123
You take Spider-Man's pictures, right?

834
01:23:16,856 --> 01:23:18,148
I used to.

835
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:19,800
Where is he?

836
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:24,295
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

837
01:23:25,902 --> 01:23:27,444
He...

838
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:30,748
...quit.

839
01:23:30,893 --> 01:23:32,053
Why?

840
01:23:32,929 --> 01:23:34,967
Wanted to try other things.

841
01:23:34,992 --> 01:23:36,617
He'll be back, right?

842
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,302
I don't know.

843
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,709
You'll never guess who he wants to be.

844
01:23:44,044 --> 01:23:45,803
Spider-Man.

845
01:23:45,981 --> 01:23:47,010
Why?

846
01:23:47,034 --> 01:23:49,859
He knows a hero when he sees one.

847
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:56,161
Too few characters out there, flying
around like that, saving old girls like me.

848
01:23:56,186 --> 01:23:59,980
And Lord knows, 
kids like Henry need a hero.

849
01:24:00,005 --> 01:24:05,539
Courageous, self-sacrificing people
setting examples for all of us.

850
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,529
Everybody loves a hero.

851
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:12,326
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

852
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:16,610
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours

853
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:21,873
just to get a glimpse of the one who
taught them to hold on a second longer.

854
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:26,560
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

855
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,146
...that keeps us honest...

856
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,482
...gives us strength...

857
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,693
...makes us noble...

858
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:38,322
...and finally allows us to die with pride.

859
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:46,585
Even though sometimes we have to be steady
and give up the thing we want the most.

860
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,251
Even our dreams.

861
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:57,471
Spider-Man did that for Henry
and he wonders where he's gone.

862
01:24:58,548 --> 01:25:00,466
He needs him.

863
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:09,645
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

864
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,273
But don't strain yourself.

865
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,873
Okay.

866
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,046
Strong focus on what I want.

867
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,428
I'm back!

868
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:08,381
I'm back!

869
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,154
My back.

870
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,474
My back.

871
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:58,011
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

872
01:26:58,547 --> 01:26:59,797
Peter Parker?

873
01:27:01,904 --> 01:27:03,154
Positive.

874
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:04,873
Thought he was your pal.

875
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:06,998
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

876
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,850
He's just a great big jerk.

877
01:27:11,137 --> 01:27:12,930
The world's full of great big jerks.

878
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:16,160
You're adorable.

879
01:27:16,577 --> 01:27:18,161
It's just the uniform.

880
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,756
Lean your head back for me.

881
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,271
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

882
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,077
Just put my head back?

883
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,240
Okay.

884
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,857
Wow.

885
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,561
I'm back on the moon.

886
01:28:00,137 --> 01:28:01,637
You up there with me?

887
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:23,752
Hiya.

888
01:28:23,776 --> 01:28:25,701
- Surprised?
- Very.

889
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:28,052
Thanks for coming.

890
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:29,912
Everything okay?

891
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,057
You might say so.

892
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:38,145
This is funny. I'm not sure how to begin.

893
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:43,275
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

894
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:44,759
Tell me about it.

895
01:28:44,784 --> 01:28:47,571
Well, mine did a real number on me.

896
01:28:49,117 --> 01:28:52,786
Some part of me heard what you had to say
after the show that night,

897
01:28:52,811 --> 01:28:54,896
that you were different.

898
01:28:55,151 --> 01:28:56,622
But I didn't want to listen.

899
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,333
I was afraid to trust you.

900
01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:04,162
But I've been thinking about it-

901
01:29:04,187 --> 01:29:07,856
Listen, there's more for me to say.

902
01:29:11,624 --> 01:29:15,992
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

903
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,686
Wait a minute. What are you saying?

904
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,076
I'm saying...

905
01:29:27,292 --> 01:29:30,294
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

906
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,366
...but I can't.

907
01:29:35,701 --> 01:29:38,953
My mind was playing tricks too.

908
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,338
Do you love me, or not?

909
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:55,014
I...

910
01:29:58,262 --> 01:29:59,512
...don't.

911
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,029
You don't.

912
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,077
Kiss me.

913
01:30:19,218 --> 01:30:20,718
Kiss you?

914
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,875
I need to know something.

915
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,004
Just one kiss.

916
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,717
What's happening?

917
01:31:26,577 --> 01:31:28,202
Peter Parker...

918
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,818
...and the girlfriend.

919
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,662
What do you want?

920
01:31:35,785 --> 01:31:38,134
I want you to find your friend Spider-Man.

921
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,920
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

922
01:31:40,945 --> 01:31:42,772
I don't know where he is.

923
01:31:44,447 --> 01:31:46,031
Find him.

924
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,725
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

925
01:31:51,302 --> 01:31:53,650
If you lay one finger on her...

926
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:55,008
You'll do what?

927
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:12,503
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

928
01:33:12,528 --> 01:33:14,201
Sorry, Jonah.

929
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:16,858
It's all my fault.

930
01:33:18,561 --> 01:33:21,196
I drove Spider-Man away.

931
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:24,389
He was the only one 
who could've stopped Octavius.

932
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:27,100
Yes.

933
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,105
Spider-Man was a hero.

934
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,397
I just couldn't see it.

935
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:38,278
He was a...

936
01:33:38,483 --> 01:33:40,975
A thief! A criminal!

937
01:33:41,623 --> 01:33:45,136
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

938
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,348
I want that wall-crawling arachnid 
prosecuted!

939
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,541
I want him strung up by his web!

940
01:33:51,897 --> 01:33:54,889
I want Spider-Man!

941
01:34:23,077 --> 01:34:24,452
Where is she?

942
01:34:24,477 --> 01:34:27,193
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

943
01:35:18,395 --> 01:35:19,443
What the hell?

944
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,467
You have a train to catch.

945
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:30,779
Help!

946
01:37:31,004 --> 01:37:35,764
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

947
01:37:54,393 --> 01:37:55,377
It's Spider-Man.

948
01:37:55,401 --> 01:37:56,936
Oh, my God, this is it!

949
01:37:56,961 --> 01:37:58,681
Tell everyone to hang on!

950
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,582
Brace yourselves!

951
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,022
Any more bright ideas?

952
01:38:24,296 --> 01:38:26,631
I got a few, yeah!

953
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:49,881
Whoa, watch out!

954
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:21,858
We're slowing down.

955
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,146
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

956
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,649
Slower. Gently.

957
01:40:35,912 --> 01:40:37,245
Is he alive?

958
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:44,165
He's... just a kid.

959
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:46,998
No older than my son.

960
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:08,144
It's all right.

961
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,401
We found something.

962
01:41:23,637 --> 01:41:25,680
We won't tell nobody.

963
01:41:39,369 --> 01:41:41,871
It's good to have you back, Spider-Man.

964
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:03,259
He's mine!

965
01:42:04,647 --> 01:42:07,357
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

966
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,853
And me.

967
01:42:09,535 --> 01:42:10,868
Me too.

968
01:42:15,856 --> 01:42:17,204
Very well.

969
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,110
Where do you want him?

970
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:57,837
And the tritium?

971
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:13,812
Yes.

972
01:43:43,892 --> 01:43:46,970
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

973
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,284
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

974
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,540
I can look into your eyes as you die.

975
01:43:57,502 --> 01:43:58,915
Pete.

976
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:00,446
No.

977
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,152
It can't be.

978
01:44:09,664 --> 01:44:10,956
Harry.

979
01:44:12,588 --> 01:44:15,657
Where is she? Where is he keeping her?

980
01:44:17,193 --> 01:44:18,833
He's got M.J.

981
01:44:18,857 --> 01:44:21,431
No. All he wanted was the tritium.

982
01:44:21,987 --> 01:44:23,237
Tritium?

983
01:44:25,209 --> 01:44:27,210
He's making the machine again.

984
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:32,564
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

985
01:44:32,589 --> 01:44:34,060
Now, where is he?

986
01:44:34,084 --> 01:44:35,340
Peter...

987
01:44:36,489 --> 01:44:38,323
...you killed my father.

988
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:47,655
There are bigger things happening here 
than me and you.

989
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:51,159
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

990
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:03,210
Hey!

991
01:45:04,467 --> 01:45:05,780
Hey!

992
01:45:07,593 --> 01:45:09,385
I'm talking to you!

993
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,222
You got what you needed for 
your little science project, now let me go.

994
01:45:13,247 --> 01:45:15,367
I can't let you go, you'd bring the police.

995
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:18,100
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

996
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,881
He's not dead. I don't believe you.

997
01:45:21,906 --> 01:45:22,944
Believe it.

998
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:42,377
Surprise.

999
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:48,194
As soon as you get free-

1000
01:45:50,737 --> 01:45:54,740
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1001
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:57,850
Shut it down, Ock. You're going to 
hurt a lot more people this time.

1002
01:45:57,875 --> 01:46:00,342
Well, that's a risk we're willing to take.

1003
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:02,772
Well, I'm not.

1004
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:37,140
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1005
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:53,914
Run!

1006
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,881
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1007
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:46,379
Now what?

1008
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:18,697
Dr. Octavius.

1009
01:48:22,704 --> 01:48:24,150
We have to shut it down.

1010
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,374
Please tell me how.

1011
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:27,816
Peter Parker?

1012
01:48:31,445 --> 01:48:33,487
"Brilliant but lazy."

1013
01:48:33,861 --> 01:48:35,337
Look at what's happening.

1014
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:38,142
We must destroy it.

1015
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:45,434
I can't destroy it.

1016
01:48:50,587 --> 01:48:52,024
I won't.

1017
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:59,814
You once spoke to me about intelligence.

1018
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:05,371
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1019
01:49:06,925 --> 01:49:08,300
A privilege.

1020
01:49:09,016 --> 01:49:12,101
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1021
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:15,029
Don't listen to them.

1022
01:49:20,822 --> 01:49:22,406
It was my dream.

1023
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:27,359
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady

1024
01:49:27,384 --> 01:49:29,886
and give up the thing we want the most.

1025
01:49:30,645 --> 01:49:32,312
Even our dreams.

1026
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:39,779
You're right.

1027
01:49:47,456 --> 01:49:48,803
He's right.

1028
01:49:50,886 --> 01:49:52,365
Listen.

1029
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:57,279
Listen to me now.

1030
01:49:59,975 --> 01:50:02,459
Listen to me now.

1031
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:09,010
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1032
01:50:10,043 --> 01:50:11,756
It can't be stopped.

1033
01:50:13,057 --> 01:50:15,183
It's self-sustaining now.

1034
01:50:15,452 --> 01:50:16,373
Think!

1035
01:50:16,398 --> 01:50:17,576
Unless...

1036
01:50:18,995 --> 01:50:20,717
The river.

1037
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:23,467
Drown it.

1038
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:27,033
I'll do it.

1039
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:15,167
No!

1040
01:51:27,047 --> 01:51:28,248
Hi.

1041
01:51:29,272 --> 01:51:30,482
Hi.

1042
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:33,459
This is really heavy.

1043
01:51:57,919 --> 01:51:59,206
M.J.

1044
01:52:00,599 --> 01:52:02,519
In case we die...

1045
01:52:02,598 --> 01:52:04,182
You do love me.

1046
01:52:04,741 --> 01:52:05,991
I do.

1047
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:09,138
Even though you said you didn't.

1048
01:52:11,981 --> 01:52:14,440
I will not die a monster.

1049
01:53:19,835 --> 01:53:21,877
I think I always knew...

1050
01:53:22,807 --> 01:53:24,579
...all this time...

1051
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,550
...who you really were.

1052
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:30,719
Then you know why we can't be together.

1053
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:34,876
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1054
01:53:36,726 --> 01:53:39,437
I can't let you take that risk.

1055
01:53:44,182 --> 01:53:45,557
I will...

1056
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:49,447
...always be Spider-Man.

1057
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:54,702
You and I can never be.

1058
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:44,751
Mary Jane!

1059
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:49,454
Hello?

1060
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:07,084
Who's that?

1061
01:56:07,423 --> 01:56:08,532
Son.

1062
01:56:10,297 --> 01:56:11,681
I'm here.

1063
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:14,329
Dad?

1064
01:56:15,801 --> 01:56:17,790
- I thought you were...
- No.

1065
01:56:18,348 --> 01:56:20,615
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1066
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,181
Now it's your turn.

1067
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:28,272
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.
Now make him pay.

1068
01:56:28,806 --> 01:56:30,375
But Pete's my best friend.

1069
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,026
And I'm your father.

1070
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:34,403
You're weak.

1071
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:39,742
You were always weak. You'll always be weak
until you take control.

1072
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:43,662
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1073
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,081
Be strong, Harry.

1074
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:48,542
Avenge me.

1075
01:56:51,259 --> 01:56:52,005
Avenge me!

1076
01:56:52,029 --> 01:56:53,301
No!

1077
01:59:18,067 --> 01:59:19,443
Call Deborah.

1078
01:59:20,124 --> 01:59:21,663
The caterer?

1079
01:59:22,447 --> 01:59:24,573
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1080
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:08,116
Had to do what I had to do.

1081
02:00:09,934 --> 02:00:11,436
Mary Jane.

1082
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,539
Peter.

1083
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:17,248
I can't survive without you.

1084
02:00:27,251 --> 02:00:29,085
You shouldn't be here.

1085
02:00:30,241 --> 02:00:33,327
I know you think we can't be together.

1086
02:00:33,942 --> 02:00:37,612
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1087
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:41,269
I know there'll be risks.

1088
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:44,486
But I want to face them with you.

1089
02:00:45,529 --> 02:00:48,621
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1090
02:00:49,027 --> 02:00:50,820
...half of ourselves.

1091
02:00:53,398 --> 02:00:54,982
I love you.

1092
02:00:57,231 --> 02:01:00,192
So here I am, standing in your doorway.

1093
02:01:01,872 --> 02:01:04,999
I've always been standing in your doorway.

1094
02:01:12,181 --> 02:01:15,684
Isn't it about time 
somebody saved your life?

1095
02:01:21,524 --> 02:01:23,358
Well, say something.

1096
02:01:25,956 --> 02:01:28,457
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1097
02:01:44,563 --> 02:01:46,314
Go get 'em, Tiger.
