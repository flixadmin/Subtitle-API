easier said than done,

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,076
[Screams]

162
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,456
Overwatch, what
happens to the Cygnus

163
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,596
if I shoot it down?

164
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,200
An accelerant will
augment the effects.

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,475
You need to freeze them.

166
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,676
It worked!
The Cygnus didn't spread.

167
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,136
You got all of them.
You contained it.

168
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,640
Not fast enough.

169
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,152
<i>Star City is reeling tonight</i>

170
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,471
<i>following a horrific
terrorist attack</i>

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,871
<i>perpetrated by its own heroes,
which injured hundreds.</i>

172
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,953
<i>The vigilantes' motives
are still in question.</i>

173
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,321
Dinah: I cannot believe they
still think we're behind this

174
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,392
after everything
we've done for this city.

175
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,190
Well, not everyone.
I'm out on parole thanks to you guys.

176
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,856
Oliver: Look, I know tonight
didn't go as planned.

177
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,936
Rene: That's
an understatement.

178
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,553
That doesn't mean
it's over.

179
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,800
John:
You can't possibly think

180
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,513
Emiko could have
a change of heart.

181
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,875
Laurel: Oliver's right.

182
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,273
What? I'm happy that you two
are on the same side finally.

183
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,856
But how can you be
siding with the woman

184
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,951
who tried to destroy
your life?

185
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,760
She actually did me a favor.

186
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,514
If I hadn't had toyed around
with being Black Siren again,

187
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,353
then I never would
have realized

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,016
that that's not the life
that I want to live.

189
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,760
Maybe Emiko will have
the same realization.

190
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,176
If people were correct
in their thinking

191
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,554
that Laurel and I
couldn't change,

192
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,359
well, we wouldn't be
here helping you.

193
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,616
Curtis: I hope you
guys are right

194
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,633
because Emiko only used
a fraction of the Cygnus.

195
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,633
She has a lot of scary
nightmare bacteria left.

196
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,518
Any idea where she may
be targeting next?

197
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,750
At the moment, everywhere.

198
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,416
Felicity: The detonation signal's
been purposely scrambled,

199
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,616
which means the target
keeps moving.

200
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,155
Yeah. It's like
a whack-a-Cygnus.

201
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,596
[Laughs] Ohh,
I missed you.

202
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,313
Our descrambling
algorithm is working,

203
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,756
but it's going to be
slower than normal.

204
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,136
Roy: Even if you find
the targets,

205
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,456
we still need to find a way to
contain the drones at each site.

206
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,472
Are you all familiar
with the term

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,552
"optimized
cryogenic chambers"?

208
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,835
Oh, no, they aren't.

209
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Yeah. It's just us? OK.

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,196
Basically I was able
to modify

211
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,152
an old portable
freezing device

212
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,556
so that it can contain
the Cygnus on the drones.

213
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,976
Good thing you guys didn't toss
all of my old tech equipment

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,559
when you did the new
bunker upgrades,

215
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,856
which, by the way,
are very cool, so...

216
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,473
- Felicity: Right?
- Rene: OK, look...

217
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,520
Uh, it's not that I don't
have faith in this team,

218
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,756
but if this scary bacteria
gets all over the city,

219
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,718
I got to get Zoe
somewhere safe.

220
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,216
John: OK. Well, Lyla took J.J.
to a secure A.R.G.U.S. location.

221
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,993
She can pick up Zoe
as well.

222
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,117
You have a son,
right? Connor?

223
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,759
- Yeah.
- We'll bring him as well.

224
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Thank you.

225
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,639
Jackpot. I got two
detonation sites.

226
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,576
Oliver: OK, digg, Turner, and I will
go to the water treatment plant.

227
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,796
Roy, Dinah, Laurel,
you go to the convention center.

228
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,056
All right. And I will
stay here with Felicity.

229
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,673
All right. No one die.

230
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,117
- Felicity: "No"... wow. What?
- Curtis: Uh, I'm rusty. Sorry.

231
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,078
Felicity: Well,
I'm glad everyone is safe

232
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,276
to say the least.

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,696
Does anyone need anything?
Do we need any water?

234
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,816
It's very important
to hydrate.

235
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,877
No. And we don't need
any snacks either.

236
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,360
Dinah: According to
the information

237
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,079
William got on Dale's
computer, the ZETAs

238
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
are marching into
Star City tonight.

239
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,096
We have to disable Archer before
they start their mass execution.

240
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,190
Rene: That won't be easy.

241
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
Archer doesn't have
a server room.

242
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,035
Its server is
the actual wall

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,839
outside of The Glades.

244
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,037
Wait.
The ZETAs use Archer to track our DNA.

245
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
They'll know
the second

246
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,256
we get anywhere
close to that wall.

247
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,600
- Mom...
- Hmm?

248
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,776
Why are you making
that face?

249
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,234
I am not
making a face.

250
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,789
This is my face.

251
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,256
I might have put a
backdoor into Archer

252
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
that utilizes
Queen/Smoak DNA

253
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,637
so that you wouldn't
be in the system.

254
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,552
So you basically just
erased me.

255
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
I...

256
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,216
you know, just add that
to the list of lies.

257
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,799
I was
protecting you.

258
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
William: Wait. Hold on.

259
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,633
Yes, what she did may be
overprotective

260
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,313
- and overbearing...
- Yeah.

261
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,520
But it could be the break
that we've been waiting for.

262
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,756
I mean, if Archer
doesn't recognize Mia's DNA,

263
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,416
she could be the key
to shutting it down.

264
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,477
You're right. If Archer
inputs your DNA,

265
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,920
it theoretically
creates an opening

266
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,235
for a virus to be
uploaded.

267
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,696
I mean, I don't know
if it would work.

268
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,536
Alena: Well, even if it did,
Archer only inputs data

269
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,153
to its main server
at one location...

270
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,516
the checkpoint between
Star City and The Glades.

271
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,795
That's where Dale plans

272
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,360
to march the ZETAs
into Star City.

273
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,272
So we go there,
we scan Mia's DNA,

274
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,919
we upload the virus.

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,656
Even with the Archer
blindspots put in place,

276
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
we're way too publicly
recognizable

277
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
to get anywhere near
that checkpoint.

278
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,672
William: I mean,
you can't, but we can.

279
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,592
- No.
- Uh, the... the public

280
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,736
doesn't even know
who we are.

281
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,910
No. It is much
too dangerous.

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,152
Mom, you've trained me
my whole life for this.

283
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,474
Trust me.

284
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,269
Got to hand it to you,
Curtis.

285
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,096
Your containment chamber
worked like a charm.

286
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,960
Nice to know you still
think I'm terrific. Heh!

287
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,150
Heard it. That was bad.

288
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,197
Any luck unscrambling
the detonation signal?

289
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,136
Felicity: Dinah started transmission
at the convention center.

290
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,914
Her data plus your data
should do the trick

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,957
and help us identify
the targets.

292
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,896
OK, perfect. If we can neutralize
the rest of the Cygnus,

293
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
then we can turn our focus
back to Emiko.

294
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Uh-oh.

295
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,359
[Computer buzzing]

296
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
What's happening?

297
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,720
Felicity: OK, so we have
a good news/ bad news situation

298
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,836
going on here, guys,

299
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,435
the bad news being we
just got 15 new targets.

300
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,552
We don't have time to
neutralize that many.

301
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
We might not have to.

302
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,896
All the Cygnus devices are
linked up to the same detonator.

303
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,376
- That was the good news, right?
- Uh-huh.

304
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,616
OK, well, if we destroy
the detonator,

305
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,016
we can neutralize
the rest of the targets.

306
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,633
I'm working on
a location for you now.

307
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,677
Oh, double frak.

308
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,470
It's at Palmer Tech.

309
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,598
Formerly Queen consolidated,
our father's company.

310
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,673
She wants to tear
down our family's legacy.

311
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,036
This is her target.

312
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,918
Call the team.

313
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,514
Two of the Cygnus
dispersement sites

314
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,319
have been compromised.

315
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,310
The Circle,
they're concerned.

316
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,270
Look, they want
to detonate

317
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,795
the remaining
devices now.

318
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
That isn't the plan.

319
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,714
The plan was
only to profit

320
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,519
on the destruction
of Star City.

321
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,593
I mean, this extra
chaos is unnecessary,

322
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,195
especially now with
the D.I.A. Closing in.

323
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,558
Chaos is the point.

324
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,109
Without terror,
there is no profit.

325
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,398
The Circle respectfully
disagrees,

326
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,631
and they worry that your
focus on your brother

327
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,313
has led to our exposure.

328
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,120
Your personal vendetta is only
drawing more attention to us.

329
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,998
I think you...

330
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,878
And the Circle

331
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,997
have forgotten
who their leader is.

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,469
My brother deserves
to suffer

333
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,439
just like I have suffered
all of these years.

334
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,153
And when he sees
his city burn

335
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,357
with his family to blame,

336
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,959
he will.

337
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Overwatch,
we're on-site.

338
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,360
We're in
the telecom suite.

339
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,312
B.C., Laurel, and Wild Dog
are still en route.

340
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,136
I'm picking up over a
hundred heat signatures

341
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,896
in the building, including the penthouse
that is still under construction.

342
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,072
One guess as to where
your sister is.

343
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,256
Roy: She really
knows how to maximize

344
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,634
collateral damage,
doesn't she?

345
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,856
If we try to evacuate the civilians,
we'll blow our cover.

346
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,936
We need to find
that relay trigger

347
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,496
before The Ninth Circle
knows we're here.

348
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,352
Actually, just the device
relaying the signal.

349
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,096
There's a power surge coming
from the room you're in,

350
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,600
so the relay must be
somewhere nearby.

351
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,216
We shut down Emiko's
ability to detonate,

352
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,959
we save the city.

353
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,194
Find
the relay device

354
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,397
and then evacuate
the building.

355
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,634
You going after
Emiko?

356

John:
I've got your back.

357
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,394
Got to go
alone.

358
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,233
Communication is
mission critical.

359
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,277
The last thing we need
are comms failing

360

while we're out there.

361
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,517
While we're
out there?

362
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,034
Sounds like you still
haven't budged

363

on Mia and William
taking the reins.

364
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,314
We are about to
stop a small army

365

from infiltrating
Star City.

366

I can't be the only one
worried about the kids.

367
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,475
Of course
I'm worried,

368
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,119
but I taught Zoe
everything she knows

369
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,793
about being
a hero.

370
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,439
Almost everything.

371
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,512
And now my little girl's
a grown-ass woman

372
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
and one of
the canaries.

373
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,393
I know she can
handle herself.

374
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,757
And your kids,
they're no slouches either, Felicity.

They're like their parents.

This is not

wanted for them.

happy, normal
lives right now.

promised him
I would do.

383

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,076
Yeah, but there's no way
anyone can make it up there

475
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,196
in 4 minutes.

476
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,350
An Archer could.

477
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,796
Felicity:
No way, Mia. Look.

478
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,896
Even if you got up there, you wouldn't
be able to make it back down in time.

479
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,990
You'll die.

480
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,200
Once I'm inside the tower,
can you talk me through it?

481
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,136
You know it's the only way.

482
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,675
If you can get inside,
I can access the system remotely.

483
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,912
- Mia, listen to me!
- Sorry, mom. I have to do this.

484
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,996
Emiko: Beatrice, you don't
have the authority to be here.

485
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,116
The council was promised

486
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,914
the total destruction
of Star City,

487
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,480
not a sibling spat.

488
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,472
And for the first
time in history,

489
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,119
the world knows
of our existence.

490
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,873
The Ninth Circle
answers to me.

491
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,511
Not anymore.

492
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,310
Finish them.

493
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,880
Almost in position.

494
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,275
Ready when you are.

495
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,637
[High-pitched tone]

[Screaming]

497
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
You're still here.

498
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,680
Yeah. I don't leave
my family.

499
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,592
Detonate the building.

500
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,396
[Grunts]

[Zeta screams]

503
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,432
OK. The device is installed.

504
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,696
Now all I have to do is bypass
the encryption protocols,

505
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,757
reconfigure
the detonation commands,

506
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,797
and voila.

507
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,951
[Computer beeping]

508
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Ready when you are.

509
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,839
Take care of mom.

510
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,957
She's already lost so much.

511
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,560
Here goes nothing.

512
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,912
I just started getting
used to having a sister.

513
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,354
I'm not
losing you now.

514
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,397
You have 60 seconds until
that wall goes boom.

515
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Get out of there.

516
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,793
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,115
I know. It's OK.

518
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,795
You need to hide.

519
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,873
[Breathing heavily]

520
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,159
Your family's gonna die.
I made sure of it.

521
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,910
You need to hide
Felicity and the baby.

522
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,150
[Straining]

523
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,435
Emiko.

524
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,831
I... i...

525
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,472
I wanted to be a Queen.

526

Uh-oh. The ZETAs are
back online.

529
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,677
You think?

530
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,039
William:
<i>You have 20 seconds.</i>

531

[Screaming]

532
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,360
So this is what it feels
like to save a city,

533
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,477
minus Palmer Tech
becoming a crater.

534
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,870
No civilian casualties.
That's a win.

535
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,520
Oliver: We really couldn't have
done this without your help.

536
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,795
Thank you.

537
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,631
Laurel, thank you.

538
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,393
Felicity: That
last-minute SCPD assist

539
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,800
really helped
turn the tide.

540
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,752
Oh, well, I'm just
relieved the department's

541
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,416
back on our side
and we can show our faces

542
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,590
- in the city again.
- Yeah.

543
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,832
Turner: Because you proved
this is a team of heroes.

544
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,837
I'm sorry about Emiko.

545
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,235
Thank you. I... I know
I tried to save her.

546
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,920
Oliver, I know this
wasn't how you wanted

547
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,071
her story to end.

548
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,835
Curtis: Hey. I'm sorry.
I hate to save and run.

549
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,434
- Ohh.
- But I have to go back to D.C.

550
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,556
The jeweler called.

551
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,313
The ring I picked out
for Nick is ready.

552
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
You're popping the question?

553
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,456
Yeah. The Holt-anastases are
gonna make it official,

554
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
assuming he says yes.

555
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,136
Of course he'll say yes!
He'd be a fool not to. Oh!

556
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,594
Congratulations.

557
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,736
Any thoughts about what
you're gonna do next?

558
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,816
A man with your
set of skills,

559
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,896
a lot of people
will be looking.

560
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,832
Lyla... well, she's
always looking.

561
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,679
I just want to spend
time with my son,

562
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,274
who I need to get back to.

563
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,079
- Copy that.
- All right.

564
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,395
And then there were six.

565
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,396
Actually, five.
I can't stay.

566
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,358
You're gonna catch
up with Thea?

567
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,750
There's a lot I still
have to figure out.

568
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,832
I killed two
innocent people.

569
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,559
I have to find a way
to atone for that.

570
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,016
Felicity: Well,
since we're on the subject of good-byes,

571
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,679
we have
an announcement, too.

572
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,910
<i>Hmm?</i>

573
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,150
We're stepping back.

574
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,590
<i>We're leaving Star City.
Not forever,</i>

575
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,239
but, uh, for now.

576
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,595
Rene: You just saved
the city.

577
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,120
You don't want to take
a victory lap?

578
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,800
I didn't do anything.

579
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,314
Our team did.

580
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,153
Felicity: The fact that
the city is safe is

581
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,360
the reason why we can leave.

582
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,318
I've spent a long
time thinking about

583
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,471
my legacy as
the Green Arrow.

584
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,512
I always hoped it would
be saving the city.

585
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,916
But now I know that
my greatest legacy...

586
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,920
Is this team.

587
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,434
<i>I started this
mission alone.</i>

588
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,240
<i>I was certain that
I would end it alone,</i>

589
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,955
but the truth of
the matter is that

590
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,553
every bit of success that
I've had along the way

591
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,518
is because
of all of you.

592
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,816
<i>The city is safe because
of your courage,</i>

593
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,071
<i>your compassion,
your selflessness,</i>

594
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
and your loyalty.

595
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,120
Courage, compassion,
selflessness, loyalty.

596
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Oliver, that sounds like
the 4 pillars of heroism to me.

597
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,096
Dinah: <i>We should find a way
to remember them</i>

598
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,477
to symbolize we will all be
there for each other always

599
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
no matter what.

600
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,711
Felicity: <i>Ooh, like
a signal, you know.</i>

601
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,031
One of us is in trouble,
we'll all come running,

602
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,113
including you, Roy.

603
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,351
We should just call it
the mark of four, right?

604
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,560
Felicity: That's brilliant.

605
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,456
Oliver: Man, I really hope
this isn't the last time

606
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,834
we're all in this bunker
together.

607
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,434
Hear, hear.

608
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,796
But it does feel like
the end of an era.

609
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,156
Felicity: <i>OK, well, let's just
try to think of it</i>

610
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,600
as the beginning of a new one.

611
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,315
Star City is a wall-free
zone once again.

612
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,960
Restoring The Glades
won't be easy.

613
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,111
The Glades hasn't been open
to outsiders in years.

614
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,954
Plenty of people will be
trying to take advantage.

615
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,633
Seems like the city's
gonna need heroes.

616
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,995
We were thinking
the same thing.

617
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,976
The four of you are the
heroes that the city needs.

618
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,116
What are you
talking about?

619
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,310
Dinah: <i>Passing the torch.</i>

620
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Zoe, you are a born leader.

621
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,678
And I think you are
more than ready

622
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,513
to rebuild and take control
of the canaries.

623
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,875
I don't understand.

624
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,720
Someone's gonna get blamed
for what happened.

625
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,035
It should be us.

626
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,315
You'll be
fugitives.

627
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,120
We've spent the last two
decades living in hiding.

628
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,953
Going off-grid
won't be new for us.

629
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,952
Wait. I just got you back.

630
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,872
I'm so sorry,

631
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,714
but the four of you
having a future,

632
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,872
that's worth any sacrifice.

Thank you,
both of you.

I should be thanking you.
You got me off that island.

we should really get going.

Um, I'll catch up
with the two of you.

this is home now.

on your family,

you told me that I was the best part of you,
