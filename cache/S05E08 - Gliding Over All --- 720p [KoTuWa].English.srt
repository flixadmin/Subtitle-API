1
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,470
Mr. White?

2
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,470
Hello?

3
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,110
Mr. White,

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,110
the car's been dealt with, sir.

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,790
No one tailed you?

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,870
No, I stayed off the main streets

7
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,870
and kept checking, so....

8
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,430
Joe ask any questions?

9
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,350
I told him RV job, just like you said,

10
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,350
and he totally knew.

11
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,470
It's pretty cool the way they do that.

12
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,470
They just turn a car into a cube.

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,580
So should we deal

14
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,580
with this other thing now?

15
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,230
Yeah.

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,880
Sure.

17
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,270
- I don't want to talk about this.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,270
- Okay.

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,750
It had to be done.

20
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,150
Okay.

21
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,070
All right.

22
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,070
I need to talk to you.

23
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,670
In private.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,950
So, what's the story?

25
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,870
You get to Mike?

26
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,630
He get out safe?

27
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,230
He's gone.

28
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,020
All right.

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,710
Well, what about

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,710
those nine guys in jail?

31
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,630
I mean, they got no reason

32
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,630
not to talk now.

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,430
So, what do we do?

34
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,630
"We"? Who's "we"?

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,310
There is no "we," Jesse.

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,670
I'm the only vote left...

37
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,790
...and I'll handle it.

38
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,150
My client will supply information

39
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,150
relating to the organisation...

40
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,140
...distribution and production of Fring's

41
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,140
methamphetamine enterprise.

42
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,870
We expect all charges to be dropped,

43
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,870
and Dennis not only walks out of here...

44
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,390
...a free man,

45
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,390
but also receives blanket immunity.

46
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,150
For what he'll be furnishing,

47
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,150
this deal is plenty fair.

48
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,910
Best I'd be willing to do

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,910
is queen for a day and reduced charges.

50
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,110
All charges dropped.

51
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,590
Queen for a day and a five-k.

52
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,590
That's the best you're gonna get.

53
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,710
No way. Guys, come on.

54
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,910
You can be a fairy princess,

55
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,910
for all I care.

56
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,480
Where you going?

57
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,950
Shopping for someone who can tell me

58
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,950
something I don't already know.

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,990
Hey, hey.

60
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,630
I got plenty you don't know.

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,630
You seem a little confused.

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,350
This here is a buyer's market.

63
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,630
I got eight other assholes just like you,

64
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,630
four of them within 100 feet from here.

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,190
I also got Dan the lawyer, who'll give me

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,190
the money and Ehrmantraut.

67
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,350
So settle in, Dennis.

68
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,350
Enjoy your new home.

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,950
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.

70
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,910
- So?

71
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,910
- Maybe you should order something.

72
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,150
- Do you want a coffee or something?

73
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,150
- Not just now.

74
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,560
I think this would play better

75
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,560
if you ordered something.

76
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,950
I think this will play just fine,

77
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,950
and I'm not thirsty.

78
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,430
So let's take a look at the list.

79
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,830
Lydia, you've come all this way.

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,830
You do have the list?

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,110
- Yes, I have it.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,110
- Good.

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,190
It's just not written down.

84
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,070
- And why is that?

85
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,070
- It's in my head. Safer there.

86
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,510
I see.

87
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,240
Then I suggest you pick up a pen.

88
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,550
Not just yet.

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,550
It was my understanding

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,550
that attending to these nine names...

91
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,550
...was precisely what you wanted.

92
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,150
Ten names now.

93
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,150
Ten, counting the lawyer.

94
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,590
Yes. Ten, counting the lawyer.

95
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,710
So, what, am I not tying up loose ends

96
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,710
for our mutual benefit?

97
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,710
You're tying up loose ends,

98
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,710
and I don't wanna be one of them.

99
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,070
I give you that list,

100
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,070
I've served my purpose.

101
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,750
Then maybe I'm just one more person

102
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,750
who knows too much.

103
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,260
So you put that list in my hands,

104
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,260
and in your mind...

105
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,070
...I immediately just murder you,

106
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,070
just right here in this restaurant?

107
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,790
- No. Not right here. Of course.

108
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,790
- Here in this public place, immediately?

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,430
- That is not--

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,430
- Listen, Lydia.

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,270
You made me promise on my children's

112
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,270
lives that I guaranteed your safety.

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,990
From Mike.

114
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,670
You guaranteed

115
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,670
I'd be safe from Mike.

116
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,150
There's no way he'd ever go for this,

117
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,150
you getting rid of his guys.

118
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,910
You wouldn't be doing this, the names,

119
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,910
if Mike were still a factor.

120
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,390
Yeah. That's what I thought.

121
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,030
What do you want, exactly?

122
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,230
Because if you don't want

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,230
to give me that list...

124
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,230
...then I've truly got no use for you.

125
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,750
I can grow your business

126
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,750
exponentially.

127
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,110
Just give me the list.

128
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,230
I can do that by helping you

129
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,230
expand into a larger...

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,990
...highly active, highly profitable

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,990
marketplace.

132
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,150
What do you know

133
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,150
about the Czech Republic?

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,640
The Czech Republic?

135
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,390
Did you know there's a higher demand

136
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,390
for meth there than anywhere in Europe?

137
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,630
Five percent of its 10 million people...

138
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,310
...which is roughly the population

139
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,310
of the Southwest...

140
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,070
...from western Texas to Phoenix,

141
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,070
are using meth.

142
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,430
You keep your market here,

143
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,430
but by adding overseas sales...

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,830
...you can more than double

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,830
your current profits.

146
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,870
And I checked. The average purity

147
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,870
is only about 60 percent.

148
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,350
They've never seen

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,350
anything like your product.

150
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,150
You'll blow their hair back.

151
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,150
Shipping internationally

152
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,150
seems like courting disaster.

153
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,350
Not if you're Madrigal.

154
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,430
Madrigal is under investigation

155
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,430
by the DEA.

156
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,430
The restaurant division, mostly.

157
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,950
We've got 46,000 employees

158
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,950
spread across 14 divisions.

159
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,750
And once Mike's people are no longer

160
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,750
a factor, things should tidy up nicely.

161
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,710
This is what I do, you understand?

162
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,270
Move things from point A to point B

163
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,270
all over the globe.

164
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,790
One-point-two million

165
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,790
metric tons a month...

166
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,980
...and all of it right at my fingertips,

167
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,980
a laptop click away.

168
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,310
The Czech Republic....

169
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,590
- Who's on the other end?

170
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,590
- People I ship to regularly.

171
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,870
People I've worked with for years.

172
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,870
Professional and very amenable.

173
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm very careful who I work with.

174
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,990
And if this is such a slam dunk,

175
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,990
then why didn't you pitch it to Fring?

176
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,990
I did. He said yes. We were

177
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,990
in the final stages of working it out...

178
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,640
...when somebody killed him.

179
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,110
You don't think Gus Fring built

180
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,110
his distribution network all by himself.

181
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,910
There are considerable advantages

182
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,910
to diversification of distribution...

183
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,310
...like putting 6000 miles

184
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,310
between you and your product.

185
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,200
At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating

186
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,200
you'll gross about 2 million.

187
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,270
Give me 10 pounds to start,

188
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,270
and we'll see how it goes.

189
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,590
- All right.

190
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,590
- Now, with Fring...

191
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,470
...my end was gonna be 30 percent,

192
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,470
which I believe is more than fair.

193
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,790
- Okay.

194
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,790
- Trust me, if you do this--

195
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,310
Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer.

196
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,070
Now, first things first.

197
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,950
Shake on it?

198
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,430
We're going to make

199
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,430
a lot of money together.

200
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,910
Todd, I think it's time

201
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,910
I meet your uncle.

202
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,230
No iron pile.

203
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,110
There's too many muscle-heads

204
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,110
flexing their shit. Too many eyes.

205
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,550
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.

206
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,230
Well, gonna keep it simple.

207
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,990
Pass-byes.

208
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,750
Yeah. Hallways,

209
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,750
shower room, cells.

210
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
The easy stuff.

211
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,870
I say we go with a riot.

212
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,870
Our boys get it done in a riot.

213
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,630
No, no, no. No chaos.

214
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,310
I don't want the goon squad rolling in

215
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,310
and stealing our shot, you know?

216
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,150
This has gotta be fast and quiet.

217
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,550
Just boom, boom, boom.

218
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,670
- You know what I'm saying?

219
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,670
- Yeah.

220
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,030
Surgical.

221
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,550
Surgical. That's what it's gotta be.

222
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,630
So how many guys we got at MDC?

223
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,270
Three, counting Shattuck.

224
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,270
And he makes the schedule now...

225
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,470
...so we can put who we need

226
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,470
where we need them.

227
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,550
All right. So MDC's covered.

228
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,550
What about the rest?

229
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,550
We need G block in Valencia, right?

230
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,350
Our guy's on the night shift.

231
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,840
- Have him pull a double.

232
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,840
- No.

233
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,350
His supervisor's got

234
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,350
some hard-on about OT.

235
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,670
Have him switch with somebody.

236
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,670
Just get it done.

237
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,030
Regardless, you know, we got

238
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,030
enough guys in Valencia right now?

239
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,990
Might have to hire out.

240
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,470
You high?

241
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,470
Mix blood with chuntaros?

242
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,510
- No way.

243
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,510
- No.

244
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,350
There's no need. We got enough.

245
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,910
Hitters ain't the problem. It's that

246
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,910
short walking window after lunch.

247
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,080
Yeah. It's gonna be tight.

248
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,670
Real tight.

249
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,430
I gotta be straight with you, man.

250
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,430
Taking out all these guys is doable.

251
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,230
But hitting them in three separate jails

252
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,230
all within two minutes?

253
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,910
I mean, whacking bin Laden

254
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,910
wasn't this complicated.

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
Where do you suppose

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
these come from?

257
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,270
I've seen this one before.

258
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,270
I wonder...

259
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,480
...are they all In some giant

260
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,480
warehouse someplace?

261
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,870
Hey.

262
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,510
It can be done,

263
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,510
just not the way you want it.

264
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,390
It can be done exactly how I want it.

265
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,310
The only question is,

266
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,310
are you the man to do it?

267
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,030
Figure it out.

268
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,580
That's what I'm paying you for.

269
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,560
Yo, what's going on, man?

270
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,560
What's that alarm?

271
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,270
What's happening?

272
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,750
What are you doing, man?

273
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,750
No, man, please!

274
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,670
No, man! Help me!

275
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,510
Help me! Help!

276
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,270
Help me!

277
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,070
Ball came in my direction,

278
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,070
batter wouldn't even bother running.

279
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,750
Excuse me a second.

280
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,750
Couple more photos.

281
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,070
Yes?

282
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,830
It's done.

283
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,120
New details have emerged

284
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,120
in the spate of jail deaths...

285
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,710
... that rocked central New Mexico

286
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,710
three days ago.

287
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,990
As of yet, no names of victims

288
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,990
have been released...

289
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,630
... but authorities continue to investigate

290
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,630
what appears to be...

291
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,360
... a carefully coordinated

292
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,360
sequence of attacks...

293
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,990
... that occurred within minutes in

294
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,990
three different correctional facilities....

295
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,070
- Is it okay if I turn this off?

296
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,070
- Oh, sure.

297
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,150
I don't want the news on right now.

298
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,590
Hank just pulled up,

299
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,590
and he's not in the best mood.

300
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,870
- Oh, all right. I'll get out of your hair.

301
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,870
- Okay.

302
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,310
Hi, honey.

303
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,470
Dinner will be in about an hour.

304
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,990
And I thought we could have

305
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,990
that chicken you like.

306
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,870
- Or we could order Chinese.

307
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,870
- Sure.

308
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,790
Here we go.

309
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,710
That fun? Play with your toys?

310
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,030
I'll see you in a little bit, okay?

311
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,030
See you in a little bit.

312
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,510
Hey, Hank.

313
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,510
I was just getting ready to leave.

314
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,110
Something to drink?

315
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,110
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

316
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,950
Perfect.

317
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,080
Hi.

318
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,550
- Rocks, right?

319
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,550
- Rocks, yes.

320
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,550
Been thinking about this summer job

321
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,550
I used to have.

322
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,510
Oh, yeah?

323
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,200
Back in college, I'd spend my days...

324
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
...marking trees in the woods

325
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
with this....

326
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,550
This orange spray can.

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,310
Marking trees?

328
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,230
Yeah. Crews would come in later...

329
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,350
...and find the trees I tagged

330
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,350
and cut them down.

331
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,190
First, you go in and you mark locations

332
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,190
for skid trails and landings.

333
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,080
Then you choose specific trees

334
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,080
all within a selected grid.

335
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,630
Every day...

336
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,790
...I'd go back...

337
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,950
...hike in...

338
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,110
...pick up where I left off.

339
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
Oh, it sounds nice...

340
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,350
...being out in the woods all day.

341
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,710
No, it wasn't so great.

342
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,600
I got sunburned.

343
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,600
There were mosquitoes.

344
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,550
I just wanted to make a few bucks.

345
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,550
Buy beer.

346
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,750
Been thinking about that job

347
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,750
more and more lately.

348
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,790
Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.

349
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,910
Tagging trees is a lot better

350
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,910
than chasing monsters.

351
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,110
I used to love to go camping.

352
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,190
- This way.

353
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,190
- Here, baby girl. Come see your brother.

354
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,270
There you go, sweetie. That's it.

355
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,510
Oh, my God! Look at her go!

356
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,310
- Good job! Good job!

357
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,310
- Over here. Peekaboo. This way.

358
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,550
Let's go see your brother.

359
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,550
Let's get him.

360
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,710
Where'd you go?

361
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,710
I can't see you. Where'd you go?

362
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,910
There you are!

363
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,110
You're really good with her.

364
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,550
Come here, my baby girl.

365
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,590
You're gonna be a handful,

366
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,590
aren't you? Yeah.

367
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,670
Mama's gonna get her exercise.

368
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,910
Hey, do you wanna watch a movie?

369
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,030
Hey, Louis.

370
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,070
One moment.

371
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,950
Nothing. What's up?

372
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,390
Oh, well.

373
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,710
It's so nice to see you smile again.

374
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,310
I mean, you seem good.

375
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,550
Yeah. I'm hanging in there.

376
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,510
To see you laugh like that just now....

377
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,830
It's such an improvement,

378
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,830
don't you think?

379
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,270
I don't-- I don't really....

380
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,190
We've been thinking...

381
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,670
...Hank and I, that it may be time...

382
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,630
...to take the kids home.

383
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,870
It's been almost three months, right?

384
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,790
Almost three?

385
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,430
Does Hank not want--?

386
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,190
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God. No. No.

387
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,150
Hank's crazy for these kids.

388
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,150
You know that.

389
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,710
It goes without saying,

390
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,710
we love having them.

391
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,430
And we're always here for you...

392
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,990
...and wanna help you

393
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,990
any way that we can.

394
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,270
But....

395
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,590
We're starting to worry...

396
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,470
...that maybe....

397
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,510
Maybe we're enabling you.

398
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,310
Sweetie, you've had

399
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,310
a lot on your plate...

400
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,520
...and you and Walt have had a lot--

401
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,590
So much to contend with.

402
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,830
I'm so proud of you for going to therapy.

403
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,830
You know that, right?

404
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,510
It can be so helpful,

405
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,510
such a good tool.

406
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,710
And I'm very, very proud of you...

407
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,470
...but I--

408
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,590
We....

409
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,270
Maybe at this point...

410
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,870
...the best way to help

411
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,870
repair the family...

412
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,350
...would be to repair the family,

413
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,350
you know?

414
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,710
Take a drive with me.

415
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,670
Here. I'll get it.

416
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,430
Walt.

417
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,670
This is it.

418
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,860
This is what you've been working for.

419
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,990
I rented this place and I started

420
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,990
bringing it here because...

421
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,230
...I didn't know what else to do.

422
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,510
I gave up counting it.

423
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,510
I mean, I had to.

424
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,230
It was just so much, so fast.

425
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,510
I tried weighing it.

426
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,470
I figured one bill of any denomination

427
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,470
weighs a gram.

428
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,750
There are 454 grams

429
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,750
to a pound, but....

430
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,390
There's a variety

431
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,390
of denominations, so....

432
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,070
How much is this?

433
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,590
I have no earthly idea.

434
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,990
I truly don't.

435
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,710
I just stack it up...

436
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,390
...keep it dry, spray it for silverfish.

437
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,310
There is more money here...

438
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,470
...than we could spend

439
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,470
in 10 lifetimes.

440
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,800
I certainly can't launder it,

441
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,800
not with a hundred car washes.

442
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,270
Walt...

443
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,110
...I want my kids back.

444
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,870
I want my life back.

445
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,390
Please tell me.

446
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,830
How much is enough?

447
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,190
How big does this pile have to be?

448
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,430
Shit!

449
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,040
Hi.

450
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,840
Hey.

451
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,350
I hope I'm not disturbing you

452
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,350
or anything.

453
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,950
I tried calling, but--

454
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,350
Yeah. No, I tossed all my burners.

455
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,470
And you didn't answer

456
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,470
your home line.

457
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,550
It's disconnected.

458
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,710
Well, unplugged.

459
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,150
I mean, did you leave

460
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,150
a message, or...?

461
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,790
No.

462
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,310
So, what's up?

463
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,990
No, I was just in the neighbourhood,

464
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,990
so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

465
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,590
You wanna come in, or...?

466
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,880
Sure. Thanks.

467
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,350
You know, I'd offer you

468
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,350
a beer or something...

469
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,230
- ...but, you know, I'm out.

470
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,230
- No, no. No, I'm fine, thanks.

471
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,830
You didn't wind up moving, I see.

472
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,910
Didn't have to.

473
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,640
Saul told me what you did.

474
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,920
Anyways, I'm not in jail.

475
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,550
You aren't either, so there you go.

476
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,790
There was no other option, Jesse.

477
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,790
It had to be done.

478
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,510
I'm not coming back.

479
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,390
I know.

480
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,670
So why are you here, exactly?

481
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,910
It's funny, I....

482
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,750
I saw a Bounder the other day.

483
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,670
- Bounder?

484
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,670
- Yeah.

485
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,630
Our RV? A Bounder?

486
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,070
Oh, you saw the same one as ours?

487
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,310
Yeah. Well, I mean,

488
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,310
within a couple of years, I guess.

489
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,830
Early '80s.

490
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,350
It was certainly in a lot better shape

491
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,350
than our old hunk of junk.

492
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,830
Much nicer paint job.

493
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,590
No bullet holes in the door.

494
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,950
Yeah. That thing

495
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,950
was a nightmare, huh?

496
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,510
Yeah. It was primitive.

497
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,310
You know, whenever

498
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,310
I hit a red light, I used to pray...

499
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,670
...it wouldn't crap out on me.

500
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,350
Yeah.

501
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,950
And then, suddenly,

502
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,950
it would sometimes have that....

503
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,590
That screeching sound

504
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,590
just out of the blue...

505
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,240
...like we hit a pack of cats.

506
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,750
Power-steering belt.

507
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,750
That's what that was.

508
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,910
You know, I always had this....

509
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,990
This whole system.

510
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,470
Strategy to not let it idle too low.

511
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,950
Remember that time we ran out of gas

512
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,950
coming back from a cook?

513
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,990
The gauge. It always said half-full.

514
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,350
You walked three miles with a jerrican

515
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,350
while I waited on the side of the road...

516
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,870
...praying the whole time

517
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,870
that no cop would show up...

518
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,630
...no Good Samaritan.

519
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,550
God.

520
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,670
We had money.

521
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,550
Why'd we keep it?

522
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,790
Why did we have to have

523
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,790
the world's shittiest RV?

524
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,870
Inertia?

525
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,390
Yeah.

526
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,230
Inertia.

527
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,710
So, hey, you know, I gotta get going.

528
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,230
- Me too.

529
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,230
- I'm meeting friends.

530
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,710
I gotta get going as well.

531
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,950
I left something for you.

532
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,550
Hey.

533
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,110
I'm out.

534
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,790
I'm out.

535
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,750
With some big earrings,

536
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,750
it could be really nice.

537
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,350
- Perhaps some big hoops.

538
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,350
- I do indeed.

539
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,190
I feel like I want to mix it up

540
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,190
with my hair this summer.

541
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,670
- I don't know, like colours--

542
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,670
- I don't know. Coins.

543
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,830
Did you have a coin collection?

544
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,830
Did you?

545
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,600
I've heard it's very therapeutic.

546
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,990
Coins and baseball cards.

547
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,990
Those were the ones.

548
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,430
You can play around with it,

549
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,430
take them in and out.

550
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,390
Not enough hours in the day, right?

551
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,230
- There's not enough hours.

552
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,230
- My hairstylist told me...

553
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,590
...to take prenatal vitamins.

554
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,190
For your hair?

555
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,590
He said they work,

556
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,590
so I figured why not?

557
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,540
Oh, Flynn, could you put some more

558
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,540
sunscreen on Holly?

559
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,270
Yeah. Is it over there?

560
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,070
- Yeah, it's right here.

561
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,070
- Okay.

562
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,870
- Especially for a home brew, though.

563
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,870
- Paba-free. That's good.

564
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,760
- I don't know why it would be bad.

565
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,760
- Yeah. Me neither.

566
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,990
Oh, do you--? I used to squeeze

567
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,990
lemon juice in my hair.

568
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,390
You remember that?

569
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,310
You wanted to be

570
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,310
a beach bum so badly.

571
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,990
I did.

572
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,150
You and your stiff hair.

573
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,100
- Stiff? Whose stiffy? What?

574
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,100
- Hey, hey.

575
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,910
I was interested

576
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,910
to see you get into that.

577
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,990
- It's like chemistry.

578
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,990
- Borage oil is supposed to be good.

579
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,150
- Better than flaxseed?

580
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,150
- I don't know.

581
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,470
- That's cool. I like your style.

582
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,470
- There is no Christmas.

583
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,710
- Maybe I should brew up a batch.

584
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,710
- Schraderbrau?

585
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,030
- Yeah.

586
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,030
- I vote yes.

587
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,920
- I second that.

588
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,920
- Well, there you go. It's unanimous.

589
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,960
Well, who am I to fly in the face

590
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,960
of public demand, right?

591
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,190
All right.

592
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,430
Anybody want anything?

593
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,430
You want anything?

594
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,030
- No, I'm good. I'm good, thank you.

595
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,030
- Yeah? All right.

596
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,150
Does it look glossier?

597
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,200
Do I have a halo?

598
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,390
- How's she doing?

599
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,390
- She's good.

600
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,790
Yeah? Try not to put any

601
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,790
of the sunscreen on her fingers.

602
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,670
"To W. W. My star, my perfect silence."

603
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,070
W. W.

604
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,950
I mean, who do you figure that is?

605
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,830
Woodrow Wilson?

606
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,550
Willy Wonka?

607
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,910
Walter White?

608
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,550
You got me.
