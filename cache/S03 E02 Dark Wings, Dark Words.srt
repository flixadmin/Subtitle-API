1
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,372
Jon: Don't think too much, bran.

2
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,084
Relax your bow arm.

3
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,261
Ned: And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

4
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,388
Father?

5
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,809
You can't kill it, you know.

6
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,234
Why not?

7
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,863
Because the raven is you.

8
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,999
Hodor

9
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,626
it's all right, hodor.

10
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,504
Hodor.

11
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,886
Osha: Were you
inside the wolf again, little lord?

12
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,639
No, it was the three-eyed raven.

13
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,142
He's back.

14
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,270
I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.

15
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,481
- There was a boy.
- Osha: I don't want to hear about it.

16
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,292
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.

17
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,861
We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.

18
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,239
I didn't ask for black magic dreams.

19
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,688
I know you didn't, little lord.

20
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,496
We need to move. We don't know
who might be after us.

21
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,081
No one knows we're alive.

22
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,168
And who told you that?

23
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,587
The three-eyed raven tell you?

24
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,172
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

25
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,844
I don't know what people know and don't.

26
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,680
I only know the wall is a long way off.

27
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,694
My mother always
told me you westerosi were a grim lot.

28
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,115
Grim, bearded,

29
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,744
stinking barbarians
that would row across the narrow sea

30
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,080
and steal us from our beds.

31
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,666
Did you ever think you'd marry one?

32
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,545
I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.

33
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,422
Never?

34
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:03,595
Not until I met the king
of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.

35
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,937
Bolton: Pardon me, your grace.

36
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,064
My queen.

37
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,524
Talisa: Lord Bolton.

38
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,569
Let me guess which is the good news.

39
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,659
Word from riverrun and winterfell.

40
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,500
I hadn't seen him in years.

41
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,546
I don't even know how many.

42
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,174
We'll travel to the funeral together.

43
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,804
Lord Bolton will Garrison
here until we return.

44
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,266
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

45
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,190
Something else?

46
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,112
Before Bolton's bastard got to
winterfell, the ironborn were gone.

47
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,951
They massacred everyone
and put the castle to the torch.

48
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,081
And bran and rickon have not been found.

49
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,961
They may have escaped.

50
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,716
Or theon may have taken
them to the iron islands as hostages.

51
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,885
Have you received any demands?

52
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,432
Have you heard anything from theon at all?

53
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,830
Where am I?

54
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,339
Who are you?

55
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,220
What do you want?

56
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,181
I want to do this.

57
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,606
Do you know how
long it'll take to get to king's landing

58
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,316
walking through fields and forests?

59
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,026
Yes.

60
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,987
How shall we pass the time?

61
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,031
By putting one foot in front of the other.

62
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,033
It's going to be a very dull walk.

63
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,660
I'm here to take you to king's landing

64
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,371
and bring back
lady stark's daughters in exchange.

65
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,414
Dull is fine.

66
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,542
You know, it doesn't matter
how onal a servant you are,

67
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,379
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

68
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,838
Trust me on this.

69
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,132
People have been serving me
since I was born.

70
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,344
You think lady stark
is going to want a giant towheaded plank

71
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,846
following her around
for the rest of her life?

72
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,225
A week's journey with you
and she'll order you to fall on your sword.

73
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,145
If lady stark is
unhappy with any aspect of my service,

74
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,524
I'm sure she'll let me know.
She's an honest woman.

75
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,526
For all the good it's done her.

76
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,627
How did you come into lady stark's service?

77
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,494
There's something we can talk about.

78
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,162
Not your concern, kingslayer.

79
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,999
It had to be recently.
You weren't with her at winterfell.

80
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,543
How would you know?

81
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,629
Because I visited winterfell.

82
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,341
I would have noticed your dour
head smacking into the archways.

83
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,426
Move.

84
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

85
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,646
Ah, renly. Really?

86
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,231
He wasn't fit to rule over anything

87
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,858
more important than a 12-course meal.

88
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,609
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

89
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,946
I lived with him at
court since he was a boy, don't forget.

90
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,198
Could hardly escape the little tulip.

91
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,201
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

92
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,745
I knew him better than you.

93
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,788
I knew him as well as anyone.

94
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,375
As a member of his kingsguard,
he trusted me with everything.

95
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,769
He would have been a wonderful king.

96
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,104
Sounds like you quite fancied him.

97
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,714
I did not fancy him.

98
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,798
Oh, gods, you did.

99
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,970
Did you ever tell him? No, of course not.

100
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,849
You weren't renly's type, I'm afraid.

101
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,561
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like loras Tyrell.

102
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,146
You're far too much man for him.

103
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,898
I'm not interested in foul rumors.

104
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,233
Unless they're about me.

105
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,402
It's all true about renly.

106
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,405
His proclivities
were the worst kept secret at court.

107
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,341
It's a shame
the throne isn't made out of cocks.

108
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,784
They'd have never got him off it.

109
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,327
Shut your mouth!

110
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,083
I don't blame him.
And I don't blame you, either.

111
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,462
We don't get to choose who we love.

112
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,283
Man: Where are you headed, then?

113
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,475
South.

114
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,644
- You?
- Riverrun.

115
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,939
Staying off the king's road, are you?

116
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,690
They get you no matter where you go.

117
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,858
You can't win.

118
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,026
No, you really can't.

119
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,820
Looks like you're safe enough.

120
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,740
Meaning no offense, my lady, but
I wouldn't tangle with you.

121
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,702
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

122
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,461
Jaime: He knows who I am.

123
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,796
He doesn't.

124
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,925
Maybe you're right. What if you're
not? What if he tells someone?

125
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,054
We're not doing it.

126
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,348
He's an innocent man.

127
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,934
More innocent than lady stark's daughters?

128
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,823
Make it tighter here.

129
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,284
Mmm. That's better.

130
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,221
It makes you look very strong.

131
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,246
No flowers.

132
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,708
I said no flowers.

133
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,170
All these are wrong. Bring others.

134
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,088
Yes, your grace.

135
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,427
Bloody flowers. On the king.

136
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,264
Looks like a Tyrell Rose.
Give it to margaery for her wedding gown.

137
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,851
Should be more than enough fabric.

138
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,941
Tell me what you think of her.

139
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,067
Who?

140
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,528
Margaery.

141
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,280
She's an ideal match.

142
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,367
With the tyrells beside us,
we'll crush the northerners.

143
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:46,122
Hang their lords, burn their
strongholds, sow their fields with salt,

144
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,709
and no one will think
of rebelling for another century.

145
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,130
It is a good match,
but what do you think of her?

146
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,928
She's beautiful and intelligent.

147
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,013
Yes, she is.

148
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,723
Her concern with the well-being

149
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,516
of the common people is interesting.

150
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,019
Not to me.

151
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,315
I only meant
to go out of your way to endanger...

152
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:17,153
This is becoming one of the
most boring conversations I've ever had.

153
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,160
Margaery Tyrell dotes
on filthy urchins for a reason.

154
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,622
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.

155
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,457
Married a traitor and known degenerate

156
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,292
like renly Baratheon for a reason.

157
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,837
She married renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

158
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:39,676
That's what
intelligent women do. What they're told.

159
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,055
You need to ask yourself...

160
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,890
I don't need to do anything.

161
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,112
Better.

162
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,865
Much better.

163
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,159
I still don't believe it.

164
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,911
He didn't want anything.

165
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,456
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

166
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,336
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.

167
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,550
Littlefinger's not in love with me.

168
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,596
Love is not the thing he wants.

169
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,808
He's too old.

170
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,893
They never see it that way.

171
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,984
He didn't ask you to do something for him?

172
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,236
Spy on someone or...

173
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,457
If he does ask you for
anything or try anything

174
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,917
or touch you, I want you to tell me.

175
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,213
Why? What will you do?

176
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,965
I will make him stop.

177
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,094
Guard: Ser loras Tyrell, my lady.

178
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,430
Send him in.

179
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,191
Lady sansa.

180
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,609
Ser loras.

181
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,445
My sister invites you to take the
air with her and our grandmother,

182
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,781
the lady olenna, in the gardens.

183
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,450
May I escort you to them?

184
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,377
I believe you
grow more beautiful every day, lady sansa.

185
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,545
You are too kind, ser loras.

186
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,300
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

187
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,806
At the hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

188
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,893
A Rose, a red Rose.

189
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,103
Of course I did.

190
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,983
It's more your color. You take it.

191
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,652
Thank you.

192
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,404
You're such a dear.

193
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,864
I'll take my leave.

194
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,449
Lady sansa.

195
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,618
Thank you, ser loras.

196
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,995
Come.

197
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:23,089
Lady sansa, it is my honor
to present my grandmother.

198
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,926
The lady olenna of house Tyrell.

199
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,928
Kiss me, child.

200
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,057
It's so good of you
to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.

201
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,268
We're very sorry for your losses.

202
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,771
And I was sorry when I heard of
lord renly's death, lady margaery.

203
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,982
- He was very gallant.
- Olenna: Yes.

204
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,276
And charming and very clean.

205
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,611
He knew how to dress
and smile and somehow

206
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,030
this gave him the notion
he was fit to be king.

207
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,032
Renly was brave and gentle, grandmother.

208
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,034
Father liked him and so did loras.

209
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,037
Loras is young and good
at knocking men off horses with a stick.

210
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,832
That does not make him wise.

211
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,792
As to your fathead father...

212
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,545
Grandmother! What will sansa think of us?

213
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,591
She might think we have some wits about
us. One of us, at any rate.

214
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,177
It was treason. I warned them.

215
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,388
Robert has two sons
and renly has an older brother.

216
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,185
How can he possibly have any
claim to that ugly iron chair?

217
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,396
We should have stayed
well out of all this if you ask me.

218
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,440
But once the cow's been milked, there's no

219
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,525
squirting the cream back up her udders.

220
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,028
So here we are to see things through.

221
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,155
What do you say to that, sansa?

222
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,241
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

223
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,702
Lemon cake's my favorite.

224
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,412
So we've been told.

225
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,955
Are you going to bring the food

226
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,582
or do you mean to starve us to death?

227
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,253
Here, sansa, come sit with me.

228
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,758
I'm much less boring than these others.

229
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,012
Do you know my son?

230
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,014
The lord of highgarden?

231
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,183
I haven't had the pleasure.

232
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,936
Mmm. No great
pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf.

233
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:05,441
His father was an oaf
as well. My husband, the late lord Luthor.

234
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,444
He managed to ride
off a cliff whilst Hawking.

235
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,821
They say he was looking up at the sky

236
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,367
and paying no mind
to where his horse was taking him.

237
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,244
And now my son is doing the same,

238
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,872
only this time
he's riding a lion instead of a horse.

239
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,542
Now...

240
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,294
I want you to tell me the truth

241
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,047
about this royal boy, this Joffrey.

242
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,303
You, you. Who else would know better?

243
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:39,892
We've heard some troubling
tales. Is there any truth to them?

244
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,063
Has this boy mistreated you?
Has he ripped out your tongue?

245
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:51,571
King Joffrey,
his grace is very fair and handsome

246
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,281
and as brave as a lion.

247
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,409
Yes, all lannisters are lions.

248
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,245
And when a Tyrell
farts, it smells like a Rose.

249
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,331
But how kind is he? How clever?

250
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,667
Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?

251
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,212
I'm to be his wife.
I only want to know what that means.

252
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,888
Bring me some cheese.

253
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,099
Cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

254
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,518
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

255
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,936
I want it served now.

256
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,569
Are you frightened,
child? No need for that.

257
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:37,325
We're only women here. Tell us
the truth. No harm will come to you.

258
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,120
My father always told the truth.

259
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:46,042
Yes, he had that reputation. And they
named him traitor and took his head.

260
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,168
Joffrey.

261
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,130
Joffrey did that.

262
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,882
He promised he would be merciful

263
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,717
and he cut my father's head off.

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,385
And he said that was mercy.

265
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,514
Then he took me
up on the walls and made me look at it.

266
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,061
Go on.

267
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,316
I can't. I never meant...

268
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,610
My father was a traitor.

269
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,654
My brother as well. I have traitor's blood.

270
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,781
Please don't make me say any more.

271
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,158
She's terrified, grandmother. Look at her.

272
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,661
Speak freely, child.

273
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,081
We would never
betray your confidence, I swear it.

274
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,794
He's a monster.

275
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,299
That's a pity.

276
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,426
Please, don't stop the wedding.

277
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,262
Have no fear. The lord oaf of highgarden

278
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,182
is determined that margaery shall be queen.

279
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,977
Even so, we thank you for the truth.

280
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,272
Here comes my cheese.

281
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,667
Rickard: We're at war.
This march is a distraction.

282
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,920
Robb: My grandfather's
funeral is not a distraction.

283
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,443
Are we riding to battle at riverrun?

284
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,050
Then it's a distraction.

285
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,970
My uncle edmure
has his forces garrisoned there.

286
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,847
We need his men.

287
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,974
Unless he's been breeding them,

288
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,143
he don't have enough to make a difference.

289
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,895
Have you lost faith in our cause?

290
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,482
If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.

291
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,067
If you no longer believe...

292
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,194
I can believe till it snows in dorne.

293
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,824
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

294
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,245
You don't think we can win?

295
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,164
May I speak my mind, your grace?

296
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,751
Have you not been
speaking your mind, lord karstark?

297
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,672
I think you lost this war
the day you married her.

298
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,808
Whoa! Whoa!

299
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,771
Your grace.

300
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,189
You're afraid of her.

301
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,357
And she knows it.

302
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,776
I'm not afraid of her.

303
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,954
May I help you, lady stark?

304
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,268
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

305
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,461
You can't help because a mother

306
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,797
makes one for her children to protect them.

307
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,134
Only a mother can make them.

308
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,725
You've made them before?

309
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,230
Twice.

310
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,482
Did they work?

311
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,070
After a fashion.

312
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,034
I prayed for my son
bran to survive his fall.

313
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,668
Many years before that,
one of the boys came down with the pox.

314
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,964
Maester luwin said
if he made it through the night, he'd live.

315
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,426
But it would be a very long night.

316
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,515
So I sat with him all through the darkness.

317
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,061
Listened to his ragged little breaths.

318
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,939
His coughing, his whimpering.

319
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,732
Which boy?

320
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,861
Jon snow.

321
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:50,202
When my husband brought that baby home from
the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.

322
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,329
I didn't want to see those brown

323
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,582
stranger's eyes staring up at me.

324
00:22:55,291 --> 00:23:00,462
So I prayed to the gods,
take him away. Make him die.

325
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,216
He got the pox.

326
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,807
And I knew I was
the worst woman who ever lived.

327
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,686
A murderer.

328
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:22,401
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child to a horrible death

329
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,653
all because I was jealous of his mother.

330
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,282
A woman he didn't even know.

331
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,493
So I prayed to all seven gods,

332
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,955
let the boy live.

333
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,710
Let him live and I'll love him.

334
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,713
I'll be a mother to him.

335
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,592
I'll beg my husband to
give him a true name,

336
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,219
to call him stark and be done with it,

337
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,013
to make him one of us.

338
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,557
And he lived.

339
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,351
And he lived.

340
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,356
And I couldn't keep my promise.

341
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,863
And everything that's happened since then,

342
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,743
all this horror that's come to my family,

343
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,874
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

344
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,887
Was it hard for you to kill the halfhand?

345
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,641
Yes.

346
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,851
You liked him?

347
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,479
I like you, but if you're playing us false,

348
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,606
it won't be hard for me to kill you.

349
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,276
I've got wildling
blood in my veins. These are my people.

350
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,569
I understand.

351
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,823
Well, how could you understand?

352
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,866
You want to protect your people.

353
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,953
Do you know what it
takes to unite 90 clans,

354
00:24:56,036 --> 00:25:00,791
half of whom want to massacre the other
half for one insult or another?

355
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,503
They speak seven
different languages in my army.

356
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,507
The thenns hate the hornfoots. The
hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.

357
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,343
Everyone hates the cave people.

358
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:16,807
So you know how I got moon
worshippers and cannibals and giants

359
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,226
to march together in the same army?

360
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:25,566
I told them we were all going
to die if we don't get south.

361
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,276
Because that's the truth.

362
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,289
Shouldn't be long now.

363
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,887
What's wrong with him?

364
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,722
Mance: He's a warg.

365
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,641
He can enter the mind of
animals, see through their eyes.

366
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,310
He's scouting for us.

367
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,896
What, you've never met a warg?

368
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,157
Mance: Orell.

369
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,419
Where were you this time?

370
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,927
The fist of the first men.

371
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,221
What did you see?

372
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,519
Dead crows.

373
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,865
What's the matter, piggy?
You crying 'cause you're cold?

374
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,497
There's 200 brothers killed by dead men

375
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,958
and you're still here

376
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,627
whimpering.

377
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,796
That seem fair to you?

378
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:17,177
I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while
you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.

379
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,514
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

380
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,393
You know you want to.

381
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,203
Hey.

382
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,960
Get up, Sam.

383
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,588
Get up.

384
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,298
I can't.

385
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,675
If you stop, you'll die.

386
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,512
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

387
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,930
You don't care.

388
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,432
'Course we care.

389
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,851
You left me.

390
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,104
When the white walkers came,
you left me.

391
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:13,942
Aye, we left you. You're
fat and you're slow.

392
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,195
We didn't want to die.

393
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,364
Help me get him up.

394
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,076
Looks like that piggy is done for.

395
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,369
Help us get him up.

396
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,704
He's slowing us down.

397
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,497
Just get him up!

398
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,374
Why? So the rest of us can die?

399
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,254
We'll move faster without him.

400
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,341
What is this? Get up, tarly.

401
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,636
Is he all right?

402
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,803
Aye, I think so.

403
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,473
- We may as well just go without him.
- That's enough.

404
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,311
Tarly, I forbid you to die.

405
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,272
Do you hear me?

406
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,441
Why should the rest of us...

407
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,652
Rast, you're responsible for him.

408
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,154
What am I supposed to do?

409
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,406
Make sure he gets back alive.

410
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,159
If he doesn't, you don't.

411
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,662
Move on!

412
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:17,005
I'm not dying for you, piggy. You hear me?

413
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,032
Where's rickon and hodor?

414
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,867
Looking for food.

415
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,999
What's out there?

416
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,802
Osha: Not another step, boy.
Unless you want to drown in your own blood.

417
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,179
I'm unarmed.

418
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,557
That was poor planning.

419
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
My sister carries the weapons.

420
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,937
I'm better with them.

421
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,524
Drop the spear.

422
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,445
Drop it.

423
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,494
If you kill me, that
wolf will tear you to bits.

424
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,585
You must be summer.

425
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:47,823
I'm jojen Reed. This is my sister, meera.

426
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,089
We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.

427
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,542
And we have much farther to go.

428
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,673
Gendry: I'm just trying to understand.

429
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,633
Arya: Would you please shut up about it?

430
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,635
Jaqen h'ghar offered you three kills.

431
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,928
I'm not listening.

432
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,263
Butjust explain it to me.

433
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,766
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted. Dead.

434
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,394
All you had to do
was give him the names. Anyone.

435
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,538
You could have picked king Joffrey.

436
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,563
Shut up.

437
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,314
You could have picked tywin Lannister.

438
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,276
Jaqen got us out
of harrenhal, so why are you complaining?

439
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,236
But you could have ended the war.

440
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,155
Where are we going?

441
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,281
North.

442
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,992
We should have come
to the red fork river by now.

443
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,201
Maybe we passed it.

444
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,956
It's 100 feet wide.
How could we have passed it?

445
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,127
If we hit the red fork,
we can follow it west to riverrun.

446
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,089
My mother grew up there.
My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us.

447
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,803
- Could be a minstrel.
- Shut up.

448
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,726
Hot pie: A minstrel's got gold sometimes.

449
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,729
We could jump him, tie him up,
steal his gold, and buy some food.

450
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,813
Arya: Shh!

451
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,068
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

452
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,697
that lord of castamere

453
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,202
but now the rains weep o'er his hall

454
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,371
with no one there to hear

455
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:26,755
Singer: What's
lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?

456
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,091
Man: Just a dirty little cub, I think.

457
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,052
- Singer: Loose a few more shafts.
- Dont

458
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,650
Put the sword down, girl.

459
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:51,530
You go on down the road.
Keep singing so we know where you are.

460
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,491
Leave us be and I won't kill you.

461
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,454
Generous.

462
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,664
You're a dangerous person.

463
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,626
I like dangerous people.

464
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,798
Why are your friends so shy?

465
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,592
What friends?

466
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,804
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

467
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:42,163
Three young ones
on the run carrying castle-forged swords.

468
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,082
You escape from harrenhal?

469
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,333
Arya: Who are you?

470
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,585
Thoros of myr.

471
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,628
The fellow with the bow is anguy.

472
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,255
No, who do you fight for?

473
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,980
Thoros: The brotherhood without banners.

474
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,343
Now come along.

475
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:01,850
I want to hear how two boys and a
very dangerous girl escaped harrenhal.

476
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,894
I'm not going with them. The brotherhood?

477
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,397
That's who the mountain were looking for.

478
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,274
They'll bring us back and put rats in us.

479
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,234
You've got nothing to fear from us.

480
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,029
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

481
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,114
We're trying to save it.

482
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,367
Now come on.
We'll talk more over brown bread and stew.

483
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,370
And then you can go on your way.

484
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,796
Anguy: Here's the thing, fat boy.

485
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:39,179
When I'm done talking,
that arrow's falling down on your fat head.

486
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,974
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

487
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,743
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

488
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,038
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

489
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,924
My lion.

490
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,218
We've spoken of this.

491
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,389
You cannot come here.

492
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,144
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

493
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,938
Did anyone see you?

494
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,273
- No.
- You sure?

495
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,609
My father does not make idle threats.

496
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,946
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

497
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,864
You have to be absolutely certain.

498
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,622
All right. What is this problem?

499
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,584
I'm worried about sansa.

500
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,337
When she spoke with lord baelish,

501
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,132
his friend warned me about him.

502
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,134
Baelish doesn't have friends.

503
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,928
I don't know her name.

504
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,471
Oh, ros? The redhead?

505
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,056
How do you know her?

506
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,975
I try to know as many people as I can.

507
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,977
You never know which one you'll need.

508
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,895
She's a whore.

509
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,815
Yes, well, we shouldn't
be judgmental about these things.

510
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,233
You fucked her.

511
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,735
Oh, please.

512
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,821
All right, yes, I fucked her once.

513
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,533
Twice.

514
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:30,498
But since I met you,
my lady, I've been with no one else.

515
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,253
And was she good? Did you like her?

516
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,422
Not as much as I like you, obviously,

517
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,674
or she'd be the one torturing me right now.

518
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,847
What did she say about littlefinger?

519
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,059
That sansa shouldn't trust him.

520
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,230
Is there an idiot in any
village who trusts littlefinger?

521
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,360
We have to protect her.

522
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,653
We can't.

523
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:05,992
Now that the lannisters have discarded
her, sansa will have many suitors.

524
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,370
A great beauty with a very old name.

525
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,123
A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?

526
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,627
Yes, she is, objectively, very.

527
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,589
Her face is quite pleasing,
to other men and to women,

528
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,716
people in general.

529
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,426
But not to me, of course.

530
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,013
I only have eyes for you.

531
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,390
You pervert. You want her?

532
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,059
This child?

533
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,852
I don't even want to talk about her.

534
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,187
But you are.

535
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,563
Only because you're making me.

536
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,857
I didn't force you to open

537
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,193
your mouth and make words come out.

538
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:44,364
This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.

539
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,368
Aw! "The cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."

540
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,413
Mmm. Yes.

541
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,967
Now do you think I'm cruel?

542
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,678
Only if you stop.

543
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,349
But you mustn't come here again.

544
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,646
Do you hear me?

545
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,318
You've come to a dangerous place
Full of dangerous people.

546
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,074
Dangerous people. Mmm.

547
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,854
Guard: Lady Tyrell, my king.

548
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,379
Send her in.

549
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,563
You wanted to see me, your grace?

550
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,315
I'm leaving on a hunting trip.

551
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,694
I just wanted to make sure
you had everything you need before I left.

552
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,654
That's very thoughtful, your grace.

553
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,573
I have everything I could want.

554
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,991
Good. Good.

555
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,869
How are you finding life in the capital?

556
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,330
It must be quite a
change after renly's camp.

557
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,206
A welcome one.

558
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,502
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

559
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,213
And the bedside of a traitor?

560
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,968
Is that a place for a lady?

561
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,346
Your grace,

562
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,351
I tried to do my duty
as a wife, that is all.

563
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,562
What was your duty to
this traitor as you saw it?

564
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:43,775
The duty of any wife to any
husband. To provide him with children.

565
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,777
You failed to do this.

566
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,409
I would not speak ill of the dead.

567
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,746
You think one
ought to speak kindly of a traitor

568
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,706
'cause he had a sword
put through his heart?

569
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,628
No. I do beg your pardon.

570
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,048
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

571
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,800
Renly...

572
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:16,140
I don't believe
he was interested in the company of women.

573
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,477
What makes you say this?

574
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,566
Whenever I wanted to
make a child with him, he...

575
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,822
He had so many excuses,
so many late-night war councils.

576
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,367
He never wanted to try.

577
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,454
Except one evening,

578
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:43,376
after he'd had far too much wine to
drink, he suggested something...

579
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,716
Something that sounded very painful

580
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,468
and couldn't possibly result in children.

581
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,431
Maybe the fault was with me.

582
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:01,102
No, he was a known degenerate.

583
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,563
It's such a relief
to hear you say so, your grace.

584
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,232
Mmm.

585
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,945
I've considered
making his perversion punishable by death.

586
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,282
As is your right.

587
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:19,203
You must do whatever you need to do.

588
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,292
You are the king.

589
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,544
Yes.

590
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,007
I am.

591
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,514
Do you like it?

592
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,517
I just had it made. Probably one of

593
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,478
the finest weapons in the seven kingdoms.

594
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,980
It's beautiful. Will you
show me how it works?

595
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,364
It's a new design.
Much easier to load. There's no crank.

596
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:59,202
You use this lever to draw the string.

597
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,334
The bolt goes here.

598
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,465
And then you just aim...

599
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,844
And...

600
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,685
Would you take me hunting sometime?

601
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,940
Forgive me, your grace.
I know a hunt is no place for a woman.

602
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,441
It's not unheard of.

603
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,860
My father would never let me before...

604
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,196
You no longer belong to him.

605
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,282
Do you want to hold it?

606
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,076
May I? Please.

607
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,630
I imagine it must
be so exciting to squeeze your finger here

608
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,216
and watch something die over there.

609
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,139
Could you do it?

610
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,434
Could you kill something?

611
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,814
I don't know, your grace.
Do you think I could?

612
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,149
Yes.

613
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,652
Would you like to watch me?

614
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,408
Yes.

615
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,537
Stop! Stop!

616
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,621
Man: Tell us the truth.

617
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,789
About what?

618
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,835
I don't know what you want.

619
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,171
I want the truth.

620
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,589
What truth?

621
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,048
Why'd you take winterfell?

622
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,427
I took it to... I took it...

623
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,970
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

624
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,471
- I took it on my own.
- Why?

625
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,682
To take the north while vulnerable.

626
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,100
And once you took it?

627
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,727
Hold it. Rule it.

628
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,562
Good. That's very good.

629
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,196
Why did you do that? I told you.

630
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,864
Why did you take winterfell?

631
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,284
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

632
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:16,589
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I took it because I hated the starks.

633
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:21,302
I hated them for
holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.

634
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,477
What are you doing?

635
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,649
Please.

636
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:43,991
I'll tell you
anything. Just take it off.

637
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,620
Please. Please, just take it off.

638
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,382
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

639
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,600
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

640
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:13,229
No, don't go. Please, please.
No, please don't leave me.

641
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,774
Please, please. Please, please don't go!

642
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,319
Please. Please. Don't leave me.

643
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,489
Please don't go.

644
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,038
Rickon, stay with us.

645
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,459
It's all right. The
wolves will protect him.

646
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:49,307
You can get inside his head,
see through his eyes.

647
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,641
Only when I'm asleep.

648
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,311
That's how it begins
until you learn to control it.

649
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,437
You're a warg.

650
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,899
It's not just wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there's a...

651
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,318
A three-eyed raven?

652
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,819
You've seen it?

653
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,113
We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?

654
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,824
Does it have anything to do with warging?

655
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:10,745
No, the raven is
something different, something deeper.

656
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,497
The raven brings the sight.

657
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,667
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

658
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,836
Or things that happened
long before you were born

659
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,340
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

660
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,009
What's he telling him?

661
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,219
Why don't you ask?

662
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,016
Isn't he ashamed,
your brother, needing you to protect him?

663
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,102
Where's the shame in that?

664
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,898
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

665
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,318
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

666
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,322
Some people will always need help.

667
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,617
That doesn't mean
they're not worth helping.

668
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,499
When my father died, I dreamt it.

669
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:02,546
You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.

670
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,798
You have the sight, too?

671
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:11,347
When I told my father about your father,

672
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,559
for the first time in
my life, I saw him cry.

673
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,436
Your father is howland Reed?

674
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,146
Yeah.

675
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,316
He saved my father's
life during the rebellion.

676
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,111
Your father told you about the rebellion?

677
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,988
Mine never did. But I saw that, too.

678
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,324
What else have you seen?

679
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,494
Only one thing that matters,

680
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,788
you.

681
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:50,052
Thoros: I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.

682
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,514
Not that I'm averse to
drinking from a puddle every now and again.

683
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,266
I don't drink ale.

684
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,310
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

685
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,020
- Yeah!
- You see?

686
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,356
They've suffered through my bouts of

687
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,525
sobriety. It's very
tedious for all concerned.

688
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,193
Now, how did three children...

689
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,987
We're not children.

690
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,282
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

691
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,494
untrained in the art of war,
escape from harrenhal?

692
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,792
Gendry's a Smith.
He was apprenticed in the armory.

693
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,336
A Smith, eh? Where'd you train?

694
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,551
King's landing. Tobho mott's shop.

695
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,595
That criminal. He charges twice as much

696
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,722
as every other armorer in the city.

697
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,724
- That's because he's twice as good.
- Ah-ha!

698
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,101
A Smith and a salesman.

699
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,645
- Gendry stole us weapons.
- Ah!

700
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,982
Fought your way out of harrenhal, I see.

701
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,985
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.

702
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,864
My brothers taught me.

703
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,078
Men: Ooh!

704
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,470
To your brothers!

705
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,939
You can finish your meals before you go.

706
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,941
It may be awhile before you see another.

707
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,193
You'll free us?

708
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,778
I gave you my word.

709
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,282
But before you go,

710
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,452
allow me to raise a cup to your...

711
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,412
Hey, hey.

712
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,916
Now that is an uncommonly large person.

713
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,378
How does one manage to subdue
such an uncommonly large person?

714
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,005
One waits for him to
drink until he passes out.

715
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,675
Poor man. You have my sympathy.

716
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,011
Aha!

717
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,389
Not a man at all.

718
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,308
A hound!

719
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,728
So good to see you again, clegane.

720
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,772
Thoros?

721
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,733
The fuck you doing here?

722
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,537
Drinking and talking
too much. Same as ever.

723
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,822
Thoros: A pretty prize, lads.

724
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,657
All: Yeah!

725
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,828
Girl.

726
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:26,542
What in seven hells
are you doing with the stark bitch?

727
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,930
Jaime: It's a tough decision.

728
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:43,934
Take the bridge and risk being
seen or cross the great water.

729
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,185
Brienne: Silence.

730
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,632
Anyone can see us on the bridge,

731
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,773
but cross by water
and the current could take us.

732
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,609
Or I could escape down the river.

733
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,485
Good luck.

734
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,742
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

735
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,036
Which will she choose?

736
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:10,210
Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.

737
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,296
Be quick about it.

738
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,679
- Oh, I need to rest.
- Get up.

739
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,307
I have these,
on your feet when you walk too far.

740
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,868
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

741
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,144
Corns. I never used to get corns.

742
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:31,857
I used to ride everywhere,
not march around like a common foot soldier

743
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,276
wearing the same shit
boots for over a year.

744
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,862
This heel is ruined. There's no way...

745
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,580
I never understood why some knights

746
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,415
felt the need to carry two swords.

747
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,181
Ooh!

748
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,021
You move well

749
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,193
for a great beast of a woman.

750
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:24,284
You shouldn't grimace before you
lunge. It gives away the game.

751
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,761
Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail lady stark.

752
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,098
But if you don't kill me,

753
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,225
I'm going to kill you.

754
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:58,026
You're good. Graceless, but good.

755
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,331
See? If you were willing to hurt
me, you might have had me there.

756
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,961
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

757
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,922
if you can call that a woman.

758
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:04,218
We enjoy a good fight.
Gets ourjuices flowing.

759
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:09,014
The flayed man of house
Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.

760
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,391
You sure he's the one?

761
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,101
That's him, all right.

762
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:16,230
I saw him fight at
the tourney for ser willem frey's wedding.

763
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,484
Give the man his silver.

764
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,655
Let us go and
my father will pay you whatever you want.

765
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,907
Enough to buy me a new head?

766
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,828
If the king in the north
hears I let the kingslayer go,

767
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,539
he'll be taking it right off.

768
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,249
I'd rather he takes yours.
