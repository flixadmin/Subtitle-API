My name is Oliver Queen.

00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,230
After five years in hell,

00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,630
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
To save my city.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,970
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,940
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,980
To the rest
of Starling city,

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,180
I am someone else.

I am something else.

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,650
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,020
I killed him.
The police officer.
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,820
Because you were
overdosed on Mirakuru;

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,390
You didn't remember,
and I was hoping
that you never would.

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,660
This city still needs saving,

15
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,800
And that is my vision
for this company.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,260
Yes, I am your boss now.

17

I can quit,
which is what
I just did.

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,340
I thought that I could
be me and the arrow,
but I can't.

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,010
Say it's never going
to work out between us.
Say you never loved me.

20
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,240
I told you as soon
as we talked,

21

It would be over.

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,910
You changed your mind.

23
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,380
I just decided
I want more
out of life.

Well, he's got it.

No. The only

Other than
the body is this.

Shaped like a spade.
What's that all about?

I don't know.
I'll look into it.

I'm not your mother

Okay, all right,

that last week,

We did the whole
candle meditation thing,

And maybe we had a moment.

What?
I have a dinner

92
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,630
With the CEO
of a Nevada
mining concern.

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
They own mineral
rights, which
are imperative

To the cogeneration
project.

Oh, and I fit into this how?

Ahh, the CEO is
boring. His wife,
even more boring.

If I'm forced
to go solo on this,

I'll end up slicing
my wrists open
with a butter knife.

a dozen other employees

as your anti-boring wing woman.

this dress for.

was different.

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,520
I can't believe
it's really you.

163
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,490
Did you like your present?

164
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,290
Do you mean
isaac Stanzler,
the man you killed?

165
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,960
I see the way
you take care
of your city.

166
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,500
Makes me wonder...

167
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,970
Who takes care of you?

168
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,770
I want to help you--

169
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,670
To fight with you,

170
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,510
To kill for you.

171
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,510
Mr. Stanzler
was just the first.

172
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,180
[cell phone beeps]

173
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,420
He might be the second.

174
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,620
I thought we could
punish this one together.

175
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,920
I'm going
to find you.

176
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,590
Well, that's the idea.

177
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,960
But you'd better hurry,

178
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,060
I don't think
he's got very long.

179
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,950
Oliver: Roy.

180
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,390
I was just researching
cheap booze for Thea's club.

181
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,660
You know, it wasn't you
who killed that officer.

182
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,730
I keep telling myself that,
but it's not working.

183
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,530
Every single time
I put on that mask,

184
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,930
I feel like a fraud.

185
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,400
You--[sighs]

186
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,570
You have to give this time.

187
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,440
[sighs]

188
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,710
If you want to talk about it--
I don't.

189
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,680
I appreciate
the offer, though.

190
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,580
I'm fine. Really.

191
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,740
[footsteps]

192
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,950
Oh, sorry,
am I interrupting?

193
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,350
I was just leaving.
I got to help Thea

194
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,980
Get the club ready
for the opening.

195
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,290
Oliver:
What's up?

196
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,320
I got an idea
on your not-so-secret

197
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,720
But very crazy admirer's
hostage.

198
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,830
Who is it?
Joe gravano,

199
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,860
Local mob boss,
wanted for 39
counts of murder,

200
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,130
Racketeering,
and drug smuggling.

201
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,460
One of the most heavily
protected men in Starling city.

202
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,770
Not anymore.

203
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,840
What's "n.P.P.?"

204
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,370
I don't know.

205
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,940
I can definitely
find out.

206
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,640
Where are we with
the cell phone
from her apartment?

207
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,080
Crazy pants
encrypted
the sim card.

208
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,740
I can crack it,
but it's going
to take some time.

209
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,510
[sighs] which we don't have,
neither does he.

210
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,020
I need 100% of your focus
on finding gravano.

211
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,020
And I will work
round the clock on it,
except for tonight.

212
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,390
Why?

213
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,390
Ray palmer
invited me to dinner.

214
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,360
Oh.

215
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,460
Not dinner-dinner,
like a date.

216
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,760
It's a work dinner,
but since dinner

217
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,560
Is a meal you can technically
only eat at night,

218
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,100
I need the night off.

219
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,800
That ok?

220
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,740
Do what you want.

221
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,780
[speaking Japanese]

222
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,650
Nothing?

223
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,020
He's not
answering his cell.

224
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,660
Just relax.
I'm sure he's fine.

225
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,790
He said it would
only be an hour.

226
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
That was
nine hours ago.

227
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,130
If he's going
to be late,

228
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,130
He always calls.

229
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,170
He said his contact
was down at the docks, right?

230
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,840
I will go down
and check it out.

231
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,510
No, I'll go.

232
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,380
Um...

233
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,810
No offense,

234
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,180
But you're just...

235
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,150
Maseo's wife.

236
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,580
And you just
a billionaire

237
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,920
Who doesn't
know how to use
laundry machine.

238
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,630
Do you have someone
who can watch akio
for a few hours?

239
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,270
[music playing,
records scratching]

240
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,370
Great, uh,
thank you.

241
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,940
You were terrific.

242
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,740
Auditions are over.
Thanks for coming, guys.

243
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,850
Wait, what are you doing?
Auditions are not over.

244
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,150
Trust me, I'm saving
you from wasting
your day here.

245
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,990
I don't need saving
from anyone,

246
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,160
And if you're really as good
as you say you are,

247
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,290
Then you can just wait in line
and prove it like everyone else.

248
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,030
I don't audition.
Then you don't work.

249
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,800
For me or for my club.

250
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,700
So...The exit's that way.

251
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,670
Later, princess.

252
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,410
I got her.

253
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,440
The user registered
to the encrypted sim card,

254
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,350
Carrie cutter,
she's former scpd.

255
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,880
She was the first woman
swat team member.

256
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,820
I've seen her
before.

257
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,220
Well, she's not unpretty
for a whacko,

258
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,120
If you're into the whole
red-headed vixen-type thing.

259
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,320
She was a police
officer, that might be
why she looks familiar.

260
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,930
No, she left the force
once year before you
got back from the island.

261
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,960
But there's another
very good reason

262
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,730
Why was she at
the crime scene
at ted grant's gym?

263
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know,
but it's not just there.

264
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,310
Apparently stalking
isn't her only
hobby, either.

265
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,310
She's a member
of a gardening group, too.

266
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,010
Which explains
the whole n.P.P. Thing.

267
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,640
What n.P.P. Thing?

268
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,210
The bag in the gravano
hostage photo.

269
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,950
N.P.P., it's an acronym--
stands for nitrogen,
phosphate, potash.

270
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,090
It's the chemical formula
for fertilizer.

271
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,220
So what if she's
keeping gravano
in a greenhouse?

272
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,790
Yeah.

273
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
The closest one
to her apartment
is sherwood florist,

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,070

and meet me there.
Ok.

If you hurt him...

I didn't touch him,
boyfriend.

I'm a one-guy woman.

287

But I am a little disappointed
you brought your wing man.

288

Tonight's not about him.

289
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,060
It's about us.

290
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,830
Together against the world.

291
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,460
Just like
we were meant to be.

292
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,530
There is no "we."

We're more like one soul,
you're right.

You and I are more alike
than you think.

Carrie, listen to me.

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,610
If I'm out of my mind,
it's because that's
what love is.

Our own little
slice of insanity.

to be together forever.

Please help me.
Don't leave me
with this psycho!

302
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,770
Quiet!
You don't want
to do this.

303
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,700
Sure I do.

304
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,870
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

305
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,170
That rope's laced
with a trip wire
that's hooked up

want, then?!

to happen.

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,530
Looks like you weren't
the only person
that carrie stalked.

321
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,000
She was put
on limited duty

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,570
After becoming obsessed
with her partner.

323
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,540
The department sent
her to st. Walker's
for a psych eval.

324
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,140
She quit the force
a little bit after.

325
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,110
Where's Felicity?

326
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,180
She's working tonight.
She said she told you.

327
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,650
Yes, she did.

328
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,450
Oliver, you ok?

329
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,990
I know this can't be easy,
with Felicity spending

330
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,720
So much time with palmer.
I'm fine.

331
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,560
Where you going?

332
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,760
The psychiatrist
that scpd
sent cutter to.

333
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,160
You need back up?

334
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,830
No. I've got it.

335
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,580
Hey.

336
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,080
Like what you've done
to the place.

337
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,380
Is everything
all right?

338
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,350
Yeah, yeah, I was just

339
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,350
In the neighborhood.
Thought I would stop by

340
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,090
And check out your new sign.

341
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,560
Oh, yeah.

342
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,260
Phew.

343
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,730
[chuckles]

344
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,500
Wow, that's a nice dress.

345
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,360
Yeah, it's
really, really,

346
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,630
Really nice.

347
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,370
Ray lent it to me
for a work dinner.

348
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,440
Yeah, some...Work dinner.

349
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,840
You and ray.
Mm-hmm.

350
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,440
Doesn't seem that platonic.

351
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,450
Actually, it has Oliver
twisted up in knots.

352
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,180
Well, Oliver
made his choice.

353
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,650
We both know that was
the wrong choice.

354
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,060
Oh, yeah, because
Oliver's just great
at expressing his emotions.

355
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,890
He would rather go ten rounds
with the league of assassins

356
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,430
Than ever say that.

357
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,100
But this thing
with you and palmer,

358
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,570
It's, um, it's messing
with his head, Felicity,

359
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,500
And...That's really dangerous.

360
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,110
I told you,
there is no
me and palmer.

361
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,240
But if there were,

362
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,080
And if Oliver had
a problem with it,

363
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,310
Then Oliver
should be the one
to say something.

364
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,710
Ok.

365
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,990
Good night.

366
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,600
Dr. Pressnall--
oh, my god!

367
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,340
I'm not here
to hurt you.

368
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,140
What do you want?!

369
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,770
To talk about
Carrie Cutter.

370
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,110
I can't.

371
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,980
Doctor-patient privilege.
Just please, get out!

372
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,710
Your patient
killed a man,
kidnapped another,

373
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,480
And I'm trying
to stop her before
she hurts anyone else.

374
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,650
To do that, I need
to understand her.

375
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,620
[exhales]
please.

376
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,460
I can only diagnose her.

377
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,660
Attachment disorder,

378
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,360
The inability to form

379
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,600
Real, lasting relationships.

380
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,630
They push everyone away,

381
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,870
And fixate
on a single person.

382
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,740
Someone they feel mirrors
their emotional state.

383
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,780
How do I stop her?

384
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,750
Give her the connection
that she craves--

385
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,420
Honesty, sincerity...

386
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,750
If you lie to her,

387
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,890
She'll know.

388
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,090
Thank you.

389
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,890
If you'll permit
a professional
observation...

390
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,060
You could use
a little therapy yourself.

391
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,660
What gives you
that impression?

392
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,800
You mean,
apart from the mask

393
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,400
And the robin hood costume?

394
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,010
Oliver: Shouldn't we
get out and look around

395
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,920
Or, I don't know,
something?

396
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
In this place,
at this hour?

397
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,390
That's a very efficient way
to get yourself killed.

398
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,690
Feel free.

399
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,060
[chuckles]
thank you.

400
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,630
That's...
We'll wait, then.

401
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,470
"Gaijin."

402
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,370
What?

403
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,170
Maseo called me that
before he left,

404
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,540
And I looked it up,
but it wasn't in my
Chinese dictionary.

405
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,510
Because
it's Japanese.

406
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,610
It means
"foreigner."

407
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,480
Outsider.

408
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,250
You.

409
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,520
It means you, too.

410
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,790
You're Japanese,
living in Hong Kong.

411
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,330
Sorry.

412
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,130
Why did you
leave japan?

413
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,470
It wasn't safe
for us there.

414
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,470
Why?

415
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
We upset some
very powerful,

416
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,280
Very dangerous men.

417
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,310
Who?

418
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,350
You ask a lot
of questions.

419
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,490
That's what
your husband
says.

420
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,760
Who's that?

421
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,960
Shu gang.
Rivals of the triad.
They control this port.

422
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,160
So they know what
happened to maseo.

423
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,900
I don't know.

424
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,970
Only one way
to find out.

425
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,380
[speaking Chinese]

426
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,080
Hey, I don't want
any trouble!

427
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,860
[speaking Chinese]

428
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,260
[footsteps]

429
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,430
What happened
to the thing?

430
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,300
Wow.

431
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,130
You are
ridiculous.

432
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,670
Um...
Which I mean

433
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,540
In a...Good way.
That's...Not creepy.

434
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,710
[clears throat]
you look beautiful.

435
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,340
I think it's the dress.

436
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,380
The dress
is actually
missing something.

437
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,180
Oh, no, I forgot
to do up the zipper again?

438
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,280
I always do that.

439
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,250
Oh, no, I can't wear that.

440
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,190
I'm not even sure
I'm supposed to be
looking at it.

441
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,390
Well, I had to put down
a $10,000 security deposit

442
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,760
Just to borrow it
for the evening,

443
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,060
So one of us should wear it.

444
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,000
And diamonds aren't
really my thing, so.

445
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,430
I appreciate it,
but I think I would

446
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,670
Feel strange
wearing a million
dollar necklace.

447
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,640
Oh, don't worry.

448
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,240
It's not worth
a million dollars.

449
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,310
Ahh.

450
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,750
I think it was
actually appraised

451
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,450
For $10 million.

452
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,620
So...

453
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,720
There you go.

454
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,490
That's better.

455
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,290
Where you been?

456
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,360
You don't call,
you don't write.

457
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,600
Carrie: I've been
busy, busy, busy.

458
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,870
[chuckles]

459
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,170
You look good.

460
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,210
Business before pleasure.

461
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,180
First I located
every crime scene

462
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,750
The arrow's been spotted at

463
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,880
In the past six months.

464
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
Now the magic part--
I created

465
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,780
An algorithm, calculated the
average amount of time

466
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,320
It takes the arrow
to reach a crime scene,

467
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,460
Triangulated that
by the distance
to said scene...

468
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,820
[beeping]

469
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,460
Genius, right?

470
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,330
I wonder why no one
thought to do it before.

471
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,900
Now obviously,
I can't pinpoint
the exact block,

472
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,670
But, uh, there's no doubt

473
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,700
Your guy hangs his hat
or his hoodie

474
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,200
Somewhere in this area.

475
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,140
And you're sure
about this?

476
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,840
Statistical correlations
do not lie.

477
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,280
Now...

478
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,150
What was this about pleasure?

479
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,680
Mmm.

480
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,730
[groans]
shh.

481
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,830
I'm sorry.

482
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,500

have you meet her there?

642
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,210
Because this is
where I saved her.

643
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,550
Hello, lover.

644
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,280
I'm not your lover.

645
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,420
Well, maybe not yet,

646
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,490
But after one night with me,
that'll all change.

647
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,890
I promise.

648
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,960
Carrie, I'm here
to help you,

649
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,290
Because
you're not well.

650
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,060
Don't ever say that again.

651
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,730
You sound like that shrink
that they sent me to.

652
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,730
I spoke to her.

653
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,870
You talked to that psycho?

654
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,740
She just wanted me
to take pills,

655
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,610
Pills, pills.

656
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,340
She thinks that love
is a disease.

657
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,810
But it's not.

658
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,380
Love is the cure.

659
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,350
Well, I'm not the man
you think I am.

660
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,050
You're a hero...

661
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,890
Who saved me.

662
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,730
I understand
that you're hurting.

663
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,130
And I know
what it's like

664
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,030
To want someone...

665
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,370
But not be able
to be with them.

666
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,710
How you wish things
can be different,
but they can't.

667
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,340
I can't be with you.

668
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,710
I can't be with anyone.

669
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,950
I have to be alone.

670
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,780
Carrie: No, you don't.

671
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,620
You're a liar!

672
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,290
I don't want
to hurt you!

673
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,560
You already have.

[groaning and gasping]

676
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,820
It's over, carrie.

677
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,290
I guess it's true
what they say--

678
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:56,400
You only hurt
the ones you love.

679
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,930

[beeping]

681
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,270
Oliver?

682
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,500
Get him back.
Oliver!

683
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,210
[both grunting]

684
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,680
Sorry.

685
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,520
But if I can't
have you--

686
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,920
Carrie, think about this!

687
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,250
I didn't want it
to end this way.

688
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,160
I guess I don't
handle rejection
very well.

689
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,560
You don't have to do this.

690
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,360
[train horn honking]

691
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,330
I do.

692
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,870
But at least this way,

693
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,300
We can be together.

694
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,010
For eternity.

695
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,590
I knew you loved me.

696
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,040
Well, it's done.

697
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,500
Lyla said cutter's
even nuttier

698
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,110
Than the last
woman they had in
the suicide squad.

699
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,710
You sure this was
a good idea,

700
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,040
Handing her over
to waller?

701
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,280
Iron heights
isn't right for her.

702
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,720
At least, on the squad,

703
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,080
She can make a difference.

704
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,560
Lyla is preparing
a late dinner,

705
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,290
If you want to join.

706
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,160
No.

707
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,360
No, I'm good, thank you.

708
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,930
Listen, Oliver...

709
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,570
Felicity heard what
you said to cutter.

710
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,100
About being alone.

711
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,540
If her reaction
was any indication,

712
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,710
She does not
want to be.

713
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,910
You got to tell her
how you feel

714
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,710
Before it's too late.

715
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,580
[exhales]

716
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,550
It's just food
for thought.

717
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,460
What do I tell him?

718
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,300
How do I tell my son
his father is dead?

719
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,680
Where have you two been?

720
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,920
What's going on?

721
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,090
You're home.

722
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,620
I was so worried.

723
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,360
I know. I'm sorry.
I should have called.

724
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Waller changed my orders
and brought me in.

725
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,990
We were
on lockdown tonight

726
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,200
Because three agents
got killed.

727
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,200
Gross!

728
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,610
Akio, get over here.

729
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,160
Pretty good
gate tonight.

730
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,430
You're never going to let me
forget this, are you?

731
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,870
You have to admit,
I did save your ass.

732
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:26,670
God, your modesty, it's--
it's so refreshing.

733
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,640
You know, you're
really cute when
you're sarcastic.

734
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,880
[chuckles]

735
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,680
Half the gate, as agreed.

736
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,790
Keep the money.

737
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,230
My grand reopening
gift to you.

738
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,560
See you next week.

739
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,940
Aha. I thought I might
find you here.

740
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,540
I thought I'd get
a jump on that
server encryption

741
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,540
You asked for.
Trying to, you know,

742
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,010
Make up for ruining
the deal tonight.

743
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,750
Your definition of ruin
is vastly different from mine.

744
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,180
Gardner's going to sell.

745
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,120
That's amazing!

746
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,180
It's all thanks to you.

747
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,250
[chuckles]

748
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,690
But really,
I should be
thanking you.

749
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,730
I mean, not just
for the new job,

750
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,930
But for this amazing,
expensive necklace.

[chuckles]

752
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,100
You have to take it
back, don't you?

753
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,240
Yeah, kind of do.

754
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,310
Here, let me help you.

755
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,540
Hmm. Thank you.

00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,310
You know, Felicity Smoak,

757
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,510
You're different
from anyone I've ever met.

758
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,950
And you deserve all those
things, and more.

759
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,300
I'm--I'm sorry, I, um...

760
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:10,380
I meant to keep tonight
platonic. Ahh...

761
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,010
I should go.

762
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,880
Um, ray?

763
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,680
I'll see you tomorrow.

Ok.

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,340
Are you ok?

766
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,380
Not really.

767
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,280
What about you?

768
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,150
Not really.

769
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,180
Come on.

770
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,350
Where we going?

771
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,360
For something
we both need.

I know it's late, but, um--

775
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,900
Hey, that was
the invitation.

776
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,800
Something
smells good.

777
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,870
Thank you. Hi.

778
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,970
Come on in.

00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,910
Yep, I just sent the notarized
transfer of ownership

Now listen, I want to get
a jump on the mining
operations immediately.

781
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,620
Let me know as soon
as the first of the dwarf
star alloy is extracted.

782
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,360
Thanks.

Ahh.

Sorry to do this to you,

789
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,460
But you have
something I need.

790

See, that's the thing
about our work...

to haunt you.
