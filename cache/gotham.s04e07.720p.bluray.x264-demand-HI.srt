Don't talk about my mother!

I forgive you.

- I wanted to surprise you.

- I ain't dead yet.
- Just measuring for when you are.

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,786
Shouldn't you be resting?
Lemme help you.

Great.

00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,134
So we can talk about you
taking Penguin's money.

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,712
- I'm not that fine.
- I meant what I said, Harvey.

How was I supposed to know
what we were carrying?

41
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,962
Stench of death, for starters.

42
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,414
I got a cold.

43
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,716
Forty-four boxes.

a great deal to your father.

- You're just angry.

That anger is concealing
what's really going on.

Unless you face it full on,

83
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,943
it will consume you

- He just showed up to offer his help.
- Did he?

Nice to meet you, Jim. I'm Headhunter.

97
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,045
I'm sure you've heard of me.

98
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,753
My new security consultant.

99
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,966
Recommended by Victor,
who is off visiting his bubby.

100
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,595
You wanna know why I carry two pistols?

101
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,843
Overcompensation?

102
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,312
See, I always shoot twice.

103
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,312
The first one does the job every time,
but the second one, well,

104
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,185
that's just my signature. Hmm.

105
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,603
He has a signature.

106
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,278
- Colorful, isn't he? But effective.
- Mmm.

107
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,823
Mr. Headhunter and my men
will help the GCPD

108
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,870
until this Pyg situation is resolved.

109
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,745
We don't want your help
or that of your idiot hitman.

110
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,502
Pyg's actions threaten the both of us.

111
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,875
He's killing my cops, my employees.

112
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,458
Allegedly.

113
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,260
Get this through you head, Oswald.

114
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,215
We don't work for you,
and we don't work with you, ever.

115
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,762
(LAUGHS)

116
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,141
Well, your captain says otherwise.

117
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,228
Excited to work with you, Jim.

118
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,356
- Are you out of your freakin' mind?
- Jim, listen...

119
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,986
You are legitimizing him, Harvey.

120
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,660
He's been legitimized for years,
he was the freakin' mayor.

121
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,783
GORDON:
Is it about the money, is that it?

122
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,947
It's not about that.

123
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:58,992
How can I know that?

124
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,457
- How can <i>you</i> even know that?
- Take a look out there, okay?

125
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,913
Half the precinct skipped town

126
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,374
because they didn't want to wear
bacon flavored death masks.

127
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,917
We need the help.

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,837
You are dangerously overreacting.

129
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,015
I'm overreacting because every cop
in this precinct got a death threat.

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,682
Except, of course, for you.

131
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,850
So Penguin's guys are gonna

132
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,724
beat and torture their way
through the city,

133
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,975
- then execute Pyg if they find him?
- And?

134
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,141
And the people need to know

135
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,146
they don't need gangsters
to keep them safe.

136
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,403
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna find Pyg, alive.

137
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,856
And I'll bring him to justice.

138
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,940
Good for you.

139
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,200
Three cops just went missing.

140
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:34,652
Where?

141
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,579
It's gonna be tough. It's The Narrows.

142
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,079
So that's it. We're shutting up shop.

143
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,548
So long, farewell. Toodledoo.

144
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,500
- I can't believe this.
- I can.

145
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,421
All this was so I could be
Ra's eyes and ears in Gotham.

146
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,427
He was bankrolling us,
and now, he's gone.

147
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,507
So I'm pulling the plug.

148
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,514
Help yourself to whatever.

149
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:06,025
So, all of this, being partners,
building something together... Lies.

150
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,274
A sales pitch. I couldn't do it alone.

151
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,606
We can still spy on the jerks
who come in here,

152
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,032
and get intel on jobs.

153
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,950
- We can make it work.
- What,

154
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,864
and the three of us stay together,
like a plucky little family?

155
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,333
Well, how about a little
parting lesson from big sis?

156
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,248
In this life, you're on your own.

157
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,372
Always.

158
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,213
Ugh!

159
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,588
Bonus lesson:
Never make bellinis from a can.

160
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,222
I followed a buyer
from The Street Demonz.

161
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,056
They have a chop shop across town

162

Lemme talk to the owner.

You're standing next to him.

No, they're not.
They've no record of Fazoli.

516
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,598
They can't find the ambulance...

Fazoli's dead.

520

The guy in the ambulance was The Pyg
in disguise.

521
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,028
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Pyg called me.

522
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,195
He warned me off.

523
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,365
He used the same phrase he used
in the ambulance.

524
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,488
He fed us the clue to get us here.

525
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,361
It has to be a trap.

526
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,532
So, the insane serial killer
who hates cops

527
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,619
warned you to save your life,
because why now?

528
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,499
Because I'm against dirty cops.

529

Except, all of the times you are one.

530

I'm telling you, Harvey, call it off.

Call it off.

532
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,346
I have another interpretation, Jim.

533
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,173
The Pyg is not trying to save you,

534
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,805
he's trying to save himself
by stopping the raid.

535
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,559
You are being played, and not
for the first time I might add.

536
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,522
We called Gotham General,
they can't locate Fazoli

537
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,022
or the ambulance.

538
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,605
Jim, it's Gotham General.
It's a madhouse down there.

539
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,315
If I'm correct, The Pyg
isn't even in the courthouse.

540
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,778
I came directly from the ambulance,
there is no way he beat me here.

541
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,202
You're wrong. Pyg is in there, Jim.

542
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,281
He's right.

543
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,834
We got a spotter across the street
that got a visual

544
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,286
on Pyg, in there,

standing next to Patel,
tied to a chair. I swear.

546
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,713
Look, I can't explain it.
All I know is this is a trap.

547
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,217
Now you asked me to trust you,
I am asking you to trust me.

548
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,099
God, so tiresome. Start the operation.

Jim, I'm sorry.
I'm with Penguin on this one.

550

get our guys slaughtered!

00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,407

Dude, this is awesome.

649
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,488
I always knew there was
another side to you, Bruce Wayne.

650
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,491
I think I'm gonna try it out
for a while.

Thank you, Detective.
You'd have done the same.

Yeah, but not as well.

We got an unlicensed robbery.

658
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,031
I've got a license. But like I told you,

We ain't accepting these no more.
