1
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,480
- Please!

2
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,787
- Aah!

3
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,025
<i> - Vandal savage.</i>

4
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,994
<i> An evil dictator</i>
<i> blessed with immortality.</i>

5
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,229
<i> He has achieved what no one</i>

6
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,332
<i> in human history ever has.</i>

7
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,335
<i> He has conquered</i>
<i> the entire planet.</i>

8
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,608
- Aah!

9
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,718
- What's your name, son?

10
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,257
- Jonas.

11
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,993
- Your mother was brave,

12
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:04,863
just as your father was foolish.

13
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,099
Which are you?

14
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,773
So you take after
your mother, huh?

15
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,013
Or not.

16
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,518
- Caesar.
Hitler.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,853
Per degaton.

18
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:30,622
Rank amateurs
compared to savage.

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,725
His forces have already
claimed the lives of billions.

20
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,527
And if we possess
the means to stop him,

21
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:39,098
and again do nothing,

22
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,733
then their blood
is on our hands.

23
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,769
- As a time master
of long standing,

24
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,938
you seem to forget
our responsibility

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,041
is to protect the timeline,
not humanity.

26
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,810
You wish to engage in the very
sort of manipulation of time

27
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,278
that we are sworn to prevent.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,214
- And yet, if we allow
humanity to perish

29
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,715
at the hands of evil,
then what universe

30
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,217
are we custodians of?

31
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,586
- What if, in trying
to save the world from savage,

32
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,489
you make it vulnerable to
another, more terrible despot?

33
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:06,091
- We are not warriors,
captain hunter.

34
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,292
We possess no army.

35
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,795
- And I'm not asking for one.

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,066
Just a single timeship

37
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:15,567
and your permission
to change history

38
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,470
before vandal savage
puts an end to it.

39
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,272
I'm not appealing to you

40
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,308
as time masters,

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,478
but as humans, please.

42
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,982
Grant me the authority
to change the timeline

43
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:33,185
just this once.

44
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,987
<i> - How did the council meeting</i>
<i> go, captain hunter?</i>

45
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,755
- Exactly as expected, Gideon.

46
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,091
<i> - So we are proceeding?</i>
- Indeed.

47
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,160
Prepare the waverider
for takeoff.

48
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,995
Set a course.
United States.

49
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:46,031
Star city.
January, 2016.

50
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,367
<i> - Ah, the early</i>
<i> second millennium a.D.</i>

51
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,501
<i> The golden age of</i>
<i> gasoline engines,</i>

52
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,936
<i> online pornography,</i>

53
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,371
<i> and those silly little</i>
<i> smartphones.</i>

54
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,539
<i> What are we going to retrieve,</i>
<i> captain?</i>

55
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,606
- Oh, not what.

56
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,041
Who.

57
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,177
I need you to pull up
some files, Gideon.

58
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,479
The eight men and women
who'll be joining us

59
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,815
on our little crusade.

60
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,151
<i> - You usually prefer to</i>
<i> work alone, captain.</i>

61
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,387
- This time, I'll need a team.

62
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,866
<i> First recruit:</i>
<i> Dr. Raymond Palmer.</i>

63
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,502
<i> Also known as the atom.</i>

64
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,672
- This feels good,
being back in the field.

65
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,739
Not that this is
a field, but--

66
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,074
- ray, are you up for this?

67
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,076
<i> - Uh, too late</i>
<i> to turn back now.</i>

68
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,378
Huh, someone removed
the central processing unit.

69
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,513
<i> - Are you sure?</i>

70
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,881
- I designed the computer's cpu,

71
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,382
so, yeah, pretty sure.

72
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,318
- Well, hive would only
remove it if they knew--

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,487
- you had me shrink down and fly
into their secret computer lab?

74
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,790
My night's about to get
a whole lot worse, isn't it?

75
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,060
- Oh, you can take them.

76
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,261
They have guns.

77
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,429
You have a super-suit.

78
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,697
<i> It's time to start growing.</i>

79
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,966
- This is gonna get
a little rough.

80
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,502
- Aah!

81
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,912
Oh, I am not
one of your adversaries.

82
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,385
<i> Next recruit: Sara Lance.</i>

83
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,387
<i> Former member of</i>
<i> the league of assassins,</i>

84

<i> also formerly dead.</i>

85
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,639
- Aah!

86
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,614
- Miss Lance?

87
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,082
Join me for a drink?

88
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,786
I have come quite a long way
to meet you.

89
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,222
<i> Firestorm,</i>
<i> the merged super-form</i>

90

<i> of one Jefferson Jackson and</i>
<i> professor Martin Stein.</i>

91

<i> 83% of the chemicals</i>

<i> combustible.</i>

93
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,403
- Yeah, tell that to Rambo.

94
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,005
<i> - Thought I told you</i>
<i> to be careful.</i>

95
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,674
- Aah!

96
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,512
- What's the use of
sharing my intelligence

97
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,613
if you won't listen?

98
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,114
- Stop bossing me around

99
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,349
like I'm one of your
snot-nosed undergrads.

100
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,483
- Excuse me.

101
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:18,483
- Who are you?

102
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,623
<i> - Kendra Saunders</i>
<i> and Carter hall.</i>

<i> The latest reincarnations</i>
<i> of hawkman and hawkgirl.</i>

104
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,995
- Kendra.

105
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,130
You, my love, almost
got us killed.

106
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,298
- Thank you.

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,533
- Your flying is still clumsy,

108
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,534
like a bird just
out of the nest--

109
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,835
- well maybe that's because

110
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,603
up until two months ago,
i was a barista,

111
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,339
not some damn winged
Demi-goddess.

112
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,175
- Have you two considered
couples counseling?

113
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,844
I hear it's quite popular
in this century.

114
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,147
<i> - There seems to be</i>
<i> an error, captain.</i>

115
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,183
<i> These candidates,</i>
<i> Leonard snart and Mick Rory,</i>

118
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,386
- Drop your weapons!

119
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:58,156
- Ah, fry, you little piggies!

120
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,893
A minivan?
Really, snart?

121
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,628
- Cops'll never hassle a dad

122
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,865
buying diapers
in the middle of the night.

123

124
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,015

What a headache!

125
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,584
- Stein?

126
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,085
What the hell
are you doing here?

127
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,187
- I'm as ignorant as you,
for once.

128
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,056
- Where are we?
- Ah.

129
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,925
- Why don't you ask the dude who
knocked us out and kidnapped us?

130
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,527
British dude
with a flashy thing?

131
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,397
Ring any bells?
- The name's rip hunter.

132
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,098
I'm from east London.

133
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,101
Oh, and the future.

134
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,503
- Nice to meet you, rip.

135
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,438
- Uh, while you were
incapacitated,

136
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,573
I may have tampered
with your weapons.

137
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,243
I've assembled you all
because I need your help.

138
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,778
The future of the world
is in peril

139
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,080
because of a man by the name

140
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,849
of vandal savage.

141
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,418
- That can't be.

142
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,086
We destroyed him.

143
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,021
- Yeah, the green arrow and
flash helped us do it.

144
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,556
- And therein lay the problem.

145
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,758
Unless you or Mr. hall
deliver the death blow,

146
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,227
savage can be restored
from but a single cell.

147
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,062
- What the hell
are you talking about?

148
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,965
- Vandal is immortal.
Kendra and I reincarnate.

149
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,434
- Yeah, I've done that.

150
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,435
- And what the hell
does this Randall guy

151
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,436
got to do with us?

152
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,470
- Vandal.

153
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,071
In the future, he will employ

154
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,873
the evil he's perfected
over his long life,

155
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,775
and the power he has amassed
throughout history,

156
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,913
to finally conquer the world.

157
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,649
I've been tasked with assembling
an elite team to stop him.

158
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,083
- How?

159
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,485
- To travel through time.

160
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,287
To capture savage
before he grows into

161
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,055
the monster he becomes.

162
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,957
- You got the wrong guy.

163
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,726
"Hero" ain't on my resume.
- Or mine.

164
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,228
- I know it's difficult
for you to fathom,

165
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,564
but where--when I'm from,

166
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,265
the year 2166,

167
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,601
you and everyone on this roof

168
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,304
aren't just considered heroes...

169
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,574
You're legends.

170
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,944
- Legends?

171
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,679
- I, um, I hate to nitpick,

172
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,515
but doesn't a legend
have to be dead?

173
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,484
- Yeah, see, uh, that's
a deal breaker for me,

174
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,585
so I'm gonna pass.

175
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,986
- It's dangerous for any of you

176
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,287
to know too much about
your own futures,

177
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,690
but I am here because
each of you,

178
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:16,328
as individuals,
is destined for greatness.

179
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,631
- I could get behind that.

180
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,766
- And, because if you don't
follow me,

181
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,835
this is what is in store
for your world

182
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,671
150 years from now.

183
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,724
I could have chosen
any time and any place.

184
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,192
Of all the people
who ever lived,

185
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,127
I chose you eight.

186
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,730
I certainly hope
that you won't let me,

187
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,866
and the world, down.

188
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,174
If your answer is yes,

189
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,177
meet me at this address
in 36 hours.

190
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,199
- I had that.

191
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,601
- I know.

192
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,869
It's fun to watch you
kick and punch

193
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,571
and skewer bad guys, but

194
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,239
I need a minute of your time.

195
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,574
I'm sure captain hunter
will return me

196
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,375
to the moment I left,
but I thought,

197
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,578
you know, just in case, someone
should I know I was gone.

198
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,779
- We went up against savage.

199
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,414
He does not go down easy.

200
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,882
- That's why hunter's
recruited a team.

201
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,084
- A team that includes
Leonard snart and Mick Rory.

202
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,187
So what do you know
about captain hunter?

203
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,289
- He's a time master
from the 22nd century.

204
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,457
It's a little hard to Google.

205
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,726
- So you know nothing,

206
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,462
and yet you trust him?

207
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,563
- I'm as trusting
as you are cynical.

208
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,965
- Well, I'm cynical,

209
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,232
and it's difficult for me
to trust anyone,

210
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,969
but that has kept me alive.

211
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,739
- I died once.

212
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,208
At least,
the world thought I did.

213
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,310
You know what happened?

214
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,079
Nothing.

215
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,981
All the money,
all the buildings,

216
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,383
all the inventions,

217
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,452
the world didn't care.

218
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,722
My life, ultimately,
didn't matter.

219
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:28,226
Rip is giving me the chance
to help save the world.

220
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,629
I have to take it.

221
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,739
- Keep your head on a swivel
while you're at it.

222
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,574
- 206 times.

223
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,010
Savage has killed both of us
206 times.

224
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,413
- Yeah, and I'm not too eager
about making it 207.

225
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,781
- So what?

226
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,816
You just going to run away?

227
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,519
We've tried that before.

228
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,255
Look, I know you don't remember
your past lives yet,

229
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,591
but I remember so much of it.

230
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,092
God, if you only knew
how I loved you,

231
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,727
and how much...

232
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,499
How much it hurt every time
he took you away from me.

233
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,100
- Have you ever stopped to think

234
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,103
that maybe, just maybe,
we can't actually beat him?

235
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,005
- But this time we wouldn't be
facing him alone,

236
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,774
and we almost defeated him
with help before.

237
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,042
- Yeah, almost.

238
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,477
- Kendra, this is
our best chance

239
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,213
to stop him forever.

240
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,950
The woman I've loved
for millennia

241
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,019
wouldn't be scared of it.

242
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,691
Look.

243
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,659
Past lives we'd fight, argue.

244
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,027
A lot.

245
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,799
But we'd settle matters
as warriors.

246
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,500
- What?

247
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,402
Like I beat you,

248
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,504
and you give up this plan
to follow hunter?

249
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,507
- Yeah, except you won't be able
to beat me.

250
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,344
But you can absolutely try.

251
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,914
Winner gets to decide,
little lady.

252
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,990
- I remember when you told
mom and dad

253
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,193
that you wanted to go to
sleepaway camp.

254
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,662
- This'll be a little different.

255
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,398
- Time travel.

256
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,699
I can't believe we're
talking about it

257
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,034
like it's something real.

258
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,602
- I know.

259
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,642
- I think you should go.

260
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,179
- Laurel,

261
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,582
I died.

262
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,419
I'm still picking up
those pieces.

263
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,454
The Lazarus pit brought me back,

264
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,890
but it left me with this

265
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,526
need to take.

266
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,262
To kill.

267
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,631
I'm dangerous.

268
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,966
- After you died,

269
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,536
I needed a channel for my grief.

270
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:54,038
I found it in becoming
the black canary.

271
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,308
I found it in you.

272
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,012
- For me, being the canary
was never that positive.

273
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,582
- Then don't be the canary.

274
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,817
Do what Oliver's been doing.

275
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,653
Do what this rip hunter
is offering you

276
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,855
the chance to do and...

277
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,228
Be a hero in the light.

278
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,032
Be the white canary.

279
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,971
- Where did you get this?

280
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,841
- I have a resourceful friend
named cisco.

281
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,445
- Where's the mask?

282
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,281
- You don't need it anymore.

283
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,851
You've lived in the shadows
long enough.

284
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,122
- I can't believe you're
thinking of

285
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,024
hooking up with the englishman.

286
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,526
We're thieves. Crooks.
Criminals.

287
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,495
I have no desire
to save the world.

288
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,698
Especially 100 years
after I'm dead.

289
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,335
- He said across time, Mick.
What about the years before?

290
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,838
Before fingerprints and
surveillance cameras

291
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,040
and DNA analysis.

292
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,509
Why did we become criminals?

293
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,779
- Because we hate working
and we love money.

294
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,448
- We could steal the Mona Lisa
straight off Da Vinci's easel,

295
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,451
snatch the hope diamond
before it was discovered.

296
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,687
This is everything
we got into thieving for

297
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,056
in the first place.

298
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,458
More than everything.

299
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,963
- You want me in, I'm in.

300
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,032
But I'm not gonna be
anyone's hero.

301
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,638
- Jefferson, it's imperative
we remain together

302
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,806
for our powers to work.

303
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,507
- In case you haven't noticed,

304
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,309
I'm still getting used to
the whole powers thing,

305
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,078
and now that's you're adding
time travel to the mix--

306
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,180
- do you have any idea
what an extraordinary

307
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,815
opportunity we've been given?

308
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,484
- A chance to get murdered
by an immortal psychopath.

309
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,153
No thanks.

310
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,589
Look, I'm a 20-year-old
auto mechanic.

311
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,093
The world is better off without
me trying to save it.

312
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,663
- I don't understand
your decision.

313
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,334
- But I respect it.

314
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,703
Perhaps I can persuade
Mr. hunter

315
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,373
that he needs my knowledge
as a physicist

316
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,010
and not my abilities
as firestorm,

317
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:16,080
so I propose we have a toast

318
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,450
to my grand and solo adventure.

319
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,719
To saving the world.

320
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,955
- Knock yourself out.

321
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,861
- You took the words
right out of my mouth.

322
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,587
- Professor!

323
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,756
This is the place.

324
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,591
- I think we're being punked.

325
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,061
Do people still say "punked"?
- No.

326
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,064
- I see your buddy threw himself
a going-away party.

327
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,565
- Yes, I believe
he drank something

328
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,069
that didn't quite
agree with him.

329
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,837
- You don't look too happy
to be here.

330
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,238
- Perceptive.

331
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,775
- Well, I see you've all
decided to come.

332
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,578
Well then, we can be on our way.

333
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,913
- I ain't footing it anywhere.

334
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,681
- A time master's sacred charge

335
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,850
is to do no harm
to the timeline.

336
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,618
Can you imagine what a timeship
would look like

337
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,654
in, say, victorian england?

338
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,591
- Holographic indigenous
camouflage projection.

339
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:36,194
- Indeed.

340
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,707
- It's called the waverider.

341
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,777
It's been my ship
for over a decade.

342
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,280
Shall we?

343
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,121
- Excuse me, would you mind,
um...

344
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,823
Thank you.

345
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,039
- Whoa.

346
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,473
I bet it uses ionic propulsion.

347
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,741
- I doubt that very much,

348
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,676
given that
even advanced technology

349
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,379
wouldn't be able to sustain
an ionic reaction.

350
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,415
- It's possible if you stabilize
the quantum flux.

351
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,583
You know, we actually covered
this before, professor Stein,

352
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,986
when I was your student,
many moons ago?

353
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,389
Perhaps you remember my paper on
subspace field mechanics?

354
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,392
- I don't remember you,
Mr. Palmer.

355
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,794
- Oh.

356
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,064
- Whatever you roofied him with,
I'd like some.

357
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,432
- I did not roofie him.

358
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,934
- Oh, I ain't judging.

359
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,570
- I have never seen anything
like this before.

360
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,072
- Neither have I,
and considering

361
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,106
I have 4,000 years
worth of memories,

362
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,741
that's saying something.

363
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,610
- How does a vessel of this size
function without a crew?

364
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:00,611
- I don't need one.

365
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,612
I have Gideon.

366
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,181
<i> - Welcome aboard.</i>

367
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,682
<i> I am Gideon,</i>

368
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,517
<i> an interactive</i>
<i> artificial consciousness</i>

369
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,187
<i> programmed to operate</i>
<i> this vessel's critical systems</i>

370
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,755
<i> and aid captain hunter</i>
<i> in his mission.</i>

371
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,623
- Captain?

372
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,226
- Gideon's been working on
helping me locate vandal savage.

373
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,395
- I thought you said he's pretty
active in the 22nd century.

374
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,896
- Perhaps engaging savage
at the height of his powers

375
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,364
isn't the best strategy.

376
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,899
- Indeed.

377
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,801
Unfortunately, savage has
kept his movements

378
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,969
hidden throughout history.

379
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,270
Not even Gideon can determine

380
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,605
where or when we can find him.

381
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,708
But I have the next best thing:

382
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,543
The man who can.

383
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,912
Professor aldus boardman.

384
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,281
Professor boardman is the
world's leading--well, only--

385
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,617
expert on vandal savage.

386
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,252
We're gonna
pay him a little visit.

387
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,122
<i> - Course plotted for</i>
<i> St. roch, New Orleans.</i>

388
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,992
- St. roch?
<i> - October 17, 1975.</i>

389
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,894
- I suggest you all
strap yourselves in.

390
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,430
Temporal navigation isn't
something one wants to be

391
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,432
standing up for.

392
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,974
- Time travel.
Cool.

393
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,775
- Some of you may experience
some slight discomfort.

394
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,178
In very rare instances,
there will be some, uh,

395
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,579
bleeding from the eyeballs.

396
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,681
- I'm sorry, what?

397
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,454
- The human body is used to time
unfolding linearly.

398
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,096
- Oh.

399
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,497
- Jackson, I'm so glad
you're awake.

400
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,832
I didn't want you to miss this.

401
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,500
- Miss what?

402
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,304
What the--

403
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,006
- oh, no, I wouldn't unfasten
those if I were you.

404
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,009
- Get me off this--whatever
this thing is!

405
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,710
- Good luck explaining this.

406
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,212
- I did him a favor.

407
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,181
- He doesn't look
all that grateful.

408
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,050
- Just hang on and remain calm.

409
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,889
All your worlds are
about to change.

410
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,466
- Whoa.
- Seriously.

411
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,869
That was insanity!
- God!

412
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:14,011
- Whoa, that is some serious
darth vader going on there.

413
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,680
- Chronos to command.

414
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,049
I am closing in
on captain hunter's position.

415
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,218
- Hey, what you doing there,
bro?

416
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,753
- I am determining whether you
are integral to the timeline.

417
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,021
- Okay.

418
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,524
- You are not.

419
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,179
- Oh, I should have
mentioned it before.

420
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,348
Nausea is one of the
side effects of time travel,

421
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,382
along with--

422
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,883
- aah!
- Vertigo.

423
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,885
- I can't see.
- And temporary blindness.

424
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,220
Oh, it should only last
a minute.

425
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,955
After all, that was
a mere jaunt.

426
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,358
The further back in time you go,
the worse the side effects.

427
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,692
Better?
- It's all relative.

428
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,728
- Good.

429
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,530
- I can't believe
you kidnapped me.

430
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,766
Hey, I want to go home.
- Good news, then.

431
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,302
2016 will be around in,
uh, 41 years.

432
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,104
Now, you three, feel free
to make yourselves comfortable

433
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,939
back here on the ship,
while the rest of you

434
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,474
are coming with me to find
professor boardman.

435
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,276
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

436
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,711
You're benching us?
- I thought we were a team.

437
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,879
- This mission doesn't require
your particular skill set.

438
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,648
Yet.

439
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,083
- Meaning you don't need anyone
killed, maimed, or robbed.

440
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,551
- Precisely.

441
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,619
- Sure it's a good idea
to leave these two

442
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,154
unsupervised on a time machine?

443
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,622
- Hey, haircut!

444
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,557
Deafness wasn't
one of the side effects.

445
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,592
- We better hurry up.
Professor boardman will die

446
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,127
in less than 24 hours.

447
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,428
- What's the point in
cutting it so close?

448
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,130
- Because if he's
destined to die,

449
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,065
then he doesn't have a timeline
for us to disrupt,

450
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,567
and his impact on the future
will be minimal.

451
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,769
How brilliant.

452
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:45,936
- And depressing.

453
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,305
How does he die?

454
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,307
- Uh, he's found dead
in his university

455
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,575
from unknown causes.
Come on.

456
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,445
- Are you coming?
- I'll stay put.

457
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,280
- You'd rather stay with them?

458
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,581
- They didn't drug me.

459
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,183
- Point taken.

460
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,821
- This is unbelievable.
1975.

461
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,791
- Imagine all the wondrous
applications of this technology.

462
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,493
A chance to witness the
construction of the pyramids,

463
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,362
the end of the dinosaurs.

464
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,164
- I've never been to 1975.

465
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,799
It's rather colorful.

466
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,001
- So, where can we find
professor boardman?

467
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,370
- In his lecture hall.

468
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,982
- Oh, man.
We're too late.

469
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,785
- This is--I'm, I'm sorry.

470
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,890
You.

471
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,225
Both of you.

472
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,027
- You know who we are?

473
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,664
- I've been studying you
my whole life.

474
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,998
Ever since, as a child,

475
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,134
I first heard the story
of chay-ara,

476
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,536
high priestess of horus,
the hawk god,

477
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,405
and her lover, price khufu.

478
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:58,576
I hoped and prayed
this day might come.

479
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:01,178
- Well, then, looks like
we've come to the right place.

480
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,880
- I'm sorry.
Who are you?

481
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,548
- A fellow historian,

482
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,251
here to discuss
another passion of yours:

483
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,654
Vandal savage.

484
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,156
- There's no way
of telling your story

485
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:15,493
without telling his also.

486
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,331
<i> - Okay...</i>

487
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,667
- Why does this stupid station
play nothing but reruns?

488
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,703
- Don't even bother
trying to explain.

489
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,606
- Am I the only one on this ship
who could really use a drink?

490
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,575
I say we go get weird
in the '70s.

491
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,110
- Excellent idea.

492
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,246
- I got the perfect outfit.

493
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,181
<i> - Perhaps captain hunter</i>
<i> was unclear</i>

494
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,949
<i> with his instructions</i>
<i> to remain onboard.</i>

495
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,684
- Shut it, metal mouth.

496
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,287
- Oh, you're not quite ready
to run with this crew.

497
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,922
Sorry, kid.

498
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,457
- Wait, you're just gonna
leave me here?

499
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,759
- I said I'd take care of you.

500
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,962
- 4,000 years ago,

501
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,632
vandal savage was
an Egyptian priest,

502
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,568
secretly in love
with a priestess.

503
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,203
You.

504
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,771
Or, rather,

505
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,773
you in your first life.

506
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,578
<i> But you were</i>
<i> in love with another.</i>

507
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,047
<i> Prince khufu.</i>

508
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,284
<i> Savage, or hath-set</i>
<i> as he was then known,</i>

509
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,152
<i> learned of the affair</i>
<i> and was consumed</i>

510
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,288
<i> with jealous rage.</i>

511
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,056
- You believe me yet?

512
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,193
- Which drove him
to murder you both.

513
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,065
<i> And prayed for the hawk god,</i>
<i> horus,</i>

514
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:32,303
<i>to damn the objects of his hate</i>
<i> for all eternity.</i>

515
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,639
But chay-ara had
a prayer of her own,

516
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,942
that horus would
protect them forever.

517
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:40,744
But another life was
bound to theirs by accident.

518
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,146
- Savage's.

519
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,181
That's why
he wants us both dead.

520
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,683
- My theory is that
the three of you

521
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,018
were exposed to the same
radiation by the meteorites.

522
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,687
- We all share the same power.

523
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,755
- And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

524
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,691
That's what maintains
his immortality.

525
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,292
- That's impossible.

526
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,595
- Unless the meteorites
contained a mutative element,

527
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,763
like the particle accelerator
that caused your powers.

528
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,298
- But without evidence,
you're asking us

529
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,366
to take you at your word?

530
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,601
- It's not my word.

531
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:04,969
It's theirs.

532
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:09,373
But you still don't remember me,
do you?

533
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,409
- We knew you in our past lives.

534
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,347
- You've told me
your entire story,

535
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,482
stretching back
through the ages,

536
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,717
but when I first knew you,

537
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:23,053
it was after world war I,

538
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,890
and your names were
Joe and Edith.

539
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,025
Edith boardman.

540
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,629
- Wait, i--we were related?

541
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,667
I don't remember you.
I'm so sorry.

542
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,068
- Don't be.

543
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,237
You always warned me
that if I ran into you

544
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,705
in your next life,

545
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,375
you might have forgotten me.

546
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,710
That's us

547
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,080
at the world's fair.

548
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:57,955
You're just as beautiful
as I remember you.

549
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,960
Mother.

550
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,902
- How old were you when--

551
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,738
- you two were murdered?

552
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,674
Ten.

553
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,242
My whole life, you taught me
to be careful,

554
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,610
to keep moving,

555
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,545
always one step ahead of savage,

556
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,948
but after tracking you
for 4,000 years,

557
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,683
he'd gotten good.

558
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,551
He found us
in the middle of the night

559
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:30,888
at a fleabag motel
in north Carolina.

560
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,756
You hid me in the closet,

561
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,059
made me promise that
no matter what I heard,

562
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:38,629
I'd stay put.

563
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,265
And I did.

564
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,767
- Sorry to interrupt
your family time,

565
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,402
but we were hoping you could
tell us a bit more

566
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,606
where to locate
savage's present whereabouts.

567
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,410
- He hides in the shadows,

568
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:56,780
never drawing
too much attention,

569
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,215
but every lifetime,

570
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,751
placing himself near
the seat of power,

571
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:04,121
sowing seeds of destruction.

572
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,723
Who remembers
the name of the man

573
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:08,759
who whispered in the ear
of gavrilo princip,

574
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:12,596
and convinced him to start
world war I?

575
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,298
- Why?
What does he get out of that?

576
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,400
- The more the world is focused
on destroying itself,

577
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:20,070
the less it notices an immortal
psychopath in its midst.

578
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:24,908
- With the ultimate goal of
subjugating the entire planet.

579
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,679
- He killed your parents,
professor boardman.

580
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:32,783
Something tells me you know
where to locate vandal savage.

581
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,251
- I have

582
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:37,821
an educated guess.

583
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,094
- Ah. Dollar beers.

584
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,196
You got to love the '70s.

585
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,466
Who wants to listen to some
captain and tennille?

586
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,201
My mother played it.

587
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,270
A lot.

588
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,977
- Wow, you guys are
really far out.

589
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,048
- You want to dance, Leonard?
- You go right ahead.

590
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,649
I'll watch.

591
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,019
- Suit yourself.

592
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,029
- Can I help you?
- Mm.

593
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,665
How about you join me
in the parking lot?

594
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,000
- Hmm, tempting,

595
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,335
but you're not my type.

596
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:28,906
But your lady,
on the other hand,

597
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:32,176
well, she looks just my speed.

598
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,911
- Maybe you didn't understand
my request,

599
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,513
bitch.

600
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,316
Aah!
Son of a...

601
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,718
- I got this.

602
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,738
- Now I could stand
for a little help.

603
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,789
- I love the '70s.

604
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,560
- Gideon.
That is your name, right?

605
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,962
<i> - How may I help you?</i>

606
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,897
- I assume this ship has
a, uh,

607
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,298
autopilot or something?

608
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,200
<i> - You assume correctly.</i>
- Great.

609
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,804
In that case, i'ma need you
to take me back to 2016.

610
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:36,206
See, me being here,
it's all a big mistake.

611
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,475
<i> - Captain hunter told me</i>
<i> you'd try to do this,</i>

612
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,711
<i> and he also told me not to</i>
<i> listen to anything you say.</i>

613
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:42,112
- Well, you are a computer.

614
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,547
You have to listen to me!

615
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:44,982
<i> - You seem overwrought,</i>
<i> Mr. Jackson.</i>

616
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,650
<i> If you'd like to go</i>
<i> to the medbay,</i>

617
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:47,951
<i> I'd be happy</i>
<i> to prescribe you a sedative.</i>

618
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,888
- I do not need another roofie!

619
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,889
Whoa!

620
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:52,890
What was that?

621
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,591
<i> - A thermite grenade.</i>

622
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:57,027
<i> It seems someone is trying</i>
<i> to breach the hull.</i>

623
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,430
<i> His name is chronos.</i>

624
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,666
<i> He's a temporal bounty hunter.</i>

625
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,469
<i> The ship is taking heavy fire.</i>

626
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,137
- I know!

627
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,840
Aren't we supposed to be
invisible or something?

628
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,909
You need to get us
out of here now!

629
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,911
- A lifetime of research
on vandal savage

630
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,479
that all points
in this direction.

631
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,147
This should help you find him,

632
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,117
and the vengeance that has
eluded me all these years.

633
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,085
- Jefferson--something's
happening to Jefferson!

634
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,154
- We seem to have a little
problem back a the, uh,

635
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,656
vessel.

636
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,324
There's an intruder.
We really must be going now.

637
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,992
Thank you for everything.

638
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,194
- Wait.

639
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,461
We can't just leave him here.

640
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,130
- We have to get back now.

641
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,098
- You said he's going to die
in 24 hours.

642
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,500
- And we can stop it.

643
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,202
- Are either of you
a time master?

644
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,670
I didn't think so.

645
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,306
I've spent years studying
the implications

646
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,373
of chronological alteration.

647
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,676
- Good for you,

648
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:46,810
but we're not going anywhere

649
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,379
unless our son's coming with us.

650
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,952
- Why is chronos attacking us?

651
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,286
<i> - Perhaps captain hunter</i>
<i> is best suited</i>

652
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,621
<i> to answer that query.</i>

653
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,223
- Fire photon torpedoes
or something!

654
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,058
<i> - Only captain hunter</i>
<i> is authorized.</i>

655
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,326
- Where is captain hunter?

656
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,827
- Dr. Palmer, please tell me--

657
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,796
- I didn't leave my exo-suit
on the ship?

658
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:08,165
Okay, but I'd be lying.

659
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,407
- Unh!

660
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,183
- Who the hell is this guy?

661
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:28,385
- Aah!

662
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,729
- Is that a laser gun?

663
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,105
- Gotta get back to the ship
and bond with Jefferson.

664
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,106
Cover me!

665
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,174
- Cover me too.

666
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:00,117
- Oh, you crazy old man.

667
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,919
- Aah!

668
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,256
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

669
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,225
- Seriously?
It's Dr. Palmer.

670
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,560
- Get down!

671
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,229
- Aah!

672
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,931
- We need to merge!

673
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,573
- We go out for one lousy drink,

674
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:24,975
and you guys somehow manage

675
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,944
to pick a fight with boba fett.

676
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,112
- Aah.

677
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,591
- Aah!

678
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:42,993
Aah!

679
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,729
Ah...

680
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,831
- Aldus!
- We'll get you out of here!

681
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,969
You're doing good.

682
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,074
<i> - Professor boardman</i>
<i> has sustained</i>

683
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,608
<i> severe internal injuries.</i>

684
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,110
- Prepare the medbay to receive
professor boardman

685
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,111
and get us out of here!

686
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,179
<i> - Course heading?</i>

687
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,148
- Anywhere but here!

688
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,294
<i> - Our cloaking shield</i>
<i> and aft entrance</i>

689
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:19,262
<i> have been significantly</i>
<i> compromised, captain.</i>

690
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,964
- Yes, I can see that, Gideon.

691
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,799
Station us in the temporal zone
while I work on repairs.

692
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,201
- Temporal zone?

693
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,136
- Yeah, it's essentially
a time limbo.

694
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,804
We can hide out there for a bit.

695
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,706
Another temporal jump would risk
revealing our position.

696
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,008
- A time limbo?
Astonishing.

697
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,142
- Oh, there's something
you people

698
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,343
don't know about time travel?

699
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,045
That's surprising, isn't it?

700
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,381
Considering none of you have
ever time traveled before.

701
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:38,782
Bringing a family member
from the past

702
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,450
onto a timeship?

703
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,686
Breaking out and carousing
around the 1970s?

704
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,654
We've barely begun,
and already this is the worst,

705
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,891
unmitigated disaster
of my career.

706
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,695
I see why you got the hots
for that one.

707
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,964
- My son is hurt because of you.

708
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:55,665
Who attacked us?

709
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,468
Something of a long story.

710
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,737
- Better tell it fast, rip,
'cause it doesn't look like

711
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,173
the lady's in a patient mood.

712
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:06,043
- Neither am I.

713
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,310
- His name is chronos.

714
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:10,914
He works for
the council of time masters.

715
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,419
My former employers.

716
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,687
- I thought you were
a time master.

717
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,390
- As I've expressed,
time's not a linear thing.

718
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,493
At some point I was, in fact,
a time master.

719
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,595
Will you people please
stop hitting me?

720
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,932
- Start telling the truth!

721
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,567
- I relinquished my position
as a time master

722
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,103
when I commandeered
the waverider.

723
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,539
Chronos was clearly sent
to bring me in.

724
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,507
- You lied to us.
- Of course I lied to you.

725
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,177
I needed your help--you all
barely said yes as it was.

726
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,612
- What about the legends part?

727
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,816
- Ooh, you lied about that too,
didn't you?

728
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,187
- I chose you all because,
a hundred years from now,

729
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:54,758
your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

730
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,396
I needed your help without
disturbing the history of 2166.

731
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:04,201
- So, we're like
the opposite of legends.

732
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,471
- Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't kill you.

733
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,473
- Ditto the arsonist.

734
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:10,774
- Because Gideon wouldn't
listen to your commands

735
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,476
and you'd be stuck here forever.

736
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:14,411
- Great, so we're not
an elite team of heroes

737
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,046
on a sanctioned mission,
sent to rid the future

738
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,547
of its most horrific bad guy.

739
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,416
Just a collection of nobodies

740
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,585
who time really doesn't
give a damn about.

741
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,654
- I didn't lie
about the mission itself.

742
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,557
Or the brutality and
ruthlessness of savage.

743
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,126
Or my need for your help.

744
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,760
- I don't imagine
you're the kind of guy

745
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,096
who quits his job and
takes on this kind of threat

746
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,898
for altruistic reasons,

747
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,467
so rip, why don't you tell us:

748
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,571
What did vandal savage
do to you?

749
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,675
The time masters
discourage marriage.

750
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,111
They urge against procreation
even more.

751
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,280
A time master should be free of
any personal entanglements

752
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:54,084
that might compromise him.

753
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,752
But...

754
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,688
I fell in love,

755
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,926
and we had a child.

756
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,162
A boy.

757
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:07,998
Jonas.

758
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,529
- Savage killed your family.

759
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,666
- He slaughtered my family.

760
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,534
And thousands of other families.

761
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,670
And that body that I swore
an oath to serve

762
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,706
turned a blind eye.

763
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,909
They continue
to turn a blind eye.

764
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,744
I won't.

765
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,713
The last thing that my child
saw in this world

766
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,982
was that monster's face.

767
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,051
You can be damn well sure
that when savage dies,

768
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:04,087
the last face he sees
will be mine.

769
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,255
I understand,
given the circumstances,

770
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,856
if you wish to return home.

771
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,658
We can make the jump
once the repairs are done,

772
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,562
if and when
professor boardman stabilizes.

773
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,536
- I think we all need
a little time

774
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:22,973
to consider our options.

775
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,120
- Just get some rest.

776
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:42,692
- There's something
I've wanted you to have.

777
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:46,129
It's around my neck.

778
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,774
It was my mother's.

779
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,710
Yours.

780
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:03,680
- It's beautiful.

781
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,450
I remember it.

782
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:30,140
- Thank you.

783
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,075
Rip wouldn't have allowed me
to bring aldus onboard

784
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,143
if you hadn't said so--

785
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,011
- of course.

786
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,183
Chay-ara...

787
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,985
Sorry.

788
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,853
Kendra.

789
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,823
- No, it's okay.

790
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,260
Chay-ara is fine.

791
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,271
- Seems an apology is in order.

792
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:02,806
What I did was wrong.

793
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:05,175
I should never have forced you
to come along.

794
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,477
But, for me, the opportunity

795
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,513
to travel through time,

796
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,816
see the mysteries
of the universe revealed,

797
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:16,052
notions I've spent
my whole life studying--

798
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,722
- please do not geek out on
quantum physics right now.

799
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:22,792
- Mr. hunter was offering
grand adventure.

800
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,160
And at my age, you never know

801
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,563
how many adventures
you have left.

802
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,131
- Hey,

803
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,333
I saw your 40-yard dash
onto the ship

804
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,535
with that chronos guy
shooting at you.

805
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:36,306
I think you got plenty of
adventures left.

806
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,708
- Yes, perhaps you're right.

807
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,078
Back home.
As firestorm.

808
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,713
- What if
i don't want to go home?

809
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,815
Yet, I mean.

810
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,852
- Why the change of heart?

811
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:51,154
- You ever play football?

812
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:54,057
Yeah, I didn't think so.

813
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,160
Anyway...The best feeling

814
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:58,828
I ever got
from being on the field

815
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,563
wasn't when I made a great play,

816
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,499
or we won some game.

817
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,034
It was when one of my teammates
took a tackle for me,

818
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:08,204
and I knew they were gonna
make sure I was safe,

819
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,107
that nobody got to me.

820
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,109
Watching all of you
rush back to the ship,

821
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,111
even those two knuckleheads,

822
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,580
to take on chronos?

823
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,517
Made me feel the same way.

824
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,420
I like being
part of a team, man.

825
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,124
- Me too.

826
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,463
- Watch it!

827
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,432
- Sorry.

828
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,267
Sorry.

829
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:43,139
What's the point of us even
giving this a second thought?

830
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,707
Rip has already seen the future.

831
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:48,278
He knows exactly what's in store
for each of us.

832
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,780
Might as well have stayed dead,

833
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,782
'cause the world doesn't need
any of us.

834
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,617
You're just a lost assassin.

835
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,253
You're just a pair of
good-for-nothing criminals.

836
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,055
- I can live with that.

837
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,391
- Well, I can't.

838
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:04,894
Can't live with somebody
putting a cap on my destiny.

839
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:08,898
Spent my whole life
working to be something greater

840
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,668
by becoming something smaller.

841
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,102
Then some guy
comes along and tells me

842
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,072
that being the atom
is as insignificant

843
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,141
as an actual atom.

844
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,644
- That's not what he said.

845
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,747
Rip said that in<i> his</i> future

846
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,649
we're nobodies,

847
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,420
but this mission is about
changing the future.

848
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:33,623
I mean, if we have the power
to change the world,

849
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:37,093
don't you think we have the
power to change our own fate?

850
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,464
- For better or for worse.

851
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,533
- That's a very good point.

852
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,439
What do you think, Gideon?

853
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:51,774
<i> - I calculate</i>
<i> a less than 6% likelihood</i>

854
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:52,976
<i> that they decide</i>
<i> to go on with the mission.</i>

855
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,711
- I meant about the repairs.

856
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:56,613
<i> - And there has been another</i>
<i> unfortunate consequence</i>

857
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,047
<i> of chronos's attack.</i>

858
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,617
<i> Care to hear about it?</i>
- Not really.

859
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,785
- He's gone.

860
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:09,792
Our son--or, our son
from our previous life.

861
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,795
It's all too confusing.

862
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,297
- I'm very sorry.

863
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:17,133
- Actually, you don't
get the blame for this.

864
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,801
This was my fault.

865
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,570
If I hadn't insisted
on bringing him back here,

866
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,139
he might have died peacefully,
in his sleep maybe.

867
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,241
- Don't torture yourself
with recriminations.

868
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:26,676
One of the great lessons
of time travel

869
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,344
is that many things
cannot be changed.

870
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,979
Time wants to happen.

871
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:33,516
Chronos, even vandal, won't be
the only enemy we face.

872
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:36,986
Very often, it will be
time itself.

873
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,421
- Whether it wants to happen
or not,

874
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:39,522
we're gonna change time,

875
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,924
erase savage's future,

876
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:42,759
and earn our rightful place
in history.

877
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,327
- Dr. Palmer is correct.

878
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,195
We may not be legends
in your time, captain,

879
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:50,166
but we are going to decide
our own fates.

880
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,435
- I don't give a damn about
being a legend,

881
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,271
as long as we end savage
once and for all.

882
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,407
- I can get down with that.

883
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,409
- And our malcontents?

884
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,010
- I like killing people.

885
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,579
- We're in.

886
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,347
For now.

887
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,617
- So how do we find this guy?

888
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:10,253
- Professor boardman had
a theory about that.

889
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,455
I've already had Gideon
plot a course.

890
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,736
- You know what this is?

891
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:30,640
An instrument to make this world
a better place.

892
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:33,443
History teaches us
that the cause of humanity

893
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,813
is only advanced through strife.

894
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:40,650
There's no renaissance without
the dark ages.

895
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:43,553
Man had no interest
in splitting the atom

896
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:46,456
until world war ii.

897
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,060
I'm just trying

898
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:54,998
to make this world
a better place,

899
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,500
one war at a time.

900
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,724
<i> - Greg, move your head.</i>
