1
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,690
<i>Nowadays, the US government
can listen to anything you say.</i>

2
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,082
<i>They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,</i>

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,562
<i>and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.</i>

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,406
<i>You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.</i>

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,603
<i>But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.</i>

6
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,921
<i>First off,
there was no Internet.</i>

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,411
<i>No cells.</i>

8
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,164
<i>The best they had were satellite phones,</i>

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,484
<i>and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.</i>

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,884
<i>On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...</i>

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,327
<i>the landowners, the politicians...</i>

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,441
<i>And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.</i>

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,164
<i>What's up, Lizard?</i>

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,567
We're going out tonight.

15
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,882
<i>And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.</i>

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,567
<i>That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify</i>

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,120
<i>- the voices of our targets.</i>

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,330
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>And you guessed it:
no GPS either.</i>

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,921
Hammer, prepare to engage.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,408
<i>Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.</i>

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,246
<i>So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.</i>

23
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,006
OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,242
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,887
<i>Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.</i>

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,162
La Dispensaria.

27
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,809
I've got a table ready.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,448
Show up around midnight.

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,570
<i>- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it,</i>

30
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,881
<i>but he'd just made himself a date.</i>

31
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,885
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,849
Hammer, disengage.

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,207
So who do we give this to? DEA?

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,807
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,962
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,448
<i>By "the other guy," he meant me.</i>

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,683
<i>I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.</i>

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,322
<i>And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.</i>

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,447
Hello?

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,966
<i>Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.</i>

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,882
Got it.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,611
<i>He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.</i>

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,045
OK.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,691
<i>I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,</i>

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,128
<i>but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.</i>

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,205
<i>So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.</i>

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,441
<i>Hola.</i>

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,201
- La Dispensaria?

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,327
All right.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,331
Guess who that was.

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,680
Your partner.

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,489
He just gave me a great gift.

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,921
Poison.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,008
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,288
Yeah, sure.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,488
He's not a fool.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,766
Gotta go.

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,851
Gonna stick me with the bill?

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,411
Cheap son of a bitch.

60
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,131
<i>In case you're wondering,
this is the asshole.</i>

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,090
<i>Javier Peña, my partner.</i>

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,682
<i>And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,</i>

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,730
<i>the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.</i>

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,610
<i>Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.</i>

65
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,409
<i>Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.</i>

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,323
<i>Especially the local hitmen.</i>

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,164
<i>Colombians call them</i> sicarios.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,971
- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,491
- Let's go inside and have a good time.

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,562
<i>Now, Poison, he was one of the best.</i>

71
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,560
<i>Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.</i>

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,130
<i>Probably hundreds.</i>

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,001
<i>But don't get me wrong.</i>

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,323
<i>I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.</i>

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,921
<i>I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.</i>

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,403
It's on, boys!

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,723
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,849
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,127
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,610
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,125
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,208
<i>I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.</i>

84
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,648
<i>Yeah, I pushed the buttons.</i>

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,165
<i>But don't call me a bad guy just yet.</i>

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,325
My fellow Americans...

87
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,721
<i>Take Richard Nixon, for instance.</i>

88
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,925
<i>People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.</i>

89
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,922
<i>We thought he was one of the good guys.</i>

90
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,203
<i>And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy</i>

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,010
<i>because he hated the commies.</i>

92
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
<i>So we helped Pinochet seize power.</i>

93
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,882
<i>Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.</i>

94
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,644
<i>- Maybe not such a good guy after all.</i>

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,211
<i>But sometimes,
bad guys do good things.</i>

96
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,651
<i>Nobody knows this, but back in '73,
Chile was on its way</i>

97
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,691
<i>to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.</i>

98
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,646
How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

99
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,247
<i>They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline</i>

100
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,481
<i>to ship the product north.</i>

101
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,201
To be productive,
you can't waste money! Come on!

102
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,329
You're surrounded!

103
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,801
- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!

104
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,450
<i>But Pinochet spoiled the party.</i>

105
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,409
- What the fuck is going on here?

106
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,481
On the ground!

107
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,804
<i>He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.</i>

108
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,960
<i>And then, being Pinochet...</i>

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,045
<i>he had them all killed.</i>

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,771
- Attention!

111
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,366
- Weapons ready!

112
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,885
Aim!

113
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,881
Ready ammunition!

114
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,841
Fire!

115
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,841
<i> They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,</i>

116
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,845
<i>- only the cockroaches will survive.</i>

117
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,649
<i>I guess they were right.</i>

118
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,930
<i>The bullets missed Mateo Moreno,
aka Cockroach,</i>

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,241
<i>and he was smart enough to play dead.</i>

120
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,450
<i>He wasn't killed on that day.</i>

121
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,889
<i>Instead, he won the damn lottery.</i>

122
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,966
<i>Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.</i>

123
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,408
<i>Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.</i>

124
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,962
<i>A product whose offer
creates its own demand.</i>

125
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,442
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

126
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,410
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

127
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,963
- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.

128
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,361
A drug trafficker.

129
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,683
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes, a drug trafficker.

130
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,207
<i>Back then, we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine</i>

131
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,125
<i>- on the human brain.</i>

132
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,443
<i>We didn't know much, but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.</i>

133
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,887
...this will give us better results, OK?

134
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,169
<i>Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.</i>

135
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,483
<i>A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.</i>

136
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,408
<i>It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.</i>

137
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,609
<i>The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...</i>

138
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,841
<i>unless we're talking about cocaine.</i>

139
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,322
<i>Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.</i>

140
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,687
<i>He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.</i>

141
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,125
<i>Gracias</i>.

142
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,891
<i>And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.</i>

143
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,086
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

144
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,281
<i>Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.</i>

145
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,643
<i>And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.</i>

146
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,528
<i>The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.</i>

147
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,321
<i>- A typical Colombian smuggling family.</i>

148
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,801
<i>- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!</i>

149
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,083
<i>...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.</i>

150
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,920
<i>Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha,</i>

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>nicknamed "The Mexican,"
for his love of tequila and sombreros.</i>

152
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,690
<i>He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.</i>

153
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,126
<i>Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.</i>

154
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,725
<i>If you make it to the top...</i>

155
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,209
<i>- it means you've killed your enemies.</i>

156
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,327
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

157
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,170
<i>And sometimes, your partners.</i>

158
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,007
<i>Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.</i>

159
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,650
<i>So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.</i>

160
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,724
<i>Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.</i>

161
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,121
<i>The man who would
change my life forever.</i>

162
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,362
<i>Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.</i>

163
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,886
<i>Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.</i>

164
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,767
<i>At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.</i>

165
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,363
<i>But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.</i>

166
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,648
<i>They didn't play by the same rules.</i>

167
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,531
Good day.

168
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,566
Pablo Escobar?

169
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,085
Where's Felipo?

170
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,203
Felipo's been arrested.

171
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,089
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

172
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,164
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

173
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,686
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

174
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,888
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

175
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,564
Show some respect.

176
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,961
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

177
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,044
How do you know my name?

178
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,328
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

179
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,044
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

180
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,085
There's Garcia, Lopez...

181
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,208
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes, Pinilla.

182
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,406
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

183
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,005
Pinilla...

184
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,923
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

185
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,082
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

186
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,730
I don't have all day.

187
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,530
Open it.

188
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,570
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

189
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,369
Who the fuck do you think you are?

190
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,842
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

191
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,729
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

192
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,529
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

193
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,409
Where are your import papers?

194
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,721
You need papers for these TV sets.

195
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,245
Take them.

196
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,046
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

197
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,441
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

198
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,329
It's for Carlitos.

199
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,371
Your son.

200
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,245
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

201
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,771
Hey, Pinilla!

202
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,123
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

203
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,168
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

204
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,444
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

205
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,967
- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,849
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

207
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,808
What's she doing with a guy like you?

208
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,641
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

209
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,844
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

210
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,446
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

211
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,683
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

212
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,923
- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- Yes.

213
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,486
Gentlemen...

214
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,722
I'm going to tell you who I am.

215
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,123
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

216
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,487
My eyes are everywhere.

217
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,520
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

218
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,721
without me knowing about it.

219
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,884
Do you understand? Not a finger.

220
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,723
One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

221
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,850
So look, I make deals for a living.

222
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,481
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

223
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,801
or accept the consequences.

224
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,811
Silver...

225
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,051
or lead.

226
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,090
You decide.

227
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,681
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right, then.

228
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,330
Yo, Pablo!

229
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,809
- This is Pablo.
- Hello.

230
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,848
- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.

231
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,446
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

232
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,443
All right,
yesterday we were talking,

233
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,969
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

234
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,451
Explain.

235
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,569
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

236
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,688
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

237
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,286
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

238
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,761
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

239
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,243
- Now tell him how much it costs.

240
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,286
In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

241
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,121
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

242
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,411
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

243
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,005
Also...

244
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,446
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

245
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,046
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

246
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,761
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

247
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,763
- we can find room on our trucks.

248
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,320
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

249
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,761
We're going to be rich.

250
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,605
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

251
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,084
Well look, Cuca...

252
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,088
you don't have any vision,
my friend.

253
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,087
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

254
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,329
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

255
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,920
- I love that song.

256
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,690
Rodrigo! One more.

257
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,527
<i>Back then, Miami was a paradise.</i>

258
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,490
<i>I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.</i>

259
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,409
<i>In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.</i>

260
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,686
DEA! Stop!

261
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,885
<i>I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.</i>

262
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,128
<i>Kevin was a little slow afoot.</i>

263
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,681
Why you running, huh?

264
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,770
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

265
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,762
What is that?

266
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,969
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

267
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,162
- Let's go celebrate.

268
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,805
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

269
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,760
- Go! Go! Go!

270
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,326
- How you like me now?

271
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,561
How much money you owe me?

272
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,404
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

273
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,124
That's right, that's right.

274
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,724
All right.
All right, who do we pick?

275
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,410
How 'bout her?

276
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,931
No, no, no,
we gotta fuck with him.

277
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,002
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...

278
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,923
Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?

279
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,128
- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.

280
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,330
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

281
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,686
- All right.
- Whoo!

282
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,888
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.

283
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,806
Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

284
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,450
Oh, she was checking out your ass.

285
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,931
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

286
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,931
Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

287
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,651
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

288
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,282
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

289
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,086
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

290
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,730
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

291
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,484
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

292
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,562
- You dicking me around?

293
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,885
Fuck it, I'm going in.

294
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,121
- Go get her.
- Mm!

295
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,009
- Yup.
- Hey, while you're up there,

296
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,605
get us another pitcher, will ya?

297
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,804
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

298
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,325
How you doing?

299
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,161
Busy.

300
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,287
I just said, "Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.

301
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,569
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know...

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,651
<i>Yeah, those bastards got me.</i>

303
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,041
<i>But I couldn't let it end like that.</i>

304
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,964
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

305
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,571
Uh, they're fucking with me.

306
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,087
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

307
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,446
You're a cop?

308
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,841
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

309
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,121
Drug Enforcement?

310
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,202
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

311
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,571
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?

312
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,246
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

313
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,049
give me your phone number?

314
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,450
How about a fake number?

315
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,521
That'll work.

316
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,089
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

317
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,366
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

318
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,850
Have a good night.

319
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,251
- Aah...

320
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,481
Shot down!

321
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,325
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

322
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,485
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

323
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,968
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

324
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,486
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

325
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,244
How much did that cost you?

326
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,448
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

327
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,561
<i>- I figured, what the hell.</i>

328
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,042
<i>Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.</i>

329
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,646
Hello?

330
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,610
So it wasn't a fake.

331
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,167
I thought you might figure it out.

332
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,641
After all, you're DEA.

333
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,122
<i>And just like that... she had me.</i>

334
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,560
<i>The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,</i>

335
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,449
<i>cocaine had him.</i>

336
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,885
It's been a while.

337
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,531
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

338
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,041
Would you like a little coffee?

339
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,770
Yeah, a coffee?

340
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,841
Yes, a coffee.

341
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,001
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

342
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,650
You sure?

343
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,850
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

344
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,801
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

345
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,564
Little magic leaves.

346
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,404
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

347
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,442
Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

348
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,606
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

349
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,725
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

350
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,643
Let it dry, dry, dry.

351
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,449
You use ammonia to get the paste.

352
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,090
And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

353
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,447
Here is the prize.

354
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,921
It's like the kitchen in your house.

355
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,003
Like baking a cake.

356
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,003
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

357
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,328
Look, an old press, an antique.

358
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,923
Now we put it in the oven.

359
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,606
Here's one.
The other will follow.

360
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,803
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

361
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,045
Well...

362
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,602
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

363
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,889
- No.
- You said a kilo.

364
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,405
We'll take five.

365
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,405
How do we get five across the border?

366
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,369
That's Gustavo's department.

367
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,085
This one has got a good engine.

368
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,766
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

369
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,081
would be under the rear wheel well.

370
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,288
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

371
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,691
Is this easy to take off?

372
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,491
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

373
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,961
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

374
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,010
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

375
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,690
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

376
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,922
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

377
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,166
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

378
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,481
- For three cars, that's 60 kilos.

379
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,882
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

380
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,530
$9,000 per kilo.

381
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,171
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

382
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,447
- That's it!

383
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,363
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.

384
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,169
- OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

385
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,126
<i>That's half a million dollars... per trip,</i>

386
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,329
<i>using the same smuggling routes
he always used.</i>

387
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,929
<i>Easiest money he ever made.</i>

388
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,164
<i>Back in Medellín,
Pablo didn't waste any time.</i>

389
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,924
<i>He bought a house
in his old neighborhood</i>

390
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,040
<i>and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.</i>

391
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,883
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

392
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,488
All this smells like shit to me.

393
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,121
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

394
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,521
The stinkier, the better.

395
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,440
All right.

396
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,289
What about all these lights?

397
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,360
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

398
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,809
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

399
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,804
I'm the artist here, clear?

400
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,086
Clear.

401
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,208
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

402
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,684
<i>It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.</i>

403
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,526
<i>But make no mistake,
it would change Medellín forever.</i>

404
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,046
You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

405
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,529
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

406
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,850
Let's build them a chimney.

407
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,126
- There you go.

408
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,123
Gentlemen, the first three?

409
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,682
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

410
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,808
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

411
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,123
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

412
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,727
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

413
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,882
 I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

414
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,926
<i>Like her son, Pablo 's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.</i>

415
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,167
Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

416
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,642
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

417
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,165
Trust me, Pablito.

418
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,208
I love it. Let's do it.

419
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,206
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

420
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,571
It's Gustavo.

421
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,765
Five kilos, right?

422
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,401
<i>Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.</i>

423
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,881
<i>He was a family man till the end.</i>

424
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,123
<i>The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.</i>

425
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,043
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

426
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,281
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.

427
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,489
<i>He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.</i>

428
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,881
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

429
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,962
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

430
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,605
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

431
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,966
Here's three.

432
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,646
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

433
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,529
- That's right.
- Pablito...

434
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,046
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

435
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,363
Look, my love...
it won't fit me.

436
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,204
Try it on.

437
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,486
Come here.

438
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,369
That's it.

439
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,885
Good, right?

440
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,481
One...

441
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,848
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

442
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,410
...three.

443
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,242
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

444
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,970
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

445
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,930
Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

446
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,607
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

447
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,205
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

448
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,362
He looks very handsome, son.

449
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,761
- Like a fag model, isn't that right?

450
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,810
<i>The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.</i>

451
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,211

452
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,965
Thank you.
Have a great day.

453
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,927

464
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,089
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

465
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,525
You like my jacket, brother?

466
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,763
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

467
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,363
I was in jail for a while, remember?

468
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,489
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

469
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,365
What you got there
is the perfect product.

470
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,926
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

471
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,844
It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

472
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,967
Yes, sir.

473
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,841
Here you go.

474
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,448
Go on. There are five kilos.

475
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,287
Where are you going?

476
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,921
I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.

477
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,361
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

478
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,245
<i>The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.</i>

479
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,607
<i>Drugs in, cash out.</i>

480
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,969
<i>And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.</i>

481
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,487
<i>And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.</i>

482
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,166
<i>Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,</i>

483
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,641
<i>the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.</i>

484
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,728
<i>He didn't even have to bribe the cops.</i>

485
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,371
<i>The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.</i>

486
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,886
<i>Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.</i>

487
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,760
<i>Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...</i>

488
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,925
<i>You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.</i>

489
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,407
<i>Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways</i>

490
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,562
<i>to smuggle the drug to Miami.</i>

491
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,291
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

492
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,886
You guys are pilots,

493
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,328
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

494
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,249
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

495
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,291
We'll take four.

496
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,850
All right, much better.

497
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,642
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

498
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,769
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

499
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,410
- See you later.
- Later.

500
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,086
Come in, please.

501
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,005
Look, here are the packets.

502
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,641
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

503
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,051
Easy, right?

504
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,646
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

505
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,841
All right?

506
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,002
But with you two,
we have a problem.

507
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,003
You girls are pregnant, right?

508
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,722
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

509
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,647
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

510
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,849
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

511
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,400
All right? All right. Perfect.

512
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,330
<i>During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogotá</i>

513
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,243
<i>had several mules on them.</i>

514
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,402
<i>They didn't even know about each other.</i>

515
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,084
<i>And you know what?</i>

516
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,290
<i>Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.</i>

517
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,328
<i>All we cared about was grass.</i>

518
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,928
<i>Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.</i>

519
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,050
<i>Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.</i>

520
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,089
<i>But even that didn't do it.</i>

521
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,443
<i>The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.</i>

522
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,648
Do you trust this guy?

523
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,326
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

524
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,483
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

525
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,210
But he's got good routes.

526
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,930
- Amigos!
- Hello, Carlos.

527
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,365
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

528
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,726
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

529
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,643
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

530
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,724
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

531
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,290
Smooth.

532
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,640
Let's get down to business.

533
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,611
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

534
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,923
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

535
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,722
- How far?
- Miami.

536
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,206
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

537
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,044
Counting the gasoline.

538
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,966
Carlos...

539
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,966
Yes?

540
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,368
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

541
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,246
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

542
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,089
We'll leave the engine, right?

543
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,890
- How much more?

544
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,406
About... 300 more.

545
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,449
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

546
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,844
<i>Within months after meeting Cockroach,</i>

547
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,046
<i>Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.</i>

548
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,728
<i>It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.</i>

549
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,883
<i>Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs</i>

550
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,450
<i>in the middle of the jungle.</i>

551
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,521
<i>Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,</i>

552
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,606
<i>he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.</i>

553
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,887
We brought you a little present.

554
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,285
Brazilians.

555
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,168
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

556
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,720
No, I'm not feeling well.

557
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,370
- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.

558
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,321
Hey, Gustavo.

559
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,806
What the fuck is up with you guys?

560
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,531
You're flying around in planes...

561
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,921
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca--

562
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,685
Look, let us explain what we have to--

563
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,410
Wait.

564
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,808
From now on,
in all of my labs...

565
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,488
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

566
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,961
- And whores from Brazil.
- ...and whores from Brazil.

567
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,486
- Just for you.
- One problem.

568
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,485
These are my labs. Mm?

569
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,570
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

570
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,086
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

571
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,403
<i>Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.</i>

572
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,166
<i>They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.</i>

573
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,449
<i>Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.</i>

574
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,246
How something like this
can make so much money!

575
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,530
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

576
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,568
What do you think, Pablo?

577
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,007
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

578
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,765
I wouldn't get involved.

579
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,128
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

580
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,448
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

581
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,889
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

582
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,924
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

583
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,681
the Peruvians will raise the price.

584
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,726
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

585
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,202
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

586
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,047
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

587
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,529
You need a lot of creativity for that.

588
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,762
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

589
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,640
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

590
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,281
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

591
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,931
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

592
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,123
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

593
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,683
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

594
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,603
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--

595
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,444
Deal?

596
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,881
Deal.

597
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,164
Sounds good to me.

598
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,645
All right,
I will create my own routes

599
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,247
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

600
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,209
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

601
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,685
Partners?

602
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,570
We know your policy toward partners.

603
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,810
Let's just call us...

604
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,650
"friendly associates."

605
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,970
To Miami.

606
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,128
To Miami!

607
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,808
<i>When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.</i>

608
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,721
<i>And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.</i>

609
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,287
<i>We thought we were
making a huge difference.</i>

610
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,285
<i>Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.</i>

611
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,530
<i>They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.</i>

612
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,969
<i>Pablo's coke flooded in.</i>

613
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,526
<i>It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.</i>

614
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,045
<i>And I mean that.</i>

615
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,327
<i>It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.</i>

616
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,325
<i>And with the money...</i>

617
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,289
<i>came the violence.</i>

618
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,443
<i>The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,</i>

619
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,205
<i>and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.</i>

620
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,167
<i>The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.</i>

621
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,081
<i>Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.</i>

622
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,605
<i>The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.</i>

623
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,570
<i>They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company</i>

624
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,608
<i>to hold all the extra corpses.</i>

625
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,643
<i>That was the first person I ever shot.</i>

626
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,120
<i>A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.</i>

627
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,923
Hey... it was self-defense.

628
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,090
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

629
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,082
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

630
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,724
He sells drugs, right?

631
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,049
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then fuck him.

632
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,326
What happened?

633
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,171
- Coming through!
<i>- I was about to finish my shift</i>

634
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,482
<i>when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.</i>

635
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,931
Stay with me.

636
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,610
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

637
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,691
<i>Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.</i>

638
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,202
<i>By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.</i>

639
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,046
- Pressure 60 over 40.
<i>- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.</i>

640
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,600
<i>- I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...</i>

641
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,401
<i>...but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.</i>

642
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,609
We did everything we could.

643
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,330
She died in the ER.

644
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,489
We tried to save the baby...

645
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,048
The baby died in my hands.

646
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,290
I'm so sorry.

647
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,044
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

648
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,689
Two of the pellets split open.

649
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,201
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

650
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,249
No one survives that.

651
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,287
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

652
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,081
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

653
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,322
Tell me something, Cockroach.

654
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,051
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

655
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,647
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

656
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,681
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

657
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,569
Let me give you a piece of advice.

658
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,009
Never say that to Pablo.

659
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,087
He's not as forgiving as I am.

660
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,208
<i>Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.</i>

661
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,643
<i>But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.</i>

662
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,611
<i>Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.</i>

663
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,011
- Stop!

664
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,442
What do you have in the spare tires?

665
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,642
390 kilos, Pablo.
We lost it.

666
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,963
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?

667
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,929
Just what I said, we lost it.

668
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,166
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

669
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,289
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

670
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,648
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

671
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,086
Look...

672
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:22,371
We've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

673
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,368
So how did we lose a load, brother?

674
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,842
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

675
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,410
Know what I mean?

676
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,764
And how much is he asking?

677
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,371
Too much.

678
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,890
What are you going to do?

679
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,605
Come back, Pablo.

680
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,044
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

681
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,770
Where are you going, Pablo?

682
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,720
Pablo?

683
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,885
What's going on, brother?

684
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,211
Mr. Escobar...

685
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,604
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

686
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,250
Eat. Shit.

687
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,804
What if I shot you in the head?

688
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,930
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

689
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,370
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

690
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,804
- We're DAS, Ibarra.

691
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,848
What's that faggot gonna do?

692
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,845
There we are.

693
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,729
No, lower, lower.

694
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,165
Not that low.

695
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,330
Ready.

696
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,762
Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

697
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,440
<i>- Pablo didn't know it then...</i>

698
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,286
<i>...but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.</i>

699
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,247
Remove the handcuffs.

700
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,090
You can go now, officer.

701
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,085
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

702
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,250
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

703
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,166
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

704
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,321
And you only gave us $150,000.

705
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,451
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

706
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,482
You know something?

707
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,643
I make deals for a living.

708
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,760
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

709
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,643
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

710
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,291
and everyone goes home happy.

711
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,926
Deal?

712
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,487
I'll give you one million dollars...

713
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,082
under one condition.

714
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,006
What is it?

715
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,971
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

716
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,327
Otherwise, how would you know?

717
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,242
Give me a name...

718
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,643
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

719
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,768
<i>Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.</i>

720
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,049
<i>Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,</i>

721
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,761
<i>he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.</i>

722
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:14,085
<i>Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business</i>

723
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,891
<i>that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.</i>

724
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,807
<i>He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?</i>

725
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,684
<i>The plan was to trade vehicles,</i>

726
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,843
<i>and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.</i>

727
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,051
<i>1200 kilos.</i>

728
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,964
<i>That would get us
on the cover of the</i> Miami Herald.

729
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,560
OK, gringos.

730
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,642
How's the plumbing business?

731
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,085
Fine.

732
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,524
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

733
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,448
Come on, amigo.
I'll show you.

734
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,565
<i>Everything was going perfect.</i>

735
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,681
Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

736
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,683
<i>Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.</i>

737
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,445
- Got a full load here, Murph--

738
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,651
Don't move! Don't move.

739
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,849
- Don't move! Don't move.

740
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,251
Get down!

741
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,007
- Hands! Down!

742
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,161
Don't look at me.

743
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,880
Fucking...

744
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,008
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz,

745
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,243
after taking into account
all due considerations,

746
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,531
bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

747
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,208
<i>I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.</i>

748
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,363
<i>My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.</i>

749
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,040
<i>The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,</i>

750
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,842
<i>paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?</i>

751
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,368
<i>La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.</i>

752
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:39,520
<i>From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.</i>

753
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,807
<i>And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,</i>

754
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,321
<i>no one much cared about that.</i>

755
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,844
<i>What got the US government
to take notice was the money.</i>

756
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,488
<i>Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.</i>

757
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,563
<i>And that... America couldn't take.</i>

758
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,404
<i>A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.</i>

759
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,690
<i>They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.</i>

760
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,049
<i>Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.</i>

761
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,567
<i>Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.</i>

762
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,487
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

763
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,928
<i>It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.</i>

764
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,206
Drugs are menacing our society.

765
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,807
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

766
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,008
They're killing our children.

767
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,889
<i>It was classic Reagan.</i>

768
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,884
<i>Folksy, direct and tough.</i>

769
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,203
<i>He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.</i>

770
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,607
<i>But it was Nancy who stole the show.</i>

771
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,930
Soto my young friends out there,
life can be great.

772
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,128
But not when you can't see it.

773
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,445
So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

774
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,807
as a precious gift to His children.

775
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,882
Say yes to your life.

776
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,284
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

777
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,806
No, no, no!
No, Pablo, no, no!

778
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,961
- No, no!

779
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,002
<i>They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,</i>

780
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,082
<i>only the cockroaches will survive.</i>

781
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,288
Leave that piece of shit there.

782
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,249
<i>I guess they were wrong.</i>

783
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,289
<i>During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.</i>

784
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,083
<i>But I wouldn't learn that till later.</i>

785
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,891
<i>My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.</i>

786
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,128
<i>But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?</i>

787
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,570
<i>No way.</i>

788
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,768
<i>He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.</i>

789
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,564
<i>So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.</i>

790
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,125
<i>It was his duty.</i>

791
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,922
<i>Cocaine in Miami?</i>

792
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,923
<i>Kilos from Colombia?</i>

793
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,287
<i>This was my war.</i>

794
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,886
<i>This was my duty.</i>

795
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,769
<i>And I was ready to fight it.</i>

796
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,411
<i>And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.</i>

797
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,720
Your ticket, please.

798
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,241
OK.

799
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,369
<i>We had no idea
what we were in for.</i>

800
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,009
<i>One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.</i>

801
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,764
<i>OK, man, what do we got?</i>

802
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,969
- We got Poison...
<i>- Excellent. Who else?</i>

803
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,405
We got Lizard.

804
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,284
Uh...

805
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,771
We got, we got...

806
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,484
- Big Badmouth.
<i>- That motherfucker.</i>

807
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,245
- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

808
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,927
<i>If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,</i>

809
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,004
<i>it's that life is more complicated
than you think.</i>

810
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,726
<i>Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.</i>

811
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,891
<i>In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...</i>

812
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,848
<i>- and hope for the best.</i>

813
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,571
Look at what happened, boss.

814
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,007
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

815
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,889
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

816
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,089
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

817
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,845
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

818
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,721
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

819
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,290
Half a million?

820
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,566
Do it.

821
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,165
As you wish, sir.

822
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,409
Fucking gringos.
