00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,244
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,462
CERTIFICATE OF ENTRY
AND DEPARTURE

5
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,757
I found out that he came back
to Korea a year and a half ago.

6
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,260
You met Kim Minsung, right?

7
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,183
I thought he had died.

8
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,935
He was alive.

9
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,270
Where is he now?

10
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,731
I can't tell you.

11
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,568
- Jungsub.
- He still has unfinished business.

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,237
No matter what it is,

13
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,200
I plan to protect him.

14
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,010
RESTRICTED CALL

15
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,814
Hello?

16
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,904
- Who are you?
- <i>I actually told him not to do it.</i>

17
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,489
<i>But Jungwook said</i>

18
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,033
<i>that we shouldn't leave her be.</i>

19
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,369
<i>He said she saw his face.</i>

20
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,412
<i>He said we must kill her.</i>

21
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,373
Han Kyungsoo. You're Han Kyungsoo, right?

22
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,172
<i>I'm telling you the truth.
I tried to stop him.</i>

23
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,675
<i>But Jungwook, that bastard…</i>

24
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,177
<i>He's unstoppable when he goes crazy.</i>

25
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,471
<i>He always gets his way.</i>

26
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,141
<i>I tried to stop him,</i>

27
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,144
<i>but he hit that woman
with his car in the end.</i>

28
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,646
Who are you, you bastard?

29
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,398
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,234
<i>I'll send you a location. Come alone.</i>

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,572
If you tell anyone,
I'll post this on the Internet.

32
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,158
Hello? Hey. Hello?

33
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,208
Damn it.

34
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,048
Are you going to leave him be?

35
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,010
This bastard killed Jaeyoung.
You need to take revenge.

36
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,638
I want to tear him to pieces,

37
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,892
but Myunghak insists on
keeping things lawful.

38
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,561
Uncle, for goodness' sake.

39
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,482
Chairman Yang,

40
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,360
since when did you abide by the law?

41
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,987
To be completely honest,

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,698
wasn't this what my father needed you for?

43
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,368
How will you get anything done
if you abide by the law?

44
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,127
Forget it.

45
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,966
I'll go alone.

46
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,219
I'll avenge

47
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,180
Jaeyoung's death.

48
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,643
Jungwook.

49
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,313
I feel ashamed.

50
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,525
I didn't prioritize Jaeyoung
as much as his friend did.

51
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,117
Where are they?

52
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,765
What are you looking for?

53
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,101
NFS materials. Anything will do.

54
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,478
National Forensic Service? Hold on.

55
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,648
National Forensic Service.

56
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,944
Here. This is a tire analysis
we received when the rapist,

57
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,113
Park Sungjin, ran over the victim.

58
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,374
What? Why does this…

59
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,685
KIM HYUNMIN

60
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,904
I heard you graduated from KAIST.
I'm also a fellow graduate.

61
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,574
Excuse me.

62
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,917
<i>The culprit who drives the black car…</i>

63
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,336
KIM HYUNMIN

64
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,796
<i>…has a crippled leg.</i>

65
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,430
Oh, Inspector Cha, what brings you here
at this hour?

66
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,476
Mr. Kim Minsung.

67
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:57,482
Perhaps, I should call you
Mr. Kim Hyunmin now.

68
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,615
CRASH

69
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,451
EPISODE 10

70
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,086
I never imagined

71
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,089
that we'd meet like this.

72
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,471
I'm glad to see you're alive.

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,895
Did the name, Kim Hyunmin,

74
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,942
come from Lee Hyunsoo and your name?

75
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,616
It was our baby's name.

76
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,786
Our unborn baby.

77
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,498
It was my wife's idea.

78
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,709
I never imagined that I'd use it.

79
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,550
Did you plan this from the start?

80
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,053
You faked your death,
changed your identity,

81
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,264
and became a forensic analyst, all to--

82
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,099
The man named Kim Minsung

83
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,144
died along with Hyunsoo
at the scene of the accident.

84
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,981
I simply wanted

85
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,317
<i>to lead a normal life like the others</i>

86
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,987
<i>as if nothing had happened.</i>

87
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,491
<i>I wanted to forget everything
and move on, like a coward.</i>

88
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,453
<i>But…</i>

89
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,749
<i>I couldn't do that.</i>

90
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,377
EUNDONG JUNCTION ACCIDENT

91
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,879
<i>Since I found out the truth.</i>

92
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,851
TIRE MARK ON THE VICTIM'S BODY
AND TIRE MARK OF SUSPECT'S TIRE

93
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,524
TIRE MARK ON THE VICTIM DOES NOT
MATCH THE SUSPECT'S TIRE

94
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,529
<i>The tire mark on Hyunsoo's body…</i>

95
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,239
THE TIRE MARK IS NOT A MATCH

96
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,824
<i>…didn't come from your car.</i>

97
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,288
<i>So I wondered why there was
no further investigation.</i>

98
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,795
EQUUS E330 TIRE

99
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,964
<i>The reason was simple.</i>

100
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,716
EQUUS E330 TIRE

101
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,885
<i>The culprit was running the investigation.</i>

102
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,098
There were two tire marks.

103
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,392
One came from forward movement.

104
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,604
One from backward movement.

105
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,024
Those bastards killed her.

106
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,361
She was still alive, but they killed her.

107
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,115
That doesn't give you
the right to murder for revenge.

108
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,327
Then what makes you different from them?

109
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,121
You could've let the law be the judge.
Why did you--

110
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,873
Let the law be the judge?

111
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,379
While working here at NFS,
I've followed many cases.

112
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,174
I know what evidence is crucial
and how severe the sentence will be.

113
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,885
There was no evidence.

114
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,306
I couldn't prove the tire
belonged to Pyo Myunghak.

115
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,309
Oh, Han Kyungsoo said

116
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:25,022
that I'll never be able to catch
Pyo Myunghak and Pyo Jungwook.

117
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,942
Where do you think he got that conviction?

118
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,695
The world must've taught him.

119
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,739
He must've seen it happen repeatedly.

120
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,248
- Where are you visiting?
- It's an urgent arrest. Open up.

121
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,749
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,334
Hurry and let them in.

123
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
Mr. Cha Yeonho.

124
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,097
Why did you become an officer?

125
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,057
You saw it too.

126
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,727
You saw how those bastards were living.

127
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,605
Even after committing
such a horrendous crime,

128
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,734
they keep repeating the same mistakes
without any remorse.

129
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,570
Putting those bastards in prison
won't change a thing.

130
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,823
What is the point of punishment
if the culprits aren't remorseful?

131
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,244
What is the point of punishment
if the victim can't agree to it?

132
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,790
Just because the victim can't agree
and the culprits aren't remorseful,

133
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,877
it doesn't justify what you're doing now.

134
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,963
No one has the right
to take another person's life.

135
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,056
How unfortunate.

136
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,017
I thought we understood each other.

137
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,188
I thought about that night
hundreds and thousands of times.

138
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,190
"What if I had left later?

139
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,735
What if I hadn't dropped the CD?
What if I had turned the wheel sooner?"

140
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,280
But the conclusion was always the same.

141
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,866
No matter how much I regret it,

142
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,535
I can't change what happened.

143
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,084
But it's possible to correct a wrong.

144
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,254
Pyo Myunghak and Pyo Jungwook's
impressive status doesn't matter.

145
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,007
The real culprits who killed Lee Hyunsoo…

146
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,010
I promise I'll catch them.

147
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,345
So please just trust me

148
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,057
and turn yourself in.

149
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,440
Because of me, the two of you…

150
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,194
To the two of you,

151
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,616
I don't know what I should say
to beg for forgiveness.

152
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,743
No, I don't even deserve forgiveness.

153
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,831
Though it's much too late…

154
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,085
I really wanted to tell you this.

155
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,299
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,810
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,982
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,911
I still have unfinished business.

159
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,163
I'm sorry, Mr. Cha Yeonho.

160
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,602
I spotted the car.

161
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,396
Stop!

162
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,201
- Don't just stand there! Get the car!
- Yes, sir!

163
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,497
Darn it.

164
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,256
Chairman Yang, we found the car.

165
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:05,261
Bring him to me after a good beating.

166
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,804
Make sure he's still breathing.

167
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,099
I'll carry out the last blow.

168
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,104
Jungwook.

169
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,757
<i>Commence operation.</i>

170
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,815
First, decide which way
you're going to turn. If it's the left,

171
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,317
<i>count to three in your head.</i>

172
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,823
STOP

173
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,883
Arrest them all for attempted murder
and reckless driving.

174
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,134
Yes, sir.

175
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,262
Come on.

176
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,308
All right.

177
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,982
- You okay? Were you hurt?
- I'm fine.

178
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,709
Kim Minsung, get out.

179
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,629
Min Sohee.

180
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,840
Hey, he's running away.

181
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,511
- Where's Kim Minsung?
- Kim Minsung?

182
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,847
By now, he should be
at Namgang Police Station.

183
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,936
It's from the same printer.

184
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,937
TEN HOURS AGO

185
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,274
Kim Hyunmin, the forensic analyst,
is Kim Minsung.

186
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,860
He's getting revenge for his late wife
after changing his identity.

187
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,072
He'll go after Pyo Jungwook soon.
We must catch him first.

188
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,323
Let's arrest him right away.

189
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,617
May I

190
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,870
try to persuade him?

191
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,665
I'll ask him to turn himself in.

192
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,709
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

193
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,628
I want to give him a chance.

194
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,090
I'm sure he knows exactly what he's doing.

195
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,593
Okay. Go ahead.

196
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,056
While Inspector Cha persuades Kim Minsung,
we'll surround the area and wait.

197
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,350
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

198
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,731
Because of me, the two of you…

199
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,442
To the two of you,

200
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,111
I don't know what I should say
to beg for forgiveness.

201
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,779
I don't even deserve forgiveness.

202
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,741
<i>Though it's much too late…</i>

203
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,369
<i>I really wanted to tell you this.</i>

204
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,290
I'm sorry.

205
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,835
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

206
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,131
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

207
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,886
<i>I still have unfinished business.</i>

208
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,096
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Cha Yeonho.</i>

209
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,056
Inspector Cha.

210
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,015
- Lieutenant.
- Wait.

211
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,393
You two, follow me.

212
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,561
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,611
Inspector Cha, are you okay?

214
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,613
Yes, but Kim Minsung…

215
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,074
Kim Minsung got away.

216
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,335
Kim Minsung.

217
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,630
That's enough now.

218
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,300
Mr. Kim Hyunmin…
I mean, Mr. Kim Minsung has been found.

219
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,218
Take him.

220
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,302
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,819
Captain.

222
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,947
Why does it have to be today?

223
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,157
All these years, you couldn't do anything.

224
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,077
You didn't know anything.

225
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,829
So why does it have to be today?

226
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,832
Han Kyungsoo told me everything.

227
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,169
He told me how
Pyo Jungwook killed my dear Hyunsoo.

228
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:43,922
TEN YEARS AGO

229
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,966
Jungwook, your father's car is amazing.

230
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,927
- I know, punk. He gets so many bribes.
- Pay up, you jerk.

231
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,971
Among the girls we met yesterday,

232
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,265
what about the lunatic
who is in love with you?

233
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:57,436
Get lost. You can have her, you punk.

234
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,230
- All right.
- Hey, let's take a photo.

235
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,574
What was that?

236
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,743
- Did you hit a person?
- I told you to drive carefully.

237
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,330
A person… A person…

238
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,248
Damn it.

239
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,213
Gosh.

240
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,424
Hey.

241
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,220
Hey. Hey!

242
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,391
For goodness' sake.

243
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,563
What are we going to do?

244
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,150
I told you to drive carefully, you idiot.

245
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,696
What are we going to do?

246
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,240
Hey, that person…

247
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,327
What are we going to do?

248
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,498
We need to call 911.

249
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,587
Shut up, you punk.

250
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,797
Can't you see what happened?
Have you no idea?

251
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,550
What are you doing?
Let's run before someone sees us.

252
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,179
- Come here.
- Please help me…

253
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,565
Please…

254
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,110
Please help me.

255
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,949
Jungwook, Jaeyoung.

256
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,952
She's pregnant. What do we do?

257
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,411
What are we going to do?

258
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,001
My goodness.

259
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,963
What should we do?

260
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,881
What do we do?

261
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,186
My baby…

262
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,730
Please save my baby…

263
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,407
Please.

264
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,873
Hey, Jungwook!

265
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,710
- Jungwook. Pyo Jungwook.
- Let go of me.

266
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,920
Pyo Jungwook! You crazy bastard!

267
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,381
Stop calling my name, you punk.

268
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,550
Hey, my dad is a police officer.

269
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,844
He's a high-ranking police officer!

270
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,139
It's all because of you.

271
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,435
This is all because
you called my name, you punk.

272
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,194
Hey!

273
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,155
Where are you going?

274
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,701
Jaeyoung.

275
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,455
Hey.

276
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,585
- What is he doing?
- Hey!

277
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,378
Is he driving?

278
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,673
What are you doing?
You bastard!

279
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,516
Please…

280
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,666
You crazy bastard!

281
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,459
<i>Pyo Jungwook killed her.</i>

282
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,671
He did it in cold blood
even though Hyunsoo was alive.

283
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,215
At the very least,

284
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,051
I should've killed him with my own hands.

285
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,221
Why?

286
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,057
Why are you saving someone like him?

287
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,726
He doesn't deserve to be saved.

288
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,978
We aren't doing this to save Pyo Jungwook.

289
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,649
We're here to stop you
from committing more crimes.

290
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,363
Mr. Kim Minsung.

291
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,283
You know about
my father's accident, right?

292
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,956
I want to catch Pyo Jungwook
more than anyone.

293
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,792
So please give me a chance.

294
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,714
I'll catch Pyo Jungwook by all means.

295
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,442
I was supposed to meet Pyo Jungwook.

296
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,485
Where?

297
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,408
IF YOU WANT TO MEET ME
COME TO THIS ADDRESS

298
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,118
- Wonseong-gu?
- Hold on.

299
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,538
I know this address.

300
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,082
Yang Jaeyoung attempted
to take Kim Minju there.

301
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,667
It's the company's vacation home.

302
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,918
Hold on.

303
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,879
It's a trap.

304
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,548
We could use it to catch Pyo Jungwook.

305
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,927
What is it?

306
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,184
What should we do?
It's Director General Lee Taeju.

307
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,478
Listen carefully.

308
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,522
We can't hand over Kim Minsung
if we want to catch Pyo Jungwook.

309
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,525
Pyo Jungwook will move
only if Kim Minsung shows up.

310
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,573
Your black car with tinted windows
is here, right?

311
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,162
- I'll lure them.
- Okay. Lieutenant Min, lure them.

312
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,872
The rest will cut off the retreat.

313
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,081
Yes, sir.

314
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,130
Why? Did you think
that we missed Kim Minsung?

315
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,299
Or did you want us to miss him?

316
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,261
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

317
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,263
- We have Pyo Jungwook's location.
- Okay.

318
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,265
- Did you say Pyo Jungwook?
- Pardon?

319
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,100
Hey, why would that name come up?

320
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,480
Lieutenant Min, get going.
I'll take care of this.

321
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,898
Yes, sir.

322
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,399
Hold on.

323
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,360
Take them. Come on.

324
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,320
You should stay here for a second.

325
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,781
There's still a rat to catch.

326
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,037
You must be mistaken.

327
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,333
I'm currently in charge of TCI
at Namgang Police Station.

328
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,210
You're waiting to be assigned.

329
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,882
Please do me a favor.

330
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,677
Why don't you mind your own business?

331
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,973
Don't meddle and risk losing your team.

332
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,854
Damn it. Hey.

333
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,529
I didn't know you had that side.

334
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,906
I guess I forgot to tell you.

335
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,284
I used to be in the Major Crimes Division.

336
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,620
I'm worried for you.

337
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,082
- You'll lose your pension at this rate.
- It's okay.

338
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,418
I'm not the one
who needs to worry about that.

339
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,962
It's you and Pyo Myunghak.

340
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,072
Do you remember what you learned?
The shoulder throw?

341
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,951
Forget it. Throwing big men
will give you a herniated disc.

342
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,329
Just beat them
with the police baton, okay?

343
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,831
No, I'll give it a try.

344
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,419
I'm more worried about Detective Woo.

345
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,004
He should live up to his size.

346
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,089
Do you know why I don't use my fists?

347
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,800
It's because people will die
if I use my fists.

348
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,012
Whatever.
It's dangerous, so stay in the back.

349
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,057
Let's wrap things up and eat out.

350
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,725
All right. What will we eat?

351
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,685
- How about spicy pork?
- Spicy pork again?

352
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,605
Seriously?
Inspector Cha, don't be like that.

353
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,952
What's going on?
Why haven't we heard from them?

354
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,245
Here.

355
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,332
What happened?

356
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,961
<i>Chairman Yang Seokchan.</i>

357
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,380
I'm Lieutenant Min Sohee
of Namgang Police Station.

358
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,256
Please open the door.

359
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,220
Damn it!

360
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,307
- Hey, break it open.
- Okay.

361
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,481
Hey, Jungwook.

362
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,567
Go out from the back door.
I'll take care of this.

363
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,362
Let's go.

364
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,245
Gosh, there's a lot.

365
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,163
Raise your hand if you're in a tracksuit.

366
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,127
Who's wearing a tracksuit? Okay.

367
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,670
Take care of the tracksuits.

368
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,547
Hands down. Suits, raise your hand.

369
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,090
Who's wearing a suit?

370
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,970
Okay. Inspector Cha, they're ours.

371
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,722
- Okay.
- Put them down.

372
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,182
Tracksuits, that way. Suits, this way.

373
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,226
- This way?
- Yes.

374
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,186
All right.

375
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,523
Thank you.

376
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,777
You punks, get it together. Okay?

377
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,325
Have you punks lost your minds?

378
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,203
How dare you come here
with just three people?

379
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,830
Chairman, there are four.

380
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,833
Isn't he one of us?

381
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,170
- He's one of us!
- Excuse me? I'm a police officer!

382
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,630
Hey, a police officer shouldn't look

383
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,007
like that.

384
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,510
I look cuter than you.
You look like my toe.

385
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,636
That's too far.

386
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,139
Guys.

387
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,349
Go get them.

388
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,852
All right.

389
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,676
Hey! You bastard!

390
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,148
Mr. Toe.

391
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,234
You're here.

392
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,906
For goodness' sake. Hey.

393
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,534
Hey, bring it on.

394
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,869
Come on.

395
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,464
I'm exhausted.

396
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,716
Lieutenant, leave them to us.

397
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,552
- Catch Pyo Jungwook.
- Okay.

398
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,053
Go that way. I'll go this way.

399
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,514
Gosh.

400
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,118
Damn it.

401
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,042
Mr. Pyo Jungwook. Let's go now.

402
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,503
Get in while I'm asking nicely.

403
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,382
How entertaining.

404
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,806
You guys are trying so hard.

405
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,809
Come here.

406
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,358
- All right.
- Hey.

407
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,207
What do you think you're doing?

408
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,792
Why do you punks keep bothering--

409
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,253
What's this? Hey, what the hell?

410
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,130
Let go of me, you bastard!

411
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,925
- Let go of me.
- Hey!

412
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,062
- Let go!
- Mr. Yang Seokchan.

413
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,732
You're under arrest for conspiracy
and aiding and abetting murder.

414
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,652
It wasn't me! Let go of me!

415
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,501
- Assisting in murder?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

416
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,544
Where are they now?

417
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,546
<i>They were moved to Namgang Police Station.</i>

418
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,966
I told them to keep things down!

419
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,010
Okay.

420
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,312
<i>At Seoul Namgang Police Station,</i>

421
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,398
<i>Chairman Yang Seokchan
of YSC Constructions</i>

422
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,692
<i>and Pyo Jungwook,
Commissioner General Pyo's son,</i>

423
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,444
<i>are confined for conspiracy
and attempted murder.</i>

424
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,947
Namgang Police Station is

425
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,450
the talk of the town these days.

426
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,578
I've hated getting attention
ever since I was in middle school.

427
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,457
My favorite phrase is "safe and sound."

428
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,626
That was why I became a civil servant.

429
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:20,131
Commissioner General Pyo's son,
a gangster-turned-chairman--

430
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,050
And who was the other one?
The man named Kim something.

431
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,178
The murder suspect who's an analyst
at National Forensic Service.

432
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,977
Are you sure
this is something we can handle?

433
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,353
Why can't we handle it?

434
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,273
If it's too much,
Criminal Division can take over.

435
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,859
Hold on.
That isn't what's important.

436
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:44,030
We should consider the severity
of the situation and choose our direction.

437
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:48,034
It sounds like you want us to come up
with a frame before the investigation.

438
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,369
Why would you twist my words?

439
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,788
Your words were loaded.

440
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,124
- My words weren't loaded.
- Listen--

441
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,292
Quiet!

442
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,465
Don't you understand
the current situation?

443
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,342
Let's put aside the other matters.

444
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,762
What should we do about Pyo Jungwook,
Commissioner General's son?

445
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,848
When he was brought in
for Lieutenant Min's father's case,

446
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,809
we used all our might.

447
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:18,314
What happened as a result?
Captain Jung got a disciplinary action.

448
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,775
What makes you think
it won't happen again?

449
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,568
Then we'll arrest him again,

450
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,737
no matter what it takes.

451
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,701
Pyo Jungwook is the driver
who caused my father's accident.

452
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,079
He's the murderer
who ran over Lee Hyunsoo.

453
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,290
He has conspired and attempted
the murder of Kim Minsung.

454
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,417
We have enough evidence.

455
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,921
So why couldn't we put him behind bars?

456
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,508
There's only one reason.

457
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,385
Because we feigned ignorance.

458
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,053
We turned a blind eye.

459
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,931
It resulted in a second criminal,
like Kim Minsung.

460
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,476
Perhaps he may get away again,
just like last time.

461
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,313
Then we should arrest him again and again

462
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,149
until the end.

463
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,985
You can't enter.

464
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,363
What do you mean
Kim Minsung is off-limits?

465
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,781
Excuse me.

466
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:12,159
No one can visit him
without Director General Lee's permission.

467
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,078
We're the ones who arrested him.

468
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,289
Director General Lee is in charge, okay?

469
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,085
Go back.

470
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,721
Mr. Kim Hyunmin.

471
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,725
Do you admit to Yang Jaeyoung's murder?

472
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,937
What did you do to Mr. Han Kyungsoo?

473
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,649
You tried to murder
Pyo Jungwook too, right?

474
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,577
What was the reason?

475
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,747
Because you lot couldn't do it.

476
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,751
Because you lot
couldn't punish those bastards.

477
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,919
That's why…

478
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,756
That's why my wife

479
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,384
was murdered by those bastards.

480
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,395
Why do you think
the victims killed your wife?

481
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,443
Han Kyungsoo has testified.

482
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:38,162
<i>I told him not to do it.</i>

483
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,247
Is this what you're talking about?

484
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,124
<i>…that we shouldn't leave her be.</i>

485
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,585
<i>But he said she saw his face.</i>

486
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,129
<i>He said we must kill her.</i>

487
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,475
This footage was
from the dashcam of your car.

488
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:04,355
Didn't you get this testimony
through torture?

489
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,658
<i>A coerced confession.</i>

490
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:20,287
As for the video of Han Kyungsoo,
the evidence is inadmissible.

491
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,625
A confession that's obtained
through torture, violence, or threat

492
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,460
is inadmissible due to coercion.

493
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,762
How about attempted murder?

494
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,850
Wasn't it the work
of Chairman Yang's subordinates?

495
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,396
Kim Minsung was the one
who asked to meet first.

496
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,648
Once he heard
that Kim Minsung wanted to meet,

497
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,943
Chairman Yang lost his mind
and took an unpremeditated action.

498
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:56,407
Painting this as attempted murder
would be nonsense.

499
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,704
Right?

500
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,209
- Lawyer Sung, you're good.
- Please raise my salary.

501
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,795
Of course.

502
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,425
We're painting the attempted murder
of Kim Minsung

503
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,635
as Chairman Yang's unpredicted action.

504
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,598
Since Han Kyungsoo's testimony
came under duress,

505
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,558
it isn't admissible evidence.

506
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,394
Unless Han Kyungsoo is still alive.

507
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,314
I feel bad for Chairman Yang,

508
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,691
but I'll use this chance to cut all ties

509
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,193
before the public say
I'm connected to a gang.

510
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:37,114
I'll give the reporters some breadcrumbs
regarding Chairman Yang's corruption.

511
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,534
Okay. You're in charge of the rabbit hunt.

512
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,745
How's Jungwook doing?

513
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,831
He met Lawyer Sung
and came up with a defense strategy.

514
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,708
He's eating well too.

515
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,379
Keep an eye on Kim Minsung.
Make sure he doesn't run his mouth.

516
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,506
Don't worry, sir.

517
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,842
My men are watching him 24 hours a day.

518
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,265
Taeju.

519
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,893
You're nearly there.

520
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,395
Don't let your guard down.

521
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,272
Yes, sir.

522
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,867
By the way,

523
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,703
where could he be?

524
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,249
Han Kyungsoo.

525
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,680
Captain,

526
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,933
at least pretend to fill out the report.

527
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,685
It's just a formality.

528
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,229
Chaeman.

529
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,606
Okay?

530
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,774
Hello.

531
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,944
- Hello.
- Min Sohee, why are you here?

532
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,030
- Did you get disciplinary action too?
- No.

533
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,949
I need to see Captain for a second.

534
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,537
Captain, let's have a cup of tea.

535
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,288
Put that down.

536
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,208
Goodbye.

537
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,960
Have a nice day. Thank you.

538
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,423
All right.

539
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,007
Here.

540
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,095
I'm happy to see everyone here.

541
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,222
You should be annoyed, not happy.

542
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:29,476
We had to visit the police administration
in order to meet Captain.

543
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,186
Where's Kim Minsung?

544
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,648
He's in the holding cell.
Lee Taeju won't let us approach him.

545
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,193
It's obvious he'll quickly get a warrant
and wrap up the case.

546
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,904
That's Director General Lee's specialty.

547
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,742
And the analysis
of the tire mark on Lee Hyunsoo's body?

548
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,953
It wasn't in Kim Minsung's house or car.

549
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,789
I checked with National Forensic Service,

550
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,585
but materials from 2014 were discarded
at the beginning of the year.

551
00:45:56,503 --> 00:46:00,132
If Han Kyungsoo is alive,
we might be able to find a way.

552
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,553
There's something on my mind.

553
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,433
At Kim Minsung's house, there were photos
of those who were involved.

554
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,148
<i>Han Kyungsoo's photo wasn't marked.</i>

555
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,614
Kim Minsung has another hideout.

556
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,617
What about the dashcam on his car?

557
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,369
Director General Lee's team
took all the materials.

558
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,557
Cheongmyeong 405.

559
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,227
Mr. Pyo Jungwook.

560
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,813
Do you admit to aiding and abetting

561
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,982
Mr. Kim Minsung's murder
and the murder of Lee Hyunsoo?

562
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,984
I have nothing to say without my lawyer.

563
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,073
Mr. Han Kyungsoo revealed it all.

564
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,576
What you did that night.

565
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,039
He revealed how you murdered Lee Hyunsoo.

566
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,795
Is that so? Han Kyungsoo?

567
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,257
He was tortured.

568
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,551
What was it? A coerced confession?

569
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,388
A confession that's obtained under duress
is inadmissible due to coercion.

570
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,473
You're a police officer, so you must know.

571
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,040
Come on in.

572
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,261
Let's resume after your lawyer gets here.

573
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,434
You messed with the wrong person.

574
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,352
Mr. Cha Yeonho.

575
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,271
The world is

576
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,940
quite unfair.

577
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,860
But that's just how it is.

578
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,572
The world.

579
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,585
How long will you stall?

580
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,212
It's a human rights violation.

581
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,256
You'd better be prepared
if you can't get a warrant in 48 hours.

582
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,549
Uncuff him.

583
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,154
What are you doing here?

584
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:03,000
THREE HOURS AGO

585
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,003
<i>What about the dashcam on his car?</i>

586
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,006
Director General Lee's team
took all the materials.

587
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,008
Not all of them.

588
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,681
The footage from his dashcam.
I backed it up just in case.

589
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,851
- Seriously?
- Well done!

590
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,286
Han Kyungsoo.

591
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,456
Are you okay? Han Kyungsoo.

592
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,168
Are you okay?

593
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,926
Can you walk?

594
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,612
Hey, Jungwook.

595
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,365
Let's stop now.

596
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,036
Stop what? What did we do?

597
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,458
- You killed that woman.
- Shut up, you fool!

598
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,709
Sit down, Pyo Jungwook.

599
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,630
Please calm down.

600
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,341
Pyo Jungwook.

601
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,011
This is just the beginning.

602
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,638
From now on,

603
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,141
I'll make you pay for all your sins.

604
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,605
Hey. Say something.

605
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,198
Why--

606
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,742
Why are you all out to get me?

607
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,869
- Why?
- Take him outside.

608
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,705
- Come here.
- Damn it.

609
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,415
- Let go of me!
- Come here.

610
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,127
Let go!

611
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,088
Damn it!

612
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,382
It's insufferable!

613
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,853
Why do you think
Mr. Kim Minsung kept you alive?

614
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,440
Although it's late,

615
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,610
you should testify truthfully in court.

616
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,115
That's the only way
to atone for what you did

617
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,033
to Kim Minsung and the late Lee Hyunsoo.

618
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,922
I'm sorry.

619
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,680
I'm so sorry.

620
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,142
I…

621
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,770
I'm sorry.

622
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,448
I'm sorry.

623
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,411
<i>Pyo Jungwook, the son
of Commissioner General Pyo Myunghak,</i>

624
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:30,373
<i>was confined for a murder charge
at Seoul Namdong Detention Center.</i>

625
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,918
<i>Along with Yang Seokchan,
Chairman of YSC Constructions,</i>

626
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,713
<i>Mr. Pyo was under investigation
for conspiracy and attempted murder.</i>

627
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,508
<i>He was also charged for the accident
at Eundong Junction ten years ago</i>

628

<i>and murdering the victim, Ms. Lee,
by running her over.</i>

629

00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,895
<i>was the chief of Eunseong Police Station
at the time of the accident--</i>

631
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,716
THE PYO FATHER AND SON'S
DIRTY TRUTH

632
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,344
TEN YEARS AGO, PYO MYUNGHAK

633
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,471
CHIEF OF EUNSEONG POLICE STATION
RECEIVED A CALL

634
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,181
<i>Father, I'm in trouble.</i>

635
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,725
<i>Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.</i>

636
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:34,104
<i>Commissioner General Pyo put the blame
on Mr. Cha, a college student,</i>

637
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,731
<i>and turned his son, Pyo Jungwook,
into a witness.</i>

638
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,484
<i>Pyo Jungwook currently
uses drugs and drives aggressively</i>

639
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,861
<i>and leads the life of a true gangster.</i>

640
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,238
<i>I'm a gangster.</i>

641
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,991
Gosh, Koreans are quite talented.

642
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,701
How are they so creative?

643
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,370
That's right. This is the power
of Korean content.

644
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,455
Who uploaded this video?

645
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,457
It's someone you know.

646
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,965
Someone I know?

647
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,676
He's coming out.

648
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,222
Over here.

649
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,268
Do you have anything to say?

650
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,568
I didn't think you'd actually
catch him. You are all incredible.

651
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,862
- It's thanks to you, Reporter Ha.
- No way.

652
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,530
The timing was perfect, right?

653
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,865
Yes.

654
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,410
What? Were you the one
who uploaded that video?

655
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,371
Well, he asked me to do it.

656
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,249
You guys did it without my knowledge.

657
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,252
You could get into trouble
if it becomes known.

658
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,714
I wouldn't have uploaded it
if I were afraid of trouble.

659
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,382
Just you wait.

660
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,176
I'm preparing a second video.

661
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,253
Father, when can I leave?

662
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,631
This place is cold and suffocating.

663
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,884
You can't leave for a while.

664
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:30,970
What?

665
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,644
I have a press conference today.

666
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,856
Including the past accident,
I know nothing of your wrongdoings.

667
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,528
They were the actions of my immature son
when he was mentally unstable.

668
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,697
I'm the unrighteous father
who failed to educate his son.

669
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:53,868
What?

670
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,372
I knew that you were unrighteous.

671
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,209
Are you cutting ties with your son too?

672
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,379
What would you do
if I tried to bring you down?

673
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,009
If you want a reduced sentence,

674
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,013
you need me in my position on the outside.

675
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:21,813
So please just keep your mouth shut.

676
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,275
"It's all my fault.
My father is unrelated."

677
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,860
Repeat those words like a parrot.

678
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,070
Understood?

679
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,836
My goodness, you're something else.

680
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,547
I still have so much to learn from you.

681
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,931
COMMISSIONER GENERAL
PYO MYUNGHAK

682
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,941
Please give me more radish kimchi.

683
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,485
Okay. Radish kimchi.

684
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,469
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

685
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,269
A word, please.

686
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,111
Please say a few words.

687
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,618
Go home.

688
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,798
So please just keep your mouth shut.

689
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,717
"It's all my fault.
My father is unrelated."

690
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,344
Repeat those words like a parrot.

691
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,263
Understood?

692
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,683
Cha Yeonho.

693
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,813
Cha Yeonho! Hey, Cha Yeonho!

694
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,398
Bring Cha Yeonho here!

695
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,692
I have something to say! Bring Cha Yeonho!

696
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,610
Be quiet.

697
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,841
Where are you going?

698
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,260
Why are you…

699
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,061
You are…

700
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,106
Pyo Myunghak.

701
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,525
If you try anything funny,

702
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,028
you'll end up
at the bottom of a river with me.

703
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,002
CRASH

704
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,365
<i>Commissioner General Pyo was kidnapped.</i>

705
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,825
- Stop the car!
- Jungwook's father made me do it.

706
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,244
- We need direct evidence.
- There might be an evidence.

707
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,330
Sir, let's get a jump on them.

708
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,539
Get out!

709
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,875
Nothing is over yet.

710
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,251
I'd like to call

711
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,003
Commissioner General Pyo Myunghak
as a witness.

712
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,005
I had some business
at the inspection office.

713
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,132
- The unlicensed taxi case.
- Give it a go.

714
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,511
As he was underage
at the time of the crime…

715
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,595
<i>I give my verdict.</i>

716
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,848
<i>Pyo Myunghak will use</i>
<i>any means to evade responsibility.</i>

717
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,517
<i>I won't let that happen.</i>

718
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:30,689
