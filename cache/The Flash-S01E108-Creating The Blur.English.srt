1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,508
Go.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,057
ARMEN: It's a special breed
that I think could work...

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:20,561
...on a show at the scale
in television. It's not easy.

4
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:25,774
We can have 150 to 200 visual-effects
shots in an episode.

5
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:29,611
And so suddenly that's spread out
over six episodes...

6
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:32,614
...it truly is as many visual-effects shots
as would be in...

7
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:36,243
...a summer blockbuster, the biggest one.

8
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,079
KREISBERG: At any given moment,
there's a superhero movie on TV.

9
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:42,916
I mean, there's a channel right now that is
showing something with a superhero on it.

10
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,128
And these are movies that have cost
hundreds of millions of dollars to make.

11
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:49,798
If you don't put on something
that's gonna compete with that...

12
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:52,842
...or certainly stand alongside of it,
people are gonna check out.

13
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,969
That's why it was important
from the beginning...

14
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:57,304
...to be able to make sure
that we were able to...

15
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,432
...pull off the level of visual effects
that we were.

16
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:12,736
ARMEN: When we hire people,
we let them know that it's a TV schedule.

17
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:16,699
There's some amazing feature guys out there,
but the pace that they're used to...

18
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:21,078 X1:0
...is a little bit of a different pace
than what our TV guys are used to...

19
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:22,788 X1:0
...but the quality has to be similar.

20
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,790
BREDERECK: We learned a lot
from feature films...

21
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:26,792
...and we use a lot
of feature-film technology.

22
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,130
But we kind of have to find, then,
always like the most efficient solution...

23
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,506
...to then make the deadline
and, you know, like...

24
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,509
...have those shows on air, on time.

25
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:40,637 X1:0
Everybody is excited about that show
and wants it to look as good as possible.

26
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:43,307 X1:0
And it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

27
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:46,018 X1:0
And we have a lot of people
that have that spirit...

28
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:50,272
...and just push every day to,
you know, like, create the impossible.

29
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,190
KREISBERG:
A lot of it is the technology...

30
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:55,569
...but a lot of it is also just
the will, and the desire, and the creativity.

31
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:58,405
You know, I mean, our show
obviously costs a lot of money to make...

32
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:00,741 X1:0
...but there are other shows
that cost a lot more money.

33
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:05,746 X1:0
And I think it really is a question of
the desire to sort of make these things work.

34
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:08,248
ARMEN: I try to do something
that hasn't been done before.

35
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,334
And it's just going up to my guys
and saying:

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,961
"I know this is hard.
I know we don't do this regularly.

37
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:16,840
But this is what we're gonna need."
And just moving forward with them.

38
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,226
We have a really good reference,
the comic book.

39
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:33,815 X1:0
Obviously a lot of things don't translate over
from the comic book over to live-action...

40
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:36,359 X1:0
...but we've been able to
do it as closely as possible.

41
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:40,321
BREDERECK: There's, like, a huge phase
of research and development...

42
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:43,699
...where we kind of, like, come up
with looks and solutions...

43
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:48,496
...um, to just come up with
all those crazy effects required to...

44
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:53,000 X1:0
...you know, bring those comic book
events to real television.

45
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:58,506 X1:0
And it's also, um, very important
to do, like, a lot of pre-visualization...

46
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:02,176 X1:0
...to show the show creators very early on
what we're planning to do...

47
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:06,389
...and what will be CG, what will be
practical, and all that kind of stuff.

48
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:09,225
It really is a combination of things...

49
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,852
...that usually take people
sometimes a year to work on.

50
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,813
And we're doing it in a few months.

51
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,523
It's definitely a lot of planning...

52
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,482
...and a lot of putting heads together...

53
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:20,276
...and coming up with
the best and fastest solution.

54
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:26,074 X1:0
We'd heard horror stories
about the '90s <i>Flash</i> series.

55
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:29,618
That they'd been taken off
and put back on several times...

56
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:33,162
...in part because they couldn't make their
air dates with the visual effects.

57
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,498 X1:0
So the second we had a story idea
and what a character could be...

58
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:38,834 X1:0
...we would get that
to our Visual Effects Department...

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,044 X1:0
...months before
they would typically get a script...

60
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:44,297 X1:0
...so that they could start the R & D
on those characters...

61
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:45,966
...so we could be ahead of the curve.

62
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,801
What the hell?

63
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:51,054
We always do get a good heads-up
from our producers of:

64
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,806
"This is coming up.
This is a very important episode."

65
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:57,309
Early after the pilot, Greg called me and said
there was gonna be a train crash...

66
00:03:57,476 --> 00:04:00,146
...where Flash goes in
and saves a bunch of people.

67
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:12,199
I mean, if I knew that two weeks before
I was gonna work on it...

68
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:14,618
...I would never make the air date.

69
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:17,872
But again it's knowing in advance
and putting a special team on that...

70
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:20,332
...saying, "This is what we have to do."

71
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:23,711
And we started propping early as far as,
like, building the asset of the train...

72
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,838
...and thinking about
the kind of shots we wanted.

73
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,007
Got in touch with a local
storyboard artist here...

74
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:30,134
...and kind of worked out
what the shots would be.

75
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,553
And after everybody approved it,
what we did, you know...

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,097
...which is what you see behind me,
is the animatic...

77
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,516
...to show the moving version of the beats...

78
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:41,270
...that we thought would tell
the story that they wanted to be told.

79
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:46,233
The animatic is basically an extension
of the storyboards. It's a moving storyboard.

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,904 X1:0
And after the storyboards are complete,
once you have the animatic...

81
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,239 X1:0
...you kind of know
what the blocking of the scene is...

82
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:55,493 X1:0
...and you know exactly what it should
look like when it's complete.

83
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,703 X1:0
Obviously the elements are really raw...

84
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,373 X1:0
...and it's all gray-shaded, and it's--
Nothing looks believable.

85
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,292 X1:0
But the animatic, it plays a big role...

86
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,836 X1:0
...in the planning of the shots
and planning of the scenes.

87
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:08,798
You know, it was just basically
Snart's on the train.

88
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:12,176
Uh, he causes the train to freeze
on the bottom.

89
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:14,928
So we kind of embellished it,
added some cool shots...

90
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,806
...you know, extended
the whole train crash...

91
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:26,397
After the animatic stage, uh,
you know, we sent that to Production...

92
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,900
...so the DP, director, everybody
could take a look at it...

93
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:31,611
...so they knew
the kind of plates that we needed.

94
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,909
TARANYAN:
Sometimes you'll cut to shots where...

95
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:41,954
...you're having to put them
into a live-action plate.

96
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,749
So was our job to kind of
be able to match the look...

97
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:50,462
...to the surrounding shots that were shot
with an actual camera on a location.

98
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:53,131
A good plate is a very good starting point.

99
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:56,927
You know, so it's amazing
to have plates like we have.

100
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:59,513
So they did a really good job
shooting those plates.

101
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:05,017
ARMEN: We work very closely
with our directors of photography...

102
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:07,854
...as far as, uh, sequences.

103
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:11,107
They come up with suggestions, too,
to make--

104
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:13,234
You know, again,
to add more dynamic to the shots.

105
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:15,945
And, you know, ask us,
you know, respectfully, like:

106
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,447
"Is this possible to do? It might be hard."

107
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:21,450
And again, we're all for,
"If it makes the shot great, let's do it."

108
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:24,996
You know, there's very few instances
that we've said no to them.

109
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:27,206
MAN: Cut.
ARMEN: We do work very closely with them.

110
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,917
You know, I do have a data wrangler
in Vancouver...

111
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:33,421
...who's able to get
all the lens data, measurements...

112
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:37,549
...we do HDR photography
for light and reflections.

113
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:42,804
I mean, we have a pretty tight department
to be able to get everything we need...

114
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:45,180
...so we could,
you know, finish the shots here.

115
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:48,726
TARANYAN: We do have visual-effects
supervisor that's there to actually tell them...

116
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:51,520
...if something is working
versus something that's not.

117
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:55,774
And, uh, that's kind of like the bridge
that we have...

118
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:59,612
...with, uh, the Camera Department,
is through the visual effects supervisor.

119
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:02,573
Three, two, one, go.

120
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,829
MAN:
Action.

121
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,247
[GRUNTS]

122
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,926
ARMEN:
This was an actual plate...

123
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:27,679
...that we shot pulling back
with a stunt girl kind of hanging.

124
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:30,015
And it was all-digital Flash going through...

125
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,476
...and saving her.

126
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:35,771
So she was kind of--
I mean, we shot her in slow motion...

127
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,230
...but she was kind of on a rig.

128
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,982
So it looked like she was suspended
in time.

129
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:44,028
And we had the Hair Department
actually hairspray her hair...

130
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,697
...so it felt like it was
kind of floating in the air.

131
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:50,660
And it was, yeah, a stunt girl that was
kind of just hanging there the whole time.

132
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:54,455
She was harnessed. There was, I believe,
a rig underneath her and also on top...

133
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:57,166
...just to kind of put her in the position
that she's in mid-air.

134
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,833
And then, you know, we paint that out.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,920
And he was completely digital in this shot.

136
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,966
The digital version of the Flash is...

137
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:11,011
...pretty much outfit with any kind of joints
or bones you find in a real human being.

138
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:16,683
Basically it's a model of the actor
with all of his features...

139
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,936
...like the skin, the pores of the skin...

140
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:22,981
...or the gold of his costume,
the leather of his costume...

141
00:08:23,147 --> 00:08:25,191
...all that re-created in the computer.

142
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:28,945
And it's basically enabling us
to, um, let him do things...

143
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:32,156
...that he could never do as an actor,
or even as a stunt guy.

144
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,951
Like for example, running up a building...

145
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:38,079
...or beating somebody up really quickly...

146
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,081
...all those things are possible...

147
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:44,460
...because we have
a computer-animated version of him.

148
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:47,963
Instead of just using
photographs, um, of the actor...

149
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,549
...we are going through
a complex scanning process...

150
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:56,054
...where we basically get not just
a two-dimensional image of the actor...

151
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,682
...but actually a three-dimensional
scan of the actor.

152
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:02,018
So-- And it's so detailed that
we get skin pores...

153
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:03,852
...we get little hairs and other things...

154
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,563
...we get, like, all the costume details
and all that.

155
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,862
All that process gives us tons of data.

156
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,574
We get, like, a 3D scalp
that is basically our base...

157
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,617
...for creating the digital double.

158
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:22,369
It's a multiple-step process,
you know, like, we have to go from--

159
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,455
Light stage, you know,
they do all the scanning...

160
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,415
...and then it goes through
a rigging process.

161
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:29,626
When we get a scan,
we get a full body, okay?

162
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:32,337
So we get a full body and there's--

163
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:35,174
Like, basically the same bones
that we have in our body...

164
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,343
...are put into that digital double.

165
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,973
And, uh, that's called the rigging process.
When it goes through the rigging process...

166
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,892
...then the rig is given to the animators...

167
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,729
...and the animators would then take it
and put it into a scene.

168
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,857
You put the CG model in there
and you basically animate him...

169
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,109
...to do whatever it is
he needs to do in the shot.

170
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,320
There was no motion-capture used on this.

171
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:59,323
Uh, everything is hand-animated.

172
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,951
After that, uh, it gets sent
to Lighting and Rendering.

173
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:06,287
They put that light in there, they give it
the highlight, they give the sheen.

174
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,999
If the lip is wet, they'll put a little bit
of a wet area right there.

175
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,793
And we did that for that shot, actually.

176
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,712
So those are things,
like, elements that are necessary...

177
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,506
...in order to make something believable.

178
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,425
Every muscle in his body
can be basically, like, flexed...

179
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:21,761
...or, like, moved in certain ways.

180
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:24,597
We can give him facial expressions.

181
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:28,101
You know, you see if he is, like--
I don't know, if he has fear...

182
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:30,436
...if he is, like, kind of like stressed...

183
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,814
...or if he's happy,
when he's running really fast.

184
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:37,193
We have all those controls built in there
on top of that...

185
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,113
...and then we have, like, layers and layers
of great textures and materials...

186
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,658
...that are basically based on
the real-world materials...

187
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:47,786
...to match him as good as possible.

188
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:52,707
And, um, in some shots, we're using
the fully, like, digitally created Barry...

189
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:55,502
...and people will probably not notice that.

190
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:59,381
For example when he grabs,
like, a missile...

191
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:03,093
...and swings it back to the drone
that was firing, and that kind of stuff.

192
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:11,101
You can get a photo of Grant, and you can
put the digital one right next to each other...

193
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:15,272
...and they're pretty much almost identical.

194
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:19,109
It's really fun to see those effects then,
like, coming together.

195
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,697
To understand Flash's world,
we have to basically live in his time...

196
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:28,659
...and that's why the rest of the world
has to slow down really dramatically.

197
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:31,662
And usually, like, we're getting footage...

198
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,206
...that got shot in
120 frames per second, or even more.

199
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:39,544
We had to come up with custom solutions
for more and more slow-motion shots.

200
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:42,380
When he moves really slowly
and you wanna see the lightning develop.

201
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,884
And then so we had to make it
a little bit more detailed.

202
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:50,638
[GRUNTING]

203
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,185
So this is our digital city.

204
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,062
And then this kind of shows you
the different layers that make it up.

205
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:02,691
And the reason we chose to do
a digital city with him is because...

206
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:05,861
...if you get any kind of real footage
and speed it up...

207
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:10,073
...everything in the footage speeds up,
so the cars, the people would speed up.

208
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,908
But this way we would have
total control...

209
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,744
...where the camera
is just the only thing that's sped up.

210
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:19,207
And everything would remain at the speed
that it's gonna be, you know, at.

211
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,792
And that was the only way
to kind of sell Flash...

212
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,212
...running fast through the city.

213
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,714
It also gave us an opportunity
to create shots...

214
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:31,344
...where we had total control over
the camera to follow him through the city.

215
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,805
BREDERECK: And we put
the digital version of Flash in there...

216
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:39,185
...and the animators put, like, a lot
of detail in whatever he's doing...

217
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:45,733
...also adding all the debris and the particles
that fly around, that kind of stuff.

218
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,614 X1:0
ARMEN: There's the effects dust
and everything we added.

219
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:54,825
Sparks, debris, lens flares.
We love our lens flares here.

220
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:59,372
We have effects guys who actually then
deform the train parts that it's gonna crash...

221
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:02,792
...and, you know, give the little cracks
and, you know, whatever else is necessary.

222
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,336
Then our Lighting and Rendering team
gives us our beauty pass...

223
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:10,382
...which is pretty much just a raw render
of the 3D elements.

224
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:13,468
And then we have the reflection pass
and the specular pass...

225
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:16,804
...which is a separate pass
that then our compers could dial in...

226
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:19,764
...to see how much reflection
and spec that you wanna see.

227
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:24,852
The effects and dirt is generated and
simmed based on the train's movement.

228
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:29,274
So there's holdouts of the train, so the dust
could actually go around the train...

229
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,567
...not just the layer that's put over it.

230
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:35,071
And then, you know, we added sparks
and other, you know, bits and debris...

231
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:38,615
...you know, just to add to the chaos
of the shot, basically.

232
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:42,452
There's sparks, there's, uh, dust,
there's debris.

233
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:46,123
There's a lot of elements
that we have to throw together...

234
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,793
...to be able to make a shot that's believable.

235
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,297
As much as elements that you get from 3D,
there's still things that you need to do...

236
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:56,341
in order to get it to look, uh, real.

237
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:06,351
I'm not going out without a fight.

238
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,022
Good.

239
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:11,523
Because you just found one.

240
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,651
TARANYAN: This scene, episode six,
was something where Flash runs in...

241
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:18,237
...and he blows the doors off its hinges...

242
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,824
...and he just flies in
and he tries to punch out Girder.

243
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,167
So as far as-- From the start, you know,
all we got was just an empty plate.

244
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:35,379
Basically, what was given to us,
it was just a shot of an open room.

245
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:38,632
What we're able to do is
we track the shot, we got a camera...

246
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,136
...and the animators went through
and they animated Flash...

247
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,013
...the way he was supposed to be animated.

248
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,932
Then they went through
the lighting process and it came to me.

249
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,684
We had to paint out a flag
that was in there. The American flag...

250
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:54,189
...that's right behind him,
we had to actually paint the flag out...

251
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:57,359
...in order to be able
to replace it with a CG flag...

252
00:14:57,525 --> 00:15:02,238
...because as Flash is flying by,
his force is making the flag move.

253
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:07,410
He's flying over the trophy showcase
that is made of all glass...

254
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:12,207
...so we have to be able to put reflections
of him and his lightning...

255
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:15,460
...we have to composite all that together.

256
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:20,340
Supersonic punch, baby! Whoo!

257
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:21,925
[GRUNTS]

258
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:26,304
The Flash is a character who is
in essence, in some ways, a visual effect.

259
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:31,226 X1:0
And so those have to be rendered as well,
and as cleanly, and as smartly, and as real...

260
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:34,396 X1:0
...to take people away, or else
all the work we're doing on the story...

261
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:36,898
...you know, or all the work they're doing
in the acting...

262
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:39,401
-...isn't gonna make a difference.
-What's happening to me?

263
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,486
The Flash look starting from the pilot...

264
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,656
...up until, like, the very end of the season
has evolved.

265
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,408
Now run, Barry, run.

266
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:52,246 X1:0
TARANYAN: The same way his speed has
evolved from starting in the pilot...

267
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:55,290 X1:0
...as he's learning to use his superpower...

268
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:58,502 X1:0
...you know, the same way we were learning
how to get him to run faster...

269
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,045 X1:0
...and push it more.

270
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:03,132
The look has developed,
the lightning has developed...

271
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:05,634
...you know, the streak,
the whole blur aspect of Flash...

272
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:08,594
...has evolved along the season.

273
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,601
ARMEN:
The blur is done in, you know, two ways.

274
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,145
You know, for the really, really wide shots...

275
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,187
...or shots that you really wanna
get a sense...

276
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:23,815
of him coming towards camera,
going away from camera.

277
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,110
Again, his digital double is animated.

278
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,903
You don't see him as much
because he is a blur...

279
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,282
...but it's still animated to generate
the lightning that comes from him.

280
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,326
There's different layers that we add on
to give him the signature look...

281
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,412
...that we're gonna give him.

282
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,623
The flares that we put on from the lightning,
generated from the lightning...

283
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,002
...those, I hope, kind of sell it again,
and give the shot depth.

284
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:49,339
ARMEN: Then you have the really, really
wide shots, which were actually Greg's idea.

285
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:52,384
We had never, you know,
discussed that during the pilot.

286
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,343
Where you're just a wide on a city...

287
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,597
...and you just see this lightning bolt
kind of going through the city.

288
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:00,808
And he thought that was really
a fun way to bridge shots.

289
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,935
And it's in every episode now.

290
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:05,937
And it works really well.

291
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:09,733
A lot of the blur is the lightning.

292
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:13,778
To the naked eye, you don't necessarily
see the blur part of the elements...

293
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,364
...but what you are seeing
is a lot of the lightning elements.

294
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:19,075
And what the lightning does
to the environment around it.

295
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:21,953
You know, it's passing cars,
it's passing people.

296
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,540
You know, a lot of times, the stuff
that they shoot practically.

297
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:29,544
You know, wind getting blown
when Flash comes into a scene.

298
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,963
Those are all things that help sell the look.

299
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,633
BREDERECK: What effect does he have
on the environment?

300
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,136
So if he runs over dry ground,
there should be a little bit dust kicking up.

301
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,639
If he runs through, like, let's say, an alley...

302
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:44,100
...with a lot of, like, you know,
garbage lying around...

303
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:47,020
...that needs to fly and shoot around.

304
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:48,605
And if he runs through water...

305
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:50,814
...we have to have a little bit spray.

306
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:52,775
Can I run on water?

307
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,904
We haven't really seen anybody
run on water before.

308
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:59,782
So basically everything
is pretty much made up.

309
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:03,953
BREDERECK: You study, like, Jet Skis
and boats and other things...

310
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,206
...that are going, like,
over water surface really, really quickly...

311
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:10,209
...but then you also have to
have that extra level of imagination.

312
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:14,421
So how would it look like
if somebody could run that fast over water?

313
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:16,215
What exactly will happen?

314
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,717
Is it a stream that just gets emitted
from behind him?

315
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:22,012
Or is it like every step is a little puddle?

316
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:27,685
BREDERECK:
We're taking our running Flash model...

317
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:31,146
...um, and then basically, like, use that...

318
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:33,898
...on top of a very, very complex
water simulation.

319
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:38,278
So we're trying to, like, simulate
what would it look like...

320
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:42,532 X1:0
...and then tune it to something
that looks really, really cool...

321
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,659
...and looks also close
to what the comic books...

322
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,245
...actually, you know, like,
showed over years.

323
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:50,873
And it's basically a combination
of all those things.

324
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,126
TARANYAN: We have people,
like water specialists...

325
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,085
...that try to simulate all these elements...

326
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:58,880
...and go through a whole shading process
to make it look like water.

327
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:01,091
And all that basically gives the illusion...

328
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:04,011
...like there's somebody, like, actually
running over water...

329
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,681
...so fast that he's not, like, sinking in.

330
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:12,185 X1:0
We've gotten pretty good with
how long it takes to do Flash...

331
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,564 X1:0
...running through a city
and, you know, different things like that.

332
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:20,777 X1:0
Those aren't as challenging anymore.
What's challenging is the big fights.

333
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:26,867
More and more, we've kind of tried
to take those to a next level.

334
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:35,499
I knew about Reverse-Flash
very early in the season.

335
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,960
I knew that episode nine was a big episode.

336
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:40,254
And that episode, it was in a stadium.

337
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,305
I think that was accidental
that it would be in a stadium...

338
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,433
...that our DP came up
with this cool lighting thing that happened.

339
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,727
Then the director said,
"It'd be cool if we did this."

340
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,481
And we have an amazing stunt crew
that said, "We could do this practically."

341
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:02,735
And then it's us chiming, said, "Well,
we could do this if you get us these plates."

342
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,695
So it becomes everyone's baby
at that point.

343
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:10,992
It's like a bunch of kids, you know, deciding
how they're gonna build their sandcastle...

344
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,911
...you know, just on a bigger scale.

345
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,373
TARANYAN: The Flash-and-Reverse-Flash,
uh, fight sequence...

346
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,626 X1:0
...it was the first time
we're seeing Reverse-Flash...

347
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:23,546 X1:0
...so the look for his lightning
hadn't been developed yet...

348
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:26,841 X1:0
...and we're trying to figure out,
obviously it's gotta be a different color...

349
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,094
...so we figured red,
so we went with the whole red--

350
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,055
It was like the inverse of--
It is the reverse, you know.

351
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:35,892
So he's red with yellow lightning.

352
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,770
The other guy's yellow with the red lightning.
So it totally made sense.

353
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:46,903
We did a big fight
in one of the episodes where...

354
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,863
...you flash back to the,
you know, time that his mom died...

355
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,534
...and we did a slow-motion fight, uh,
inside the house.

356
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,371
And we did that all CG,
we scanned the set...

357
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:00,707
...we texture-mapped the set,
so we could control the camera move.

358
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,167
BREDERECK:
There was, like, a lot of work put in...

359
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:07,714
...to get the animation, and the staging,
and the action, and the whole story right...

360
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,885
...down to the wine spilling out of
Nora Allen's glass, and that kind of stuff.

361
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:17,557
And it's definitely, like,
a really cool creative process...

362
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:22,478
...where you work with the production
together to achieve the best result.

363
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,521
Because sometimes
they wanna do something...

364
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:26,272
...but they're not sure, can we do that?

365
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,066
And then we show them,
"Yes, we can. And how about this?"

366
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:37,324
I could talk a little bit about this
beginning of what we did. It's kind of cool.

367
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:40,786
So to sell that he
was jumping out of the train...

368
00:21:40,953 --> 00:21:44,706
...we just set up a platform,
and kind of timed as we were driving back...

369
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:47,584
...for, you know, the stunt guy
to jump out...

370
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:51,671
...you know, to mimic that he just
jumped out of a moving train.

371
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:53,798
Good luck with that.

372
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,303
So many of these amazing
visual-effects shots...

373
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,221
...only work because of the stunt people.

374
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:03,183
You know, and our stunt team,
led by J.J. Makaro...

375
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,143
...who also works on Arrow...

376
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,605
...you know, it really is this
amazing collaborate process.

377
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:12,317
Towards the end, Flash
takes the stunt girl off camera...

378
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:15,612
...and then we had
basically stunt doubles...

379
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,156
...on the outside,
you know, portion of the shot...

380
00:22:18,323 --> 00:22:22,160
...just kind of fall into place,
like they're being dropped off by him...

381
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:26,122
...and again, his digital double
mimic them being dropped into place...

382
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:29,626
...you know, which was the exterior shots
that came after this.

383
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:31,711
There's little we kept
from the original plate...

384
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:34,047
...except the ground
and a little bit of the background.

385
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:44,973
Kind of stepping up our game,
episode per episode.

386
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:48,060
We introduced Firestorm and featured him.

387
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:52,022
Again it was a very iconic character
that, you know, you brought to life.

388
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:55,358
I mean, it's a guy with his
head on fire, and hands on fire.

389
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:59,028
You always have the danger
of making something like that look cheesy.

390
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:05,910
So that was great to finally get a look
that I think everybody was pleased with.

391
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:09,413
When I watch a great episode of the show,
it makes me feel...

392
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,999
...the way the books used to make me feel
when I was a kid.

393
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:16,504 X1:0
One gratifying thing about the show is
so many times when we sit back in editing...

394
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:19,006 X1:0
...it really does feel like a comic book
come to life.

395
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:21,259
BERLANTI: There's a great learning curve
that happens...

396
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:24,010
...of how early you have to break stories
and figure things out...

397
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:28,390
...so you can start visual effects
and prevising those events kind of early.

398
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:33,061
BREDERECK: I'm sure the writers,
after, like, this first season...

399
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:37,858
...know that we can do pretty much,
like, anything that they imagine.

400
00:23:38,024 --> 00:23:42,362
And so they will probably come up with
bigger things that will challenge us again.

401
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,950
Story comes first.

402
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:50,702
And we hope that with the visual effects
that we're doing...

403
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:53,997
...that we're taking lots of
those boundaries, of those limits off...

404
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:57,041
...so the writers can be creative
and can really go crazy...

405
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,377
...and give the fans
what they want and what they need.

406
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:03,839
It's a great feeling, the best feeling
working on this show is...

407
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:05,882
...that my 11-year-old gets to go to school...

408
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,259
...and tell his friends that his dad
works on <i>The Flash.</i>

409
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:11,888
That's the best experience, you know,
part of it, but again it's playing.

410
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:16,726
I mean, it's being able to, as an adult,
be able to take something...

411
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:18,685
...and create something out of it.

412
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,396
TARANYAN: The effects that
we're doing, we're trying to push--

413
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,772
We're pretty much pushing the limit
of what's possible...

414
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:26,358
...to do on TV, on a TV schedule.

415
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:29,653
And it's awesome and it's great, you know?

416
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,991
Like, we-- I have fun
working here every day, you know.

417
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:38,037
When I go home, I think about the stuff
that I'm gonna do the next day.

418
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:40,079
And it's really rewarding, you know.

419
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,789
And then seeing all the fans...

420
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:44,626
...and all the feedback
that we're getting from everybody...

421
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,377
...you know, it'sjust phenomenal.
You know, it's great.

422
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,631
KREISBERG:
It's just a whole new level of storytelling.

423
00:24:50,797 --> 00:24:54,301
All anybody wants is to entertain people.

424
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,677
And all anybody wants is for it to all work.

425
00:24:56,844 --> 00:24:59,680
And all anybody cares about
is making the best possible show.

426
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:02,224
And there really isn't a lot of ego.

427
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:05,394
And when you watch everybody
collaborating like that...

428
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:08,773
...and everybody coming together
to make the show look as good as it does...

429
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,651
...I think that, you know, is pretty special.
