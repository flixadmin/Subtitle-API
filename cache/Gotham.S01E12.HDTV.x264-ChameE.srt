00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,723
I've worked so long all my life
to get where I am.

170
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:05,703
So long, I forget why
I wanted to be here.

171
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,911
Well, you wanted
to be someone.

172
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,115
And you are.

173
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:12,058
Look at all the
stuff you have.

174
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,132
(thunder rumbles)

175
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,810
You're a good girl, Liza.

176
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:20,587
You need to find a young man
and get married,

177
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:22,292
have babies.

178
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,969
It's not fair of me,
keeping you cooped up here,

179
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,138
doing my housework.

180
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,250
You'll never find
a good husband here.

181
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:32,861
Anyhow, if you'd like
to get out in the world,

182
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:35,203
I was thinking
I could set you up

183
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:39,049
with a bakery or some type
of business like that.

184
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,695
So you can be independent.

185
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,601
That's really nice, Mr. F.

186
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:46,106
Thank you.

187
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,447
But I would rather
be here with you.

188
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:50,254
You would?

189
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:51,692
I like it here.

190
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,639
You make me feel safe.

191
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:57,545
Well, good.

192
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,719
I like having you here.

193
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:02,027
Yeah.

194
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,802
Maybe I'll try to get a little
work done before dinner.

195
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:08,315
I'm making something
special tonight.

196
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:20,221
(car door closing)

197
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:22,295
(screaming)

198
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,593
What are you laughing at?

199
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:32,897
Ah, it's good to be back.

200
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,536
Only a man from
a lunatic asylum

201
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,674
would say that.

202
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,945
You're like a human
roller coaster,

203
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,349
except you only go down.

204
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:40,256
Wouldn't that make him
more of an elevator?

205
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:41,393
You have anything useful, Ed?

206
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:42,664
I got a little less
than 20 hours

207
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,135
before I lose my job.

208
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:45,674
I do... have something useful.

209
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:46,777
And it is?

210
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,149
I cross-checked fingerprints.

211
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:50,625
The clinically insane
Jack Gruber

212
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:52,932
of Arkham is a figment
of the files.

213
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:54,638
The man himself is really
a career criminal

214
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,845
by the name Jack Buchinsky.

215
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,484
How is that even possible?

216
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,189
Easy enough to bribe someone
to change the records.

217
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,196
Yep, apparently, he wanted
to be transferred to Arkham.

218
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:04,404
That's really
good work, Ed.

219
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:05,842
What's this
Buttinsky's deal?

220
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:08,351
NYGMA:
Uh, it's, uh,

221
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:09,454
Buchinsky.

222
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,528
It's all in the files.

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,104
Just make sure you sign it out.

224
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,977
It's classified information,
so just be careful.

225
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,448
Miss Kringle?

226
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,388
(sighs)

227
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,264
I believe you left this
on my desk.

228
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,435
It's a riddle.

229
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:26,545
It's a cupcake

230
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:28,954
with a live bullet
sticking out of it.

231
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:30,091
It's a riddle.

232
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:31,128
It's menacing

233
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,871
and weird and inedible.

234
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:38,553
Thank you for the files,
Miss Kringle.

235
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,095
BULLOCK: This Buchinsky dude
and his partners

236
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:43,034
pulled four successful
bank robberies,

237
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:46,079
killed six along the way
before the GCPD caught him

238
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,316
by accident.

239
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:48,520
He never named his accomplices.

240
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,657
GORDON:
He's in prison,

241
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,429
he hears Arkham
is opening its doors,

242
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:53,436
so he uses his connections,

243
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,075
and he gets himself
a new identity

244
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:57,015
as the mental patient Gruber.

245
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,353
He must have some
good connections.

246
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,192
Right, and when the rest
of the nuts get transferred

247
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,363
to Arkham... voilà.

248
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:03,370
So, he had
partners, huh?

249
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,775
Yeah, GCPD never
identified them.

250
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:05,945
They're still
out there.

251
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:08,755
Yep, we find them,
we'll find him.

252
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:11,163
BULLOCK:
Easy enough, huh?

253
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:13,103
Detective.

254
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,079
A hit.

255
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,531
GORDON:
What do we got?

256
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,873
MAN:
Lead detectives dusted
for prints, two sets...

257
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,913
Gruber and Danzig,
just like we thought.

258
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:27,953
Right. Thanks.
All right.

259
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,829
Van checks out.

260
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:33,874
It was them.

261
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,047
Our man's an electronics
freak, right?

262
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,121
Yeah.

263
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,402
Think he went
shopping?

264
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,506
He's dead.

265
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:05,312
Fried like a doughnut.

266
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:07,386
(faint squeaking)

267
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,236
(faint squeaking continues)

268
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,196
GORDON:
GCPD.

269
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,270
Turn around slowly,
let me see those hands.

270
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,216
Hey.

271
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:28,223
(groans)

272
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,230
Hey, buddy.

273
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,304
Hey. Hey!

274
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:57,489
(screams)

275
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:58,827
Help, help! Please!

276
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:00,834
Get back in the store.

277
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,205
Okay. Take it easy. Okay.

278
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,744
(tires screech)

279
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:07,021
Please, there's been
a terrible mistake.

280
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,329
I am Don Falcone's housekeeper.

281
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,035
Fish?

282
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,874
Thank God.

283
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,881
Why'd you have to pull
me out like that?

284
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:16,353
You scared the
life out of me.

285
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,025
It's time, Liza.

286
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:20,333
I'm gonna make
my move on Falcone.

287
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,473
And don't be scared,
baby girl.

288
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,246
I got this.

289
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,293
(phone rings)

290
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:33,110
SCRAMBLED MALE VOICE:
Mr. Falcone,

291
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,284
we have your girl, Liza.

292
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:37,291
Would you like to see her again?

293
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:38,795
Yes, I would.

294
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:40,702
She'll be glad to hear that.

295
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:44,615
For a fit young woman,
she has a low pain threshold.

296
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,321
Please! No!

297
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,993
Stop!

298
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,672
An intermediary will be
in contact with you soon.

299
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:53,679
Don't hurt her.
She's a civilian.

300
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,017
(call disconnects)

301
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,157
Hello?

302
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,191
What now?

303
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:10,904
Now we let him sit and think
about his life for a while.

304
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:27,058
BULLOCK:
"The Electrocutioner."

305
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,196
Cute.

306
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:29,366
No pressure.

307
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,704
Don't worry, we'll get him.

308
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:32,142
Yeah, and we got 17 hours
to do so.

309
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:33,147
I love the name.

310
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:34,818
It's catchy, has drama.

311
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,059
The Electro-cutioner.

312
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,066
Speaking of which, given
the general mode of attack,

313
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:42,109
may I suggest you
both wear your...

314
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,982
department-issue galoshes
while you're out in the field.

315
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,320
Galoshes?

316
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:47,962
In the event of
electrical misadventure,

317
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:49,701
your footwear should
be insulated.

318
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:50,872
No, Mom!

319
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,678
I'm not gonna wear
my rubbers on the case.

320
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,752
Nygma, give 'em here.

321
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,127
Seriously?

322
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,451
BULLOCK: All right,
so what do we know?

323
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:07,294
Gruber wasn't too happy
with Irwin.

324
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,636
Maybe they were partners in
crime, Irwin turned on him,

325
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:10,974
Gruber took the fall.

326
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,010
Detective Gordon.

327
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,452
Dr. Thompkins.

328
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,459
My friends call me Lee.

329
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,867
Congratulations, you
got your job back.

330
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:19,871
Or not, depending.

331
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:21,008
It's good to see you.

332
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,144
Is it?

333
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:25,623
I-I know you're caught
up with the escape.

334
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,627
That's why I'm here.

335
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,630
Is everything okay?

336
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:29,469
Must be chaos down there.

337
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,208
We're getting by just fine.
Thanks for asking.

338
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,579
(clears throat)

339
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:35,489
Oh, right, this is my
partner, Harvey Bullock.

340
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:36,827
<i>Hola.</i>

341
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,266
Detective Bullock.

342
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:39,603
Who's your little
friend there?

343
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,242
Oh, this is
why I'm here.

344
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,349
One of the women in my
wing is a pagan sorceress.

345
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:44,353
Of course.

346
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:45,991
She's very popular.

347
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:47,664
The inmates make dolls
to look like people

348
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,035
that they want to curse.

349
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,142
And then they give it to
the sorceress to curse them.

350
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:52,814
In exchange for extra
soda and candy.

351
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,688
I curse you all the time.
You never give me candy.

352
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,092
I asked her if Gruber

353
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:57,765
had ever given her
a doll to curse,

354
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:59,069
and she said yes.

355
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:00,240
This is the doll.

356
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:01,845
His name is Mr. M.

357
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,855
You owe me for a double
six-pack of root beer.

358
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:05,893
Mr. M.?

359
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,230
Mr. M.

360
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,568
Mr. M.

361
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:11,645
Who does this
look like to you?

362
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:13,284
MARONI:<i> I tell this guy,</i>
<i>I said, "Maurice...</i>

363
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,956
"we've pulled out half
your freaking teeth.

364
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,461
"What the hell are
you waiting for?

365
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:17,866
The tooth fairy?" Right?
(laughter)

366
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:27,398
(cell phone buzzes)
So, what he does...

367
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,004
you know what Maurice does?
He smiles at me.

368
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:30,275
So I say, "I'm
gonna take out

369
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:31,746
another one, man."
I go to his molar.

370
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:34,221
I got to get Mario and Gabe
to help me pull it out.

371
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:35,425
Do excuse me.

372
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,964
Right.
So, we're, like, pulling it,

373
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,101
we're pulling it, right?

374
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:39,438
And finally
we get it out.

375
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,111
The thing is this big...

376
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:42,181
Yes.

377
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,252
FALCONE:
Come see me.

378
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,322
I need you.

379
00:16:44,324 --> 00:16:45,393
I'm on my way.

380
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,065
What's wrong?

381
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,403
Somebody took Liza.

382
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:49,774
Come, quickly.

383
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,774
You sly devil.

384
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:02,784
You took her.

385
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:04,858
You're mine now.

386
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,310
So I'm trying to tell
this guy, "Let him talk."

387
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:12,852
Because now he's trying to talk,
but now I don't understand him

388
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:14,324
'cause he's got no teeth, right?
(laughing)

389
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,196
So I'm saying,
"Let him talk. Clean him out.

390
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:17,802
He's gonna tell us something."

391
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,481
Don Maroni, sir, forgive me.

392
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:23,487
Such fun we're having.

393
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:25,762
But I regret
that I must run away.

394
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:27,836
If you'll let me.

395
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,240
My mother is sick.

396
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,618
Well, a sick mother's
a sick mother.

397
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,692
Go.

398
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:49,576
Hey...

399
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:51,014
Penguin, you all right?

400
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:52,686
Whoa.

401
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:54,225
Hey, kid, what
are you...?

402
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,596
What's going on here?

403
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,509
Get down!

404
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,560
(coughing)

405
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,473
MARONI:
I don't know what happened.

406
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,145
It was like a silent bomb.

407
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,751
You know who
did this, right?

408
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,423
Who?

409
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:24,962
A few years ago,
Jack Buchinsky

410
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:27,337
and partners unknown
knocked over four banks.

411
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,210
Killed six people.

412
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,715
Buchinsky went
down for life.

413
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:34,060
His partners were
never caught.

414
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:36,234
You're one of
those partners.
(chuckles)

415
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:39,377
The one that took his share and
sold him up the river, I expect.

416
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:41,752
What guy was this?

417
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,425
Bu... uh...

418
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,432
Who?

419
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,772
While he's out there
looking to hurt you,

420
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:50,782
he doesn't care
who else he hurts.

421
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,789
Women, kids.

422
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,960
Hey.

423
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:55,466
That's not my fault.

424
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,512
Help me do the right
thing here, Don Maroni.

425
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:04,697
Let me place you in
protective custody.

426
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,703
Protective custody?

427
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:07,774
Yes.

428
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:08,944
Bait, you mean.

429
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,389
We catch our bad guy,

430
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:13,894
you get rid of a
dangerous nuisance.

431
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,064
We both come
out ahead.

432
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,071
Excuse me.

433
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,744
Hello?

434
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:20,884
I... must be going.

435
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,125
Very urgent business.

436
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,199
W-W-With Falcone.

437
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:42,558
All right, make
yourself at home.

438
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,023
Hey, sweetheart.

439
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,193
Get me a double espresso.

440
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:54,197
Extra sugar.

441
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:55,267
Nah.

442
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,650
(rings doorbell)

443
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,807
I'm Barbara.

444
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,817
Barbara Kean.

445
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:31,757
My parents, they live here.

446
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,169
It's very nice to
see you, Barbara.

447
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:47,176
Isn't it, Everett?

448
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:48,180
(sighs)

449
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,186
Yes, very nice.

450
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:53,330
It's nice
to see you, too.

451
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:56,273
You've been well, I hope?

452
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:58,615
Yes.

453
00:20:58,617 --> 00:20:59,886
And you?

454
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,525
Splendid.

455
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:04,568
Are you staying the night?

456
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,046
Uh, if that's
all right.

457
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:10,388
In fact, um...

458
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,428
I-I thought maybe
I could stay a few days.

459
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,502
If that's...

460
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,582
Oh, I see.

461
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:20,589
Yes, of course.

462
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:23,933
I'm sure you're going
to be frightfully bored.

463
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:26,275
But stay until
the weekend.

464
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:28,449
By all means.

465
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,456
Thank you.

466
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,064
How's that young
man of yours?

467
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,737
James?

468
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:36,744
The policeman?

469
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:38,181
All well, I hope?

470
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:41,191
Yes.

471
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,834
He's well, thank you.

472
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,744
Good.

473
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:49,955
We're very happy.

474
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:52,028
Very happy.

475
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,055
(men laughing)

476
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,494
You guys are, like,
hungry for this.

477
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,166
What do you guys do here
for excitement?

478
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:05,106
Remember that joke
about the, uh, what is it?

479
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:07,647
The two cops and the undertaker
that go on a fishing boat.

480
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,521
When you use
a tethered goat as bait,

481
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:12,799
shouldn't the goat be out in
the jungle and not in the house?

482
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:16,444
This house is the
best-defended spot in Gotham.

483
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:20,223
Buchinsky is crazy and
arrogant and resourceful.

484
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,966
Wherever Maroni is,
he'll come after him.

485
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,107
He'll enjoy the challenge.

486
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,050
(indistinct chatter)

487
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,722
(gasps)

488
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,595
Hey, there.

489
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:33,435
Hi... hi, boss.

490
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,174
How long have I
been unconscious?

491
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:36,479
Couple of hours.

492
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,151
Oh, my gosh.

493
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,522
I-I must go.

494
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,927
My-my poor mother...

495
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:43,904
Your mother can wait.

496
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,910
(quiet gasp)

497
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:48,185
It's her heart, poor thing.

498
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:49,623
Valves.

499
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,034
She-she might be
taken at any moment...

500
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:57,416
But... but,
by all means,

501
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,091
of course, she can wait.

502
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,965
When you woke up before,

503
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:05,209
you said you had
urgent business...

504
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:09,223
...with Falcone.

505
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,798
I did?

506
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,805
I said that?

507
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:16,313
Did I?

508
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:18,387
(phone ringing)

509
00:23:28,154 --> 00:23:30,327
MOONEY:
Carmine?

510
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:34,073
Some people have called me
about your girl Liza.

511
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:36,448
They want me
to help make a deal.

512
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:41,498
I didn't think
it was going to be you.

513
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,171
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,846
I'm just an intermediary.

515
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:47,518
I just want to help.

516
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,756
Please, my dear.

517
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,161
Stop.

518
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,967
I know this is you.

519
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:54,509
Be honest.

520
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:55,980
It's me.

521
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:57,987
Of course it is.

522
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:00,997
How long have I known you?

523
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:02,971
You're the smart one
in the family.

524
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:04,676
Didn't I always say so?

525
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:06,683
She won't be hurt.

526
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:08,021
Leave Gotham.

527
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:09,928
That's all... leave Gotham,

528
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,064
never come back.

529
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,737
You can take her with you.

530
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,296
Agreed.

531
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:21,366
That's the right decision.

532
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:24,276
I'll make the arrangements.

533
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:27,220
You were always my favorite.

534
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:30,598
Wait for my call.

535
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,237
GILZEAN:
He's leaving?

536
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,310
You did it?

537
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:36,752
(laughing)

538
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:38,223
Boss?

539
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:40,832
The genius! The-the vision!

540
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:44,645
You brought down
the old man... finally.

541
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:47,153
Let's celebrate.

542
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:51,502
Butch, this is not
the time to celebrate.

543
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,047
He was a great man once.

544
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,957
You don't think somebody would
take him out if he stayed on?

545
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:01,501
I am doing him a favor
and giving him an easy way out.

546
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:07,789
I owe him at least that.

547
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,462
Of course.

548
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,369
You're right.

549
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:13,208
It's best for everyone.

550
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,586
LIZA:
How did he sound?

551
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:22,105
Sad.

552
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:25,550
Look at me.

553
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:28,427
Is there something
you're not telling me?

554
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:30,266
No.

555
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:33,845
You're going to have
to leave town with him,

556
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:35,416
string him along for a while.

557
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:36,988
Do you think
you can do that?

558
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,426
Sure.

559
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:39,630
Sure.

560
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:43,008
But you like him, though,
don't you?

561
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,718
Well, I can like him, can't I?

562
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:49,464
He's been
a perfect gentleman.

563
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,705
He could've done anything,

564
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:54,448
and he never laid a hand on me.

565
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,323
Liza, you can like
him all you want.

566
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:01,036
But you can never
tell him the truth.

567
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,646
I know that.

568
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:13,746
Sir?

569
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:16,087
Let me go to work.

570
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,365
No.

571
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:22,175
"No"?

572
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:23,914
If Fish and the others...

573
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,392
and there must be others...

574
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:29,633
if they all want me
to step away so badly,

575
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,640
maybe it's time.

576
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:35,219
Why not?

577
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:38,897
Why am I still here fighting?

578
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,008
For what?

579
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,052
For respect.

580
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:48,831
You're Don Carmine Falcone.

581
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,102
"Respect"?

582
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:54,049
Who cares?

583
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:55,587
They all want me

584
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:58,530
to go live in the country
with Liza.

585
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:00,772
I would like that.

586
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:03,882
That's what I want, too.

587
00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:06,324
So, why not do it?

588
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:10,538
Please...

589
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,812
don't talk that way, sir.

590
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,488
(laughs)

591
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,929
And just me on my own?

592
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:20,739
I can take out Fish's crew easy.

593
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,445
You're not
listening, Victor.

594
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,830
Your job is to keep
me and Liza safe

595
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:29,937
through the coming transaction.

596
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,944
That's all.

597
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:34,017
Yes, sir.

598
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:48,098
Miss Kringle?
(gasps)

599
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,774
What?! What?

600
00:27:50,776 --> 00:27:53,951
The cupcake is sweet,
the bullet is deadly.

601
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:56,426
A beautiful woman's
a dangerous thing.

602
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,811
Um, uh, listen, I, uh...

603
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,420
That is so...

604
00:28:04,422 --> 00:28:06,125
I don't...

605
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:07,999
I don't even know
what to say to that.

606
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:10,073
Nygma, you perv, back off.

607
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:12,045
Can't you see the lady
doesn't want you bugging her?

608
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,751
NYGMA:
I, um...

609
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:15,625
Hey, there. Hey, now.
Who's bugging who?

610
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,464
I'm just, I'm just...

611
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:19,003
What's green and then red?

612
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:20,440
Frogs in a blender.
(laughs)

613
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:22,849
Walk away, Nygma.

614
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,056
Walk away.

615
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:28,802
I'm very sorry if I've
offended you, Miss Kringle.

616
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,942
That was not my intention.

617
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:35,090
(rumbling nearby)

618
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:36,897
Do you hear that?

619
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,301
Go.

620
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:43,686
Thank you.

621
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,495
He is so weird.

622
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:18,236
OSWALD:
I have no business with Falcone!

623
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:19,908
I swear on my mother's life!

624
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,550
May God strike her dead
with horrible torment

625
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,156
if I'm lying!

626
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:26,096
Okay, then, my friend.

627
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,838
I'm sorry I doubted you.

628
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,477
Go see your mom.

629
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,417
Give her a kiss for me.

630
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,491
(shuddering):
Thank you.

631
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,843
(men and women clamoring)

632
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,841
(all yelling, clamoring)

633
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:53,759
Ah.

634
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,431
There's the one.

635
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,973
Under that funny-looking
fellow there.

636
00:30:57,975 --> 00:30:59,244
(grunts)

637
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:02,086
Take him to the truck.

638
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:05,799
They didn't cook.

639
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:07,706
Just stunned.

640
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,114
I expected more...

641
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:11,987
oomph!

642
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,201
You want "oomph," Jack?

643
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,408
Ah.

644
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,888
Officer Gordon.

645
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,095
Nice shoes.

646
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:27,238
Detective Gordon.

647
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,112
Hands up, both of you.

648
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:32,556
Uh, you might want to drop that.

649
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:39,614
Aah!

650
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:43,293
(grunting)

651
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:49,079
Why fight me, Gordon?

652
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,819
Who here

653
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,293
deserves your protection?

654
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:54,765
Any of them?
All of them.

655
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,504
Even Maroni?! Please!

656
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:59,949
Just let me kill
this false friend

657
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,692
and get on with my life.

658
00:32:02,694 --> 00:32:05,200
(both grunting)

659
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:12,959
All this fight.

660
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:15,033
And for what?

661
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:22,191
I'm putting you
back in Arkham, Jack.

662
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:24,231
That's closer to the mark,
now, isn't it, Jim?

663
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,937
You need to win.

664
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:28,512
Don't you? You pretend
to care about the law,

665
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,087
but in your heart,
it's all primitive ego.

666
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:34,833
And you lust
for blood and power.

667
00:32:34,835 --> 00:32:38,714
You just hate to lose.

668
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:39,951

I hope you have some
nasty pictures of him,

Don't worry.

Told me that she told you
stuff about my mother

00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:04,882
so that I'd get
all caught up in you.

00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:04,458
Right, yeah.

841
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,331
Is that why you're here?

842
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,873
Yes.

843
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:13,422
No.

844
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:16,231
She does want her
doll back, but, um...

845
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,439
Not entirely.

846
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:19,743
No.

847
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:25,998
You live here?

848
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:29,510
Sort of between places
right now.

849
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:31,349
(laughs)

850
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:34,125
I don't know why I'm here.

851
00:42:34,127 --> 00:42:35,296
Sorry.

852
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:37,704
A whim.

853
00:42:39,511 --> 00:42:40,948
Wait.

854
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,853
OFFICER:
Hey, Gordon,
did you hear?

855
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:16,468
There's been a big shootout
at Fish Mooney's place.
