1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,440
There will be a war in this family,
and one of you will die.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,040
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,080
are your own responsibility.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,040
Since my mother
passed away four years ago,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,440
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,120
I'm very much looking forward to
working with you again, Michael.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,120
That, my friend, is the finest opium
in the world.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
Why would you sell?
The Irish are being difficult.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,120
The Italians are not an option.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,280
You're going to America? To Canada,
to collect payment for the shipment.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,680
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman,

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,840
to have each day what
I have only sampled once.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,360
Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
She's gone, Tommy. She's gone.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,760
A daughter lost. A son found.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,800
This is my son.
They call him Duke.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,560
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,480
How long? Perhaps 18 months.

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,080
My associates are going
to take care of Thomas Shelby,

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
and you are going
to give us his brother.

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,600
What are Michael's real intentions
towards me, Gina?

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,480
And if you lie, I will know.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,000
It is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,120
This programme contains
scenes of Repetitive Flashing Images

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,320
and some scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting,

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,040
and very strong language and some
violent scenes from the start.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,720
It was the ambitions and strategies
of one man that caused this.

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,560
I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Do you want a drink first
or a whore first?

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,800
I want to see my wife first.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,480
After you've fucked your wife,

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,080
you're going to kill a man,
right?

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,680
DOOR OPENS

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,320
SNIFFLING

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,960
The smoke
from your daughter's funeral

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,000
is still in your clothes...

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,480
...and you slept with someone.

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,840
Not just someone.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,400
The enemy.

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,920
Every enemy we ever had
in one woman.

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,240
There are some things
that I do, Lizzie, that I...

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,080
You're not so good
at lying any more, Tommy.

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,240
These days,
the truth gets in your eyes.

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,360
I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,440
I need to know where you will go.
See? You just accept it.

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,560
You don't fight it.

47
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,560
You ARE cursed, Tommy.

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,200
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

49
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,280
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

50
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,200
A curse never to be lifted.

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,680
I will be away, Lizzie.

52
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,640
And while I'm gone,
I know a place where...

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,360
Always gone, always away.

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
Well, now your rings are gone,

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,760
your rings are away.

56
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm already packed.

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Now leave me to say goodbye
to Ruby.

58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,720
I have to go away for a bit,
Charlie.

59
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,600
Look at me.

60
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Hey. Look at me.

61
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,640
Mum already told me
she's leaving...

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,000
..and she told me why.

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,480
Mum, where are you going?

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
A hotel.

65
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,560
And then your father
will get me a house.

66
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,880
Mum, I'll come with you.

67
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,440
I'd rather be with you.

68
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,760
Wherever it is.

69
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,560
You're not my mum...

70
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
..but you're more my mum
than he's my dad.

71
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
He's never here.

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,640
I'd be on my own here.

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,440
Oh, Charles, love...

74
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,360
..I don't think your father
would allow that.

75
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
You can go.

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,400
You can go, son.

77
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
I know a good place.

78
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Lizzie,
I'll arrange that place.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,920
And, Charlie,
you can take him, eh?

80
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,720
They have stables
at this new place.

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,000
After a while, he'll...
He'll listen to you.

82
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,440
He'll forget about Ruby.

83
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,400
That's how horses are.

84
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,520
And you'll be here all alone.

85
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm buying land, Lizzie.
I'm buying up land.

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
This place I've bought

87
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,680
I was going to knock down,
but you can go there. Dad...

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,760
Where will you go?

89
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
KEYS CLANK

90
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,720
This is
the Peaky Blinders' armoury.

91
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,320
We have
a very good relationship

92
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,760
with the BSA factory
in Armoury Road.

93
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,200
Two dozen machine guns,
half a dozen sub-machine guns,

94
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,000
BSA sniper rifles,
three boxes of hand grenades.

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,760
For what purpose?

96
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,560
For eventualities like
the one that is about to occur.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,680
When men come to us
with bad intentions,

98
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,640
the family come together.

99
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,240
Tommy says it's time
you join the family.

100
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,640
But you're not just going to be
a soldier.

101
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,360
You're going to be a general...
some day.

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
So, I need to ask you
some questions.

103
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,760
What have you ever fired?

104
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,920
Shotgun.

105
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,760
Pistol.

106
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,040
22.

107
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
What have you ever killed?

108
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Few rabbits.

109
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,480
Pheasant, partridge. A stag.

110
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,840
Arthur tells me when they were
taking care of some business

111
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,320
at the betting shop,
you ran away.

112
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
It was unfair.

113
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,640
Fairness is not
a soldier's concern.

114
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,560
You do what you do.

115
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,680
I already have done.

116
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,480
Fair and square.

117
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,920
I have killed a man.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Tommy's always right.

119
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,800
We were outside
a hospital in Bridgnorth.

120
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,480
In the Black Country.

121
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,520
My mother was dying.

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,840
And the orderly
wouldn't give her a bed

123
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,840
cos she was a Gypsy -
she had no insurance.

124
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,200
She never saw the sunrise.

125
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
Nor did that man
who denied her.

126
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Just one more thing
we need to know about you.

127
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,360
Can you keep a secret?

128
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,080
I know, brother.

129
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
I know.

130
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,880
I know.

131
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,080
I stole your keys.

132
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Tuberculoma.

133
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
In your brain.

134
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah.

135
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,080
But I still have time
to do what I need to do.

136
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,400
Fuck you, Tommy.

137
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,680
I don't need anyone to know,
Arthur.

138
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,880
No, you don't, do you?

139
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
You don't need anything,
do you?

140
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,400
No, I don't need anything.

141
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,520
I don't need anything.

142
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
How long
have we been dead for, eh?

143
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,120
You and me, how long?

144
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
At least now
I'll have a certificate.

145
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,480
ARTHUR SCOFFS

146
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,880
Wherever it is,

147
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,520
I'll get the drinks in
and I'll wait for you.

148
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Fuck's sake. Yeah.

149
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,600
All them bullets that missed.

150
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,080
TOMMY CHUCKLES
It's funny, Arthur.

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,080
It's funny is what it is.

152
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,400
So don't you fucking weep.

153
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,320
Weep!

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,360
When everyone is taken care
of financially,

155
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,960
I will take myself away.
On my own.

156
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,800
I don't want anyone...

157
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,440
..anyone who may or may not
love me...

158
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,560
..to have to see me crawl...

159
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
..or grow insane and helpless.

160
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,960
It would be a cruelty to me
and to them.

161
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,720
By the time people know
the truth, I will be gone.

162
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,840
What about Lizzie?

163
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,120
I have some papers
I need you to sign

164
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,000
on behalf of the company.

165
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,880
Told Lizzie?

166
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm working
with the housing minister.

167
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,840
I will be allocating contracts,

168
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
construction contracts,
worth £10 million.

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,160
You haven't told Lizzie?

170
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
Some of the contracts
I will be allocating

171
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,000
are with companies
in which we have an interest.

172
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,520
Fuck you and your contracts!

173
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,120
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue to earn money.

174
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,840
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing it
because it's a good thing.

175
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,120
Building houses. Oh...

176
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Yeah, for ordinary working people...
Oh, yeah, good for you. Fuckin'...

177
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,480
..in the interests
of a fairer future.

178
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,920
And before that,
I will be going to Canada

179
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,720
to collect payment
for the shipment - £5 million!

180
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,520
Oh, five fucking million?

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,000
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

182
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,720
And that will be my legacy.

183
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,440
Instead of me,
there will be money.

184
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Because for most of the people

185
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,520
who are close to me,
that is what I am!

186
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,240
Fucking money.
That is my agency.

187
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,640
Is that all you think you are,
eh? Hmm?

188
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,120
Stand up.

189
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,520
You heard me.

190
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,680
Stand up.

191
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
On your feet.

192
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,640
On your fucking feet. Arthur...

193
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,040
On your feet, Soldier.
On your feet.

194
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,920
Stand the fuck up! Come here.

195
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
No!

196
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,520
No.

197
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,960
You hear me?

198
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,440
Enough.

199
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Enough!

200
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
Now you know.

201
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,240
You tell no-one else...

202
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,040
..until I am gone.

203
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
Until you're gone, yeah?

204
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,040
When the time comes,
I'll call you.

205
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,040
I'll tell you where.
It'll be a wagon.

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,640
Fuck your wagon!

207
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,480
You light the flame.

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,760
You bring Charlie and Curly
and no-one else.

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,640
Get drunk.

210
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Rake the ashes
for silver and gold.

211
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
Fuck you!

212
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,760
And your fucking plans!

213
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,600
That time,
I did let you fucking win.

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,800
John...

215
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Fuckin' you, John.

216
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,040
Fuckin' both of you.

217
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
Arthur...

218
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,080
Arthur.

219
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,440
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

220
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,720
ARTHUR SOBS
Come here.

221
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,280
Come here.

222
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,240
Come here.

223
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,680
Let me see your eyes.

224
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,440
I'm clean, man.

225
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,120
The dragon's fucking gone.

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,040
Thanks to you. Fucking...
Fucking thanks to you.

227
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,560
You all right?

228
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,960
Come on.

229
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,200
Fucking...
Hey, I'm still fucking here.

230
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,080
Pull yourself together,
come on. We have work to do.

231
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,200
Come on!

232
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,640
DOOR OPENS

233
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,880
You're sure you want Billy?
I had to shut up the shop.

234
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,560
Yes. We want Billy.

235
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,400
Sit down, Billy.

236
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,840
Thank you for inviting me,
Mr Shelby.

237
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,160
Good to see you again, Billy.

238
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,440
No. Mary says
not until after six o'clock.

239
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,040
He said to tell his father
he feels OK about it.

240
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,920
Good. Shut the door, Duke.

241
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Now, we are all gathered...

242
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,070
...and those...

243
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,440
TRANSLATION FROM ROMANY:

244
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,800
Apologies, Mr Shelby,
I still don't speak the lingo.

245
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,920
Well, Finn here never even
bothered to learn it.

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,600
I heard "tachipen".

247
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,920
Truth. You said something
about the truth.

248
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,920
Truth. The truth is...

249
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,360
..I called men here
that I could trust...

250
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,560
..because I will be going away.

251
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,160
I have to collect payment
for a shipment of goods

252
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,040
which left Liverpool
ten days ago. Payment from who?

253
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
South Boston Irish, Finn.

254
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,400
Bootleggers.

255
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,560
Are you going alone?

256
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,440
Johnny Dogs has already sailed
for Canada.

257
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,560
Michael will be there.

258
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,280
Michael is family.

259
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,880
Michael will be my guarantee
of safety.

260
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
But while I'm away,
I have a job for you all.

261
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,760
I need you to go
to Arrow House.

262
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,880
I will be leaving Arrow House
for good,

263
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,520
and there are things
that need removing.

264
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,640
I need men that I can trust.

265
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,120
There is cash,
there is valuables.

266
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,520
There is information
about important people

267
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,480
that has more value than gold.

268
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,080
There are also bodies buried
in the grounds

269
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,560
which need digging up

270
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,800
before the contractors
start moving earth.

271
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Isiah, you will be in charge.

272
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,320
In Arrow House,
there is a wine cellar.

273
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,920
In that wine cellar,
there are fine French wines

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,120
that are worth more
than a man's life.

275
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
You are welcome to them, boys,
it'll be like a...

276
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
..be like a farewell party.

277
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,960
Are you ready for the party,
son?

278
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,680
Tachipen.
The fucking truth again.

279
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
What truth? You'll need shovels,
you'll need boxes,

280
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,360
and you'll take the bones
to Mr Patches

281
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,000
to put in the furnace
at Greenham's.

282
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,040
Got it?

283
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,880
Right. Any questions?

284
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,440
Yeah. If it's a party,
can we bring girls?

285
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,680
BILLY CHUCKLES

286
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,800
No, Billy. All the fun will be
laid on for you.

287
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,440
So, when is the party, Tom?

288
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,000
Mr Shelby.

289
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,920
Party's next Sunday, Billy.

290
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,520
You mean this Sunday?

291
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,360
Yeah.

292
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,480
And while you're
digging fucking holes,

293
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,440
I'll be here drinking
champagne with my wife.

294
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
It's our wedding anniversary.

295
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,840
Right.

296
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,840
Oh, and, Finn, by the way,

297
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,480
please explain to, erm,
what's her name?

298
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,360
Mary. Mary? Yes. Is it Mary?

299
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,040
Please explain to Mary
that you are a Shelby.

300
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,280
It says it here
on the back of your watch.

301
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,960
Have a look - Shelby. Look.

302
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,160
This means you own the watch,

303
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
the watch doesn't own you.

304
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,080
The clock strikes six
when you fucking tell it to.

305
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,760
Have a whiskey.

306
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,200
Enjoy the party, boys.

307
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,720
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

308
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,800
SHE SIGHS
Want a drink, baby?

309
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,160
No.

310
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,480
Drinking water like Tommy, huh?

311
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,080
Until this thing is done,
I need a clear head.

312
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,840
PHONE RINGS

313
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,320
Leave it.

314
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,760
Yeah?

315
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Good.

316
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,560
That's good.

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,080
Look, I've got to go.

318
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,480
Good news, Michael. Listen.

319
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,640
That was our informant
in Birmingham.

320
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,560
The Shelby men will all be together
on Sunday.

321
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,880
But Arthur will be having
dinner with his wife

322
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
at the bar
at the Garrison Tavern.

323
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,760
As I recall, the Shelby table is
right next to the windows, correct?

324
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,640
Every table's a Shelby table.
Yes, but...

325
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,200
...maybe our people
could just drive by and...

326
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,800
..shoot Arthur through the glass
without even getting out of the car.

327
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,480
Michael...

328
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,000
..we've talked about this -
there's no other choice.

329
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,640
This business is between me
and Tommy.

330
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,200
Yes, and when you kill Tommy,

331
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
Arthur will come after you.

332
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,880
He has to die too.

333
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,400
If Arthur's in a bar,
he'll be drunk.

334
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,200
Or worse.

335
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,600
At least he'll die without pain.

336
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,160
Who'll do the killing?

337
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,960
Tommy's working
with a faction of the IRA.

338
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,160
Connor has connections.

339
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,600
They made a deal.

340
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,280
A favour in return for guns.

341
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,280
But, Michael...

342
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,120
..whilst the assassin's
in this city...

343
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,600
..Tommy has a son.

344
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,160
He's a kid.

345
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,640
Kids grow up.

346
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,760
We don't kill women
and we don't kill kids.

347
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,960
The informant also mentioned
a new boy named Duke.

348
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,360
Do you want
a fucking bloodbath, Gina?

349
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
I know about the new boy.

350
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,360
I've decided that
the illegitimate son

351
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
is not a threat. My decision.

352
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,480
Only Arthur.

353
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,840
Michael, baby...

354
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
..everything's been agreed.

355
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,160
Everybody wants the same things.

356
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,320
How many men do you think they
killed with bullets and blades?

357
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,760
That's how Tommy became king.

358
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,680
And in three days' time,

359
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,680
that's how you will become king.

360
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,000
Deep down, Arthur and Tommy
want to be dead anyway.

361
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,520
On Sunday, we'll just...

362
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,200
..give them what they want.

363
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

364
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,680
DOOR OPENS

365
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,760
Oswald was called away.
He sent me instead.

366
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,120
Actually, that's not true.

367
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,360
I sent Oswald away
and elected myself

368
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,680
to be his representative.

369
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
What was it you wanted?

370
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm planning on bringing
my housing bill before Parliament.

371
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,960
You'll need to start drawing up
a list

372
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,760
of all your land-owning families
with gambling debts,

373
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,120
drug addictions, any other drain
on their resources.

374
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,120
I will deliver offers to buy
the surplus land

375
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,920
using Treasury bonds.

376
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,680
Thomas, why don't we fuck here,

377
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,200
on these benches?

378
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,640
Right now.

379
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
We wouldn't be the first.

380
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,760
I hear your wife left you.

381
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,880
Over the last few months, I've had
some associates of mine...

382
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
..break into
some of your pals' houses.

383
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,120
They stole paperwork.

384
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,120
Letters, bills,
bank statements...

385
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,240
Are you not upset?

386
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,480
This is a list
of all land-owning families

387
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,520
facing foreclosure.

388
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,680
HE SIGHS

389
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
And to answer your question...

390
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,360
No.

391
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,280
No, I'm not upset that
my wife left me.

392
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,800
And, yeah,
if you want to fuck, I'll fuck.

393
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,480
But you'll have to cross the floor

394
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,040
cos I refuse to fuck
on Tory benches.

395
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,360
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

396
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,160
Mr Shelby.

397
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,720
I was going to have
this delivered to you,

398
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,400
but I decided to bring it
in person.

399
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,320
It's an invitation
to mine and Diana's wedding.

400
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
It's in Berlin.

401
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,640
We're going to get married in
the presence of the Fuhrer himself.

402
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,320
Were you having fun?

403
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,760
Making paper aeroplanes.

404
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,680
I'm afraid, er...

405
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,720
..I have business.
I will be in Canada.

406
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,080
Pity.

407
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,200
Oh, and, er...

408
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,840
..the other reason I wanted
to bring this in person

409
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,960
was to tell you that,
after our wedding,

410
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,320
you must understand, Mr Shelby,

411
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,080
that if you so much as look
in my wife's direction,

412
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,080
I will have you killed.

413
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,360
Come, Diana.

414
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,160
Just think...

415
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,560
..very soon crumbling old
institutions like this one

416
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,080
will be swept away and become
a thing of ancient memory.

417
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,760
Fly safe.

418
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,120
HE EXHALES

419
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,480
Be careful with this baby.

420
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,840
You see any potholes,
you drive round them.

421
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,640
Mr Shelby called to say
to expect you.

422
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,360
Yeah, we've come to do
a bit of gardening.

423
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,840
We're hearing so many rumours about
what's happening to the house.

424
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,040
Tommy says your second best
quality after your baking is

425
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,720
you don't ask questions.

426
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,840
Get everybody away from
the house until Monday.

427
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,960
OK, let's find
these bottles of wine

428
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,080
worth more than a man's life.

429
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,920
There's only one guest here.

430
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,520
The rest of the rooms are free

431
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
if you want to use them
while you wait.

432
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,680
Our friend will be here
by the time it gets dark.

433
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,720
There was a storm last night.

434
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,040
Last of a hurricane.
Boats all came in.

435
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,360
He's not coming by boat,
he's coming by plane.

436
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,120
Then your friend is dead.

437
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,440
Wind was like...
HE WHISTLES

438
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,640
Maybe God's done your job
for you, Mickey.

439
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
My name is not fucking Mickey,

440
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,120
there is no fucking God,
and Tommy will be here.

441
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Another one.

442
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
THUNDER CRASHES

443
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,720
RATTLING AND CREAKING

444
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,080
POLLY: There will be a war...

445
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,240
..and one of you will die.

446
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,520
Which one I cannot tell.

447
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,480
NELSON:
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

448
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,800
Where the fuck were you?

449
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,360
She's gone Tommy. She's gone.

450
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,480
The devils who did this will pay,
Ruby.

451
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,520
Tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

452
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,280
CRASH

453
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,160
How long? Perhaps 18 months.

454
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,600
I will change.
And change for good.

455
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,800
What is this good
that you have become?

456
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,080
Kill...and kill.

457
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,240
CAR APPROACHES

458
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,240
DRUNKEN LAUGHTER

459
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,760
What's going on?

460
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,640
What the fuck is this?

461
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,760
I thought it was meant to be
a fucking party, lads.

462
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,200
It is now you're here.

463
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,040
Where's the...
Where's the fucking booze?

464
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,080
In the kitchen. All the booze
is in the kitchen.

465
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,320
All right.

466
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,400
God gives a man wealth,
possessions and honour,

467
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,960
but God steps in and says,

468
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,160
"No, this is grievous,
mindless evil!"

469
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,600
Where is he, Jeremiah?

470
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,840
In heaven, looking down.

471
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,800
God tells us that blood is given to
him from us.

472
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,800
Why don't you turn
the fucking lights on, eh?

473
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,800
Well, there's no longer
any power

474
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,440
in the house of Thomas Shelby.

475
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,200
Why not? What do you mean?
What happened?

476
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,520
I thought there were
going to be girls here.

477
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,160
Who need girls when you're in
a house bound for hell?

478
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,600
Fuck d'ya mean?

479
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,160
Hey. What the fuck do you mean?

480
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,720
GUN COCKS

481
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,560
Fuck!

482
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,040
Fuck!

483
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,600
We can do whatever we want
in this house.

484
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,480
It's got a death sentence.

485
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,040
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

486
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,600
HE EXHALES
I don't want a drink.

487
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,920
GLASS SMASHES

488
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,920
I want to go dig up
those fucking bodies, yeah?

489
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,480
Billy? Yeah? Got to wait until
all the bodies are buried

490
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,320
before you start digging them
back up.

491
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
What the fuck does that mean?

492
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm a fucking Shelby.

493
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,120
So am I.

494
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,240
He's here.

495
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,000
Step back and give me
a bit of light there, boys.

496
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,640
HE BREATHES DEEPLY

497
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,720
Charge is set to blow
in 30 minutes.

498
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
That's at exactly 16.20.

499
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,520
Everybody got that?

500
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,080
I'll do it.

501
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,320
This is between me and Tommy.

502
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,080
I'll do it with my own hand.

503
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,120
I'll come with you.

504
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,280
Yeah, don't slam any doors.

505
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,400
Easy.

506
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,160
It's just a pity
you didn't have the guts

507
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,840
to shoot him face to face.

508
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,480
My mother was a Gypsy.
She saw the future.

509
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,880
She always said
it won't be a bullet

510
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
that'll kill Tommy Shelby.

511
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,560
Hey, lads.

512
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,360
Over by the bridge.

513
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
Big, big fish.

514
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
Poisson. Grande.

515
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,280
Go on.

516
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,040
HE GASPS

517
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,880
Take the gun, Finn.

518
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,160
Arthur says if you don't do it,

519
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,520
then you can walk away
from this family for good.

520
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,720
What the fuck do you know
about family? You're not family!

521
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,160
You're the son
of a fucking whore!

522
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,160
Just take the gun and do it,
Finn.

523
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,600
Take the fucking gun.

524
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,080
Now you have the gun, Finn,
you have the gun.

525
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,120
Use it on these fucks!

526
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,600
GUN CLICKS

527
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,600
GUN CLICKS
Argh!

528
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,000
Charlie Strong told me,

529
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,600
"When you give Finn the gun,

530
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,480
"make sure the first two chambers
are empty."

531
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,120
HE CHUCKLES

532
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
Good old Uncle Charlie.

533
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,040
HE WHIMPERS

534
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,480
You are no longer a member
of this Shelby family.

535
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,960
By order of
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

536
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,000
I will come for you.

537
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,200
I will fucking come for you!

538
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
JEREMIAH PREACHES IN THE DISTANCE

539
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,840
..That find me faulting them

540
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,480
who govern like dogs in
Garrison Lane.

541
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,000
Hear this, then came
Jesus forth

542
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,200
wearing the crown of thorns

543
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,880
and the purple robe,

544
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,560
and Pilate said,
"Behold the man,

545
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
"he is the man."

546
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,600
Not the Peaky Blinders!

547
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,560
We see them in the automobiles,
with their whores and their...

548
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,000
PREACHING CONTINUES

549
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,200
WATCH TICKS

550
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,000
Hmm.

551
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,760
PHONE RINGS

552
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,400
DOOR OPENS

553
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,040
RINGING CONTINUES

554
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,360
GUN COCKS

555
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,120
Order your man to drop it.
Order him.

556
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,720
Empty the fucking gun.
Tell him.

557
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,560
You all right, Charlie?

558
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,120
All good here, Arthur.

559
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,240
Let's move.

560
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,240
Take you out to the street
cos I don't want to spoil my pub.

561
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,080
You'd shoot us like dogs?

562
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,120
No. I don't shoot dogs.
I shoot fucking fascists. Move.

563
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,880
GUNFIRE

564
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,360
Fuck! Fuck!

565
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,640
Fuck!

566
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,480
LAURA WHISTLES

567
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,400
Oh, Lord!

568
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,400
Time for the chosen one
to reveal himself.

569
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
BABY CRIES

570
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,440
CHILD: Let's go and see!

571
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,800
Kids, no, come here.
I said, come here!

572
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,280
What have I told you
about running off?

573
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,480
Don't pick up things. Don't.

574
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,880
Come here, come on.

575
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,120
Emily! Emily, come on.

576
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,320
If you get lost in the fog,
the Peaky Blinders will get you.

577
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,040
BABY CRIES

578
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,480
Jeremiah...

579
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,800
..let's charm the old keepsake
from Passchendaele.

580
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,600
Fuck!

581
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,240
Fuck!
SHE COUGHS AND WHEEZES

582
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,040
SHE COUGHS

583
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,280
COUGHING CONTINUES

584
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,960
Come here.

585
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,720
Shh...

586
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,480
SHE COUGHS

587
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,400
Breathe.

588
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,080
Her name was Elizabeth Gray.

589
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,480
She was my Aunt Polly.

590
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,200
SHE WHEEZES

591
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,760
My Aunt Polly.

592
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,680
Vengeance is for the Lord...

593
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,680
Not in Small Heath, it ain't.

594
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,120
Rest in peace, Pol.

595
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,120
Leave us, Uncle Charlie.

596
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,600
We're still in France.

597
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,360
OK.

598
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,200
I see him
coming out of the fog.

599
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,880
DOOR OPENS

600
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,880
How was the flight?

601
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,080
They say it's the future,
I'm not so sure.

602
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,640
Whiskey.

603
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,040
Hello, Michael.

604
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,080
Tommy.

605
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,080
Give me another.

606
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,720
We want you to take us to where the
opium is being stored.

607
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,640
And then we will provide you
with a banker's draft

608
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,840
for the full amount.

609
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,560
$5 million.

610
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,880
$5 million.

611
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,440
Let's go.

612
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,440
I'll go with Tommy.

613
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,200
You boys follow behind.

614
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,200
Ah, shit. Forgot my cigarettes.

615
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,560
Mum...

616
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,760
..it's done.

617
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,200
It's over.

618
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,120
And may God forgive me.

619
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,280
Johnny! Johnny, where are you?

620
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,280
I switched the ticker
like you said, Tom.

621
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,760
Tell me I've done
a good thing here, Tom.

622
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,240
Goodbye, Michael.

623
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,760
Goodbye, Johnny.

624
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
You're a good man.

625
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,760
I'm going to go look at the fog,
Tom.

626
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,200
Speak to me.

627
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,760
Speak to me, Michael.

628
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,280
You killed her. Polly made
her own choices, Michael.

629
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,880
No...

630
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,600
No-one close to you makes a choice
without your opinion, Tom.

631
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,200
Not Arthur,

632
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,280
not me, not Ada.

633
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,880
We can't escape you.

634
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,560
Your lethal hand is always
on our shoulders.

635
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,800
Polly was half of me.

636
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,120
Still visits me in my dreams.

637
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,120
She'll visit me no more.

638
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,280
I have no limitations.

639
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,880
I smell the smell
of roasting Irishmen.

640
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,080
Oh, yes, hello.

641
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,720
HE PLAYS PIANO KEYS
I also smell the smell of tobacco,

642
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,680
which is forbidden in my presence
for all except for one -

643
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,320
my new wife, Edna.

644
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,840
The Irish being rendered
to smoke and fat,

645
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,520
I now own half of Boston,

646
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,560
so, out of respect
for my restored authority...

647
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,760
..put the fucking cigarette
out now, Tommy.

648
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,320
Hello, Alfie.

649
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,840
I heard it was a good wedding.

650
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,040
Yeah, it was, actually.
Thank you.

651
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,520
Edna's from a family circus.

652
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,160
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

653
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,000
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants!

654
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,760
Yeah, it was quite a thing.

655
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,000
They had to shut down
Camden High Street,

656
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,280
and even the Gentile what normally
fucking hate me,

657
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,160
they waved with their hankies.

658
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,440
Justice.

659
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,960
And housekeeping. Long overdue.

660
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,760
Yeah, look at
that little cunt ascending,

661
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,240
he's ascending to the heavens!

662
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,680
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

663
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,880
I can see with this eye.
I'm not blind.

664
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,160
This eye is the eye
of a dead man.

665
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,960
Dead men can see through life
like it was a curtain

666
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,480
that billows with the flicker
of truth upon it.

667
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,760
And I can see with this eye,
Tommy,

668
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,000
that your nephew is ascending,
and he will be forgiven.

669
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,640
Unlike you,

670
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,880
who, on Judgment Day,

671
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,840
is probably truly fucked when the
other shoe drops.

672
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,360
Hmm?

673
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,120
All right, Tommy?
How are you keeping?

674
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,680
You know, Alfie...

675
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,600
..so many people,

676
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,760
so many times

677
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,760
going to so much trouble
to kill me.

678
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,360
I'm fucking dying anyway.

679
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,280
We're all dying anyway.

680
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,560
No.

681
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,720
Not a bullet, not a bomb,

682
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,720
not a knife.

683
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,000
Is it clap? Is it clap?

684
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,800
No, not even that noble.

685
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,880
What are you trying to say?

686
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,040
I'm about to sign over
half of fucking Camden Town

687
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,480
to you as part of this deal.

688
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,280
Are you saying you're
just going to die in your bed?

689
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,200
I'm not going to die in bed, Alfie.
Who fucking dies in bed?

690
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,000
Good people die in their bed,
Tommy. Good people.

691
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,560
Good people, eh? Hmm.

692
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,560
Good people.

693
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,440
And yet here we are, Alfie,

694
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,800
after all this time,
just you and me.

695
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,760
And I crossed the line.

696
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,320
Michael.

697
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,520
Polly.

698
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,520
Ruby.

699
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:18,280
Tommy, if you are about
to express profound emotion,

700
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,080
you might be better served
expressing it

701
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,720
to someone
who gives a fuck,

702
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,960
or perhaps to somebody
who is being paid

703
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,920
to pretend to have to.

704
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,200
Like a fucking nurse.
Or a priest! Someone.

705
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,680
And as for death,

706
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,120
speaking as someone
who has been dead

707
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,360
for a number of years,

708
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,800
I can only
heartily recommend it.

709
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,280
Well, Alfie,
your opera is complete.

710
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,280
Shall we go
and witness the final act?

711
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,400
Whenever you're ready, boys.

712
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,040
That's enough.

713
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,880
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

714
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,680
Thank you all for coming.

715
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,120
Well, at least
I can say that, er...

716
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,800
..I am one of those rare politicians

717
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
who actually makes good
on his promises.

718
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,400
Country estate -

719
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,720
requisitioned to make way
for houses for working people.

720
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,880
I improved my own home
with good intentions

721
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,560
and 1,500lb of dynamite.

722
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,040
Now I'm back where we began...

723
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,400
..with horses and caravans...

724
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,800
..vagabonds and thieves.

725
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,400
Frances, sit down, please.

726
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,840
I'd like to raise a toast.

727
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,200
A simple toast.

728
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,920
To family.

729
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,640
To family. To family.

730
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,960
Sometimes it is shelter
from the storm.

731
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,280
Sometimes it is
the storm itself.

732
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,320
I'm planning on going away
for a bit.

733
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,080
After I'm gone...

734
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,720
Ada...

735
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,160
..in this family...

736
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,880
..it was you who was born
to be a politician, not me.

737
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,960
Remember that.

738
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,880
And if ever a seat
is to become available

739
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,320
in this ugly old city,
you should run.

740
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,840
SHE LAUGHS

741
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,920
Where's Arthur?

742
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,240
He went for a walk
down the river.

743
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,520
He said he's not good
at farewells

744
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,120
so he's decided to
go catch a trout instead.

745
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,680
He told me to tell you that...

746
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,560
"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be...

747
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,360
"..very soon. Love, Arthur."

748
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,520
How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?

749
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,680
You watch him, Linda.

750
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,680
You love him.

751
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,760
Charles, I want you
to look after your mum.

752
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,040
You tell her I'm sorry,
you hear me?

753
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,960
I want you to be the bes...

754
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,760
Exactly how long
are you going away for, Tommy?

755
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,840
Thanks, Curly.

756
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,040
HE WHISPERS

757
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,800
Tom, the horse.

758
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,520
Shut up, Curly.

759
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,120
Is she hitched, Johnny?

760
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,240
Tommy, you tell me right now,
where are you going?

761
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,160
You have to carry the bucket
on your own this time, Ada.

762
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,040
Tommy, you come to me
with everything.

763
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,440
You always come to me. Not this
time. Not this one, sister.

764
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,640
What the fuck does that mean?
Where are you going?

765
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,320
Tommy!

766
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,040
# My eyes are open wide

767
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,360

01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,920

781
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,280
# Beginning

01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,960
Dad, it's me.

823
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,640
Did Polly send you?

824
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,880
Did Polly send you?

825
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,280
Or am I dead already?

826
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,640
No.

827
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,240
You're not dead.

828
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,440
You're not even sick.

829
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,000
But I am, my darling.

830
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,360
I'm sick.

831
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,920
Sick like you was.

832
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,120
No. Not true.

833
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,000
I know it.
You've got to live, Daddy.

834
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,800
You let the fire go out.

835
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,440
Light the fire again
and get warm,

836
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,680
and you will see
that you must live.

837
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,600
You're not even sick, Daddy.

838
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,720
HORSE WHINNIES

839
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
TOILET FLUSHES

840
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,240
Fucking Gypsies.

841
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,600
Have you thrown the tinkers off
the top field yet?

842
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,480
Well, I went up to the caravan,
sir, but there was no-one there.

843
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,000
Well, go back up there
and set fire to the fucking thing.

844
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,040
Yes, sir.

845
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,600
Have you filled the car
with petrol?

846
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,880
I said, have you filled the car up
with petrol?

847
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,360
How was the wedding in Berlin?

848
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,520
I hear Chancellor Hitler
himself was the best man.

849
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,240
You've been my doctor now
for three years.

850
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,320
Never knew you were
so well connected.

851
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,760
Oh, and the doctor
at St Thomas's

852
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,840
who you sent me to
for the second opinion,

853
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,880
second set of X-rays?

854
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,520
A maid of honour
at the same wedding.

855
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,520
All so very well fucking
connected.

856
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,400
On your knees, Holford.

857
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,960
I'm guessing you people
all decided

858
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,320
that the only person

859
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,640
who could ever kill
Tommy Shelby

860
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,640
is Tommy Shelby himself.

861
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,080
You made me believe
death was coming.

862
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,680
Let my nature do the rest, eh?

863
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,200
You may not have tuberculoma,
Mr Shelby,

864
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,920
but you are sick.

865
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,640
I know you.

866
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,880
You are sick with guilt.

867
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,640
Sick of death at your own hand.

868
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,880
Sick of who you were.

869
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,440
You are no longer
the kind of man

870
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,920
who would kill another man
in cold blood.

871
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,880
Tommy, you have been
on a journey

872
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,480
from the backstreets
to the corridors of power.

873
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,640
You cannot go back.

874
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,920
You are a different man.

875
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,000
The gun no longer belongs
in your hand.

876
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,200
Oh, but I am back.

877
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,600
Back from under the ground.

878
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,480
Close your eyes.

879
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,480
SOFTLY: Close your eyes.

880
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,520
CLOCK BELL CHIMES

881
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,880
WATCH TICKS

882
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,520
The eleventh hour.

883
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,000
Armistice.

884
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,040
Peace at last.

885
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,120
Peace at last.

886
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,560
HOLFORD SCREAMS

887
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:36,120
# All the tired horses in the sun

888
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:41,800
# How am I supposed to get
any riding done?

889
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,280

890
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:04,280

891
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:19,760

897
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,960

898
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:23,400
# How am I supposed to get

899
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:37,000
# All the tired horses in the sun

900
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,800

901
