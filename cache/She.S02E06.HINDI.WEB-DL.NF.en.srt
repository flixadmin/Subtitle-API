1
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,320
Two of my informers reported that
the police have beefed up the security.

2
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,480
One at the airport and the other at...

3
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
<i>By the time I got the information,
it was too late.</i>

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,080
Clear this space.

5
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
-Move to the next location.
-Okay, brother.

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,080
Come on! Move! Move!

7
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,880
How's Rupa?

8
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,040
Alright.

9
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,320
You said two weeks, right?

10
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,480
It's just been a day.

11
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,520
Why the blindfold?

12
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
Are you planning something special?

13
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,560
I thought you wouldn't
insult me by asking me why.

14
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,040
Why?

15
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,480
I told you about the airline staff.

16
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,880
ACP Fernandez's
special operations police team

17
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,160
is questioning the staff
at the airport right now.

18
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,400
The double-life I'm living...

19
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,040
do you have any idea how difficult it is?

20
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,440
I feel like I'm walking on a knife's edge
every single second of my life.

21
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,960
You're just "Nayak"!

22
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
You don't need to be anybody else.

23
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,640
Keeping up the act, keeping secrets,

24
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,120
remembering what's supposed
to be a secret and what's not.

25
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
One wrong word...

26
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,560
and I'll be done!

27
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
You think I betrayed you.

28
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Maybe.

29
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,840
But that man...

30
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,280
your man...

31
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
the airline guy...

32
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,160
he's living the same double-life, right?

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Why can't he be the rat?

34
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
But you're sure that it's me.

35
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,320
Alright.

36
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,200
Punish me.

37
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Come on, punish me.

38
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,240
You're playing me?

39
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,960
And I'm getting played.

40
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,760
-Your department?
-Ground staff.

41
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,560
Here's the muster for 5th April.

42
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
The in and out timings of all the
employees have been recorded.

43
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,000
-Is anyone missing?
-No.

44
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,200
-Check the CCTV footage.
-Sure.

45
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,440
Give me your phone.

46
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,320
Should I check the footage?

47
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
Sure. Go on.

48
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
-Check it again.
<i>-I've double-checked it, sir.</i>

49
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,760
We've found nothing suspicious.

50
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,480
Beef up the security...

51
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
{\an8}...at all places.

52
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,440
Nayakudu...

53
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,320
I'm sorry to say,

54
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,640
but we shouldn't trust Bhumi.

55
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,080
You told me that you
wanted to be on my side.

56
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,480
You had sex with me...

57
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,680
to save your life.

58
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
I get that.

59
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,360
But why would you risk
your life to be with me?

60
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,920
Double-life?

61
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Betraying the police?

62
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,720
Giving up...

63
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
your old life in a heartbeat?

64
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,560
One day is all it took
to "fall in love" with me?

65
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,000
I won't explain myself, Nayak.

66
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,840
You're a sharp man.

67
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,760
Really smart.

68
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,280
But you're not a woman.

69
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
A woman who's lived
all her life thinking that...

70
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,360
she's not good enough for any man.

71
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,520
She's a "cold hag".

72
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,560
She's dull in bed!

73
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Who's been told all her life that...

74
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,280
"You're a man!"

75
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,000
"Shoving it in you
doesn't give me pleasure either!"

76
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,640
And who has believed that it's all true.

77
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,440
Then I meet a man.

78
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,760
I touch him.

79
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
He likes it.

80
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,840
He wants to have sex with me!

81
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,960
He does have sex with me!

82
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,840
Not with himself!

83
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,160
He holds me...

84
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,760
with love!

85
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,200
All this love...

86
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,880
for me!

87
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,200
I would be a slave to a man like that
for the rest of my life!

88
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,080
But you won't get it.

89
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
And I'm not gonna bother explaining.

90
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,520
What am I becoming, Nayak?

91
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,960
I have no control...
over myself, over my life!

92
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,840
Who am I?

93
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,240
<i>What happened, Fernandez?</i>

94
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,240
We've found nothing at the airport, sir.

95
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,560
But Bhumi had confirmed that
the airline staff was involved, right?

96
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,840
Yes, at my home!

97
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,520
At 4:30 a.m.

98
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,840
I've left my phone at the hotel, sir.

99
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,760
I want to talk to you.

100
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
They have an informer
in the airline staff.

101
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,680
He was the one who
informed the Nayak syndicate...

102
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,000
that we were gonna
check the cabin baggage.

103
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,480
She seemed really sure, sir.

104
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,880
How could it be wrong?

105
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,960
What about the other leads she gave you?

106
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,440
First, they gave me a number.

107
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,120
Phone number.

108
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,000
Use it for coordination.
They'll answer all your questions.

109
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,600
This one.

110
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm told to be in touch with this number.

111
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm connected to the whole
drug supply network in Mumbai.

112
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,680
I've sent names and numbers
of a few girls on this number

113
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,200
to expand their network.

114
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,120
There's only one way I can
connect to this number.

115
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,080
I send a text between 4:00 to 4:30 p.m.

116
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,360
And I get a reply in exactly 15 minutes.

117
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,240
And in those 15 minutes...

118
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,720
the whole chain is completed.

119
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,400
And the syndicate is informed.

120
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,640
And thirdly,

121
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
the final date of this operation.

122
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,360
Their operation style
could be cyclical, sir.

123
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,720
That's exactly what it was in Karwar.

124
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,720
There are particular dates in every cycle.

125
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,440
The movement happens
only on these dates, sir.

126
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,880
And there's one more
date left in the current cycle.

127
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,560
What's the date?

128
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,960
I don't know the date, sir.

129
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,160
But I know that the
date's really important.

130
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,520
Most of their work happens online.

131
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,480
But every member in the network
will be on the move on that date.

132
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,000
And his whole network will be exposed.

133
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
And his whole drug business will be set.

134
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,920
The syndicate will be
vulnerable on that one date!

135
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Absolutely!

136
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,040
This might be our last opportunity
to catch them red-handed.

137
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Anything else?

138
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,680
Anything else?

139
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,440
<i>She's telling us the truth, sir.</i>

140
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,720
But my instinct says she
isn't telling us the whole truth.

141
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
Call me back soon.

142
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,480
Before you leave.

143
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,560
I want as much time as I can get.

144
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,880
What's wrong?

145
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Sir, there's a mole in your team.

146
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
He's giving him all the information.

147
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,560
I told you about his airline informer.

148
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,280
How did he find out?

149
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,880
That's impossible, Bhumi.

150
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,680
You know I personally choose
every single person on my team, right?

151
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,080
I trust them, there's no
scope of them betraying me!

152
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm the one who's risking my life, sir!

153
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,120
I'm the one who has to live with him.

154
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,320
I don't care who you trust.

155
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,040
You're the only one I trust.

156
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,400
And you should do the same, sir.

157
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,000
Sir, did you tell this to anyone else?

158
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,960
The syndicate gave her his number?

159
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,440
Keep watching, Kamble.

160
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
<i>Copy.</i>

161
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,880
<i>You text him?</i>

162
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,960
I think he's illiterate.

163
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,160
I don't think this is the guy.

164
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,760
Sir, it's 4:00 p.m.
I need to send the text.

165
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
He's on the move.

166
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,640
Copy.

167
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
{\an8}<i>I should get a reply in 15 minutes.</i>

168
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,440
It goes to me as well as
the other syndicate members.

169
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,120
If I don't get a reply in 15 minutes,
it means that something's wrong.

170
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
Okay.

171
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,320
We'll try it again tomorrow.

172
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,080
And if the pattern is repeated,

173
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
then we strike.

174
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,360
<i>I'm gonna drizzle my love...</i>

175
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
So, how's Whore Inc. doing?

176
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
Stay out of it, alright?

177
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,440
It's really filthy.

178
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,840
You cheat on your wife by sleeping
with me in the name of protection costs.

179
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,520
Isn't that filthy?

180
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,480
Look, Yasmin.

181
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,880
People like you and me...

182
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,520
our lives aren't black or white.

183
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
We're somewhere in the middle.

184
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,760
But the whole drugs business...

185
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
it's the scum of the earth.

186
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,800
Everyone who gets involved ends up dead.

187
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,480
Bhonsle...

188
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,080
how can I end up dead
if I have you with me?

189
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,720
-Right?
-Me?

190
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,200
You'll protect me, right?

191
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,680
You want me to join Whore Inc.?

192
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,640
Why not?

193
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,120
I'm saying it for your own sake.

194
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,600
What the hell is going on?

195
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,120
A whore's threatening me?

196
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,200
"For my own sake"?

197
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,160
How the mighty have fallen, Mr. Bhonsle!

198
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,480
What are you doing?
Listen to me. Bhonsle!

199
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,800
Bhonsle, come here.

200
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
So, you whores have
really made it big, huh?

201
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,640
Where are you going?

202
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,680
Every bloody pig's telling me...

203
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,040
"Bhonsle, ignore Whore Inc.
Look away! Look away!"

204
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
They're all pressuring me to look away.

205
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,640
I think I should take a peek.

206
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
And I will take a peek.

207
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,040
Bhonsle...

208
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,640
if you do that... you and I are done.

209
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Alright?

210
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,840
Get lost!

211
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,120
There's no dearth of prostitutes.

212
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,240
I'll find another!

213
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,800
-Bhonsle!
-Get lost!

214
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,000
Stop.

215
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,720
What's going on, Bhonsle sir?

216
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm told you're hanging out with
senior call girls these days?

217
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,520
What's so funny?

218
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,520
Every man has different interests.

219
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,760
He's interested in the seniors.

220
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,240
Oh, come on.

221
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,920
Don't mind me, Bhonsle.

222
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,600
We're just kidding.

223
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,120
Why would Bhonsle mind?

224
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,480
Bhonsle is just a dumbfuck!

225
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,480
-He drinks and he sobs like a weakling!
-Hey!

226
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,480
Fuck Bhonsle up his ass!

227
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
-Hey!
-Come on.

228
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,320
What's wrong with him?

229
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm not gonna spare those whores!

230
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
I'm gonna screw them!

231
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,960
Please use a condom, alright?

232
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,360
Yeah.

233
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,560
This is what I deserve.

234
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,480
Kanitkar sir insulted
me the other day as well...

235
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,840
in front of those whores...

236
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
in the bloody police station.

237
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,600
Of course!

238
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,680
If you poke your nose where it
doesn't belong, it will be chopped off!

239
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,840
Because there are
bigger powers at play here.

240
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,080
What are you gonna do?!

241
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,800
Look, Bhonsle, only bark at a person
who's scared of getting bitten.

242
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,160
Are you getting me?
Otherwise, just keep a low profile.

243
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
Am I right? Of course!

244
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,800
-Give it to sir.
-What's "Sir"?

245
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,800
Hey, take the premium stuff away.

246
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,600
I'll have the bloody country liquor.

247
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,320
I don't deserve this premium whiskey.

248
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,720
-I'm a bloody cockroach!
-Drink up, buddy!

249
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
No, stop! I'm just a bloody cockroach!

250
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,280
"Bloody! Bloody!"
Just take a bloody sip!

251
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,000
-Come on!
-Drink up, Bhonsle. Come on.

252
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Open up!

253
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,560
Yasmin!

254
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,520
Open the door!

255
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,080
Pooja Jadhav. Seven packets.

256
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Ma'am...

257
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,600
Bhonsle's here.

258
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,520
Hey!

259
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,480
The door's closed. Can't you see that?

260
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,880
-Who's in there?
-Why?

261
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,000
What do you want?

262
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,800
You bitches love humiliating me, right?

263
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,960
Hey!

264
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,960
Go away or these bitches
are gonna give you stitches!

265
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,560
-Get out! Leave!
-Don't touch me.

266
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm here to make you an offer.

267
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,200
Why? Aren't you done humiliating me?

268
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
You've shown me that
I'm just a bloody cockroach.

269
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,880
Why would you make me an offer?

270
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,560
Because you're right.

271
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,160
You're a cockroach.

272
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,320
And cockroaches can go to
places that elephants can't.

273
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,040
The whole system...

274
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,720
every drain, every gutter,

275
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,800
how to maneuver it,

276
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,000
you know it.

277
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,160
Because you're a cockroach.

278
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
And we need you.

279
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,080
She's leaving.

280
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,840
Let her go. Don't look.

281
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,800
-Oh, God!
-Speak up!

282
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,960
-What?
-Who's sent you?

283
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,440
Tell me!

284
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm letting you go right now.

285
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,960
But if I see you again...

286
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,440
I'll blow your brains out!

287
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,480
Stay away from me.

288
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Are you alright?

289
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,680
I can save you.

290
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Really?

291
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,360
Do it.

292
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,000
Look...

293
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,800
we know who has pitted
us against each other.

294
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Who?

295
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,920
We have nothing against each other.

296
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,040
If we had met under
different circumstances...

297
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,840
we could've been friends.

298
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,800
I won't touch you.

299
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,840
But you'll have to stop
obsessing about revenge.

300
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,560
I don't care if I die,
I'm gonna get my revenge!

301
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,800
That asshole, Nayak...

302
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
he made me a widow.

303
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,040
I will exact revenge...

304
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,360
not on you.

305
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,600
I'm talking about that asshole Nayak.

306
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Tell me something.

307
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Is Nayak one man or is it a group?

308
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,280
Bitch.

309
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,560
You've slept with him
and you have no clue?

310
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,360
Did you sleep with one man or many?

311
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,360
Do you really want me to give you a count?

312
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,720
So, you're saying...

313
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
it's a group?

314
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,360
That's what they say.

315
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,680
I used to think it was one man as well.

316
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,080
And I get my commands on the phone.

317
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,440
Listen...

318
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,880
I won't tell anyone about you.

319
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,680
Otherwise, you know...

320
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,120
Get some rest.

321
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,680
<i>The bitch is tough.</i>

322
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,480
<i>Great actress.</i>

323
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,920
"I used to think it was one man as well."

324
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,040
Was she lying?

325
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,680
I have no idea how
these perverts live their lives.

326
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,720
-What should we do?
-What can you do?

327
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,000
-Keep following her.
-But Nayak's one man, right?

328
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,480
He has to be!

329
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,520
How many men am I gonna kill?

330
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,560
<i>-Chembur?
-Okay.</i>

331
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,400
-And Mahim?
-That's in control as well.

332
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,040
Ma'am!

333
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,160
-Well...
-Good morning, ma'am.

334
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,200
I'm from the office of the
Municipal Commissioner.

335
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,360
Hey, move.

336
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
Please have a seat, sir.

337
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,760
Have you lost it?

338
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,520
Keep me away from
public officials, alright?

339
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,720
Your request has been sanctioned.

340
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,720
We've received an order from the ministry.

341
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,440
We need you to sign some papers
and the lease can be finalized.

342
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,880
You can go and see the
building anytime you want.

343
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,400
What building?

344
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,000
The building for your social organization.

345
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,800
Women Welfare Organization?

346
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,440
The building for your NGO.

347
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,520
-You have an order from the ministry?
-Yes, we got it today.

348
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,080
You see, these are old
buildings tied up in litigation.

349
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,200
These can be leased
out to social organizations

350
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,360
only after the ministry clears them.

351
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,280
Please sign these.

352
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,880
Can we see the building today?

353
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,400
Of course.

354
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,080
There you go.

355
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,520
That's your building.

356
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,720
Please come.

357
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,280
Wow!

358
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,000
-There's more!
-This is awesome!

359
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,520
-This is huge!
-Come on!

360
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,680
This a sprawling mansion!

361
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,680
-Look at that...
-Hey, Tipu!

362
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,200
Hey, Mary!

363
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,200
Fort! It's a bloody fort!

364
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,960
We can have a whole army!

365
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,720
-This will be our office, right?
-Hey!

366
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,600
We can live here as well!

367
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,840
Do you think...

368
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,320
I can't handle it myself?

369
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,400
<i>-You can.</i>
-Then why are you helping me?

370
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
Getting the girls out of jail?

371
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,320
And this social welfare building?

372
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,280
<i>It was just a gift.</i>

373
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,240
<i>I won't help you anymore.</i>

374
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,280
<i>You don't need it either.</i>

375
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,480
But what am I gonna do
with that huge building?

376
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,280
<i>That building will be
too small for you soon.</i>

377
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,080
<i>You have no idea...</i>

378
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,560
<i>what you've become.</i>

379
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,560
<i>And where you're heading.</i>

380
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,120
I've received a text from Nayak.

381
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,920
He wants to see me immediately.

382
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,880
-I think something's wrong.
-Why?

383
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,120
Sir, he suspects my motives!

384
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,600
They suspect my motives.

385
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,520
And his mole must've informed him.

386
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,240
What should we do?

387
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,480
I'll have to go.

388
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,720
And I need to send the text
between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m.

389
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,280
Okay.

390
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,880
I'll go.

391
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
It's me.

392
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,440
Did you send the text?

393
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,600
Yes.

394
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,160
I'll get a notification in 15 minutes...

395
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,520
if no one messes up.

396
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,720
We don't have much time then.

397
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,200
Leena, inform the second unit.

398
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,400
Take position.

399
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,360
<i>On mark.</i>

400
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,800
Look properly.

401
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,000
-Hey, what's happening?!
-Down! Get down!

402
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,120
Hey!

403
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,960
-Stay down!
-We've got him, sir.

404
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,000
We have three minutes
to send the notification.

405
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,600
Is the cybercrime team working on it?

406
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,080
-How do you send the notification?
-I don't know, sir.

407
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,200
I have no clue...

408
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,160
Tell me how you send the notification.

409
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,680
Sir, my parents have no idea I do this.

410
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Please, it'll ruin my life!

411
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,960
How do you send the notification?!

412
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,240
-What's happening, Kamble?
<i>-The boy's nervous, sir.</i>

413
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,600
He isn't thinking straight.

414
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,240
Slap him into thinking straight.

415
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,560
Check the message history on the darknet.

416
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,920
Check yesterday's messages.

417
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,320
-It's been cleared, sir.
-We're out of time, goddamn it!

418
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,520
<i>Message sent, sir.</i>

419
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,720
Nayak syndicate handles all
its dealings through the darknet.

420
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,680
Every link in the network has a unique ID,

421
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,720
that they use to
communicate with each other.

422
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,240
<i>These operators handle all the
communication that happens on the darknet.</i>

423
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,640
<i>Just like the one we've caught.</i>

424
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,520
You mean there could be more
such operators in Nayak's network?

425
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,520
Highly possible.

426
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,200
My God!

427
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,320
Did you give some
information to the police team?

428
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,960
About a suspicious workshop?

429
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,840
Yeah, I mean, Fernandez sir
keeps questioning me.

430
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,720
I gave him a bait to
get myself off the hook.

431
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,960
I told him, "Maybe there's a workshop."

432
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,360
Alibaug, right?

433
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,160
Kihim.

434
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,240
Kihim, Alibaug...

435
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
same.

436
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,720
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

437
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,760
What's going on?

438
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,920
-Check it.
-Sir, my phone...

439
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,160
Sit down, Karmarkar.

440
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,240
Sit down, guys.

441
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,880
Sir, there's a mole in your team.

442
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,560
Bhumi had told you guys
about a suspicious workshop.

443
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,160
Nayak syndicate has a workshop...
in Palghar.

444
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,160
I overheard them.
They were talking about...

445
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,920
a workshop in Khandala.

446
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,040
Where?

447
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Kihim.

448
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,520
Alibaug.

449
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,080
Sir, I had given everyone
a different location.

450
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,480
And I had told Karmarkar about Kihim.

451
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,160
Do you want me to check the footage?

452
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,640
We need to keep it a secret.

453
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,840
The Nayak syndicate shouldn't
find out that we've caught him.

454
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
What if...

455
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,600
Karmarkar tells them himself?

456
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,000
He's the first guy they'll kill.

457
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,080
I feel like such a fool here.

458
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,080
I've never chosen the wrong
man in my life, Karmarkar!

459
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,800
You didn't select the wrong guy, sir.

460
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,520
But I'm not lucky like the other officers.

461
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,720
I have an eight-year-old son.

462
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,040
They kidnapped him.

463
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,640
<i>I did what I had to.</i>

464
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,560
We'll deal with this later.

465
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,040
Karmarkar is out of the operation.

466
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,040
No one's gonna give him any information.

467
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,800
And no one outside this room should
know about this new development.

468
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,040
-Sir!
-It's alright.

469
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,600
Sit.

470
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,240
Thank you.

471
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,400
So, how's it going?

472
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,920
It's the same, sir.

473
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,120
You tell me.

474
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,520
How is Commissioner Bhat feeling?

475
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,960
I could be transferred.

476
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,920
What?

477
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,960
They need a scapegoat.

478
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,680
And you know how bad
our reputation is right now.

479
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,960
The media is useless, sir.

480
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,560
They have no clue about the
size of this drug operation, sir!

481
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,200
But now we're making some progress, sir.

482
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,600
But not fast enough, I guess.

483
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,360
These things take time, I understand.

484
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,120
Sir, we're close to exposing
Nayak syndicate's entire operation soon.

485
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,480
We don't have the date, Fernandez.

486
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,480
This information is
useless without the date.

487
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,800
I need the Karwar files again.

488
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,720
All the links of the syndicate
seem to know about the date.

489
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,880
But no one's mentioning
it on the darknet.

490
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,400
Get me all the statistics we have!

491
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,200
Air, land, sea, check posts,
get me everything!

492
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,600
Any headway on the date?

493
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,840
Not yet, sir.

494
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,160
<i>Sir, it's like this.</i>

495
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,920
Day one, drug movement.

496
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,080
Day two, drug movement.

497
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,320
Day three, drug movement.

498
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,480
Day four, nothing.

499
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,720
Day five, drug movement.

500
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,560
Day six, seven, nothing.

501
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,960
-Day eight...
-Nambiar! Nambiar!

502
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,000
Sir, Fibonacci series, sir!

503
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,760
Sir, zero, one, one, two,

504
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,720
two plus one, three,

505
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,720
three plus two, five,

506
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,720
five plus three, eight,

507
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,160
eight plus five, thirteen!

508
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,720
Sir, this is the working
pattern of the syndicate, sir.

509
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,280
So, what you're saying is...

510
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,160
on the first, second...

511
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,680
third, and fifth, we have a
record of syndicate's movements?

512
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,600
-Yes, sir, this is the pattern!
-No!

513
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,280
There was no drug movement
on the first and the second.

514
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,240
But that's the pattern, sir!

515
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,480
They followed the same pattern in Karwar!

516
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,880
There's no date.

517
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,960
We need the date, Nambiar!

518
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,760
Poor girl, she was born on the
thirteenth day of the lunar calendar.

519
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,160
The moon's position in her
birth chart isn't auspicious.

520
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,240
Do you really believe these
charts about the sun and the moon?

521
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,880
Don't underestimate the moon.
It's really powerful.

522
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,040
Moon!

523
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,360
-The moon!
-Dear?

524
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,760
Dear, what's wrong?

525
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,000
Sir!

526
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,240
He's back!

527
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,120
And he's got some
calendars with him this time!

528
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,080
We got distracted by the sun, sir.

529
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,480
The Fibonacci series is the right pattern!

530
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,200
But they aren't using the solar calendar!

531
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,160
Lunar!

532
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,920
He switched to the lunar
calendar based on the moon.

533
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,960
Sir, solar is western, sir.

534
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,520
The Indian calendar is the lunar calendar.

535
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,880
-Telugu calendar.
-Okay.

536
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,040
Now you see.

537
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,200
Day one.

538
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,160
Day two.

539
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,160
Day three.

540
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
Day five.

541
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,200
Day eight.

542
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,280
Day thirteen.

543
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,600
30th August!

544
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,560
There's been no movement
after 30th August!

545
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,320
That's right, sir.

546
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,240
So, what's left?

547
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,320
Day 21, day 34, etc.

548
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,360
But day 34 etc., won't be possible because
there are just 28 days in the lunar cycle.

549
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,520
So, one day left, sir.

550
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Day 21.

551
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,440
September 7th?

552
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,720
Precisely!

553
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,680
We've got the date, sir!

554
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,680
<i>7th September.</i>

555
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,440
<i>Five days to go.</i>

556
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,600
Just five days to go, Bhumi.

557
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,560
And then, one way or the other,

558
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,200
we'll close Nayak's chapter forever!

559
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,960
<i>Do you like the sun...</i>

560
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,160
<i>or the moon?</i>

561
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,440
I've never thought about it.

562
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,360
I like the moon.

563
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,040
Me too.
