- reached the mainland.
- Reunification isn't happening.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,394
No action until the government

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,994
can determine if Gotham's safe.

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,756

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,792
What the hell are you doing?!

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,191
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,312
- Her name is Ivy.
- She's a witch.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,718
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,115
It consumes them,

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,590
and then it flourishes.

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,056
We wouldn't have escaped
without you.

16
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
You saved me

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>and my friends.</i>

18
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:36,121
I wanted to help.

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,639
- Come with us.
- Are you telling me

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
you found a way out of Gotham?

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,190
It's a submarine.

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,555
I've been giving you space,

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,296
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,536
I'm gonna be a part
of this kid's life.

25
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,870
- Oh, you seem pretty confident about that.
- I am.

26
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,872
You're having a baby
with Barbara.

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,958
Can't change the past, so...

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,560
I guess we just have
to live with it.

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,834
(indistinct chatter)

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,999
Come on, people!

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,480
Time's a-wastin'!

32
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,000
The filtration system that
Lucius designed is working.

33
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,880
What you're doing is both
unnecessary and it's reckless.

34
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,839
Our supplies of drinking water
are at critical levels.

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,759
Every day, the gangs
grow more aggressive.

36
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,151
If I can get a cease-fire,
even a temporary one,

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,317
then when reunification
does happen,

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
at least there will be people
left to save.

39
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,595
They deserve that much.

40
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,399
And does your child
deserve a father?

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
You have no problem taking
care of the entire city.

42
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,432
What about focusing
on just one life?

43
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,960
<i>(sighs) Why are you
always so ready</i>

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,434
<i>to put yourself
in the crosshairs?</i>

45
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,599
It's like you won't be satisfied
until you sacrifice yourself.

46
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
You really believe that?

47
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,399
<i>I do.</i>

48
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,880
And it scares me.

49
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
How is this gonna work?

50
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,794
Am I supposed
to just stay at home

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,434
and raise this child
with Barbara

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,910
while you go cowboying off
all the time?

53
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,560
It won't always be like this.

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
After reunification...

55
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,355
Nothing will be different.

56
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,875
Unless you stop being...

57
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Me?

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
BULLOCK:
<i>Hey, Jim.</i>

59
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,350

I have to go.

60
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,791

- If there is an after.

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,438
- (shouting)
- (chainsaw buzzing)

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,839
Oh, yeah?! Oh-ho!

63
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,557
Oswald, where
the hell is Nygma?

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,393
Shouldn't we have left the city
already?

65
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Ms. Kean,

66
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,513
this may come as a surprise,

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,871
but building a submarine
from scratch

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,952
by yourself takes time.

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,753
- Patience.
- Easy for you to say.

70
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,593
You're not
a walking egg timer.

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,400
Tell him to get
a move on.

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
And why, exactly,

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,117
are you hosting Gordon's
gangland get-together?

74
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,919
Keep your friends close and
your enemies closer, my dear.

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,880
If we're really going
to leave Gotham,

76
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,314
we need to keep Gordon happy.

77
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,352
You know all about
that, don't you?

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,399
It was a momentary slip.

79
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,320
The world was on fire.

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
(loud thump)

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,558

<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

85
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,113
I'll make this short.

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,434
Gotham is running dry.

87
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,115
Our supply of clean water

88
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,237
will only last
a few more months.

89
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,074
So you have a choice.

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,914
You can keep killing each other,

<i>maybe eke out a few
more months, then die.</i>

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Or...

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,271
we can all agree right now

95
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
to an immediate cease-fire.

96
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,958

(speaks indistinctly)

98
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,875
The government
will not annex a war zone.

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,711
If we can show them that we
deserve to rejoin the mainland,

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,514
supply chain will be restored

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,673
and we will all survive
until reunification.

102

<i>That's the choice.</i>

103

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,396
You made her say that.

497
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,632
PROSECUTOR: <i>I didn't make her
say anything.</i>

498
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,069
Ask them.

499
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,312

GORDON:
<i>Who are they?</i>

501
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,155
PROSECUTOR: <i>More people who trusted
you, who believed you</i>

502
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,552
when you said you
would protect them.

503
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,116
They're from Haven.

504
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
I think I'm dying.

505
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,112
And isn't it about time?

506
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,196
The verdict's in.

507
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
You're guilty.

508
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,758
(wind whistling)

509
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,874
Hey, Jeff, listen to me.

510
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,256
One day, you're
gonna meet someone

511
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,720
who's gonna totally
change your life,

512
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,439
and that's gonna
make you happy,

513
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,518
and you deserve it.

514
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,709
Or not.

515
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,156
Is she here?

516
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,595
She's here, isn't she?

517
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,389
Sweetie.

518
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,873
All I asked of you

519
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,553
was to kill Jim Gordon.

520
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,436
You're not angry, are you?

521
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,313
'Cause I'll do it.
I'll do it right now.

522
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,276
I'll do it.

523
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,794
You keep the cops busy.

524
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,477
Luckily, the other part of my
plan is coming together nicely.

525
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,152
(steam hissing)

526
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,110
Lucius!

Bruce.

528
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,998
I had no idea
you were stopping by.

529
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,520
I wanted to check
on your progress.

530
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,038
Well, the toxicity levels
in this river continue to drop.

531
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,510
At this point, we'll be under
the threshold mandated

532
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,518
by the government
sooner than expected.

533
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,512
It's not glamorous work,
but we are helping

534
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,672
to save the lives
of thousands of people.

535
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,832
People. Ugh.

536
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,316
I'm sorry. Did you just say
"People. Ugh"?

537
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,551
Lucius,
what if I were to tell you

538
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,155
I have in my possession
the most intoxicating perfume

539
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,470
you'll ever smell?

540
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,680
I would tell you that's
an abrupt change of topic.

541
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,196
Can we go back to the part
where you said "People. Ugh"?

542
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,390
(grunts)

543
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,036

In fact, you were probably here

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,199
How do I protect that child
when everything around me dies?

659
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
<i>Harvey?</i>

660
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,359
WILL: <i>That's
a good question.</i>

661
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,116
Will.

662
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,877
You said I'd be
safe in Haven.

663
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,596
I trusted you.

664
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,196
<i>I know.</i>

665
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,915
I did my best.

666
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,391
Your best never seems
good enough.

667
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,474
It's time to go.

668
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,856
- (beeping)
- THOMPKINS: <i>No, no, no.</i>

669
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,760
- No, no, no, no. Jim.
- (long, continuous beep)

670
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,856
- Where's my adrenaline?
- (distant, rapid gunfire)

671
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,234
Oh...

672
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,589
Oh, looks like
Victor succeeded after all.

673
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,037
I guess I'll have
to settle for killing you.

674
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,919
I can tell you one thing.

675
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,992
I am sick and tired of getting
shot at in my own precinct.

676
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,873
Hey, what the bloody
hell's going on?

677
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,576
I thought you had this
lunatic locked up.

678
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,432
Ivy broke him out
and gave him an arsenal.

679
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,360
But I have an idea. I got to get
to the storeroom. Give me cover.

680
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Alvarez, go!

681
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,879

682
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,954

683
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,156

684
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,840
(panting)

685
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Why are you doing this?

686
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,959
What has Jim ever done to you?

687
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,831
Gotham has a chance
to be born anew.

688
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,079
To return to
what it was

689
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,836
before people ripped down the
trees and paved over the earth.

690
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,680
He's trying to reunify
with the mainland

691
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,910
to save all these people.

692
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,275
A return to filth.

693
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Pollution.

694
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,156
He's fighting for
death, while I...

695
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,950
promise life...

696
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,000
in its purest form.

697
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Is that your plan?

698
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,477
To have the plants take over
Gotham by killing Jim?

699
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,998
Oh, killing Gordon's
just the first part.

700
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,629
Bruce Wayne is taking
care of the rest.

701
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,714
- For what it's worth, I am sorry.
- For what?

702
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,476
(gasping breath)

703
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,434
This pain is nothing

704
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,350
compared to what you
are about to feel.

705
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,637
Say good-bye...
to Jim Gordon for me.

706
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,639
No!

707
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,835
<i>No, no, no,
no, no!</i>

708
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
No!

709
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,556
Jim.

710
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Selina, you're wasting

711
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:41,719
your time.

712
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,518
Bruce, you have
to snap out of Ivy's spell.

713
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,353
- This is not you.
- You're wrong.

714
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,795
Ivy's given me a purpose.

715
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,316
(grunting)

716
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,995
Stop! Stop! I don't
want to fight you!

717
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,200
What are you gonna do?
Kill everything in Gotham?

718
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,233
The toxins will only kill
all the people.

719
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,240
The plants will adapt;
they always do.

720
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,472
- Can you hear what that sounds like?
- Yeah.

721
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
It sounds great!

722
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,234
(coughing)

723
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,595
(panting)

724
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,437
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

725
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,071
You don't care about Gotham.
You're gonna leave anyway.

726
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,560
What about the
rest of us, huh?

727
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,076
The ones who
are gonna be

728
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,594
stuck here without you?!

729
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Selina...

730
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,553
(both gasping for breath)

731
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,473
<i>Selina...
I'm okay.</i>

732
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,597
- Bruce, I'm so sorry.
- We got to stop Lucius.

733
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,240
- Come on.
- Okay.

734
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,919
(grunts)

735
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,274
(alarm blaring)

736
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,790
Lucius! You have
to stop the shutdown.

737
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,873
Oh, no, I can't do that.

738
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,713
Ivy will be so mad.

739
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,918
Listen to me, I-I used
Ivy's perfume to hypnotize you.

740
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
She's using you.

741
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,835
No.

742
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,553
Ivy would never do that.

743
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,397
We're perfectly bonded,
like... carbon and oxygen

744
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
or hydrogen

745
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,280
<i>- and oxygen...</i>
- We do not have time for this.

746
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I'm sorry.

747
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880

748
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,639
- (flips switch)
- There.

749
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,240
Oh, you kicked me
in the head.

750
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,993
I didn't have
a choice, Lucius.

751
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,720
Bruce, where's Ivy?

752
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,399
She was headed to the GCPD.

753
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,038
I wonder what Ivy's doing
right now.

754
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,679
BULLOCK:
<i>Hey, lover boy.</i>

00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,874

You fight for everyone else.
You never give up.

00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,072
<i>I first met a young Jim Gordon</i>

823
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,439
when he was a, uh...

824
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,512
pain-in-the-ass, moralistic

825
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,751
<i>- rookie detective.</i>
- (laughter)

826
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,637
In the years since, he's evolved
into a pain-in-the-ass,

827
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,393
moralistic captain.

828
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,354
<i>I'd say he's my best friend,</i>

829
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,513
but in truth,
he's my <i>only</i> friend.

830
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,553
So we'll skip that.

831
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,191
Uh, on to Lee.

832
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,878
<i>Lee's always had his back.</i>

833
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,198
Except for the time
when she was infected

834
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,558
with the crazy-making virus
and she tried to kill him,

835
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,836
<i>but that's love.</i>

836
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,554
<i>But I will say,</i>

837
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,111
if there's one beautiful thing
that's happened

838
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,313
<i>over these last few crazy years,</i>

839
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,837
it's that these two people
met each other.

840
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,800
<i>And that truly is...</i>

841
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,954
<i>a beautiful thing.</i>

842
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,872
Jim, will you please
take Lee's hand?

I do.

And you, Lee Thompkins,
do you do the same?

855
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,475
Sure, Harvey.

856
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,835
I do.

857
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,592
