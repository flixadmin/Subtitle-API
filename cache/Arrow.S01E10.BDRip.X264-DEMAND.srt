1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,083
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,687
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,005
Survive.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,491
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,086
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,203
...to use the list of names he left me...

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,761
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,607
To do this,
I must become someone else.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,486
I must become something else.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,369
Previously on Arrow:

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,363
- It's done.
- He won't be harmed?

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,161
Nor will he ever discover your
involvement. You have my word.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,130
You know,
when I confront somebody on the list...

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,408
...I tell them they failed the city.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,889
But tonight...

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,169
Tonight it was me who failed.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,643
Get that hose to the north face
or we're liable to lose the block.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,404
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,846
- Danny?
- Yes, chief?

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,045
- Getting a little smoky out here, buddy.
- Just clearing the upper level.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,200
Hey, you. Over here.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,761
I could use some help.
I got a hot spot.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,931
Hey. hey. Hey. what--?

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,366
How you doing?
The rehab going good?

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,482
- Any news on Walter?
- My contact at the Bureau struck out.

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,609
Same with my guy at Interpol.
They both say the same thing.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,962
Either my stepfather
doesn't wanna be found...

28
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,521
...or someone doesn't want him
to be found.

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,802
It's been six weeks, Oliver.

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,451
No contact from the kidnappers,
no ransom demand, no proof of life.

31
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,201
- I hate to sound insensitive--
- Dig...

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,725
...we both know
he's more than likely dead.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,960
- What do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,251
Even my contacts in the Bratva
can't dig up a lead.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,330
I wasn't talking about Walter.

36
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,003
Back at fighting weight, looks like.

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,848
And last I checked, there were more than
a few names to cross off in this book.

38
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,888
Those people aren't going anywhere.

39
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,843
With Walter missing,
my family needs me right now.

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,766
Call your people. Tell them to bring the plane.

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,491
My people will be here shortly.

42
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,323
Do you not think it convenient
you captured me so easily?

43
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,251
- Go!
- What?

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,890
Run!

45
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,531
And Judge Hinkle is ready
to grant them another continuance.

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,082
So I said,
"Hell, no. This trial starts right now."

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,481
- Thattagirl.
- Thanks.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,926
Dad, what brings you by?

49
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,448
- I need to talk to Jo.
-ls everything okay, Mr. Lance?

50
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,931
No.

51
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,882
- What's happening?
- No.

52
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,887
Her brother, Danny,
he was killed on duty last night.

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,761
- Jo, I'm so sorry.
- No. No, no!

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,090
No. No!

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,241
- Jo, it's okay.
- No, no!

56
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,927
Shh.

57
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,050
Morn?

58
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,322
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

59
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,923
I stopped by the Big Belly Burger.

60
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,246
Thought maybe you, me and Thea
have some takeout, watch a DVD.

61
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,920
Thank you, sweetheart.
I'm not very hungry.

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,768
If you change your mind...

63
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,362
I've seen the movie before.

64
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,444
Cut me some slack.
I've been gone for a while.

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,769
And apparently
I missed the cinematic genius...

66
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,802
...that is Zach Galifianakis.

67
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,405
I mean, with Mom.

68
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,930
When you and Dad disappeared,
she spent more and more time at home.

69
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,890
Eventually stopped going out altogether.

70
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,761
- What snapped her out of it that time?
- Walter.

71
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,361
One morning, he showed up...

72
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,649
...and you know when he gets
all British and stern-like.

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,922
- Yeah.
-"Moira.

74
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,004
Get dressed.
We're going out for lunch."

75
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,491
I mean, and it worked.

76
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,685
You know, I've been thinking
maybe Walter wasn't abducted.

77
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,166
Maybe he's having some
mid-life crisis...

78
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,563
wand he's wfih some stewardess
'm Bore Bore...

79
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,929
...and he's too ashamed to call home
and say that he's okay.

80
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,290
Just because we haven't heard from him
doesn't mean he's...

81
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,046
He's gone.

82
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,641
- Right?
- Right.

83
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,691
What strikes me is that this vigilante
was actually making a difference.

84
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,810
In the four months that he was active,
assaults were down.

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,047
Muggings down.

86
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,965
The murder rate dropped
by 16 percent.

87
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,645
So in a very quantifiable way...

88
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,482
...this man in the hood
had been a positive force in this city.

89
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,921
So where has he been
for the past six weeks?

90
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,206
True enough.

91
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,250
Looks like everyone's disappearing.

92
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,041
Hey-

93
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,364
- What's this?
-It's nothing.

94
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,602
-It's nothing?
- It is, it is.

95
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,522
"Reasons I deserve a drawer."

96
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,406
Okay, we're gonna table this
for a less tragedy-filled day.

97
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,929
Yeah, and besides,
I don't think we're there yet.

98
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,242
- I should probably get that.
- All right.

99
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,488
- I need your help.
- Jo, come in.

100
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,724
I, um...

101
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,961
I don't think what happened
to Danny was an accident.

102
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,807
I think he might have been murdered.

103
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,841
Jo, do you remember when Sara died?

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,767
I did all this research to try to find an
explanation for why the boat went down.

105
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,523
I needed to believe
that it wasn't just an accident.

106
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,251
That is not what I am doing, Laurel.

107
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,526
I once handled a case for a clerk
in the coroner's office.

108
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,606
He passed me a copy
of the incident report.

109
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,246
It said that Danny's turnout coat
was doused in turpentine.

110
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,564
But I checked and the plant owner said
that there wasn't any in the factory.

111
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,930
A turnout's supposed to withstand
temperatures in excess of 500 degrees.

112
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,611
But the coroner said
that the fire did not exceed 250.

113
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,848
How did my brother burn hotter
than the fire that supposedly killed him?

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,843
Laurel, a fireman died fighting a fire.

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,606
- I'm not sure I see the crime.
- I did some digging.

116
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,889
Last week, another firefighter,
Leo Barnes, was killed in action.

117
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,166
Same circumstances.

118
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,207
Traces of turpentine and ignition
temperatures hotter than the actual fire.

119
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,601
Do you think you could talk
to the fire marshal?

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,524
Encourage him to pursue this?

121
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,366
Fire Department has its own investigative
unit. They don't answer to police.

122
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,569
Sorry to take so long with it.
CSU's been really backed up.

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,204
- Well, you find anything?
- The only prints on it are yours.

124
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,967
The tech inside is military grade.
I can't even trace the manufacturer.

125
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,043
Forensics-wise, it's a dead end.

126
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,209
Another case?

127
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,602
Vigilante. The phone belongs to him.

128
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,565
Where'd you get it? Does he answer?

129
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,330
Well, like Kelton said, it's a dead end.

130
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,888
Listen, kiddo,
I feel for Jo and her family, I really do...

131
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,327
...but there's not a lot
I could do this end.

132
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,088
I gotta go. I love you.

133
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,242
Hey, let's go.

134
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,090
Hello?

135
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,086
I need your help.

136
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,808
I didn't trust that you'd come.

137
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,646
No one's seen you for a while.
Where have you been?

138
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,609
You said it was important.

139
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,127
My best friend's brother...

140
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,242
...he died two days ago fighting a fire.

141
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,761
The police and Fire Department
say that he died in the line of duty.

142
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,282
But my friend,
she thinks he was murdered.

143
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,602
So you're asking one killer
to find another?

144
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,282
I heard what you said
to your father about me.

145
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,643
That I'm a killer,
that I have no remorse.

146
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,969
Do you?

147
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,846
Take a look at the file.

148
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,806
If Danny De La Vega was murdered,
then we have to bring his killer to justice.

149
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,123
I'll look into it.

150
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,124
Rotate your hips, Diggle.
That's where the power comes from.

151
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,001
It's not just your arms,
even if they're the size of bowling balls.

152
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,289
- Laurel reached out to the hood last night.
- Really?

153
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,125
Thought the vigilante spooked her
pretty well last time.

154
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,681
She thinks somebody's
killing firemen.

155
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,570
It looks all in the job. Seems pretty thin.

156
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,690
- We look into it?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,524
I have a friend who has a friend...

158
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,411
...in the Fire Investigations Department.
I'll reach out.

159
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,689
If you get any leads, tip the police.

160
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,531
The police?

161
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,000
They just need something
to jumpstart them.

162
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,051
Isn't the whole idea of being a vigilante
that you do the police's job?

163
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,531
You've been spending a lot of time
around here lately.

164
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,247
I thought after six weeks
you'd be anxious to hood up.

165
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,767
I even prepared the
"you gotta slow down" speech.

166
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,922
Where the hell is everybody?

167
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,200
Let me see what's going on upstairs.

168
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,965
There was supposed to be a delivery
this morning, another one this afternoon...

169
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,168
...and I see nobody ready for work.

170
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,085
If you don't get some progress here
in the next week...

171
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,050
...I'm gonna bring someone else in.
Is that clear?

172
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,441
It's difficult for you
to manage my nightclub...

173
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,961
...what with there not being
a nightclub here.

174
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,771
I just took the liberty
of, uh, yelling at our contractor.

175
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,601
I told him if we didn't see any real
progress, we'd bring someone else in...

176
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,280
-...to finish the job.
- Good.

177
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,284
How's Laurel's friend?
The one whose brother was a fireman?

178
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,603
Hanging in there, thanks.
That's something I wanted to bring up.

179
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,242
I was thinking that we could throw
a fundraiser for the Fire Department.

180
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,649
- Raise some money for the families.
- That's a great idea.

181
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,326
We could do it here.
We could keep the overhead low.

182
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,245
Make sure we maximize
the proceeds to the firemen.

183
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,926
Who are you?
Where's my friend Tommy Merlyn?

184
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,924
The guy who once rented out
a pro football stadium...

185
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,930
...so that he could play
strip kickball with models.

186
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,805
That guy needed a swift kick
in his lazy ass.

187
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,400
Jo, you really should take
some time off.

188
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,085
Go be with your family.

189
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,962
I seem to recall when Sara died
you hit the books pretty hard.

190
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,442
I am not exactly the best example
for healthy grieving.

191
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,282
Hey, can I talk to you, please?

192
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,530
- What is it?
- Where is it?

193
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,848
- Where's what?
- The phone.

194
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,331
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have.

195
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,960
Stolen evidence?
Yeah, you probably shouldn't have.

196
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,491
I had to do something.

197
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,004
- The man is a killer.
- Then why did he give you his phone?

198
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,362
- Give me the phone.
- He took it back.

199
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,323
- You were with him?
- When Sara died...

200
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,280
...if someone could've done something
to give you even a little closure...

201
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,044
...don't you wish they'd done it?

202
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,370
If it meant breaking the law,
lying to the people closest to them, no.

203
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,488
Surely there are contingencies
for these types of situations.

204
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,120
Bring someone over
from our London office, perhaps.

205
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,847
It's not solely a matter
of the day-to-day operations.

206
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,731
We have accountants
and vice presidents to do that.

207
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,281
It's about perception,
public confidence.

208
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,364
The company will be fine.

209
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,568
I don't mean to be indelicate...

210
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,684
...but this is the second time
in five years...

211
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,689
...that the CEO
of Queen Consolidated...

212
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,087
...has vanished under
mysterious circumstances.

213
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,487
I don't need you to remind me of that.

214
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,362
The last thing
I wanna do is upset you.

215
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,524
Then you should consider
this visit doubly disappointing.

216
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,690
Good day.

217
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,686
- Who was that?
- Ned Foster.

218
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,208
- The COO of the company.
- He wants Mom to take Walter's place.

219
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,762
He says that the company's stock price
has been damaged by Walter's absence...

220
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,084
...and my stepping in
would help settle the board.

221
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,130
But I told him that I needed
to be at home for my family.

222
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,366
Mom, Thea and I are fine.
We can manage here without you.

223
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,171
This sounds like something
everyone needs you to do.

224
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,802
Well, maybe I don't care
what everyone needs.

225
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,928
She's gonna be all right, Thea.

226
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,769
We have to get going if you wanna
make your dentist appointment.

227
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,046
Now, sir.

228
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,771
Eyewitnesses place a '72 Ford pickup
at the scene of Danny De La Vega's fire.

229
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,571
- Okay.
- Stagg Chemical lit up 1O minutes ago.

230
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,927
I hacked into
Stagg's video security feeds.

231
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,242
Parked on the street
running along the plant.

232
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,483
- Same pickup.
- I've got your gear in the car.

233
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,968
By the time I get someone on the phone
who will even listen to me...

234
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,600
...at least one of those firemen
are gonna be dead.

235
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,446
They need the man in the hood.

236
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,287
I have contact. Two klicks southwest.

237
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,129
Portable to Deputy Chief.

238
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,123
All clear of civilians.

239
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,727
Copy that.
Bail out and wait for second-in-companies.

240
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,802
Who are you?

241
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,605
Hello.

242
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,326
I have some information for you.

243
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,840
The killer drives a 1970s Ford pickup.

244
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,801
There's a scar on his right wrist from
a severe burn and a tattoo of a firefly.

245
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,770
Well, then you must've gotten
pretty close to him.

246
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,890
All the men in Engine Company 15
had firefly tattoos.

247
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,804
Any one of them could be the killer.

248
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,406
And what should I do
with this information?

249
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,768
Whatever you'd have done
before you met me.

250
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,045
- Who was on the phone?
- Wrong number.

251
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,808
So Laurel's on her own against
a murderer who burns people alive?

252
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,409
- I can't right every wrong in this city.
- No, I get that, Oliver.

253
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,848
But maybe you're not back
to 100 percent like you thought.

254
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,527
Maybe I'm not.

255
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,765
- What did that prove?
- That this is one sturdy desk.

256
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,009
And clearly your problem
isn't physical.

257
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,322
- I never said I had a problem.
- Don't have to.

258
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,801
But this guy, the other archer...

259
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,406
...he got in your head,
he took something from you.

260
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,689
- That's enough.
- He took whatever is in your heart...

261
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,889
...that lets you jump off buildings
and take down bad guys.

262
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,724
Thank you for the analysis.

263
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,123
You can avoid Laurel, Oliver,
avoid me...

264
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,649
...avoid this as long as you want.

265
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,610
But until you're ready to take ahold
of the fear in you...

266
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,603
...you might as well
have let that archer kill you.

267
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,167
Text from Tommy.

268
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,961
I need to run an errand for the benefit
at the firemen's station.

269
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,770
While you're at it, let me know...

270
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,930
...if you still wanna be a vigilante
or just a club owner.

271
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,411
Hey, what are you doing here?

272
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,166
I told Joanna
I'd clean out Danny's locker.

273
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,570
- And you?
- Tommy sent me over...

274
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,963
...to make sure the guest list
for the Fireman's Gala was accurate.

275
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,168
Tommy's been working
very hard on that.

276
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,642
-It's very generous of you, Oliver.
-It's truly not.

277
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,928
Ha, ha. Speaking of Tommy...

278
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,368
...he told me that you're being very
protective of your drawers.

279
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,171
This is not a fancy term
for your underwear.

280
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,130
Are you and I
seriously having this discussion?

281
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,884
Well, we're friends.

282
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,608
Yes, Tommy asked for a drawer.

283
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,767
- And this is bad?
- No, it's just...

284
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,449
I'm an all-or-nothing type of girl.

285
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,888
First it's a drawer, then it's a closet,
half my rent, it's half my life.

286
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,123
Am I really ready
to do that with Tommy?

287
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,404
- You could take it slow.
- I don't take things slow, remember?

288
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,969
I close my eyes and I jump.
Just like you.

289
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,208
I think that's why
we spooked each other.

290
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,567
Our feelings, our fears, they control us.
It's not the other way around.

291
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,091
- You know?
- Yeah.

292
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,163
I have to get inside.

293
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,646
I did some research.
There are eight firemen in this picture.

294
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,044
You called yourselves the Fireflies.

295
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,601
That station house was shut down
a few years back.

296
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,161
All the guys went to different
companies, so...

297
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,164
Four of these men are now dead.

298
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,963
It's not all getting cats out of trees.

299
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,521
But three of them died
within the last six weeks.

300
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,082
Except for that man right there,
Garfield Lynns.

301
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,931
He died two years ago
in the Nodell Tower tragedy.

302
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,690
You forget something, Mr. Queen?

303
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,730
Just wanted to see if my friend there
needed some help.

304
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,883
- What was the Nodell Tower?
- How do you not remember that?

305
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,762
I was Wi-Fi free for a few years.

306
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,886
It was 22 stories of glass and steel.

307
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,249
Except it turned out that
the construction company who built it...

308
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,370
...used substandard materials
to save themselves a few bucks.

309
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,801
It was nowhere near the structural code.

310
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,770
A gas line blew. There was a fire.

311
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,050
Yeah, melted right through
the stanchions.

312
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,409
- The whole damn thing came down.
- Bad day.

313
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,242
Thirty-four civilians
and six of my fellow firemen died.

314
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,882
Now, do you need anything else,
Ms. Lance?

315
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,007
Other than reminding rne
of all the friends I've lost and buried?

316
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,041
Hey, what was that all about?

317
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,765
It was nothing, Oliver. I have to go.

318
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,804
Hello?

319
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,567
Are you there?

320
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,611
I spoke to Danny's old chief.

321
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,691
I didn't get anywhere.

322
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,686
- What am [supposed to do now?
- Nothing. It's my turn.

323
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,448
We have so many of these old photos.
I really should have them scanned in.

324
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,206
Well, that's an incredibly
ambitious plan.

325
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,964
Which will have to wait.

326
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,088
- Why?
- Because we're gonna go out.

327
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,643
To dinner or to a movie or shopping.

328
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,528
- Anything to get you out of the house.
- No, Thea, I'm just too tired.

329
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,049
Really? That's pretty amazing
considering you've been in bed all day.

330
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,489
Please, don't presume to think
you know what I'm going through.

331
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,643
I do know.

332
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,530
I lost Dad too.
I'm worried about Walter too.

333
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,730
But I don't get to worry about him,
because I'm busy worrying about you.

334
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,407
- I never asked you to do that.
- Right.

335
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,250
Because you don't ask me
to do anything anymore.

336
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,449
You don't ask me to do my homework
or to be home at a decent hour.

337
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,807
I mean, you basically stopped
being my parent.

338
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,488
Well, how's this?
Don't talk to your mother like that.

339
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Maybe you should start acting
like my mother.

340
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,642
So I don't have to act like yours.

341
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,169
Thought you were done
helping Laurel.

342
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,722
The first Firefly to die,
his name was Garfield Lynns.

343
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,168
Well, being dead kind of rules him out
as a murder suspect, right?

344
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,929
Oliver...

345
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,044
...I'm sorry I came at you so hard, man.
But I've been there.

346
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,088
I know what it's like to stare death
in the face and be the one who blinks.

347
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,524
That's not it.

348
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,009
I've been close to death
on the island...

349
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,770
...more times than I can remember
and I never feared it.

350
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,041
Because I had nothing to lose.

351
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,646
But when that archer almost killed me,
when I stared death in the face then...

352
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,485
...I thought about the people that
I've let into my life since I've been back.

353
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,247
My family, Laurel, Tommy.

354
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,921
And that made me afraid.

355
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,686
Afraid of what would happen
to those people if they lost me again.

356
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,442
And for the first time in so long...

357
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,723
...I had something to lose.

358
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,647
Maybe you got it backwards, Oliver.

359
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,686
You think the people you let in
have taken your edge.

360
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,481
I think it gives you one.
Maybe a stronger one, even.

361
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,921
You can stare down death
with something to live for or not.

362
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,051
Something to live for is better.

363
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,323
All the men in the unit
had an alibi for Danny's murder.

364
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,491
The guy that I fought had a firefly tattoo
and his arm was severely burned.

365
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,041
Okay, I don't see
where you're going with this.

366
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,446
The Node“ Tower fire...

367
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,683
...the bodies were so burned,
they couldn't be lD'd off records.

368
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,845
What if Garfield Lynns didn't die,
but was just presumed dead?

369
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,406
Hi.

370
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,930
RAUGHS]

371
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,486
You know, ironically...

372
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,247
...if we get any more people in here,
we're gonna violate the fire code.

373
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,209
- We're good on Drawergate, right?
- All good.

374
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,690
Excuse me.

375
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,683
- Can I borrow Laurel for a sec?
- Absolutely.

376
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,169
- Chief Raynes.
- Hi.

377
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,211
- Mr. Queen, this is spectacular.
- Well...

378
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,842
The Starling City Firemen's Relief
Association can't thank you enough.

379
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,004
You guys are the real heroes.
Like at the Nodell Tower fire...

380
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,447
-...which I've been reading up on.
- Oh, yeah?

381
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,080
Garfield Lynns was the first man
to die in your unit.

382
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,851
I read that they recovered his coat
in the wreckage...

383
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,729
...but they never found his body.

384
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,201
You always interrogate
your club's guests?

385
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,330
Why? Do you feel like
you're being interrogated?

386
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,643
I could see it on your face
at the fire station.

387
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,604
There's more to the Nodell Tower fire
than people know about.

388
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,169
I've been doing this a long time
and I've never seen a fire like that.

389
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,324
It was like some monster
out of a science-fiction movie.

390
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,370
I radioed for my men
to get the hell out of there.

391
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,043
But Lynns, he wouldn't go.
Begged me to send the unit back in.

392
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,409
But I wouldn't do it.

393
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,044
I couldn't.

394
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,483
God help me, I left him to burn.

395
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,529
- But I can't bring him back.
- You don't have to.

396
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,762
He is back.

397
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,162
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Garfield Lynns killed Danny...

398
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,004
...and the other men on your unit.

399
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,371
There is no way
he could have survived that fire.

400
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,330
You'd be surprised
the power revenge can give you.

401
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,528
Thank you so much.

402
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,371
The people in this city
appreciate everything you...

403
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,924
You're insane. Gar did not
make it out of that building.

404
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,571
Just like you won't
make it out of this one.

405
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,921
- Go, come on. Exit's this way.
- Go.

406
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,367
GO, go!

407
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,931
Go, go, go. This way.

408
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,889
Gar, what the hell are you doing?

409
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,647
- Run.
- Go!

410
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,849
What the--?

411
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,771
Laurel!

412
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,125
Laurel. Laurel.

413
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,282
- Where's Oliver?
- He's still inside.

414
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,925
We can't leave him.

415
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,491
Tommy!

416
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,325
You know how long it takes
for your skin to melt?

417
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,524
- I do, from experience.
- I told you to get out of there.

418
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,765
And I told you
that we could save the building.

419
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,405
But you got scared.

420
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,485
You lost your nerve.
You left me in there to die.

421
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,361
- How did you get out?
- I was pulled from the wreckage.

422
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,730
Listed as a John Doe in the burn unit.
In a coma for months.

423
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,489
When I woke up
and saw what was left of who I was...

424
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,848
...I only had one thought:

425
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,528
To leave you as alone as you left me.

426
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,605
Now it's your turn.

427
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,766
Go.

428
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,001
It's over.

429
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,406
I'm not afraid to die.

430
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,050
I know.

431
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,245
You're afraid to live.

432
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,004
Let me get you out of here.

433
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,729
Lynns“.

434
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,245
...let me get you help.

435
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,084
Thanks.

436
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,767
- But I'm already burned.
- Lynns, don't do it.

437
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,249
Eyewitnesses contend
that numerous lives would have been lost...

438
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,006
...if not for the timely intervention
of the vigilante.

439
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,362
But these were not the actions
of a vigilante.

440
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,885
What's been described
are the actions of a hero.

441
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,201
What's got you all smiley?
Your new club's a briquette.

442
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,081
It was under construction before.
Now it's just more under construction.

443
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,208
Good morning.

444
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,283
Sharp suit, Mom.

445
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,523
Not used to seeing you without
your bedroom wrapped around you.

446
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,963
Well, I could hardly go
to the office in my pajamas.

447
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,608
I'm taking Walter's position at the office.

448
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,040
- What changed your mind?
- Not what. Who.

449
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,007
My daughter.

450
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,769
My family.

451
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,724
And I promise you,
Walter will get back to us.

452
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,850
I will keep looking for him
and I will find him.

453
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,691
- And I'll see you for dinner.
Mm-hm.

454
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,761
- What?
- Just feeling the whiplash.

455
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,447
She went from shut-in
to chairman pretty fast.

456
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,166
- Sounds like you got through to her.
- Yeah, I guess.

457
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,363
It'll just be for a few months.
My mom, she's taking it so hard.

458
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,046
Whatever you have to do
to take care of your family.

459
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,721
Before I forget.

460
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,286
My brother's badge.

461
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,485
My mom was hoping maybe you could
find a way to get it to, you know, him.

462
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,001
As a thank-you.
I don't care what anyone has to say.

463
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,689
He really is a guardian angel.

464
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,200
I'll find a way to get it to him.

465
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,286
I'm gonna miss you.

466
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,850
Yeah.

467
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,531
- Hi.
- Hey.

468
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,206
- You look after yourself, all right?
- I will.

469
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,930
Good.

470
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,003
So Joanna's taking
a leave of absence, huh?

471
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,167
- She has to go be with her family.
- Yeah, well, family's important.

472
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,929
- I already apologized.
-It's my turn.

473
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,409
After what happened last night...

474
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,484
...maybe it's a good thing
you got the hood involved.

475
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,681
He didn't take
the phone off you, did he?

476
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,571
Maybe you should hold onto this.

477
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,569
I mean, I may not like the guy's methods,
but whoever this guy is...

478
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,850
...he's got a habit of putting himself
between danger and you.

479
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,241
And that's not something
I can argue with.

480
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,004
Besides,
I shouldn't have this thing anyway.

481
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,731
Kelton, are we good?

482
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,641
I got a strong signal from the crystal
VHF transmitter you hid in the speaker.

483
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,730
- It can't be back-traced.
- Talk to me like a third grader.

484
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,042
Next time your daughter calls
the vigilante...

485
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,248
...we'll be able to listen to every word.

486
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,646
I know you swore
to bring this guy down, detective...

487
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,691
...but using your own daughter as bait,
that's stone cold.

488
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,210
Good thing the fire didn't spread
to down here.

489
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,168
It's one of the benefits of concrete
and steel construction.

490
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,767
Thank you.

491
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,531
- What for?
- You know what for.

492
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,922
- So, what's next? More training?
- No.

493
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,282
We go hunting.
