1
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,000
(Bells chiming, birds singing)

2
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,240
(Horse whinnies)

3
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,440
(Men shouting)

4
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,240
(Ned) Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

5
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
No.

6
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,680
l stood vigil
for him myself last night.

7
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,560
He had no one else.

8
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,360
He'd never worn this armour before.

9
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,240
Bad luck for him -
going against the Mountain.

10
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,480
Who determines the draw?

11
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,640
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

12
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,480
Aye.

13
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,680
But who holds the straws?

14
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,760
You've done good work, Sisters.

15
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
Life is strange.

16
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,600
Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

17
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,520
l'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

18
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,720
As is my wife. l don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

19
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,960
(Chuckles) You're too modest.

20
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,480
l've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

21
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,000
My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

22
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
l never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.

23
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,960
He was a fine man, your father.

24
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.

25
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,680
And that lad -

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

27
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,720
How could he amord a new suit of armour?

28
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
Perhaps Lord Arryn
Ieft him some money?

29
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,320
- l hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

30
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,040
(Chuckles) Robert tends
to do what he wants.

31
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,560
lf the king got what
he wanted all the time,

32
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,080
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

33
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,800
lt's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

34
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,520
Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.

35
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,560
Did you know that?

36
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,880
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,680
He can't even put
a man's armour on him properly.

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,520
- You're too fat for your armour.
- Fat?

39
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,000
Fat, is it?

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,400
ls that how you speak to your king?

41
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,240
(Laughing)

42
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,040
Oh, it's funny, is it?

43
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,840
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,200
You don't like the Hand's joke?

45
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,520
You're torturing the poor boy.

46
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,200
You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armour.

47
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,120
Go find the breastplate
stretcher - now!

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,240
- (Laughs)
- ''The breastplate stretcher''?

49
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,400
How long before he figures it out?

50
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,520
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.

51
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,480
You watch me out there.
l still know how to point a lance.

52
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,120
You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,440
Why, because l'm king?
Piss on that. l want to hit somebody!

54
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

55
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,480
- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.

56
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,840
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.

57
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,160
Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?

58
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,880
Aye.

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
- Drink.
- l'm not thirsty.

60
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,760
Drink. Your king commands it.

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,320
Gods,

62
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,800
too fat for my armour.

63
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,200
Your squire -
a Lannister boy?

64
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,680
Mm. A bloody idiot,

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,680
but Cersei insisted.

66
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,040
l have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

67
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,920
''Cersei Lannister will make
a good match,'' he told me.

68
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,600
''You'll need her father on your side.''

69
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,320
l thought being king
meant l could do whatever l wanted.

70
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,240
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

71
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,920
At least l can smell
someone else's blood.

72
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,960
- Robert.
- What?

73
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
Oh. (Laughs)

74
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,120
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,960
Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!

76
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,000
(Ned chuckles)

77
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,080
(Cheering)

78
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,320
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

79
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,560
The Knight of the Flowers.

80
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,320
Thank you, Ser Loras.

81
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,760
(Horse neighs)

82
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,840
(Crowd jeering)

83
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,280
(Horse grunting and neighing)

84
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,720
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

85
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,400
- Hey.
- l can't watch.

86
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,240
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,920
- l'll take that bet.
- Now what will l buy with 100 gold dragons?

88
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,000
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

89
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,000
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

90
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,840
- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.

91
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,720
Ser Loras rides well.

92
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,080
(Neighing)

93
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,680
(Fanfare)

94
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
- (Gasps)
- (Laughs)

95
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,680
Such a shame, Littlefinger.

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,880
lt would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
And tell me, Lord Renly,

98
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
when will you be having your friend?

99
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,520
(Neighs)

100
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,840
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.

101
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,160
Ser Loras would never do that.

102
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,040
- There's no honour in tricks.
- No honour and quite a bit of gold.

103
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,120
- (Helmet clanks)
- Sword!

104
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,040
(Horse neighs)

105
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,760
- (Gasps)
- (Neighs)

106
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,840
- (Crowd gasps)
- (Grunts)

107
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,600
Leave him be!

108
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,880
(Growls)

109
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,760
Stop this madness
in the name of your king!

110
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,640
(Robert) Let him go!

111
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,880
l owe you my life, ser.

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,080
l'm no ser.

113
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,520
(Cheering)

114
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,560
(Grunting)

115
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,280
Remove his hood.

116
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,360
♪ On that eve, the captive Imp

117
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,840
♪ Downwards from his horse did limp

118
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,920
♪ No more would he preen and primp

119
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,560
♪ In garb of red and gold ♪

120
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,200
(Tyrion) This isn't the Kingsroad.

121
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- l did... Often and loudly.

122
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,560
Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,

123
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,600
looking for me in the wrong place.

124
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,520
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

125
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,040
He'll be omering a handsome reward.

126
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.

127
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,560
Would you be so good as to untie me?

128
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,880
- And why would l do that?
- Why not?

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Am l going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

130
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

131
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,800
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

132
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,400
Ah, the eastern road.

133
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,360
We're going to the Vale.

134
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,960
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

135
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,880
Tell me, Lady Stark,
when was the last time you saw your sister?

136
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,520
- Five years ago.
- She's changed.

137
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,040
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

138
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,200
- l am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am l.

139
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,600
l had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.

140
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,440
- The dagger found...
- What sort of imbecile

141
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,160
arms an assassin with his own blade?

142
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
- Should l gag him?
- Why?

143
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,240
Am l starting to make sense?

144
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,040
- (Thuds, grunts)
- (Catelyn) Rodrik!

145
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,760
(Roaring)

146
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,280
My lady, this way.

147
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,120
Untie me.

148
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,040
lf l die, what's the point?

149
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,240
(Neighs)

150
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,480
Ah!

151
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,680
(Man roars)

152
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,840
(Breathing heavily)

153
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,480
- Rodrik?
- l'll be fine, my lady.

154
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,480
There's no need to bloody yourself.

155
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,720
Your first?

156
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,800
You need a woman.

157
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,960
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,840
l'm willing if she is.

159
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,000
(Laughing)

160
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,760
Bran.

161
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,440
(Bran) The Iron Islands.
Sigil - a kraken.

162
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Words - ''We do not sow.''

163
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

164
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,000
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

165
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,640
(Laughs)

166
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,760
And failed rebellions.

167
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,920
Sigil - a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

168
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,920
- Good.
- Words - ''Ours is the fury.''

169
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,480
- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

170
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
The Westerlands.

171
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,520
- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

172
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,520
- Words - ''A Lannister always pays his debts.''
- No.

173
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,880
A common saying,
but not their omicial motto.

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,920
- (Arrow thunks)
- Lords - the Lannisters.

175
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,800
- We're still on their words.
- l don't know them.

176
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,760
You do know them. Think.

177
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,240
''Unbowed, unbent, unbroken.''

178
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,920
- That's House Martell.
- ''Righteous in wrath.''

179
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,360
- House Hornwood.
- ''Family, duty, honour.''

180
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Those are Tully words -
your mother's.

181
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,840
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honour...

182
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,080
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

183
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,120
Family comes first?

184
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,320
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

185
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,760
How can she protect the family

186
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,120
if she's not with her family?

187
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,320
Your mother sat by your bed

188
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,040
for three weeks while you slept.

189
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,160
And then she left!

190
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,720
When you were born, l was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

191
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,640
l placed you in her arms.

192
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,400
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

193
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,800
she will love you.

194
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,520
Absolutely.

195
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,520
- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?

196
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,400
(Sighs) l still can't tell you,

197
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,880
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

198
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,560
- (Arrow thunks)
- Today?

199
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,200
- No, l don't.
- Then how can you promise me

200
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,280
she'll be home soon?

201
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,440
Sometimes l worry
you're too smart for your own good.

202
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,840
l'll never shoot another arrow.

203
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,200
And where is that written?

204
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,840
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

205
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,320
lf the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

206
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,800
you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.

207
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,560
Really?

208
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,960
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

209
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Why shouldn't you?

210
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,920
(Grunting)

211
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,040
(Moans)

212
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,480
Shh, keep it down.

213
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,960
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

214
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,200
l thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

215
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,520
lmportant enough for the likes of you.

216
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,800
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

217
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,240
Who, the Imp?
l'd call him half a nobleman.

218
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,200
Jealous?

219
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,000
Why should l be jealous?

220
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,920
Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

221
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,960
What's a dwarf like down below?

222
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
l've always wondered.

223
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,160
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

224
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,240
He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

225
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,160
Generous tipper.

226
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,840
l guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

227
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,760
You are jealous.

228
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,440
l'm a Greyjoy.

229
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,600
We've been lords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

230
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,400
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

231
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,360
not even the Lannisters.

232
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,400
And what about the Starks?

233
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,480
l've been Lord Stark's ward
since l was eight years old.

234
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,840
A ward -
that's a nice word for it.

235
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,680
Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...

236
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,840
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

237
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,440
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

238
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,000
You're a very serious boy.

239
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,120
- l'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

240
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,920
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

241
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,280
l don't want to pay for it.

242
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Then get yourself a wife.

243
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,240
- (Arya) Come on.
- (Meows)

244
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,680
- l'm not gonna hurt you.
- (Meows)

245
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,960
(Meows)

246
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,960
How is your son, my lord?

247
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,720
He'll never walk again.

248
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,560
But his mind is sound?

249
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
So they say.

250
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,520
A blessing, then.

251
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,640
l sumered an early mutilation myself.

252
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,880
Some doors close forever...

253
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
others open
in most unexpected places.

254
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,760
May l?

255
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,920
lf the wrong ears heard
what l'm about to tell you,

256
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,080
om comes my head.

257
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,640
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

258
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,240
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

259
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,680
But there are things you must know.

260
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,000
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

261
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,720
your friend, l know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.

262
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,240
l've been in the capital a month.

263
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,960
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

264
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,760
l didn't trust you.

265
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,160
So why do you trust me now?

266
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,880
The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,040
There are few men of honour
in the capital.

268
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,800
You are one of them.

269
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,680
I
l would like to believe l am another
strange as that may seem.

270
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,240
What sort of doom does the king face?

271
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,960
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

272
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,880
The tears of lys, they call it.

273
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,240
A rare and costly thing,

274
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,680
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

275
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,320
Who gave it to him?

276
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,400
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

277
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,560
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

278
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,720
(Sighs) There was one boy.

279
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,280
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

280
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,240
The squire, Ser Hugh?

281
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,080
Pity, what happened to him,

282
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.

283
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,240
lf Ser Hugh poisoned him...

284
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,640
who paid Ser Hugh?

285
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,880
- Someone who could amord it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

286
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,360
He was Hand for 17 years -
17 good years.

287
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
Why kill him?

288
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,280
He started asking questions.

289
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,960
(Meows)

290
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,320
(Man) He's found
one bastard already.

291
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,520
He has the book.

292
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,480
- The rest will come.
- (Lock clicks)

293
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,800
(Man #2) And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

294
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,560
(Man #1) The gods alone know.

295
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,560
The fools tried to kill his son.

296
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,280
What's worse -
they botched it.

297
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,280
The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

298
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,000
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- (Man #2) What good is war now?

299
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,040
We're not ready.

300
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,640
lf one Hand can die,
why not a second?

301
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,240
(Man #1) This Hand is not the other.

302
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,840
(Man #2) We need time.

303
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

304
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,320
- You know what these savages are.
- ''Delay,'' you say.

305
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
''Move fast,'' l reply.

306
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,560
This is no longer
a game for two players.

307
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,640
(Man #2) It never was.

308
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,280
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

309
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,800
l admire your industry.

310
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,400
You do move quietly.

311
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,920
We all have our qualities.

312
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,840
You look a bit lonely today.

313
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,200
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

314
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,640
- First boy is on the house.
- l think you're mistaking

315
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,520
- business with pleasure.
- Am l?

316
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty little things.

317
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Trust me,

318
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,120
we accommodate all inclinations.

319
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:09,040
Oh, l'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, l hear.

320
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,760
l'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -
both equally important.

321
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,360
Though l suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

322
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,720
ls it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

323
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,440
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

324
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,840
And l heard the most amul rumour
about a certain lord

325
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,880
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

326
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,000
Must be enormously dimicult
to accommodate that inclination.

327
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,960
The logistics alone...

328
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:40,200
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

329
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,240
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.

330
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,640
Strictly speaking.

331
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,040
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

332
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,440
l've often wondered.

333
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,520
Do you know,
l have no idea where they are.

334
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,200
- And we had been so close.
- (Chuckles)

335
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,920
But enough about me.
How have you been

336
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,040
since we last saw each other?

337
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,560
Since you last saw me
or since l last saw you?

338
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,920
Now the last time l saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

339
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,680
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes l own.

340
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,240
Council business.

341
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,240
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

342
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,120
Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

343
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
lf the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

344
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,680
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

345
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,680
to think a simple word to the queen...

346
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,000
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

347
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,440
But you know something?
l do believe that l have seen you

348
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,400
even more recently
than you have seen me.

349
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,160
- Have you?
- Yes.

350
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,920
Earlier today, l distinctly recall

351
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,360
seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

352
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,520
Was that you under the bed?

353
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,480
And not long after that

354
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,120
when l saw you escorting a certain

355
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,160
foreign dignitary...

356
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,520
Council business?

357
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,720
Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

358
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,280
You're from there yourself, after all.

359
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,440
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

360
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,680
l'd like to think we are.

361
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,880
So you can imagine my burden,

362
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.

363
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,440
To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

364
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,280
turning right loyalty to the realm...

365
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,600
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

366
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,560
- where a simple word to the king...
- (Door opens)

367
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
What are you two conspiring about?

368
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,000
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

369
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,000
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

370
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,880
Disturbing news from far away.

371
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
Hadn't you heard?

372
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,320
(Birds cawing, waves breaking)

373
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,160
Om with you. No begging.

374
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,080
l'm not a beggar.
l live here.

375
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,240
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

376
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,120
l want to see my father.

377
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,840
l want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

378
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,600
You want your father, boy?

379
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,640
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

380
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:33,080
My father is Hand of the King!

381
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,640
l'm not a boy.
l'm Arya Stark ofWinterfell.

382
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,000
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

383
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,960
Now are you going to let me by
or do l need to smack you

384
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,440
on the ear to help with your hearing?

385
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,920
You know l had half my guard
out searching for you?

386
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,360
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

387
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,000
- Who did?
- l didn't see them,

388
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,840
- but l think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya. (Sighs)

389
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,480
l'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

390
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,360
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

391
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,120
Something about the savage.

392
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,440
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

393
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,640
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

394
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,720
Chasing a cat.

395
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,080
(Knock, door opens)

396
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,400
Pardon, my lord.

397
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,640
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

398
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,160
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

399
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,160
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- l'm a girl!

400
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,800
Did Benjen send you?

401
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,760
No one sent me, my lord.
l'm here to find men for the Wall

402
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,280
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

403
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,880
- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,240
But that's not why l disturb you now.

405
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,200
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -

406
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,280
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

407
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,560
lt's for his sake l rode here so hard
l damn near killed my horse.

408
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,280
There are others riding too.

409
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,800
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

410
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Know what?

411
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,720
Best said in private, my lord.

412
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,040
Go on. We'll talk more later.

413
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,000
Jory, take her safely to her room.

414
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,440
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

415
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,800
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

416
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,400
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

417
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,120
No fear on that count, little lady.

418
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,880
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

419
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,840
She's taken the Imp.

420
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,200
(Neighs)

421
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,160
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

422
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,600
- To whom do l speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

423
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,720
- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

424
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,920
May l ask, my lady,

425
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,760
why he is with you?

426
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,400
That's why there was no time.

427
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,040
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

428
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,240
My sister will decide what he looks like.

429
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,840
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

430
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,920
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

431
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,520
Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

432
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,760
l'll impregnate the bitch.

433
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,480
(Tyrion) l like you.

434
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,840
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

435
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,160
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

436
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,280
l need to see the king first - alone.

437
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,560
The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

438
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,560
He has summoned you.

439
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,440
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

440
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,080
l believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

441
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,320
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

442
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,720
l warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

443
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,360
l warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

444
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,600
Well, hear it now.

445
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,040
l want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

446
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,120
And that fool Viserys as well.

447
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,480
ls that plain enough for you?
l want them both dead.

448
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,000
You will dishonour yourself
forever if you do this.

449
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:43,560
Honour?!
l've got seven kingdoms to rule!

450
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,640
One king, seven kingdoms.

451
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,880
Do you think honour keeps them in line?

452
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,040
Do you think it's honour
that's keeping the peace?

453
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,360
- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

454
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,560
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

455
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
because the spider heard a rumour?

456
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,960
No rumour, my lord.
The princess is with child.

457
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,240
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

458
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,480
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

459
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,880
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

460
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,440
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

461
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,120
I
Jorah Mormont's a slaver
not a traitor.

462
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,480
Small dimerence, l know,
to an honourable man.

463
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:24,120
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

464
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,160
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

465
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,760
(Robert) And if he's right?
If she has a son?

466
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,000
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

467
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,800
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

468
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,880
l'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

469
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,840
Do nothing?

470
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,160
That's your wise advice?

471
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,680
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

472
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,800
You're my council.
Counsel!

473
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,440
Speak sense to this honourable fool.

474
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,280
l understand your misgivings, my lord.

475
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,840
Truly, l do.
It is a terrible thing

476
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
we must consider, a vile thing.

477
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,160
Yet we who presume to rule

478
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,240
must sometimes do vile things

479
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,480
for the good of the realm.

480
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,800
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

481
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,600
- the realm will bleed.
- l bear this girl no ill will,

482
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,360
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

483
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,720
How many towns will burn?

484
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,920
ls it not wiser, kinder even,

485
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:31,040
that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?

486
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,600
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

487
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,880
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

488
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,120
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

489
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,200
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

490
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,880
l followed you into war -

491
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,920
twice,

492
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,760
without doubts,

493
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,840
without second thoughts.

494
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,600
But l will not follow you now.

495
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
The Robert l grew up with

496
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,920
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

497
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,640
She dies.

498
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,840
l will have no part in it.

499
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,040
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

500
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,520
You'll do as l command
or l'll find me a Hand who will.

501
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,240
And good luck to him.

502
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,960
- l thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

503
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,680
l'm done with you.

504
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,680
Go, run back to Winterfell!

505
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,000
l'll have your head on a spike!

506
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,160
(Robert) l'll put it there myself, you fool!

507
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,080
You think you're too good for this?

508
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,000
Too proud and honourable?
This is a war!

509
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,720
l'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

510
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,520
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

511
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,040
Lord Baelish is here for you.

512
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,600
His Grace went on about you
at some length

513
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,400
after you took your leave.
The word ''treason'' was mentioned.

514
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,080
- What can l do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

515
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,960
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

516
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,600
l'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

517
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,080
lf that sort of thing still interests you.

518
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,680
l don't have the time.

519
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,720
lt won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

520
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,000
Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

521
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:39,440
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

522
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,520
Find them and meet me at the stables.

523
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,680
You bring him here without permission?

524
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,480
You pollute my home with his presence?

525
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,320
(Sucking sounds)

526
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,640
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

527
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,200
You remember her, don't you?

528
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,440
lsn't he beautiful?

529
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,440
And strong too. Jon knew it.

530
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,280
His last words were
''The seed is strong.''

531
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,760
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

532
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,280
his son would grow up to be.

533
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

534
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,680
Lysa,

535
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,080
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

536
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,080
- warning me...
- To stay away from them !

537
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,640
Not to bring one here!

538
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
Mummy...

539
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,960
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

540
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,920
(Chuckles)

541
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:38,200
He's little.

542
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,400
(Lysa) He's Tyrion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

543
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,280
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

544
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,760
Oh, did l kill him too?

545
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,800
- l've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

546
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,600
These men are knights of the Vale.

547
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,280
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

548
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,240
Every one of them would die for me.

549
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,640
lf any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

550
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,520
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!

551
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,280
- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

552
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,640
He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

553
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,360
No one will hurt my baby.

554
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,080
Mummy...

555
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,480
l want to see the bad man fly.

556
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,680
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

557
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,080
l will not have him harmed.

558
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,080
Ser Vardis,

559
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,840
my sister's guest is weary.

560
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Take him down below
so he can rest.

561
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,320
lntroduce him to Mord.

562
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,040
You go sleep, dwarf man. (Chuckles)

563
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,120
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

564
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,800
(Laughs)

565
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,000
(Slams, lock clunks)

566
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,880
(Wind whistling)

567
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,720
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

568
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,360
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

569
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,440
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

570
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,000
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if l slip.

571
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,520
(Scraping)

572
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,120
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

573
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,600
lf you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

574
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,640
l want you.

575
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,640
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

576
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,080
He treats me as if l'm a spoilt child.

577
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,240
Oh, and you're not?

578
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,320
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

579
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,520
How many wars have you fought in?

580
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,760
Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armour of yours?

581
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,640
Hold still.

582
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,520
All l ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how l'm not tough enough,

583
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,320
how l squirm at the sight of blood.

584
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,960
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

585
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,920
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

586
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,520
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

587
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,680
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

588
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,120
(Groans) It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

589
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,000
l'm good because l work at it -

590
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,760
every day of my life
since l could hold a stick.

591
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:31,760
l could work at fighting all day, every day,
l'd still never be as good as you.

592
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,200
Yes, well, l guess we'll never know.

593
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,240
(Sighs)

594
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,200
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

595
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,480
So how did it end up?

596
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,440
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

597
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,480
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

598
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,960
Every time he talks about killing her,
l swear the table rises six inches.

599
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,800
lt's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

600
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,200
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

601
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,600
You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

602
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,840
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever sumered to walk the world,

603
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,480
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

604
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,520
- l have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

605
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,920
(Laughs) But a lot more than you.

606
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,200
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

607
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,240
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

608
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,680
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

609
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,720
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

610
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,040
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

611
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,000
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

612
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

613
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,520
And he used to be good at it.

614
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Do you know who should be king?

615
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,040
- Be serious.
- l am.

616
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,240
My father could be your bank.

617
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,200
l've never fought in a war before,

618
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,920
- but l'd fight for you.
- l'm fourth in line.

619
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,920
And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?

620
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,200
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

621
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,720
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

622
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
He's still my older brother.

623
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,320
- (Gasps) What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

624
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,480
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

625
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,800
Sometimes a little spills.

626
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,960
lf you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

627
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,160
You need to get used to it.

628
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,200
Go on. Look.

629
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,160
People love you.

630
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,520
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

631
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,000
They want to be near you.

632
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,840
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

633
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,000
but you don't gloat over it.

634
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,800
You don't love killing.

635
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,240
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

636
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,920
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

637
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,240
You would be a wonderful king.

638
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,560
(Kissing and sucking sounds)

639
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,240
(Door creaks)

640
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,520
l'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

641
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,160
You seemed so good together.

642
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,440
l'm glad l could do something
to make you happy.

643
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,160
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

644
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,760
l suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

645
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,240
No.

646
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,280
He's not serious enough.

647
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,240
l'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

648
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
(Robert) Hmm.

649
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,920
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

650
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,800
l don't know.

651
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,880
But l do know this -

652
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,880
if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

653
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,120
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

654
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,760
we won't be able to stop them.

655
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,120
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

656
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,320
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armour.

657
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,760
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

658
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,760
you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

659
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,760
(Chuckles softly) Is my father wrong?

660
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,880
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

661
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
with 40,OOO Dothraki screamers at his back.

662
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,800
We hole up in our castles.

663
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,560
A wise move -

664
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,200
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

665
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,000
They leave us in our castles.

666
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,440
They go from town to town,
Iooting and burning,

667
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:45,160
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall

668
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,680
stealing all our crops and livestock,

669
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,560
enslaving all our women and children.

670
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,000
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

671
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,240
their absentee king,
their cowardly king

672
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,680
hiding behind high walls?

673
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,480
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

674
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,880
is the rightful monarch after all?

675
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,520
We still outnumber them.

676
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,000
Which is the bigger number -
five or one?

677
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,400
Five.

678
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,160
Five...

679
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,920
One.

680
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,120
One army - a real army

681
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:26,920
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

682
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,480
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

683
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,640
Now we've got as many armies

684
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,480
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

685
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,480
And everybody wants
something dimerent.

686
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,720
Your father wants to own the world.

687
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,960
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

688
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,000
What do you want?

689
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,080
We haven't had
a real fight in nine years.

690
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,240
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.

691
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,280
And that's all the realm is now -

692
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
backstabbing and scheming

693
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,400
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

694
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,040
Sometimes l don't know
what holds it together.

695
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
- Our marriage.
- (Laughs)

696
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,320
Ah, so here we sit,

697
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,960
17 years later,
holding it all together.

698
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Don't you get tired?

699
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,880
Every day.

700
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,920
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

701
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,840
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

702
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,400
Yes, it is.

703
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:51,640
Yes, it is.

704
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,280
What was she like?

705
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,320
You've never asked
about her, not once.

706
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,840
Why not?

707
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,320
At first, just saying her name
even in private

708
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,480
felt like l was breathing life
back into her.

709
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:17,160
l thought if l didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

710
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,000
When l realised
that wasn't going to happen,

711
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,080
l refused to ask out of spite.

712
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,480
l didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking l cared enough to ask.

713
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,760
And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

714
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,640
As far as l could tell
you actually enjoyed it.

715
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,600
So why now?

716
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,480
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

717
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,600
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

718
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:50,240
You want to know the horrible truth?

719
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,280
l can't even remember
what she looked like.

720
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,200
l only know she was
the one thing l ever wanted.

721
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,520
Someone took her away from me,

722
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,720
and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

723
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,880
l felt something
for you once, you know?

724
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,840
l know.

725
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,640
Even after we lost our first boy.

726
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:28,320
For quite a while, actually.

727
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,720
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

728
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,800
No.

729
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,000
Does that make you feel better or worse?

730
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,520
lt doesn't make me feel anything.

731
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,160
(Door opens, closes)

732
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,320
She looks like him,

733
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,280
don't she, my lord?

734
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,200
She has his nose,
his black hair.

735
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,640
Aye.

736
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,640
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

737
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,840
lf it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

738
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,920
- l will.
- And tell him l've been with no one else.

739
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,320
l swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

740
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,440
l don't want no jewels or nothing,

741
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,200
just him.

742
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,840
The king was always good to me.

743
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,000
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

744
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,080
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

745
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,880
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

746
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,920
healthy.

747
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,560
Looks healthy enough to me.

748
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,440
The girl shall want for nothing.

749
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,600
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

750
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:11,280
l've found.

751
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,600
Whores rarely sink.

752
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,440
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

753
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,880
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

754
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:26,440
- (Ned) How many?
- Does it matter?

755
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,280
lf you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

756
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,240
And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

757
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,120
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

758
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,280
He was overcome with fatherly love.

759
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:41,600
Come.

760
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:49,640
- Jory!
- My lord.

761
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,840
Such a small pack of wolves.

762
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,600
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

763
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:15,560
Was the Hand of the King.

764
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,440
Now l'm not sure what he is -
Iord of somewhere very far away.

765
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,640
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

766
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,800
Get back inside where it's safe.
l'm looking for my brother.

767
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,560
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

768
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,600
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

769
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,720
- l remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

770
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,520
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

771
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,800
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

772
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,320
- (Littlefinger) My lords!
- (Horse neighs)

773
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,840
l'll bring the City Watch.

774
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,040
Come, Stark.
l'd rather you die sword in hand.

775
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,040
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

776
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,960
As in, ''l'm going to open your lord

777
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:01,520
''from balls to brains
and see what Starks are made of'?

778
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,360
You kill me,

779
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,840
your brother's a dead man.

780
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,640
You're right.

781
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,320
