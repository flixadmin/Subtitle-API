315
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,830
Oh, maybe we can stay,
all of us, in your asshole!

316
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:09,417
Or maybe we could not run.

You are like a record that is broken.

318

Well, we shouldn't just give up.

319
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,926
Guys, we get some Compound V,
we bring it to <i>The New York Times,</i>

320

'Cause I don't.

00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,987
- Fuck Butcher. We don't need him.
- A-Team had Hannibal.

- I mean, guys, just hear me out, okay?
- Shut the fuck up!

Ashley. [clears throat]

Glad to see you're making yourself
at home. [clears throat]

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,710
Yeah. [sighs]

339
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,588
Renovation is definitely overdue.

340
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:04,133
It's like 2003 called,
they want their office back, you know?

341
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,051
Huh.

342
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,221
- I liked it.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

343
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:13,893
Homelander, I just wanna thank you again
for recommending me for this job.

344
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:17,772
I was so surprised
to get the call. [chuckles]

345
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,278
I am gonna fill Miss Stillwell's shoes
as best I can.

346
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,614
God rest her soul.

00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,411
Yeah. God rest it. Yeah.

348
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:36,874
Any luck catching her killer?
That Butcher maniac?

349
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,421
No. Not yet.

350
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,631
But we will.

351
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,843
Oh, good news.

352
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,511
I think I found a hero.

353
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,055
Perfect candidate to replace Translucent.

354
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,850
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

355
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:55,810
So soon?

356
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,271
He's in the gym right now.
You wanna meet him?

357
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,357
Do I? [chuckles] Lead the way.

358

That's Blindspot, right?

A differently abled member of The Seven.

360
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,337
We'll poll through the roof
with millennials.

361
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,714
Inclusion's a big priority for them.

362
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,840
Amazing.

363
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,718
And then I think we find an ethnic
or female or, fingers crossed,

364
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,888
an ethnic female
to replace The Deep, and we're golden.

[both chuckle]

00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,815
It's an honour, sir.

368
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,194
Wait. Hold on. You can tell it's me?

369
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,362
Mm-hm. [chuckles]

- [chuckles] Wow.
- [chuckles]

371
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,158
That's impressive.

372
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,535
You don't need super eyes
when you have super ears.

Can I just say, "That is amazing"?

374
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:00,833
And you, my friend, are a true hero.

375
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,503
Not because of what you do
for a job, but...

376
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,256
- [sighs] Because of what you've overcome.
- Thank you.

377
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,259
That means everything, coming from you.

Oh. Stop it. Come on.

Hey, guys, um...

380
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,767
- I just have one question if that's okay.
- Yeah.

381
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,935
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

382
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,062
All right. So...

383
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,193
What happens if, I don't know, I do this?

[screaming]

385

And now you're just another useless,
fucking blind guy.

386
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,293
This must be some kind of a joke, Ashley.

387
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,589
What made you think I would ever allow
a cripple into The Seven?

388
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,718
For fuck's sakes, Ashley,
don't look at him. Look at me.

389
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,472
Ashley! Look at me.

390
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,434
- Sorry, sorry.
- Let's get one thing straight.

391
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:04,939
The only reason you're here and not doing
corporate PR for fucking Diva Cups

392
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,733
is that I brought you here.

393
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,861
You are dispensable,
which means you answer to me.

394
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,279
Okay. Okay.

395
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:16,576
From now on, I will set my own agenda,

396
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,829
I'll approve my own marketing,
and I'll write my own talking points.

397
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,958
You will tell me everything
that goes on on the 99th floor.

398
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,960
And I mean everything.

399
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,962
Every call, e-mail, group chat.

400
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,466
If a fucking lightbulb goes out,
you will tell me.

401
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,510
- And, Ashley...
- [Blindspot whimpering]

...in no fucking way do you decide
who goes in The Seven.

about "Super Villain."

472
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,248
What about the term "Super Villain"?

473
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,418
That sounds better to me. More exciting.

474
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,129
- More exotic.
- Okay.

475
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:14,720
Okay, turning our attention back to these,
which do you prefer?

476
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,598
"Saving America,"
can I get a show of hands?

477
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:20,517
Okay. How about "Saving the World"?

478
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,229
Wow. Unanimous, strong reaction.

479
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,815
- So, what is it about...?
- Nope. It's "Saving America."

480
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:28,817
Uh...

481
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,197
I don't know.
I feel like "Saving the World" has a...

482
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:42,831
It's Americans that are gonna keep us
in the Army, not the fucking world.

483
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,376
It's "Saving America."

484
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,336
Mm-hm.

485
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,880
- Pull the trigger.
- [pats Ashley]

486
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,924
Great. Great.

487
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:08,357
[Deep] Hey, man.

488
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,567
[groans]

489
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,153
Thanks for letting me crash.

490
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:16,949
Sorry, about the bathroom.
I'll clean it up.

491
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,201
No need to apologise.

492
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,162
[groans]

493
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,164
Okay.

494
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:29,503
- Oh, shit. You scared me.
- Oh, that's just Carol.

495
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,671
Good friend.

496
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:34,550
Carol, this is The Deep.

497
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,469
I have been looking forward
to meeting you, Deep.

498
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:38,721
Would you like a Fresca?

499
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:42,391
Thank you.

500
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,022
Anyway, no need to apologise.

501
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,441
We've all been there. It's tough.

502
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:55,279
- Been where?
- Rock bottom.

503
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:57,698
I... [scoffs]

504
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,742
I don't think I'm at rock bottom.

505
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:04,455
For me, my aha moment came

506
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,124
with a hostage situation at Kroger.

507
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,959
Multiple shooters.

508
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:13,881
I showed up, I'm letting arrows fly,
my aim is perfect.

509
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,383
But...

510
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,723
there's only so many arrows
a quiver can hold.

511
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,101
I just ran out.

512
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,145
And then...

513
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:32,232
we lost a lot of good people that day.

514
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,111
Then you start to question,

515
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:39,615
like, fucking arrows against TEC-9s?

516
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:43,827
- But?
- But I came to see

517
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,790
that archery isn't irrelevant,
it's timeless.

518
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:51,627
It's a pure and ancient art.

519
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,255
Carol helped me see that.

520
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,801
- What are you, his therapist or something?
- No. [chuckles]

521
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:03,097
No, therapy's very destructive, actually.

522
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,265
You could say I'm his teacher.

523
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,600
What about you, Deep?

524
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,604
What about...? What about me?

525
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,773
How did you end up here?

526
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,567
You can tell her, Deep.

527
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,405
[scoffs] Tell her what?

528
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:23,700
About your drinking.
About your self-esteem issues.

529
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,203
- Really open up, Deep.
- No, I don't...

530
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,747
I don't have a drinking... I'm fine.

531
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:32,418
- This is a safe space, Deep.
- If you don't have any self-esteem issues,

532
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,878
why are you constantly demeaning women?

533
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,423
- That's a good question.
- Okay, thank you.

534
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:41,176
I don't know what the fuck this is,
but it's weird as fuck, so I'm leaving.

535
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,095
We just want to help.

536
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,973
- Carol really helped me, Deep.
- No, thank you.

537
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,058
Help you get back into The Seven.

538
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:09,455
[reporter] <i>Yesterday, The Deep was found
drunkenly ranting at children</i>

539
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,207
<i>at Splash Zone in Sandusky, Ohio.</i>

540
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:16,962
<i>He was later arrested and taken
to the Sandusky general detention centre.</i>

541
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,590
<i>He was released on bail shortly after.</i>

542
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,301
Did you make this?

543
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,897
You wrote something.

544
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,400
"Boy."

545
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:40,652
What boy?

546
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:44,114
I do not understand. What boy?

547
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,082
Okay, so?

548
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,836
They were wired the money
from a blind account

549
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,463
to smuggle the bastard in.

550
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,383
- Cold trail.
- Amazing fucking friends of yours.

551
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:08,222
I never said they were my friends, huh?
I only said we will be safe here.

552
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,186
- Okay, all right. What do we do?
- [Milk] Oh, you just call 911.

553
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,896
[scoffs] What, an anonymous tip?

554
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,190
Yeah, I'm sure
that'll go straight to the mayor.

555
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,692
You saw that video.
What if he does that to an aeroplane?

556
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,611
Or the fucking Brooklyn Bridge?

557
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,655
So, what's your big plan, Hughie?

558
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,535
Okay, the CIA lady, right? Raynor?

559
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:30,452
Right.

560
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:36,375
The same CIA that wants to clamp our nuts
into some jumper cables.

561
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,834
We could call Butcher.

562
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:41,129
- For the last time, we don't need Butcher.
- Then what?

563
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,425
We should...

564
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,970
call Annie.

565
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:48,887
[chuckles softly]

566
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,098
"Call Annie."

567
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:56,853
Annie?

568
00:39:58,647 --> 00:39:59,481
Yeah.

569
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,484
You mean Starlight?

570
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,487
'Cause that's who she is.

571
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:10,576
Vought has her phone so bugged,

572
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,579
they're praying that you do that.

573
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,208
Oh, no.

574
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:23,672
- You fucking called her?
- No, no. I'm not stupid, okay?

575
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,427
- I texted her.
- Oh, fuck.

576
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,762
And then we met up,
but we're getting some Compound V.

577
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:33,307
- Fuck you! Are you fucking crazy?
- [Frenchie] M.M., easy!

578
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,934
- You crazy? What are you doing?
- [Hughie] We were careful!

579
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,020
- We used burner phones.
- Kid, you don't get it.

580
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,690
They could've been following you.
They could be watching us right now!

581
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:48,488
If you're the fucking reason
why I can't finish

582
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:52,034
that Vermont country dollhouse,
I will fucking end you.

583
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,245
You've been walking around for days
like you wanna kick my ass,

584
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:56,663
so do it already.

585
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,754
Goddamn it.

586
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,380
[sighs]

587
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,299
Shit!

588
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,805
I don't want to kick your ass, Hughie.

589
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:16,600
I just don't want to get dragged
back into this shit, all right?

590
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,730
I want to get home to my wife and my kid.

591
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,357
That's it.

592
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:25,859
If I still can.

593
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:32,282
- This guy could kill a lot of people...
- Hughie, let somebody else handle it.

594
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,701
There's no one else!
No one's coming to save us.

595
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:35,786
You don't get it.

596
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,288
You are not a soldier.

597
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,207
You're not a spy.

598
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,920
- You're a kid that sells stereo equipment.
- No, I don't!

599
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,173
I don't have a job.

600
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,301
Or Robin.

601
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,889
Or my dad. Or Annie.

602
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,143
One way or another, they all...

603
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:05,899
Now all I have is this.

604
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:11,196
This. Which is really
fucking depressing, but it's true.

605
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:16,243
So maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.

606
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,663
But I can be Harry Potter.

607
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,417
Or, you know, John Connor

608
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,670
or, what's her name
from <i>The Hunger Games?</i>

609
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:27,796
Katniss.

610
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:33,677
The point is, I could be that person
that nobody thinks is awesome,

611
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,680
but it turns out
they're kind of fucking awesome.

612
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:38,098
[sighs]

613
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:42,144
M.M., listen, we help the CIA lady,

614
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,771
she could help you maybe
get back to your family.

615
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,773
Ever think of that?

616
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,364
<i>- My baby needs a mother!</i>
- [Butcher actor] <i>Oy.</i>

<i>Shut your trap, you dumb bird.</i>

618
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,995
- [Madelyn actress whimpers]
<i>- Or else I'll bollocks you.</i>

619
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:04,750
[Chris Hansen] <i>But that's exactly
what William Butcher did.</i>

620
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:08,795
Gecko?

621
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,464
Is that you?

622
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:14,384
Starlight? Annie, hi.

623
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,386
- Hi.
- Oh, my God, hi.

624
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,304
[both chuckle]

625
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,641
- Look at you, bigtime Seven hero.
- Oh, shut up.

626
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:25,812
You know, I work in Vought Tower
at the labs on 67.

627
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:27,522
Oh, you don't say.

628
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:30,525
I see your posters everywhere.
They're marketing the shit out of you.

629
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,443
[scoffs]

630
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,612
I'm happy for you, really.

631
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,239
Buy you some coffee?

632
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,867
[chuckles]

633
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,826
Thank you.

634
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,537
Yeah, at the Capes for Christ
Bible Camp, yes, totally.

635
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,582
That Passion play we put on?
You were the best Jesus.

636
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,959
No one's gonna take a nail
through the hand like I can.

637
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,545
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

638
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:53,048
Oh, my God, those freckles.

639
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:57,010
- You know he wanted to make out with me?
- Pontius Pilate and Mary hooking up?

640
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,513
- Sacri-licious. [chuckles]
- Yeah, we never did.

641
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:03,975
- Why not? He was so cute.
- Yeah, it was what Ezekiel always said.

642
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:05,227
And my mom too.

643
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,480
That God is watching over you,
every second.

644
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,943
I thought that he was watching us,
and I thought that he'd be upset.

645
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:16,112
Yeah, it's a messed up thing
to tell a kid.

646
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:17,781
Yeah, but looking back?

647
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,493
I should've made out with Big Game.

648
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,955
I should've done
a lot more stuff because...

649
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:29,209
there is nothing up there.

650
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,380
There's nobody in the sky
watching over us.

651
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:38,593
Not God, not Homelander.

652
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,346
Not anybody.

653
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,933
It's all just...

654
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:46,935
lies.

655
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,321
I need a favour.

656
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:04,077
Yeah. Yeah, anything
for a Bible Camp alum.

657
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,165
[clears throat]

658
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:15,255
I need you to go into the labs on 67
and steal me a sample of Compound V.

659
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:19,426
Um...

660
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:21,928
I, uh...

661
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:23,847
I don't know what that is.

662
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,890
See?

663
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,976
Another lie.

664
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,479
I know how we're made.

665
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:33,815
And it is not Jesus.

666
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:40,530
I can't. I mean, it's impossible.
I'm a nobody there. I'm a lab rat.

667
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:43,199
They cut off my limbs
and they grow back. I cannot get you...

668
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,200
You have to.

669
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,912
Or I put this on Facebook tonight.

670
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,500
Gecko,

671
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:57,005
former teen star
of Vought Summertime Clubhouse,

672
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,549
working as an S&M hooker...

673
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,636
as a side hustle?

674
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:08,391
I'm sure enquiring minds will wanna know.

675
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:10,352
Annie?

676
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:14,105
- I thought that we were friends.
- I'm sorry.

677
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:16,483
But...

678
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,777
we're not anything.

679
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,246
Hi.

680
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,873
You know who we are.

681
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:34,125
But let's meet another hero.

682
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,920
This is Lance Corporal Dan Miller.

683
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:39,631
Dan and the other brave marines
of Second Battalion

684
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,384
are helping keep you safe
from the Super Villain threat.

685
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,719
We're proud to fly alongside them.

686
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:47,389
And now we could use your support.

687
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,392
That's right, Maeve,
with our new campaign, Saving America.

688
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,936
Here I go, you guys! Wish me luck.

689
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,605
Oh, FYI, not a real base.

690
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:59,067
As if Homelander
and Maeve are gonna eat MREs

691
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,194
and piss in a ditch
with the rest of the grunts.

692
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,154
Yeah, hi, we're filming right now.
Excuse me?

693
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:05,657
You might recognise Army Boy
as Hotel Clerk 2

694
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,909
- from "The Devil's Breath"...
- Hello, excuse... Okay.

695
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,953
...episode
of <i>Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders.</i>

696
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,496
[Homelander] Well, hello!

697
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,415
Oh, my God, hi!

698
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:16,167
My nana's your biggest fan.
I'm Stormfront.

699
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:19,504
- Great.
- Oh, right, yeah. From Seattle, right?

700
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,339
Uh... [chuckles]

701
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:25,719
Portland, actually, Your, uh... Highness.

702
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:30,181
[chuckles] Holy shit! Your eyes
are really fucking blue up close.

703
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:33,977
[laughs] You are fun.

704
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,147
It's been a hoot, but we got work to do,
so let's get back to it.

705
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,401
Oh, totally.
They just wanted me to meet you.

706
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:42,861
Who?

707
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,113
Oh, the boys on 82.

708
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,449
- I'm the new girl.
- [Queen Maeve] Wait.

709
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,743
- What are you talking about?
- Oh.

710
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,787
Hi. I'm in The Seven.

711
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,498
Replacing Translucent.

712
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,167
God bless his soul.

713
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:02,088
Ink's barely dry
but, yeah, reporting for duty.

714
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:04,299
Fuck, yeah!

715
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,551
No, I don't think that this is...
It's not true.

716
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,094
I don't know anything about this.

717
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:13,433
Wow. Well, Stormfront?

718
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,020
Who delivered the good news?

719
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:18,813
[Stormfront] Oh, uh...

720
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:21,733
Mr. Edgar, the big guy?

721
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,860
[director] All right, back to one.

722
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,028
Wonderful.

723
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:26,529
Great.

724
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:28,364
All right!

725
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,034
Great!

726
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,328
- [director] Going again, people.
- [man] Stand by.

727
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,455
Well, I think this is going great.

728
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,755
[Milk]
You know, you ain't John Cusack, man.

729
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,216
You ain't got no motherfucking boom box.

730
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,469
- Sorry?
- You want to get back with Starlight.

731
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,764
- No. No, I don't.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

732
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,724
But this ain't the way to do it, Hughie.

733
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:58,728
You can't keep pulling this shit, man.
Calling her, texting her.

734
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:01,397
- Are you crazy?
- You sound like Butcher.

735
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:03,358
- She's on our side.
- I know.

736
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,861
I'm saying this for her, kid.
You're putting her in danger.

737
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,073
Homelander finds out
that she's been talking to you? [scoffs]

738
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,241
She's fucked.

739
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,410
The deeper you keep pushing her
into this thing,

740
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:16,871
the deeper in the meat grinder she goes.

741
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,459
[Raynor] How are you guys doing?

742
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,504
[Milk] We're hanging in there.

743
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,923
- [Raynor] Has Butcher contacted you?
- Nope.

744
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,551
He's completely ghosted.

745
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:34,389
- Do you think he killed Madelyn Stillwell?
- I'd like to think that he didn't.

746
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,600
But... I don't know.

747
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:43,648
Deputy director, I know this might not be
the best time to ask, but do you ever...?

748
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,108
Hear about your family?

749
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,279
Your daughter is starting soccer, I think.

750
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,490
Soccer?

751
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:56,202
Ma'am.

752
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,496
Can M.M. see them?

753
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,292
[sighs] You know what?
Let's see if this checks out.

754
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,294
And I will see what I can do.

755
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,590
Thank you, ma'am.

756
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,842
Okay, so give me
the description of this guy.

757
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,721
All right, about 5' 10", 165,

758
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,599
black hair,
wearing knockoff jeans and sneakers,

759
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,768
probably from Taiwan, maybe India.

760
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,146
You got all that from the video?

761
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:27,150
So the other shoe drops
and it just crushes us all.

762
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:28,902
Meaning?

763
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,989
Meaning, I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

764
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,491
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

765
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:38,912
- And I think you just handed it to me.
- Okay, so then what's the whole picture?

766
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:40,830
The whole picture? It's Vought.

767
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:45,168
- It's a fucking coup from the inside.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

768
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:50,840
Uh... ma'am, your nose.

769
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,888
- Fuck! Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Holy shit!

770
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:01,309
- Holy shit!
- Come on! Get in! Go, go, go!

771
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,521
- Must be a Supe out there.
- Are our heads gonna explode?

772
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,482
Frenchie, who do you know
who could do that?

773
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,776
- No one!
- Are our heads gonna explode?

774
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:11,444
<i>Look, I have a daughter.</i>

775
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,448
<i>I'm worried about Super Terrorists too.</i>

776
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,243
<i>But that does not mean</i>

777
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:21,704
<i>that Vought can use that fear
to control us.</i>

778
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,164
- Morning.
- Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry...

779
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:25,792
- [Stan] That's all right, Samantha.
- Busy day. [chuckles]

780
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,085
Morning, Homelander.

781
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,587
To what do I owe the pleasure?

782
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:33,925
Well, you never come up to 99,
so figured I'd pay you a visit.

783
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,094
- What a lovely idea.
- Right?

784
00:51:36,678 --> 00:51:39,264
After all, you run a superhero company

785
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:42,433
and you never check in
with your superheroes, do you?

786
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,603
Like, oh, I don't know,

787
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:48,106
around the hiring of that girl,
for example.

788
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,650
You wished to be consulted on Stormfront?

789
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,943
Well, why not?

790
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,570
I signed off on all the rest.

791
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,864
I'm the leader of The Seven.

792
00:51:56,948 --> 00:52:00,201
- For which you have my undying respect.
- See, I don't think I do.

793
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,120
No.

794
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:07,250
Not even Madelyn would've dared
to try and pull this kind of shit.

795
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:10,378
Of course you know how important
you are to everyone at Vought.

796
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,088
No, no. Stan.

797
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,048
I am Vought.

798
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:18,594
You show my photo
to some illiterate fucking camel jockey

799
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:19,887
in the middle of the Sahara,

800
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,889
he's gonna turn around
and say, "Homelander,"

801
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,266
in perfect American.

802
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:25,268
You know what?

803
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,938
My contract's up, end of this year.

804
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:31,983
[sighs]

805
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:36,362
Maybe it's time I move on.

806
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:41,075
How do you think
your shareholders would feel about that?

807
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,341
What do you know about Frederick Vought?

808
00:52:58,801 --> 00:52:59,677
Excuse me?

809
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,139
Frederick. Vought.

810
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,144
Our esteemed founder.

811
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:14,817
Well, I don't know, not a lot, probably.
I only read his autobiography...

812
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,028
- five times?
- [chuckles softly]

813
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,821
Not the self-serving bullshit

814
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:21,366
that we peddle to the shareholders,
the real story.

815
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:24,827
- Enlighten me.
- Got his doctorate from Munich.

816
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,080
Ahead of his time in genetics.

817
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:30,583
Such the rising young star that in '39,

818
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,211
Hitler appointed him
chief physician at Dachau,

819
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:36,339
where he enjoyed
a ready supply of human subjects

820
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:39,133
on which to test
his earliest iterations of Compound V.

821
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:43,388
For which we condemn
in the strongest of possible terms.

822
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:46,099
Early in '44, he felt the winds change,

823
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:48,393
got spirited away to the Allies.

824
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:50,520
When Oppenheimer was flailing
with the bomb,

825
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:54,232
Dr. Vought already had
practical applications of Compound V

826
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:55,566
tested in the field.

827
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,361
Heroes like Soldier Boy,

828
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,363
killing Germans by the dozen.

829
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,991
So Roosevelt pardoned him,

830
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,702
and he became
as Wonder Bread American

831
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,789
as Disney and Edison.

832
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,291
Well, this is a truly fascinating,

833
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,837
if not slightly condescending lecture,
but, uh...

834
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,256
I don't think I see the point, Stan.

835
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,549
The point is...

836
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:24,429
that you are under a misconception
that we are a superhero company.

837
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,513
We are not.

838
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:28,433
What we are, really,
is a pharmaceutical company.

839
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,936
And you are not our most valuable asset.

840
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,648
That would be our confidential formula
for Compound V.

841
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:39,193
Which you, man-child that you are,
released into the wild.

842
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:41,320
[scoffs]

843
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:46,200
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Let me remind you.

844
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,744
You slipped Compound V
to terrorists all over the globe

845
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:51,414
to get you and your cronies
into national defence.

846
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,208
But maybe at the cost of destroying
the whole company.

847
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:58,171
I don't think I appreciate your tone, sir.

848
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:00,756
Not much at all.

849
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,011
And I don't appreciate
that the FDA now knows about Compound V

850
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:09,265
or that it's only a matter of time
before the public finds out.

851
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:12,894
While you're preening
at the Golden Globes,

852
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:17,315
we're busy, running around like maniacs,
trying to clean up the mess you made.

853
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:25,448
I don't have to consult you
about Stormfront or anything else.

854
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:33,748
Now, I believe you have a premiere
of <i>Tek Knight Lives</i> to go to?

855
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:05,863
[sighs]

00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:19,377
What are you doing here?

857
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,256
I've come to see my son.

858
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:43,734
Fuck, Hughie. So glad you...

859
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:45,987
got us into this shit.

860
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:47,863
[Hughie] She had a husband.

861
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:49,824
Right?

862
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,536
A kid?

863
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,664
Two kids.

864
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,418
And I got her killed.

865
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,712
You didn't get her killed.

866
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,590
That wasn't meant for us.

867
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,050
How do you know?

868
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:10,928
Because our brains aren't
all over the dash, that's how.

869
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:12,805
Someone was watching her.

870
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:16,100
And the minute she said something she
wasn't supposed to... [mimics explosion]

871
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,519
Somebody from Vought?

872
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:25,109
So we're saying
that Vought may have just assassinated

873
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,987
the deputy director of the CIA.

874
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,907
And now we're in the middle of that too.
Happy now, motherfucker?

I just want to take our time.
Do this right. That's all.

I know when you're not
telling me the truth, Hughie.
