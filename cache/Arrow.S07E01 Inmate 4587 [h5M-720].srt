1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,076
Last season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:05,162
This is my city!

3
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,371
You want to stop me,

4
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:07,956
you're gonna have to kill me!

5
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:09,133
No!

6
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:12,928
So far Ricardo Diaz
has been unstoppable.

7
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,964
You want my help? I'm gonna
need two things from you.

8
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,008
- Mr. Queen, it's time.
- What is she talking about?

9
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,344
I thought you said
we had immunity!

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,679
You do, but only if
Oliver agreed to turn himself in.

11
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,182
There is still work to be done.

12
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,234
I am the green arrow.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,076
- William, run!
- I can't run anymore.

14
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:45,994
Yes, you can!
Get up. Get up.

15
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:47,788
Oliver, help!

16
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,665
Oliver can't help you.

17
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,508
Run now! Now!

18
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,087
You're brave.

19
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:58,557
Oliver queen took
everything from me.

20
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:11,987
I'm gonna enjoy taking
everything from him.

21
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,779
Morning, 4587.

22
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,322
Beautiful day.

23
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:47,139
Watch it, arrow.

24
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,059
You're not gonna
eat that, are you?

25
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:50,077
Lights out!

26
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,548
Morning, 4587.

27
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,017
Beautiful day.

28
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,380

29
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,569
You... you're
the green arrow.

30
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,905
Wrong guy.

31
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:28,365
But I saw you on TV.

32
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,616
That beard threw me off
a little bit,

33
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:30,909
but... it's definitely you.

34
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:32,628
I'm a big fan.

35
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,204
"You have failed this city."

36
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,257
Ok, I'm not that person
anymore, all right?

37
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:43,046
Look, I'll join whatever
gang you're in.

38
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,973
I don't care what I have to do.

39
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,716
I just... I need your protection.

40
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,468
I'm not in a gang.

41
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,762
Then let me be your,
uh, sidekick

42
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,764
or your lookout or
something. Please.

43
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,058
Just... I...

44
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,726
How am I supposed
to survive in here?

45
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:01,156
I don't know.
Leave me alone.

46
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,820
What the hell?

47
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,117
I told you this
wasn't over, didn't I?

48
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,994
We waited a long time for this.

49
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,872
Revenge is a bitch.

50
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,549
We don't have to do this.

51
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:01,758
But we want to.

52
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,530
Break it up!
Break it up!

53
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:28,702
You've all had enough fun
for today, don't you think?

54
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,915
You know the penalty
for being in possession

55
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,574
of a weapon, Mr. Turner.

56
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,784
Take him to the hole.

57
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,410
You're dead.

58
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,995
When I get out,
you're a dead man!

59
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,840
He planted that.
That's not mine.

60
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,671
Deals can't miss, bro.

61
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,547
Primo product, great price.

62
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:52,059
Look, I'm on my way
over now, ok?

63
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,231
It can't be you. Aah!

64
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:08,233
Would you mind
handling the incident report?

65
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,744
I'd like to make date night
with Curtis for a change.

66
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:16,166
Go get the captain.

67
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:30,257
4587, you pull that crap
again from yesterday,

68
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,426
I'm gonna make
an example out of you.

69
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,687
Understood, inmate?

70
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,107
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:42,778
You got a visitor.

72
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,495
You know the drill.

73
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:07,553
You've looked better.

74
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,589
I've looked worse.

75
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,674
How are William and Felicity?

76
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:14,926
Still safe and sound
in witness protection.

77
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:16,687
I've upped surveillance to 24/7

78
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:18,188
since we spoke last week.

79
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,515
Has the FBI made any progress?

80
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:23,518
No. No. Nothing.

81
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,479
Watson says she won't
stop looking,

82
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,022
and neither will I.

83
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,274
But, Oliver, it's been
5 months, man.

84
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:31,693
Five months.

85
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:33,278
Maybe we need to think
about the possibility

86
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:35,113
that Diaz is
off the grid for good.

87
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,957
I can't believe that.

88
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,827
I know this
must be so frustrating...

89
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:42,954
Losing all sense
of agency like this.

90
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:44,414
Being out of control, I know,

91
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,717
is not your strong suit.

92
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:48,794
I'm focusing on what
I can control.

93
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,546
What's that?

94
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:53,799
Keep my head down.

95
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,343
Hopefully shorten my sentence.

96
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,136
That's smart.

97
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:01,106
I think that's a good play.

98
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:04,226
But I worry about the toll

99
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:06,236
that's going to take
on you, Oliver.

100
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:07,729
Cuts heal, John.

101
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:09,948
Not physically, bro.

102
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:13,735
Keeping passive,
not fighting back.

103
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:16,196
Never been who you were.

104
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:19,083
I've always done
what I had to do.

105
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,745
Right now...

106
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:26,373
This is what I have to do.

107
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,500
Don't lose yourself
in here, Oliver.

108
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:30,010
I'll be ok.

109
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:34,506
Damn it.

110
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,974
What's up?

111
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,759
We're supposed to go
live on this app today,

112
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,386
but something in the upgrade

113
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,263
is corrupting
the break. It's...

114
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:42,848
Can I take a look?

115
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,558
Be my guest.

116
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:46,777
Oh, yeah.

117
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:49,688
Are you some sort of, like,
secret tech wiz or something?

118
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:52,366
I just know my way
around a computer.

119
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,785
There you go.

120
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,329
You are a woman of many
talents, Erin. It's...

121
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,290
Saving the world one
Espresso at a time.

122
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:03,794
This coffee's crap.

123
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,746
I'll make sure to take
it up with our barista.

124
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:08,465
You ready to talk?

125
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,967
To a beat cop?

126
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:12,210
I've already wasted
enough of my time.

127
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,045
I want to talk to your captain.

128
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:16,214
You sure about that?

129
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,967
Because officer anastas
is a lot more patient

130
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,477
than I am.

131
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:23,313
Lady captain? Oh, nice.

132
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,983
Hmm. Well, you have

133
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,144
quite the list of allegations
against you, huh?

134
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,321
Fraud, racketeering,
embezzlement.

135
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,157
The key word being allegations.

136
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:37,235
Well, where there's smoke,
there's fire, Mr. Stent.

137
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:39,070
And in my experience,
innocent men

138
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:40,998
don't typically show up bound
and gagged at my doorstep

139
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,332
without reason.

140
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,409
There's a reason, all right.

141
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,078
The green arrow.

142
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:48,622
Maybe you hit your head
a little too hard,

143
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,174
but Oliver queen is in prison.

144
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,584
Then there's another
psycho in green leather

145
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:54,678
assaulting people with
a bow and arrow.

146
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:57,631
There have been no vigilantes
in this city for 5 months.

147
00:09:57,707 --> 00:10:00,008
Looks like you got your work cut
out for you, then, don't you?

148
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,135
Now, are you gonna let me go,

149
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:03,803
or do I have to sue your asses?

150
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,431
Yeah. Just as soon

151
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:08,400
as officer anastas
takes your statement...

152
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:15,106
Very slowly.

153
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:20,362
Guys, guys, remember,
always keep your hands high.

154
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:22,322
That's your guard.

155
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,949
Tony, yeah. In and out.

156
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,367
Yeah, but keep your distance.

157
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:26,877
Nice one, peanut.

158
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,620
Isn't it bad to punch things?

159
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,547
Ms. Lopez says
Gandhi wasn't violent.

160
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:32,290
Gandhi ain't from the glades.

161
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:37,387
Besides, self-defense isn't
about being violent.

162
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,798
It's about being focused
and disciplined

163
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,841
so you can protect yourself
and the ones that you love.

164
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:46,388
That's just 'cause there's no more
heroes to keep us safe, right?

165
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:49,015
Hey, dad, my bag's leaking.

166
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:53,478
Uh, nothing a little
duct tape can't fix.

167
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,072
Are we ever gonna get new stuff?

168
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:57,232
This bag's kind of gross.

169
00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:59,192
Still waiting to hit
that lottery, Zoe.

170
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,320
Besides, gross builds character.

171
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:04,990
Ten-minute break while I
patch these things up.

172
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,584
What's up with you, man?

173
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,419
This class is dumb.

174
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,745
Boxing's not gonna win you
a fight in the glades,

175
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:11,746
and you know it.

176
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:13,164
Boxing's not about winning.

177
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,749
It's about being focused
and disciplined

178
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,501
so you don't have to fight.

179
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,420
You mean with, like,
a hockey mask?

180
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,754
Come on, man.

181
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:21,131
Everyone here knows
that you're wild dog

182
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,340
after that trial.

183
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,550
And you just didn't
punch people.

184
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,343
I don't do that anymore.

185
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,596
Yeah? Maybe you should.

186
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:31,182
'Cause my family just
got robbed last week.

187
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,768
And the cops don't care
about us in the glades.

188
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,572
So it's on us
to protect ourselves.

189
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:40,242
Hitting these bags
isn't gonna do it.

190
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,459
You know, I ain't into
blondes myself.

191
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,703
Put that down.

192
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,580
Slow your roll, arrow.

193
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:57,250
You wouldn't want this
conversation to get messy.

194
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:59,210
You know I can just take
that from you, right?

195
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,212
Well, that'd be a good thing.

196
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,381
You see, it'd save us
the trouble of planting it

197
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,133
when we rat you out to yorke,

198
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:07,052
just like you did to Turner.

199
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:08,970
Now, I know you're
trying to get back

200
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,930
to this pretty little face.

201
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:13,808
You're probably counting
down the days.

202
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,769
Just tell me what you want.

203
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:17,646
Yeah. Well, you see...

204
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:19,773
You see, me and Sampson here,

205
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:22,984
we've got a 3-man
operation with Turner.

206
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:24,819
Side hustle.

207
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,165
And, uh, because of you,
we're a man down.

208
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:31,409
So I think you
should take his place.

209
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,078
No chance.

210
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:36,956
Now, here's two reasons
why I don't believe you.

211
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,634
Now, I bet you really wish you

212
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,212
hadn't have stopped merlyn
from killing me, don't you?

213
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,851
See you soon, arrow.

214
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:57,811
So I can sell cheap
to the culebras, no problem.

215
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:59,696
Whatever you want,
Mr. Stent.

216
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:03,200
Heh. You got it. I got you.

217
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,610
My man.

218
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:07,704
This ain't no playground, kid.
Keep it moving.

219
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,489
Y'all sell guns, right?

220
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:11,449
That depends.

221
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,876
How much money you got,
little man?

222
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:14,878
He's not interested.

223
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:17,214
You followed me?

224
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,207
Yeah, I figured you would
do something stupid,

225
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,042
and it looks like I was right.

226
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:24,462
Hold on.

227
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,390
I know you.

228
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,633
You're the one that dropped
a dime on Oliver queen.

229
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,553
Uh, crazy dog
or something like that.

230
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:34,189
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let's go. Come on.

231
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:39,018
Unfortunately for you,

232
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,571
you just saw my whole operation.

233
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:46,025
And that can't be good
for anybody.

234
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:48,036
Get down.

235
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:26,283
You ok?

236
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:28,359
Was that the green arrow?

237
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,746
I don't know who
the hell that is.

238
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:42,624
We should turn around!
It's not safe.

239
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:44,292
But is it impossible?

240
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,545
No, not impossible,
but it's not very smart.

241
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,139
Then how about I add
another 100 grand

242
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,882
to the 200,000
I've already paid you?

243
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,134
Most people would pay
that kind of money

244
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:55,094
to stay away from here.

245
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:58,598
This place must be very
important for you.

246
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,350
It's not the place.

247
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,986
It's the person I'm
hoping to find there.

248
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:19,078
- Hey.
- Hey.

249
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:21,456
Thanks for your help
the other day.

250
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:22,915
Yeah, it was nothing.

251
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:24,292
Ah, it was more than nothing.

252
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:26,294
The app's number one
thanks to your genius.

253
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:29,088
Oh, well, I'm pretty
sure I just touched

254
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:31,174
somebody's snotty snot rag,

255
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:33,301
so I am also living the dream.

256
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:35,470
Ha ha. Well, I hope I'm
not one of those customers

257
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:36,929
that you secretly
complain about.

258
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:40,099
You? No. You're
polite and nice.

259
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:41,976
And your hygiene is fairly on
point from what I can tell.

260
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:43,936
The bar seems pretty low.

261
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:45,855
Yeah. You should work here a
month, you might change your mind.

262
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:49,984
You could always... I don't
know... change my mind over dinner?

263
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,113
Unless if that just put me
on your creepy customer list.

264
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,365
You're asking me out.

265
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,033
And now I'm regretting it.

266
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:58,534
No. I mean, I'm
flattered and everything,

267
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,621
because, like,
"whoa. Still got it!"

268
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,049
Not interested? I... I get it.

269
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,293
No, you definitely don't get it.

270
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,879
Breaking news
out of star city this morning

271
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,890
as the d.A.'S office
is set to comment

272
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:14,717
on growing speculation
that the vigilante known

273
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:17,470
as the green arrow has returned.

274
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,722
For an official statement
from the district attorney,

275
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,399
we go live to city hall.

276
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,026
- Are the rumors true?
- Is the green arrow really back?

277
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:24,569
Did Oliver queen escape?

278
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,905
Do you have any idea
who's under that mask?

279
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:28,898
We have reason to believe

280
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,243
that a vigilante impersonating
the green arrow is out there.

281
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,862
While we're still pursuing leads
as to the identity

282
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:39,325
of this unknown assailant, we
can tell you with 100% certainty

283
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:41,744
that he is not Oliver queen.

284
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:43,246
This is someone new.

285
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:45,039
You said, "assailant."

286
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:46,424
Does that mean city hall
considers this new green arrow

287
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,592
a threat?

288
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,544
To the rule of law? Absolutely.

289
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,089
Star city continues to employ
a zero-tolerance policy

290
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,050
against any and all acts of
vigilantism.

291
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:01,597
Anyone found committing or
aiding and abetting these acts

292
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:06,018
will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

293
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:08,187
Think she's full of crap?

294
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:09,948
You really have to ask me that?

295
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,566
You done giving your statement?

296
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:14,360
Green guy with a bow and arrow

297
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:16,955
takes down a weapons deal
and saves my ass.

298
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:18,781
If you ask me, you should
be helping this guy,

299
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,366
not hunting him down,

300
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,201
especially with Diaz
still out there.

301
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,203
Diaz has been gone for months,

302
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,538
and the FBI still has
its eye on us.

303
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:27,790
So as much as I doubt
Laurel's motives...

304
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,968
And, uh, believe me, I do...

305
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:32,211
Taking a hard-line stance
was the right play,

306
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:34,380
because if agent Watson
even so much as suspects

307
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:35,807
we have something to
do with this...

308
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:37,550
Our immunity goes adios.

309
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,385
That's right. And that's
why we have got to find

310
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:41,387
this green arrow wannabe
and shut him down.

311
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:44,983
Rene, we all agreed,
for better or for worse,

312
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,642
we were not gonna go out
as vigilantes.

313
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:48,769
Otherwise, what was
Oliver's sacrifice for?

314
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:50,989
Ok, so we're supposed
to just ignore

315
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:53,733
the rising crime rate
and do nothing about it?

316
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,827
Actually, I think risking
my officers every day

317
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:57,495
fighting to maintain
law and order is

318
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:58,654
doing something about it.

319
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,823
I... I get that, d.,

320
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,659
but Oliver asked us to carry on.

321
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,870
So whoever's behind
that mask is doing

322
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:07,622
what we're supposed to be doing.

323
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:09,582
But he's not
helping the problem.

324
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:11,843
Actually, he's making it worse.

325
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,670
Rene, I'm not saying

326
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,256
that we can't still be
heroes to this city.

327
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,309
We just have to do it in a
little bit of a different way.

328
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:24,430
So where you at
finding this wannabe?

329
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:27,308
Well, we retrieved a few
arrows from the scene,

330
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,268
but forensics still
turned up empty.

331
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:30,770
But what about the perp?

332
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:33,031
Any pattern as to how he's
selecting his targets?

333
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:35,033
This weapons dealer has a
rap sheet 12 feet long.

334
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:36,651
He was an obvious Mark.

335
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,369
But this first guy...
Stent...

336
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,363
I still haven't figured out
how he fits into the puzzle.

337
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:42,698
You don't think he's innocent.

338
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,158
This guy? Hell, no.

339
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,660
But his rap sheet's only clean

340
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:47,161
because he paid
to make sure it was.

341
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:48,663
Well, it looks like you
might have to take

342
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,215
a deep dive through
his financials.

343
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,874
Yeah.
But I can't exactly

344
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:53,459
subpoena his records
based on a hunch.

345
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,003
Who said anything about
a subpoena?

346
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,797
I really miss this, guys.

347
00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:00,341
Not that I don't like being
the head of R&D at a.R.G.U.S.

348
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:03,010
It has better benefits, as in
there are actually benefits.

349
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,562
I just miss the team.

350
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,347
Less talking, more typing.

351
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:07,974
Right! Sorry. Uh, it should
only be a couple of minutes

352
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,475
before I'm in, which Felicity
could beat one-handed.

353
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,310
Miss her.

354
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,562
I really appreciate
the assist here, you guys.

355
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:14,522
You especially, John.

356
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,407
I know you've been in some hot
water here at a.R.G.U.S.,

357
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:17,733
burning so many of their
resources going after Diaz.

358
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,485
Well, Lyla's down
at hq right now,

359
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:21,079
trying to smooth things over.

360
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:23,322
Besides, I want to get
this green arrow imposter

361
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,740
off the streets as bad as you.

362
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:26,492
I don't want Watson
thinking that Oliver

363
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,744
set this in motion
in some type of way.

364
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:30,663
There's enough trouble as it is.

365
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,549
How's he holding up?

366
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,502
He's surviving.

367
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,796
- And that's a bingo.
- What did you find?

368
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,298
How stent's been
making his money.

369
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,924
And it's not from
defrauding pensions.

370
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,269
He's been peddling
black-market arms.

371
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,512
What kind of dumbass leaves his
entire criminal enterprise online?

372
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,439
He was actually
pretty smart about it.

373
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,266
He kept himself clean,
off the radar,

374
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:53,227
activities washed through
a series of shell corporations.

375
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:54,937
I just happen
to be smarter. Boo-ya.

376
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:56,772
So this is how the
targets are connected.

377
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,783
Stent supplied the
weapons, Medina sold them.

378
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,027
The vigilante's trying to shut
down stent's whole network.

379
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:03,621
Yeah. And according to this
text exchange, he's panicked.

380
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:05,364
Stent's trying to sell the
rest of his inventory off

381
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:07,074
in a huge buy tonight.

382
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,951
Do we have a location?

383
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,369
Not until an hour
before the buy.

384
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:11,996
I'll keep you guys posted.

385
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:14,707
That's where we'll find
our green arrow wannabe.

386
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:18,303
So, uh, any guesses
on who this might be?

387
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,755
Well, my money was on John.

388
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,307
Whoever it is,

389
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:24,559
they won't be hiding
under the hood for long.

390
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:31,807
If you don't hear from me in
a week, I'm not coming back.

391
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:33,643
I hope you do.

392
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,561
You know, you pay me
a lot of money to do

393
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,563
very stupid things.

394
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,241
Always a pleasure.

395
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,447
This food isn't as bad as
I thought it'd be...

396
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:30,950
You can't sit here.

397
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:33,711
It's just like high school.

398
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,705
I don't really know how
to be much clearer

399
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:37,832
than I've been being.

400
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:40,042
Go away.

401
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:41,836
So what do you think
about your replacement?

402
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:43,879
It's got to bug you there's
a new guy that can do

403
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,340
all the things that you
can't do anymore.

404
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,718
Ok. Just because I have
decided to let you sit here

405
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:50,845
doesn't mean that we're
having a conversation.

406
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:52,438
You understand?

407
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:58,310
- You ready to hustle?
- No.

408
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:02,648
Listen, if you try to
leverage my family ever again,

409
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:05,067
I will expose whatever
it is you have going on

410
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:08,821
to every single guard in here.

411
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:10,331
Disappointed to hear that.

412
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:15,086
We'll just have to try
this a different way.

413
00:22:15,163 --> 00:22:16,954
This your new friend?

414
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:20,425
It's nothing to do with him.

415
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:22,135
- It is now.
- I didn't do anything.

416
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:26,055
Do you want to come
with us now, queen?

417
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:29,925
No.

418
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:31,135
Oliver.

419
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,937
I can't help you.

420
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:35,848
Oliver... don't.

421
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:40,278
Don't. Please... uh! Uh!

422
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,497
Looking pretty crazy out there.

423
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,332
I wanted everyone ready to move

424
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:00,717
the second Curtis
has a location.

425
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:02,544
With any luck, we'll
establish a perimeter

426
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,128
and gain some lead time.

427
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:06,389
And if that vigilante shows up?

428
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:08,058
Then we take him down, too.

429
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:10,218
I still don't think
you should do that.

430
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:12,637
I thought we settled this, Rene.

431
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:15,065
For the last few months,
all I kept hearing is

432
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:16,849
how scared my kids at
the center were.

433
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:20,186
And then this green arrow
wannabe shows up,

434
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,522
and they have hope again.

435
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,482
So, to me, that's worth
a hell of a lot more

436
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,077
than our immunity deal,
rule of law,

437
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:29,904
whatever the hell crap
Laurel said.

438
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:32,082
Sometimes people just need
something to believe in.

439
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,325
Right. I get it, Rene.
I really do.

440
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:36,536
But how do you know you
can believe in this guy?

441
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,037
You don't know
what his motives are.

442
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:39,422
You don't even know who he is.

443
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:41,708
I know he could've let
me die, and he didn't.

444
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,593
That's good enough for me.

445
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,096
Yeah? You sure
he saved you?

446
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:47,430
Or were you just not his target?

447
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,424
Because there's a big,
big difference.

448
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,222
Curtis?

449
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,849
The buy's going down in an hour.

450
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:59,985
Old manufacturing plant
by the wharf.

451
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:05,398
You arrest
that vigilante, d.,

452
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:07,191
you're making a big mistake.

453
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:10,787
No, Rene.
I'm doing my job.

454
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:24,250
Felicity...

455
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:26,753
Hey. Sorry. Did I wake you?

456
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:28,138
I couldn't sleep.

457
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,464
Everything ok?

458
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,424
I guess.

459
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:33,217
How was school today?

460
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,136
The same. It sucked.

461
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:37,388
Well, did you at least
crush your geometry test?

462
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:41,651
Yeah. I just miss
my old school.

463
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,770
And I miss old my job.

464
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:45,989
I really, really miss your dad.

465
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,690
Me, too.

466
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,618
At least we still have
each other, right?

467
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:54,456
How much longer do we
have to stay here for?

468
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,460
I don't know.

469
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:28,106
Are you ok?

470
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,576
What do you care?

471
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,613
I'm not gonna survive in here.

472
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,199
Yeah, you will.
You'll be fine.

473
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,327
You... you just left
me to die.

474
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,046
I...

475
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,540
I knew that they
didn't want to kill you

476
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,458
because they...

477
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:50,378
I knew that they
were coming after me.

478
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:52,222
So you just let them
beat the crap out of me?

479
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:56,393
I'm on the guards' radar

480
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:58,469
after what happened
the other day.

481
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,105
And I...

482
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,067
I get another strike against me,

483
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:06,185
and I'm back to square one,

484
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:08,563
and I want to get
back to my family.

485
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:10,231
I can't...

486
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,242
I can't do that to them.

487
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:16,705
I have family, too. Did
you ever think about that?

488
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,077
I mean, I shouldn't
even be in here.

489
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:27,090
I was wrongfully
accused of murder.

490
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:30,918
And that's what
the city's like now.

491
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,004
There's no justice.

492
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,598
Just keep your head
down, you'll be fine.

493
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:39,269
That... that's your advice?

494
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:43,440
All this time, I thought
you had a raw deal,

495
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:45,892
like I did.

496
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:47,518
But it makes sense now

497
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:49,687
why there's a new
green arrow out there.

498
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:53,065
Because the old one is a coward.

499
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:56,286
Lights out!

500
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:04,118
There's close to $1
million worth of product here.

501
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:05,962
All yours for 400k.

502
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,789
What's the catch?

503
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:09,540
I got burned out
on the business.

504
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:11,801
I decided to liquidate
for my mental health.

505
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:19,258
Stent's about to make
the exchange.

506
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:21,135
Should we move in?

507
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:22,929
We can make this bust
in our sleep.

508
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:25,815
I'm waiting for the vigilante.

509
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:32,939
400k of assorted
cryptocurrencies,

510
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:34,574
as requested.

511
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,402
I do miss the old ways.

512
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,905
You mean a briefcase
full of money? No, thanks.

513
00:27:47,238 --> 00:27:49,714
That's him. Move!

514
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:20,778
Please. I'll give
you anything.

515
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:23,906
I have what I came for.

516
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:27,836
Jason stent, you have
failed this city.

517
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,503
Drop your weapon now.

518
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:39,180
Don't be stupid.

519
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:46,312
Vigilante heading north!

520
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:57,866
Where the hell are you hiding?

521
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:07,533
I was just trying to get free!

522
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,335
You never should have come here.

523
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,510
Morning, 4587.

524
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:26,146
Beautiful day.

525
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,192
Ohh, you think I'd be sick
of coffee by now.

526
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,403
Will?

527
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,909
Heh heh. Hey, Erin,

528
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,587
you're a hard woman to find.

529
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,511
No one to save you now.

530
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:50,513
It's just you and me.

531
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:52,056
I swear to god, if you hurt him.

532
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,775
You're gonna do what?

533
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,768
You're gonna sic Oliver
after me?

534
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:57,946
Right now, he's realizing

535
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,198
how difficult prison life is.

536
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:13,127
What the hell do you want?

537
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:17,090
Pretty simple, actually.

538
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:21,794
I want Oliver to spend

539
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:25,131
the rest of his life
in prison knowing

540
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:26,975
I killed his wife.

541
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,227
Oh, thank god,
you monologue. Run now!

542
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,964
No!

543
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,139
You're gonna suffer for that.

544
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:27,535
The only reason you're
still breathing is

545
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,986
so you can hear this message:

546
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:30,780
Diaz found Felicity.

547
00:32:30,856 --> 00:32:32,373
Your wife is dead.

548
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,678
I, um...

549
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:55,347
I need to make a phone call.

550
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:56,890
Rough night, 4587?

551
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,517
I have reason to believe

552
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,435
that my family
has been attacked.

553
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:03,480
Please allow me to make
a phone call.

554
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:06,024
You know you don't have
phone privileges.

555
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:08,535
You got a visitor, though.

556
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:28,764
You're ok.

557
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:33,510
How's William?

558
00:33:33,587 --> 00:33:35,437
He's fine.

559
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,807
Are you?

560
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,350
I am now.

561
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:42,486
I've missed you.

562
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,156
I love you so much.

563
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,901
And I'm so sorry
that I wasn't there.

564
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:51,695
I should have been there.

565
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:53,446
How could you have been?

566
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:55,323
The only reason that I'm here is

567
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,367
to keep you and William safe.

568
00:33:57,444 --> 00:33:59,911
Yeah. I know.

569
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:01,830
I need you to tell John

570
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,915
to set the two of you up
with new identities.

571
00:34:03,926 --> 00:34:05,417
I need...

572
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,755
I need you... I need
you back

573
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:12,841
in the witness
protection program.

574
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,176
I have William set up

575
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,722
at a boarding school
in Cambridge.

576
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:20,348
He leaves tomorrow.

577
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,559
You're not going with him?

578
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:25,353
No, I'm not.

579
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,772
- Felicity...
- I'm done hiding, Oliver.

580
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,108
I'm done being a person
who doesn't fight back.

581
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,736
Diaz broke in, and all
I could think about was

582
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:34,362
protecting William.

583
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,365
I tried, and I couldn't do it.

584
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,243
If a.R.G.U.S. Hadn't gotten
there when they did...

585
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,130
Do you know what it feels like

586
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,415
not being able
to protect your family?

587
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:49,136
I have lived with that
feeling every second

588
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,962
since I stepped
in here, Felicity.

589
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,797
Don't...

590
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:54,924
Don't tempt that,

591
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:57,644
please.

592
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,605
Please.

593
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:04,559
I am begging you to go back

594
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,810
to witness protection.

595
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:09,606
No. I won't.

596
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:13,535
You don't get to decide
this time, Oliver.

597
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:18,165
I love you,

598
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,909
and I will always...

599
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,838
Always wait for you.

600
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,625
But I can't let what happened

601
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:30,460
to William and I happen again.

602
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:32,179
I can't.

603
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:36,257
I have to fight back.

604
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,927
You, of all people,
understand that.

605
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,013
Time's up, 4587.

606
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:44,641
I... I need a bit more time.

607
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:46,652
And I don't care.

608
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:53,108
I love you.

609
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,277
Ok. Ok.

610
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,455
I love you.

611
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,333
Hey, guys, listen up.
I got some news.

612
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,293
We need more duct tape, dad.

613
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,878
Not anymore, peanut.

614
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:15,463
We got ourselves
some new equipment.

615
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,849
I'm talking about bags, gloves.

616
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,851
You were talking about you
wanted some new shoes, right?

617
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,386
We got that, too.

618
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:23,188
Hey, you win
the lottery or something?

619
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,556
Nah. I just got some help
from somebody looking out.

620
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,892
But I thought you said
the old stuff builds character.

621
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,770
That... that was before I knew
we would get newer stuff.

622
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:32,981
Dad?

623
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,732
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ok.

624
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:36,493
Uh, keep practicing.

625
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,902
And when we get back,

626
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,621
we're gonna be ripping
these bags apart.

627
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:45,743
Hey.
What's up, d.?

628
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,121
What brings you to these parts?

629
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:52,667
Well, uh, a couple of mom and
pop shops called the precinct.

630
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,794
They said they opened up
to find cash waiting.

631
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:57,681
It seems like 15 other
hard-up businesses

632
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,133
from the glades also got the same
exact amount that went missing

633
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:01,968
from the weapons buy
the other night.

634
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:04,679
So, uh, you wouldn't happen
to know anything about that,

635
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,763
would you?

636
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,307
Uh, no. No. I can't...

637
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:10,143
But it does sound like
the work of a hero, though.

638
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,770
That's what it feels like.

639
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,364
I should be arresting you

640
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,366
for the crap you pulled
the other night.

641
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,943
Do you have any idea the position
you're putting me in, Rene?

642
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,695
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
d., all right?

643
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,363
But I couldn't let you
lock him up.

644
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,207
He's not a criminal,
and you know it.

645
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,908
No, I don't.

646
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,827
And it's not a leap of
faith I'm willing to take.

647
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:30,788
You know, I am working so hard
to restore the city's faith

648
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,958
in the men and women
who serve it.

649
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,377
Rene, if you go out there
as wild dog again,

650
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,796
I will not hesitate
to lock you up

651
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:40,715
just like that vigilante.

652
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,559
Are you serious, d.?

653
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,135
I just want you to think
long and hard

654
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,179
about what that means, ok?

655
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:49,557
For these kids and for Zoe

656
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,027
and for our city, man.

657
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:55,989
'Cause I'm not gonna give
you a second warning.

658
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:05,823
- Hey.
- Hey.

659
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,408
How is he?

660
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,827
Quiet. Reading, mostly.

661
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:11,996
I'll give you two a minute.

662
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:13,339
Thank you.

663
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,506
Hey.

664
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,759
Did you see him?

665
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,094
I did.

666
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,979
I wish I could've come with you.

667
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,681
Yeah, me, too.

668
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:32,683
It's too dangerous.

669
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,019
No one can know
that you're here.

670
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:37,614
Hey, I got something for you.

671
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,529
What's this?

672
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,864
It's a symbol of reconnection.

673
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:48,574
Your aunt thea gave it to me

674
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:50,076
before she left town,

675
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,961
and it's something your
father had given her.

676
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,747
As long as you have this,

677
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:57,166
I will always be able
to find you.

678
00:38:57,177 --> 00:38:58,960
I don't understand.

679
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,753
You have to go somewhere.

680
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,882
It's super-super safe.

681
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,769
I can't come with you.

682
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,804
- You're leaving me.
- I'm not leaving you.

683
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,856
It's only temporary, ok?

684
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,267
Just until we get Diaz,
I promise.

685
00:39:14,343 --> 00:39:16,310
And then as soon as we do,
I'm gonna come get you.

686
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,321
It's all gonna be over...

687
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,950
I swear.

688
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,922
Check it out.

689
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,766
Queen, you don't look
too hot there.

690
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:49,519
Maybe I can help you... uh!

691
00:39:56,385 --> 00:39:59,478
Stand down.

692
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:01,739
Don't be a hero.

693
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,600
You should've killed me.

694
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,428
Who sent you?

695
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,047
No one.

696
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:09,766
But you knew my father.

697
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,759
How am I supposed to know
who your old man is?

698
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,845
No.

699
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:16,931
My father...

700
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,234
Is Oliver queen.

701
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,158
William?

702
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:02,277
Greg, move your head!
