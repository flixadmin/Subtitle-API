1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,446
<i>Remember last night
when you asked after Mama?</i>

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,570
<i>Do they always have to do
the stock taking at night, Arthur?</i>

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,801
I'm gonna have a baby.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,726
What business do you have
with the Russians, Tommy?

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,040
<i>I've been to the factories</i>

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,929
<i>and the armoured vehicles
are in good condition.</i>

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,845
"A factory break-in,"
that's what you said.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,160
When you go home today,

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,083
be sure to check
under your little boy's pillow.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,645
<i>We can reach anyone.</i>

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>Anywhere.</i>

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,840
<i>The priest is passing
information about the robbery</i>

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,729
<i>to a Lloyds underwriter called Monkland.</i>

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,326
Why would the priest
pass information to our enemies?

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,808
<i>The complexities are your business.</i>

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,284
Now give me permission
to kill the priest.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,403
Watch out, John-Boy,
he has got a strong left.

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,563
Arthur, John, Finn. Come here.

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,249
All right, what is it?

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,202
This letter says that Dad's dead.

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,928
He was in Boston
in a bar called the Mickey Free.

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,001
Two men waiting in an alley.
He was shot twice.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,684
Who's Rosie Rice?

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,685
Some fucking whore.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,764
She is a woman
who took the trouble to write to us.

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,845
And she wanted us to know
that during the night,

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,650
while he was dying,
he asked for our forgiveness.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,325
The only thing he ever taught us
was how to kill and cut a stag.

30
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,930
- Finn, John, you won't remember.
- I remember. Cannock Chase.

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,681
Parked up at a pub called the Griffin.

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,090
He got drunk and sang <i>Silver Dagger</i>
about 100 times.

33
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,605
Yeah. One weekend.

34
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,882
One weekend he was like that.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,928
The stag is to remember him.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,371
We eat and then we forget him.

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,848
No need to forgive him. Agreed?

38
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,967
John, I have to say this.

39
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,520
You can name your new baby after him
if you like.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,726
No.

41
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,449
Arthur, I won't even ask.

42
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,130
So his name dies.

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,764
It's been in the family for a long time,
but now it's gone.

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,166
All right, that's done. Fuck him.

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,004
Before we cook and eat,
there's some business.

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,081
Boys!

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,690
I wanted to say this out here, 'cause
I don't trust the maids in the house.

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,524
There's gonna be a robbery.

49
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,450
- I wish to confess.
- There's no confessional today.

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,965
The name's Shelby.

51
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,362
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

52
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,364
Today is a holy day.

53
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,887
Look, I came. I made myself.

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,081
Have you been drinking?

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,400
I couldn't sleep.

56
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,770
I tried to get enough down me
to get myself to sleep, but...

57
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,969
I just do these night vigils
by myself, thinking...

58
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,642
How long since your last confession?

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,965
I don't remember.

60
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,328
Mrs Shelby,
do you have something to confess?

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,042
Do you know it is actually "Gray"?
My name is Elizabeth Gray.

62
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,044
Yeah. Do you think God calls me
Pol or Polly?

63
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,769
The voice calls me Pol.

64
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,530
You hear a voice?

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,689
- Yeah. Like Bernadette heard a voice.
- And what does the voice say?

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,166
"Murderer."

67
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,049
It says this to you?

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,331
It's in my head.
Who else would it be talking to?

69
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,008
And are you a murderer?

70
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,531
If you're talking about the law, then...

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,604
Yes.

72
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,604
- I'll be out in a moment, Peter.
- Yes, Father.

73
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,330
Are you saying
you want to confess to a murder?

74
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,767
No.

75
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,090
My confession is that I feel no regret.

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,291
He was a policeman.
He was a bad man. He hurt me.

77
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,242
I do the things I do
so that my son doesn't have to do them.

78
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,204
It's just the wiping away of the shit
from under your feet.

79
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,250
The taking of any human life
is a mortal sin.

80
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,008
No, the unjust taking of a human life
is a mortal sin.

81
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,129
Look it up. Look who did it.

82
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,965
Moses, Samson, Lord Kitchener.

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,161
Are you saying
you took the life of a policeman?

84
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,526
Oh, Father.

85
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,761
Now there is another life to be taken.

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,843
If there is a voice telling you
to take a life, you must ignore it.

87
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,163
The voice doesn't tell me.
The voice asks me.

88
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,208
It says, "Pol,

89
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,531
"does this way of excusing
a murder still work

90
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,610
"if the life that is going to be taken
is a consecrated man?"

91
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,970
He's a man of the cloth.

92
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,524
He's a holy man.

93
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,171
What kind of holy man?

94
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,166
It's not fair.

95
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,762
They're off drinking and shooting rifles
as we sit here.

96
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,808
Listen to the mugs swearing,

97
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,646
spitting on the bloody floor
for us to fucking wipe up!

98
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,248
Without men here,
they'd be like dogs pissing up the wall.

99
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,002
I was just saying it's not fair.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,968
The men are down there like lords.

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,604
Esme, just...

102
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,485
Get on with it.

103
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,202
I'm bloody five months gone.

104
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,405
- I forgot the combination.
- 24-8-22.

105
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,922
How do you know
the paper cash combination?

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,651
- Tommy talks in his sleep.
- Shut up, Esme.

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,490
He's changed the combination.

108
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,289
- You've put it in wrong.
- No, I haven't.

109
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,565
Your hands are shaking.

110
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,769
And actually, I am sleeping with Tommy,
OK? Now and then.

111
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,566
Because he wants to, now and then.
When the mood takes him.

112
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,041
Except we don't sleep.

113
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,771
It's hard to sleep
bent over a desk, isn't it?

114
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,327
Happy?

115
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,802
None of it's fucking fair.

116
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,485
It's two hours' work.

117
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,449
Bit of grease on your cuffs,
and that's it.

118
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,204
Tommy, should I really be here for this?

119
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,964
I've cleared it with Polly.

120
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,520
There's no way around it.
We need you to know.

121
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,286
Who the fuck wants to buy
27 stolen armoured cars?

122
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,566
A foolish man.

123
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,642
And how much
is this foolish man paying?

124
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,850
£150,000. Cash, diamonds and sapphires.

125
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,849
So that's 20 for you, Charlie.

126
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,408
Isiah, there's 5 to you.

127
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,723
The rest we take to America
to invest in legally-acquired property.

128
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,884
Assets bought
with untraceable income resold,

129
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,361
and the profits reinvested
to make sure it's clean.

130
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,010
And after that, I suppose,

131
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,970
the whole business
will be like that stag

132
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,929
hanging up over there, right, Tom?

133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,809
Well, with profits on this scale,

134
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,724
we'll be in a position
to stop the off-track business for good.

135
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,326
Keep the pubs, stop the protection.

136
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,644
Horses for the sport
and race days for a lark.

137
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,369
I made a promise to Charles' mother.

138
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,728
Now, I also made a promise to Linda.

139
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,241
I know.

140
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,923
I can see it in your eyes, man.

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,809
Part of the reason
for doing this last job

142
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,771
is so you'll be set up
when you do decide to walk away.

143
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,605
Look at you, Arthur.

144
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,927
A man that wants to live a clean life,

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,482
but here you are signing up for
the biggest robbery of all.

146
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,010
I have to hand it to you, Tom.

147
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,966
- You're a smart man.
- You in or out, Charlie?

148
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,841
Curly?

149
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,166
Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.

150
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,810
- Oh, shut up. Shut up.
- Bad luck.

151
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,448
How do we know this foolish man will
hand over the diamonds when we're done?

152
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,090
We don't.

153
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,525
But that's another business.

154
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,563
Right, let's cook some meat.

155
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,485
Can't wait to
part with their money,

156
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,005
stupid bastards.

157
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,923
It's all right, it's me.

158
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,201
Arthur said you'd be short-staffed today
because they are on a works outing.

159
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,645
Piss-up, actually.

160
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,809
I brought sandwiches
and the lemonade I made myself.

161
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,323
I'll make tea and empty ashtrays,
but I won't handle money or slips.

162
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,804
Arthur says what you do here
is illegal, but not immoral.

163
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,921
Depends what time
you get here, Linda.

164
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,285
And anyway,

165
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,648
I thought I'd offer you my physical and
spiritual support in your time of need.

166
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,165
Oh, Linda, if you want to be a help,

167
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,369
run up to the shops
and get me 20 Senior Service.

168
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,690
- Lizzie'll give you the change.
- No, I won't.

169
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,411
Actually, I'll use my own money, Polly.

170
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,687
And before you ladies decide to find me
so amusing, I have a message for you.

171
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,807
Oh, God, no, Linda.

172
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,609
I've been to church already. Have you?

173
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,842
It's not a message from God, Polly.

174
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,969
- It's from Jessie Eden.
- Who's Jessie Eden?

175
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,884
She's the lady shop steward
at the Lucas factory in Sparkhill.

176
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,291
Lady shop steward?

177
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,964
She's bringing all the female workers

178
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,804
in the spot-welding
and wire-cutting shops

179
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,006
out on strike for the day.

180
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,965
In protest at being made to work
on a holy day.

181
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,489
Poor conditions, lack of holidays,
unsanitary lavatory provisions

182
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,562
and lower pay for female workers.

183
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,124
Apparently, all the female
factory workers in the city

184
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,168
are joining the protest in sympathy

185
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,641
and will walk out of
their places of work at 9 a.m.

186
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,291
to march on the Bull Ring.

187
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,091
All oppressed female workers welcome.

188
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,924
Them bastards down there shooting deer.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,241
Me five months gone,
sat here like a pudding.

190
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,607
Only one outside lavatory
between the lot of us.

191
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,841
Not consulted.

192
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,649
Bent over a fucking desk.

193
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,566
Ladies, I honestly believe
those who march on Good Friday

194
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,130
will have God on their side.

195
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,651
It's 9 o'clock, ladies!

196
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,529
Open the fucking door!

197
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,046
Fuck it.

198
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,968
I'm not in the mood today.

199
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,084
Let's go to the Bull Ring.

200
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,211
Hallelujah!

201
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,044
The foolish man?

202
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,731
Not quite.

203
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,530
I'm sorry I came unannounced.

204
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,207
What do you want?

205
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,325
We need proof.

206
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,282
Proof Of what?

207
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,362
You said the priest is a traitor.

208
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,284
We need to know how you know.

209
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,685
The proof is my word.

210
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,001
If he is involved, I'm out.
He needs to die.

211
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,250
Are you always so violent?

212
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,725
I killed a stag today,

213
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,284
and it hurt me to do it.

214
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,767
But I treated it with respect,

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,127
and the spare meat
will go to poor people.

216
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,845
It will grieve me far less
to put a bullet in the priest's face.

217
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,001
Will you not sit when a duchess sits?

218
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,046
I'm told you're part of the deal.
Is that true?

219
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,363
The Royal Court in Tbilisi
actually worked very efficiently.

220
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,125
Ah, I see. And it worked like this, eh?

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,966
There were lots of
corridors and small rooms.

222
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,280
Attics.

223
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,727
There were no rules there.
Deals were done.

224
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,768
Brothers gave sisters,
aunts gave uncles,

225
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,604
fathers gave daughters and servants.

226
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,847
It was my aunt's idea that I came alone.

227
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,369
She is in charge of this.

228
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,330
When there are no rules,
women take charge.

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,482
They understand that the power they have
comes through silent agreements.

230
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,360
I've promised I will do everything I can
to make this plan work.

231
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,330
My aunt assumed you would want me
as part of the deal.

232
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,571
I will tell her she's wrong.

233
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,165
Tommy,
you ain't gonna believe this, man.

234
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,967
I just phoned the garrison, right?
I just spoke to Billy.

235
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,648
He says Polly, Esme and Lizzie have
gone on fucking strike.

236
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,321
- They what?
- They've gone on fucking strike!

237
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,730
Half of Birmingham is out.

238
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,690
The female half, they're all out,
every single one of them.

239
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,046
Quakers put 'em up to it.

240
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,601
Who's watching the shop?

241
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,321
Polly's locked it up.

242
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,771
See, Good Friday's
one of our best days for takings.

243
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,091
All the men get drunk.
The races are all fixed.

244
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,130
It's like picking apples
off the lowest branches.

245
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,486
Hey, John?

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,081
Hmm, yes.

247
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,129
Then your business is very easy.

248
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,203
- Was Linda with them?
- You know,

249
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,724
Billy said that Polly jumped
in the fucking Bull Ring,

250
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,770
just pissed out of her mind,
started going on about revolution,

251
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,080
screaming to the rooftops.

252
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,329
Was Linda with them?

253
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,566
Yeah.

254
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,289
Then it was Linda's idea.

255
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,491
Linda's a smart woman.

256
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,961
John.

257
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,849
There's a Bentley in the drive outside.

258
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,048
I want you to go out
and put a nail in its tyre.

259
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,930
It's Good Friday,
so there'll be no garages open.

260
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,604
The lady will have to spend the night.

261
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,361
Then I want you and the boys
to all go home.

262
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,046
You take Charlie, put him with
Arthur and Linda for the night.

263
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,088
They can use the practise.

264
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,203
- You want to put a nail...
- Yeah.

265
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,170
- You heard me.
- Yeah.

266
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,211
Right. Nice to meet you.

267
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,841
Why do you need
to put a nail in the tyre?

268
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,131
I want it so neither of us
can change our minds.

269
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,684
We came back early.

270
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,089
Polly didn't finish the count yesterday.

271
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,046
Hmm.

272
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,564
So you thought you could take a tenner.

273
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,924
I thought I'd finish the count.

274
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,806
Hey!

275
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,486
Esme, I've told you.
Stay off the snow till the baby's born.

276
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,530
It does no harm, passes the time.

277
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,444
- Knocks down the walls.
- Listen.

278
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,250
Listen.

279
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,442
I know you miss the travelling.

280
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,844
It's all gonna be all right.

281
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,768
It's like being a hen in a coop.

282
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,047
Remember that house in Lichfield?

283
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,686
The one the bailiff used to
throw you out of?

284
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,330
Throw you in the ditch.

285
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,366
I'm gonna buy that fucking house.

286
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,088
Big as Tommy's with more land.

287
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,243
If you feel cooped up,

288
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,005
we'll take a wagon,
camp out by the ditch.

289
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,646
How?

290
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,208
It's all gonna change, Esme.

291
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,804
This is not your bedroom.

292
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,846
This is not where
you slept with your wife.

293
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,170
Do you ride horses?

294
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,766
No.

295
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,811
I would need to open my legs in
a public place and that is not allowed.

296
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,641
You drink whisky?

297
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,241
No.

298
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,843
It tastes like men. I prefer wine.

299
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,761
Cars?

300
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,486
No.

301
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,726
So, diamonds are your only love, eh?

302
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,643
Sapphires?

303
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,969
They're just a currency.

304
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,202
Well, you know,
if it was me who had all them jewels,

305
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,491
I think I'd just sit with them,

306
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,600
look at them,

307
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,967
touch them.

308
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,644
Izabella does that sometimes.

309
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,241
Late at night.

310
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,682
I swear she puts one of the biggest
sapphires into her body for pleasure,

311
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,570
and walks up the stairs
to breakfast with it still in place.

312
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,641
- And it stays in there all day?
- Yeah.

313
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,721
Oh.

314
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,450
What is your weakness?

315
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,366
Talking about duchesses
with sapphires inside of them.

316
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,521
Mmm.

317
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,688
I think I already know your weakness.

318
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,523
I can get a fuck whenever I want, love.

319
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,001
Yes.

320
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,009
But I am a duchess.

321
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,522
And I am under you like a horse.

322
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,568
I'm like a telegram.

323
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,006
"A telegram"?
I don't think your English is so good.

324
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,969
Or maybe you should
listen more carefully

325
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,610
to what I have to say.

326
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,806
Hmm?

327
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,121
I have a message for you, Mr Shelby.

328
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,881
As a duchess, I can show you
what is possible for a man like you.

329
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,250
A man in a house like this.

330
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,006
Right now, you hide inside it like a boy
who's broken in through the window.

331
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,210
Why did we come to a bedroom for this?
Hmm?

332
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,886
In your own house?

333
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,205
That's a loaded fucking weapon.

334
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,001
We could fuck by the fire with the maids
standing to attention and watching.

335
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,127
What can they do?

336
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,326
- Give it here.
- Nothing.

337
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,846
There are no rules for you. Hmm?

338
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,001
Give me the fucking gun.

339
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,606
You have maids here.
You can bring a maid into the room.

340
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,648
What can I do about that? Nothing.

341
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,724
- Give me the fucking gun, now.
- You have power.

342
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,725
Everyone does what you tell them to do.

343
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,930
Your brothers, your soldiers,
no one can stop you.

344
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,126
Don't point the fucking weapon at me.

345
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,725
I can be an actress.

346
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,084
Who do you want me to be?

347
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,161
Your dead wife?

348
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,810
Now, that's enough.
Give me the fucking gun!

349
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,043
If you don't like something,
you say stop, and it stops. Hmm?

350
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,564
But you are afraid of it.

351
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,246
You break the law,
but you obey the rules. Why?

352
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,285
Did you know that madness sets you free?

353
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,761
Otherwise, we're just peasants
obeying the law.

354
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,403
There is madness inside your head, too.
I can see that.

355
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,522
Let a duchess show you something.

356
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,206
I emptied the chamber,
except for one bullet.

357
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,647
- No! No, please.
- This is a game we used to play.

358
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,407
No.

359
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,009
- Watch.
- Do not fucking do this.

360
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,162
No. Look at me.

361
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,887
Don't do this.

362
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,007
No!

363
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,969
Give me the fucking thing.

364
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,361
It brings you alive. You won't try it?

365
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,010
No, I do not want to try!

366
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,163
And I do not want
your mad fucking Russian brains

367
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,049
all over me fucking walls.

368
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,884
I survive each time by the will of God.

369
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,325
Get to fucking bed, now!

370
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,209
I already called a maid.

371
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,441
Fucking...

372
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,606
You see?

373
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,210
You are afraid.

374
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,006
Like a boy who's broken in
through the window.

375
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,851
I need to educate you
in how to run a house like this.

376
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,125
Yes. Come down.

377
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,687
Pour us a drink.

378
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,882
Mary, go back to bed, please.

379
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,851
You go back to bed, please.
This woman is drunk.

380
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,884
That's all right, sir.
Should I pour whisky?

381
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,440
- Yes, he will have whisky...
- No, go back to bed.

382
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,602
He will have whisky
and I will have wine!

383
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,691
Mary, go back to bed.

384
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,489
- In a house like this...
- Stop talking.

385
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,847
- The servants expect it.
- Go back to bed! Do as I say!

386
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,570
Normally, if there's a call
after midnight,

387
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,688
the maid who comes in
is the one in love with the master,

388
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,606
- but she is not in love with you.
- This is not fucking Russia!

389
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,524
Please, Mary.
Go back to bed, hey?

390
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,688
I know your weakness, Tommy.

391
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,885
It's freedom.

392
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,040
Madness.

393
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,651
Killing.

394
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,287
I am the first one who understands you.

395
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,804
I found her perfume.

396
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,611
Put it on.

397
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,323
What proof do you have
that the priest is a spy?

398
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,081
I told you. I gave you my word.

399
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,885
Then kill him.

400
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,402
From now on, you must do
everything that you want to do.

401
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,807
There'll be two of us for breakfast
this morning, Mary.

402
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,326
She's gone for a walk by the river.

403
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,971
The lady left, sir.

404
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,849
Left? How?

405
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,641
She took your car.

406
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,927
She what?

407
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,482
She was in a terrible hurry.
She said she had your permission.

408
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,686
She told David to go to the garage
to get a new tyre for the Bentley.

409
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,410
She said you could use that.

410
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,442
And why the hell
would you listen to her, eh?

411
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,410
The way she said it, sir.

412
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,211
- How was she, Tom?
- Talkative, yeah.

413
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,327
Hmm.

414
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,444
I was fucking working, all right?

415
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,847
Yeah.

416
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,927
From what she said,
when she was out of her fucking mind,

417
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,367
I'm pretty certain
the treasury is underneath the house.

418
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,441
What have you got?

419
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,807
Our Ada got this
from the British Library

420
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,928
using her scholar's pass.

421
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,646
She talks about her aunt

422
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,643
coming up the stairs
to have her breakfast in the morning,

423
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,690
which means
it has to be in the building somewhere.

424
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,001
Wine cellar. Septic.

425
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,164
Kitchen cellar.

426
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,446
And a tunnel under the river.

427
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,965
They don't trust a soul in this country,

428
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,681
so my guess is they've turned
one of the cellars into a strong room.

429
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,841
Did you find someone, Arthur?

430
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,651
Moss gave me this.

431
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,848
Stefan Radischevsky.

432
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,287
He's a kid from Greet,
lives in Cheltenham.

433
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,081
Dad's a Russian. He has dreams of
owning a pub but he's got a record.

434
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,010
- Breaking and entering.
- Hmm.

435
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,730
- And he speaks Russian?
- Yeah.

436
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,770
Their butler drinks in a pub
called the Masons Arms.

437
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,001
Get to him, tell him who we are,

438
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,970
offer him some money
if he gives the kid a job in the house.

439
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,371
Wait.

440
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,604
Talk to the kid,

441
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,967
offer him one of the pubs
we took off the Italians

442
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,283
if he works in the house for four weeks,
keeps his ears open.

443
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,521
All right?

444
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,761
Come.

445
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,970
The executive committee of
the union of bookies and allied trades

446
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,485
will see you now, sir.

447
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,048
I heard you were giving speeches
off the back of a wagon, Pol.

448
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,611
I can't remember a fucking thing.

449
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,002
Well, Moss tells me you were threatening
to burn down the town hall.

450
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,800
Oh, Tommy, we were having a laugh.

451
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,487
You know, actually,
the crowd around me was bigger

452
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,244
than the crowd around Jessie Eden.

453
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,526
Who's Jessie Eden?

454
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,761
She's too soft.

455
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,763
You're not gonna
break the capitalist system

456
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,525
talking about
separate lavatories for women.

457
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,681
Who is Jessie Eden?

458
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,411
She's our new best friend.

459
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,482
Shop steward at the Lucas factory.

460
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,449
A woman shop steward, I've heard of her.

461
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,682
There is a leaflet here
if you want to take a look, Tommy.

462
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,804
So, a separate lavatory?
Is that it? Is that what you want?

463
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,441
I don't know what you want.

464
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,444
You have to tell me what it is
that you want and then I'll know.

465
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,731
Actually, we want to know
about the robbery you're planning.

466
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,167
Not the factory robbery. The other one.

467
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,041
The one you're not
telling the women about.

468
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,209
- John has a big mouth.
- No.

469
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,042
Arthur's got a big mouth.
Arthur told Linda, Linda told me.

470
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,404
- Polly?
- Read the leaflet, Tommy.

471
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,370
Ladies, why don't I
talk to Tommy privately,

472
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,681
and then I'll
report back to you faithfully.

473
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,411
You're not just gonna take payment
from the Russians, are you, Tommy?

474
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,802
You're going to clean them out,
is that right?

475
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,961
- Esme?
- So...

476
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,365
What happens after,
when they come for us?

477
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,851
When I'm about to give birth?

478
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,526
Get out, get back to work.

479
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,806
Esme, come on.

480
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,006
- Keep us posted, won't you, sister?
- I will.

481
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,921
Fucking hell.

482
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,802
So Arthur tells Linda everything, eh?

483
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,369
She's stolen his soul
and taken it to a better place.

484
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,487
The suburbs.

485
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,008
Where men are honest with their wives.

486
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,361
We can trust Lizzie.

487
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,842
Yeah, but I can't trust Esme.

488
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,727
I can't trust the fucking Russians
to pay me or the army,

489
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,565
and I can't trust my own brother
to keep his fucking mouth shut.

490
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,529
Did you make progress last night?

491
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,126
Yes.

492
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,442
John said the girl looks like
Edna Purviance from the pictures.

493
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,849
Be careful.

494
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,644
She's an excellent source of information

495
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,290
regarding the location
of the merchandise.

496
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,361
- Here we go.
- You know,

497
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,444
there is a general lack of discipline
in this fucking company.

498
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,009
She stayed the night.

499
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,811
I'm working, Pol.

500
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,886
I am working for
the good of the company.

501
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,400
You're grieving.

502
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,569
And when you grieve,
you make bad choices.

503
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,885
I know. I did it myself.

504
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,008
Look. No more marches.

505
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,250
No more fucking politics.

506
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,721
It can kill us. All right?
Joke or no joke.

507
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,890
Did you tell Arthur about the priest?

508
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,851
I only told you.

509
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,485
Thanks for the burden.

510
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,800
You were correct
not to talk over the phone.

511
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,530
What did she say?

512
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,889
She said there was gonna be a killing.
A holy man.

513
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,007
And she was with the Shelbys, was she?

514
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,885
I suppose you have something to say
about yesterday.

515
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,760
No.

516
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,490
It's something else, actually.

517
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,440
I believe Arthur has told you

518
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,921
about some business
we're planning, Linda.

519
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,402
Oh, there's always business, Thomas.

520
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,808
And Arthur believes when
this business is done,

521
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,166
it'll all be over.

522
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,801
Arthur believes you, but I don't.

523
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,408
Linda, the people who have hired us
to rob the factory are very bad people.

524
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,049
They'll not pay us, as they've promised.

525
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,250
So, on the night of the robbery, we will
take what is ours from their treasury.

526
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,970
And a bit more on top for luck.

527
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,561
If you're saying
you're gonna stop Arthur,

528
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,880
I need to know.

529
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,204
That'll be Arthur's decision.

530
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,761
And your plan is still
to reform him, eh?

531
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,764
- To the absolute degree of redemption.
- Mmm-hmm.

532
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,325
Well, Arthur will walk away from this
with £30,000. We made a deal.

533
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,925
And afterwards,

534
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,685
you and Arthur can begin your new life.

535
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,049
Did you say 30,000?

536
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,522
Arthur said the estimated total proceeds
would be 150,000.

537
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,921
- Estimated. Yes.
- A third of 150 is 50.

538
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,365
- Why a third?
- The three brothers.

539
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,010
- Finn is not yet a man.
- There are expenses.

540
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,411
Of 25,000, you said.

541
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,403
As of last night,
the expenses increased.

542
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,845
We need to dig a hole.

543
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,922
Arthur agreed to a plan
with a figure of 25.

544
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,205
25 from 150 is 125.

545
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,363
A third of that is £41,000.

546
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,441
Sugar?

547
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,081
Yes.

548
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,771
Thank you.

549
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,046
So, you've worked this all out, I see?

550
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,246
Only in my head.
I haven't written it down.

551
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,247
Linda, are you saying...

552
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,684
If it were 41,000".

553
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,242
I've already told you,
that'll be Arthur's decision.

554
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,365
But I don't imagine
he'll accept less than 41.

555
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,249
- May I smoke?
- No.

556
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,249
So, I imagine you have some plans

557
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,290
for your 41,000.

558
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,641
Yes. California.

559
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,641
For the child's health,
away from the smoke.

560
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,731
We want to run a general store
on an Indian mission.

561
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,489
The Americans invite Quakers
to do good work with the Indians.

562
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,041
We've already sent our papers
and been accepted.

563
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,888
Arthur Shelby as a missionary...

564
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,282
- No. Arthur will run the store.
- Hmm.

565
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,889
I will teach in the school next to it.

566
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,840
Arthur will swim in the ocean.
I will be on the beach with a towel.

567
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,967
The open air and the sun

568
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,361
will get rid of all the nonsense
in his head from France.

569
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,770
That's some plan.

570
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,250
As you know yourself,

571
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,681
the arrival of a new life

572
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,161
concentrates the mind
on practical things.

573
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,085
Amen to that.

574
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,726
When is the child due?

575
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,240
September.

576
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,926
When is the robbery?

577
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,286
June.

578
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,769
Then the timing's perfect.

579
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,444
We'll book a passage
through the Panama Canal

580
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,410
the day after
the 41,000 is paid to Arthur.

581
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,647
Did we agree 41,000, Linda?

582
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,250
I heard nothing to the contrary.

583
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,050
- Word association. Right now.
- Oh, God. I hate this game.

584
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,565
It's Freud. It's terribly fashionable.

585
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,211
I'd rather you put on
that music that I hate.

586
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,886
Are we going mad
in here, do you think?

587
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,007
Yes.

588
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,891
We shouldn't have drunk
red wine with the cake.

589
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,160
And I believe your vow never to sleep
with another man is a good one.

590
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,086
Good for the painting.

591
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,088
It's not a vow. It's just...

592
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,727
I think when men want sex,
they become hilarious.

593
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,482
Like a dog, when you pick up a lead,
and he knows he's going for a walk.

594
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,801
May I respectfully point out

595
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,683
that so far you haven't even
picked up the bloody lead.

596
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,007
There.

597
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,041
That's the look.

598
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,926
Imperious.

599
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,080
No man is good enough.

600
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,920
You idiot.
You nearly killed him.

601
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,480
I told you we needed him
fully conscious.

602
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,881
We need to stop using soldiers
who've been in India, they hit too hard.

603
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,450
Not fucking hard enough.

604
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,329
Hey, Mr Shelby. Hey.

605
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,244
I heard about your plan
to kill a holy man

606
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,561
from a voice in the confessional.

607
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,801
Can you hear us?

608
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,327
Grace?

609
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,966
Shelby.

610
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,887
Why were you attempting
to kill Father Hughes?

611
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,691
Maybe we should wait
until he is fully conscious.

612
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,410
I have a dinner appointment.

613
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,809
Hey, Shelby?

614
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,009
Wake up. Eyes front.

615
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,931
Mr Shelby, you were trying to kill me,
were you?

616
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,285
Passing information...

617
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,923
Fuck. He knows.

618
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,321
Where am I?

619
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,165
You are among the Odd Fellows.
Please count from 10 to one.

620
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,971
Ah, fuck you.

621
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,209
Whatever else you might have forgotten
about last night,

622
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,086
remember this.

623
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,330
I am passing on information
to the Soviet Embassy

624
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,569
on the instruction of Section D.

625
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,967
It's part of a bigger picture.

626
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,803
You explain to the Russians
that you were mistaken about me,

627
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,924
and you apologise to me
in front of them.

628
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,844
A threat on your sister
was evidently not enough.

629
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,807
You do as we say,
or we will take your son.

630
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,367
Hear this. We will take your son.

631
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,803
We can do it at any moment.

632
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,880
We have people in your life.

633
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,129
You will make your apology to me
tomorrow night,

634
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,171
and you will repair the damage
you've done.

635
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,520
Or you will never
see your son again.

636
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,610
Sir, I don't understand...

637
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,882
I don't understand why,
as a former soldier yourself,

638
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,725
you have sacked all of the former
soldiers on the staff.

639
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,802
It means there is only one man
left in the household.

640
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,850
Mary, I want it so that
Charles is never left on his own.

641
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,001
Understood?

642
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,963
Sir, I should call a doctor.

643
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,611
There will be some men
coming down from Birmingham.

644
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,564
And you put them up here in the house.

645
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,450
You put them in the front and back of
the house, you feed them, and you...

646
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,483
Why are they needed, sir?

647
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,484
I brought a cursed sapphire
into this house, Mary.

648
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,844
And now, I'm paying for it.

649
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,602
And I don't know what to expect.

650
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,648
But neither do my enemies.

651
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,845
Tell David to bring the car around.
I'm going to go to London.

652
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,771
- Sir...
- And get me some tea, Mary.

653
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,566
Yes, sir.

654
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,927
<i>Hello?</i>

655
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,604
- Yes, Arthur.
<i>- Tommy?</i>

656
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,642
They want the robbery to be sabotaged.

657
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,889
They don't give a fuck who gets hurt.

658
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,007
<i>Are you OK, Tommy?</i>

659
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,082
- It's a bigger picture now.
<i>- What...</i>

660
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,081
Did John make a list?

661
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,650
<i>Speak clearer, Tom.</i>

662
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,960
I said did John make a list?

663
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,042
<i>John-Boy! John!</i>

664
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,201
Right.

665
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,808
<i>Gypsies and kin only. Yeah.</i>

666
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,041
Good.

667
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,007
<i>Tommy, can I ask you why?</i>

668
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,161
<i>Tommy?</i>

669
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,971
No, Karl. I told you.
Go on and play in there.

670
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,447
Hello?

671
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,811
Ada, it's me. It's Tommy.

672
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,611
Ada, I need you to...

673
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,170
I need you to speak
to one of your comrades

674
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,642
and get me a meeting
with someone from the Soviet Embassy.

675
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,160
Tonight.

676
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,482
Your place, 10 p.m.

677
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,121
It seems that Mr Shelby

678
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,646
was given bad information
by an informant

679
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,566
who was also in contact
with the underwriter,

680
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,048
who, as we know,
is in the pocket of the Soviets.

681
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,246
- Wine, Tatiana?
- A little.

682
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,291
Bad girl.

683
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,609
Sorry I'm late. I, uh...

684
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,610
There was a body on the line.

685
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,286
Drink, Mr Shelby?

686
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,406
No, thank you.

687
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,164
It was drink that caused
half this trouble.

688
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,771
I have come here to apologise.

689
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,646
I have already explained
that you now realise

690
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,282
that your absurd allegation against me
was false.

691
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,321
Indeed.

692
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,644
And that your base nature
made you rash.

693
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,682
And that now, once again,
our plan is back on track.

694
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,050
When a child in my care commits a sin,

695
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,450
first of all, he confesses,
as you just did.

696
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,810
And then,
I instruct him to perform penance

697
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,403
in a manner of my choosing.

698
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,484
As a child, you went to church?

699
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,201
Yes.

700
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,648
Do you remember
the Act of Contrition?

701
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,766
Good.

702
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,683
Do you remember
the words of the Act of Contrition?

703
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,726
Yes.

704
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,449
As your penance,
I would like you to recite it now,

705
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,562
in the presence of our associates.

706
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,291
Go away.

707
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,486
Uh...

708
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,322
Oh, my God,
I am heartily sorry for having...

709
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,607
Instead of "God," say my name.

710
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,330
Since it was me you offended
with your false allegation.

711
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,682
Father Hughes, I am heartily sorry
for having offended you,

712
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,566
because of your just punishment,

713
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,483
but most of all,
because they offend you.

714
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,086
Father Hughes, who art all good
and deserving of my love,

715
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,524
I firmly resolve to...

716
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,201
With the help of your grace,
to sin no more

717
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,284
and to avoid all near occasions of sin.

718
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,641
Mmm.

719
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,125
Very good. Thank you.

720
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,321
Amen.

721
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,165
And now that we are
a united band once more,

722
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,163
perhaps we could order some food.

723
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,244
I'm sorry. I am not feeling well.
I have to go. Good night.

724
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,131
Mr Shelby...

725
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,081
My God, Tommy.

726
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,207
- Are they here?
- Yeah.

727
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,688
- Do you have cocaine?
- No.

728
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,444
Tommy.

729
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,205
Tommy, this is the Special Adviser
to the Soviet Consul.

730
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,570
Members of the British establishment
and exiled White Russians

731
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,486
are planning to rob armoured cars
from a factory in Birmingham.

732
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,126
We know about the robbery.
We have an informant.

733
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,205
No, your informant is working for them.
They want you to know about the robbery.

734
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,566
Your informant
is working to their instruction.

735
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,923
Why would they want us to know?

736
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,331
They want you to...

737
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,162
They want you to stop the robbery.

738
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,562
They want you to commit a violent act
on British soil.

739
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,801
Tommy, do you want water?

740
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,685
A violent act on British...

741
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,202
To force the British government
to break off diplomatic relations.

742
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,044
That's the game.

743
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,449
The robbery in Birmingham
is just the bait.

744
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,763
Why are you telling us this?

745
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,251
Because my family are the ones
who will be sacrificed

746
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,123
if you decide to blow up the train.

747
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,206
The Consul wants to know who you are.

748
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,726
He's Tommy Shelby.

749
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,969
You can take his word.

750
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,610
- Ada.
- Tommy...

751
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,806
Ada.

752
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,281
OK.

753
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,565
Stop, stop.

754
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,449
Ada, stop.

755
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,882
OK.

756
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,370
Drive me to a hospital, Ada.

757
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,247
If I'm not conscious when I get there,
tell them I have a fractured skull,

758
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,970
concussion and internal bleeding.

759
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,885
I think I may have haemorrhaged.

760
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,325
- Tommy.
- Ada, go on.

761
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,731
- Be quick because I can't see.
- OK.

762
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,211
I can't fucking see.

763
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,964
OK.OK.

764
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,084
Except for you, Dad.

765
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,450
I can see you.

766
