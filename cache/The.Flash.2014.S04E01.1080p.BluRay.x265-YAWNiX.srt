1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,368
<i>Last season, on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,452
Iris West...

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,039
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,669
I'm not Caitlin anymore.

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,085
- You're not Killer Frost?
- I'm not.

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,423
I'm something else.

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,801
And I need to figure out what that is
on my own.

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,224
Cecile Horton, I love you.

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,098
<i>That's definitely not a breach.</i>

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,021
<i>The Speed Force is unbalanced.</i>

11
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,353
- It's a Speed Force prison.
- Without a prisoner.

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,233
- It goes unstable.
- How do we stop this?

13
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,405
<i>My name is Iris West,</i>

14
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,078
<i>and I was supposed to marry
the fastest man alive,</i>

15
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,496
<i>but six months ago, he left.</i>

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,496
<i>Barry, it's time.</i>

17
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,494
Barry.

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,378
This isn't fair.

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,711
We're supposed to have our happy ending.

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,252
I'm ready to be Iris West-Allen.

21
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,635
And you always will be,

22
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,551
but you have to
keep living your life, okay?

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,841
Keep running. For me.

24
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,223
Promise me you'll run, Iris.

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,388
I promise.

26
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,859
<i>I promised him I'd run.</i>

27
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,693
<i>So that's what I've been doing
these last six months.</i>

28
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,278
<i>Running as fast as I can.</i>

29
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,580
I can't find her, Cisco.

30
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,964
Boy, I gotta work out more.
She's really stepped up her game.

31
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,549
Then let's turn up ours.
I don't have eyes on her.

32
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,134
<i>- Iris?</i>
- Copy, I'm on it.

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,923
Looking.

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,426
- Got her.
<i>- And?</i>

35
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:44,844
Duck!

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,145
I don't see no duck.

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,140
Peekaboo.

38
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,359
Your only warning, boys.

39
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,144
Stay back.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,861
She meant the other "duck."

41
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,656
Yeah, I cannot believe you actually
thought she meant a "duck" duck.

42
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,192
Where is she, Iris?

43
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,869
She's headed for the Keystone Bridge.

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,742
If she gets out of this city,
we're gonna lose her for good.

45
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,368
You guys have to stop her now.

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,786
I'm gonna catch her this time.

47
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,869
I hate teleporters.

48
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,231
Three... Three.

49
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,602
<i>She jumps to every third rooftop.</i>

50
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,062
Cisco, she's gonna jump
to the Broome Tower.

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,317
- When she lands, stop her.
<i>- On it.</i>

52
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,818
- Dad, meet them at the bottom.
<i>- Copy.</i>

53
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:39,899
- Wally...
<i>- I know what to do.</i>

54
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,197
Come on.

55
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,624
Peekabooyah!

56
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,303
Dead bang, fellas.

57
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,013
Look at that.

58
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,723
We got her.

59
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,147
I'm so proud of us.

60
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,778
That was a good hustle out there,
Team Vibe.

61
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,196
It's Team Kid Flash, but thank you.

62
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,528
Okay, not your finest hour, gentlemen.

63
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,238
What are you looking at me for?
I was the one that put her down.

64
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,745
And Wally and I helped him out
with the assist. Classic maneuver.

65
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,542
Yeah. It actually went
exactly as we planned it.

66
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,664
Exactly as we planned it.

67
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,790
You don't believe us? Ask Joe.

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,917
Joe, go ahead and tell her how
this went exactly as we planned.

69
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,333
- Peekaboo fell right into our trap.
- I'm not doing that.

70
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,302
And we aren't exactly
catching bad guys at our old rate.

71
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,595
One out of every three metas

72
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,638
that we fought in the last six months
has escaped.

73
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,975
Temporarily, yes,
but Team Kid Flash is on the case.

74
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,518
Son, I love you,

75
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,850
but ain't nobody feeling Team Kid Flash.

76
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,226
It's like too many syllables.

77
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,353
Okay, guys. Maybe a little less
fooling around

78
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,980
and a little more
taking things seriously.

79
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,107
It's up to us
to protect this city, right?

80
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,026
Because there is no one else.

81
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,947
Wally, why don't you
go to the Speed Lab?

82
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,286
I've programmed a new
training simulation for you.

83
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,363
It should only take four hours.

84
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,079
Four... What? No. What about
family dinner tonight? I'm...

85
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,210
You know what? Training sounds amazing.

86
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,495
Okay.

87
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,872
See you at home, boss.

88
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,011
Cisco, you want to share
what you're thinking?

89
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,348
I'm thinking it'd be a lot better off
if we weren't one man down.

90
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,641
<i>I only have a couple more boxes
to bring over.</i>

91
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,277
We have no more room
in the garage or the basement.

92
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,856
Right. Or we could just get rid of
some more of your stuff.

93
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,023
Like what?

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,903
Like, babe, do you really need
all the smelly old records in there?

95
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,237
- Oh, Cecile.
- Records?

96
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,788
You mean my vintage jazz LP collection

97
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,621
that I painstakingly and carefully
collected over the last 30 years?

98
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,830
- Really?
- Those are my loves, babe.

99
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,963
They're going in the coffin with me
when I die.

100
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,921
Okay, maybe we could bury them now,

101
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,051
and you can just join them
at a later date.

102
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,173
<i>Oh, you gotjokes.</i>

103
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,803
- Oh, wow.
- You're lucky I gave you a key,

104
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,760
because I'm starting to rethink
this whole move-in thing.

105
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,935
No, you're not.

106
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,517
- No, I'm not.
- No, you're not.

107
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,264
Because you love me.

108
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,399
Why don't I go make us some coffee?

109
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,068
Obvious.

110
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,651
<i>Okay, so...</i>

111
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,866
Ever since Julian
moved back to London,

112
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,617
they have been short-staffed
in the crime lab at CCPD.

113
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,203
And I've been stalling Singh
with this whole story

114
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,663
of Barry being on a sabbatical
in the Czech Republic.

115
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,007
And they want to hire someone
to replace him.

116
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,049
Yeah, they should. They need the help.

117
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,597
- Barry's not coming back, so...
- You don't know that.

118
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,340
Yes, I do.

119
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,384
Sweetheart,

120
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,598
I'm very proud of you
for taking the lead

121
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,354
with Wally and Cisco at S.T.A.R Labs.

122
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,273
I let you have your space

123
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,697
so that you'd have time
to deal with what happened.

124
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,904
Dad, I'm fine. Okay?

125
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,486
I'm not. We lost him, Iris.

126
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,825
My son. Your everything.

127
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,198
Dad, what do you want me to do?

128
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,201
Curl up in a ball and cry all day?

129
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,743
I can't do that.

130
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,372
Barry told me to be strong.
I'm being strong.

131
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,255
When H.R. died, we had a funeral.

132
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,089
We spoke about his life.

133
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,715
Maybe we should do
the same thing for Barry.

134
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,175
Give us all permission to grieve.

135
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,763
And what are we going to bury, Dad?

136
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,846
That empty suit in the lab?

137
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,320
You know what? Thank Cecile for dinner.

138
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,567
I'm going to get going, okay?

139
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,354
Wally? Cisco?

140
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,772
We're up.

141
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,749
Guys, what are we looking at?

142
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,117
Holy Ronin.

143
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,751
It's a samurai.

144
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,548
Anybody speak Japanese?

145
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,926
Tell me he did not just speak Japanese.

146
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,264
I can do things.

147
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,557
<i>The Flash.</i>

148
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,687
Yeah. You're looking at him, pal.

149
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,687
<i>You're not the Flash.
You're not the best.</i>

150
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,440
<i>Bring me the Flash.</i>

151
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,524
I'm sensing an "or else."

152
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,486
<i>Or else, your city falls.</i>

153
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,488
<i>The Flash ain't coming.</i>

154
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,912
Furthermore, Mifune, we're gonna
need you to sheath that sword

155
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,368
<i>before somebody gets hurt,</i>

156
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,377
<i>somebody like you, for instance,</i>

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,621
'cause you're up against
some bad <i>hombres.</i>

158
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,465
Now, what do you think
you're gonna do against us

159
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,009
with a sword?

160
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,644
You guys okay?

161
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,603
The hell kind of sword is that?

162
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,071
<i>You have one day.</i>

163
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,402
<i>If the Flash does not face me,</i>

164
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,700
<i>Central City dies.</i>

165
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,663
<i>The Flash hasn't been seen
in almost six months,</i>

166
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,091
<i>leaving us to speculate what can
save us from this newest threat.</i>

167
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,627
There are other superheroes
in this town.

168
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,046
Yeah, and your boy Kurosawa over there

169
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,258
blew us away like rag dolls,
performing his reverse Excalibur.

170
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,018
We haven't faced
anything like this before.

171
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,891
Why do you think
he only wanted the Flash?

172
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,601
He said he wants to fight the best.

173
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,557
He's threatening to destroy the city.
Do we think he can he do it?

174
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,641
I say yes.

175
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,853
- Then he has to fight the Flash.
- Who isn't here.

176
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,689
What if he was?

177
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,324
Iris, you said it yourself.

178
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,028
Just us trying to keep the city safe,
we're barely getting it done.

179
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,822
And this guy, he's no joke.

180
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,208
If we don't offer up the Flash,
there's gonna be serious damage.

181
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,248
People are gonna die,
and that's gonna be on us.

182
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,331
We need to bring Barry back.

183
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,124
Cisco, we can't.

184
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,468
If Barry comes out,
the Speed Force prison goes...

185
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,628
Becomes unstable.

186
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,304
Could destroy the city, the whole world.

187
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,173
Which is exactly what
we're trying to prevent.

188
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,303
What if I can solve that?

189
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,931
- In the next 24 hours?
- Yes!

190
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,887
Guys, I've been working on this.

191
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,142
For how long?

192
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,233
Since the night he left.

193
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,147
- Cisco...
- I've had help.

194
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,528
I've consulted with Harry and Tina
and Tracy and Felicity and Curtis,

195
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,650
and I'm pretty sure
I've figured out a way

196
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,411
to stabilize the Speed Force prison
and free Barry

197
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,867
without unleashing another
lightning storm on the city.

198
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,666
I just need a couple more things.

199
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,962
- Maybe we should.
<i>- No.</i>

200
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,094
You've been working on this
for how long and you never told us?

201
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,092
I didn't want to say anything
until I was certain.

202
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,890
Are you certain that the Speed Force
won't take Wally in his place?

203
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,346
Are you certain that you can even

204
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,053
close it before it rips Central City
in two?

205
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,765
Are you certain that
Barry is even still alive?

206
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,308
He's got to be.

207
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,815
Iris, you of all people,

208
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,359
how can you not be in on this?

209
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,820
Because Barry is gone.

210
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,662
That is the only thing
any of us can be certain about.

211
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,496
Now, let's do what we can do to come up

212
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,074
with a plan to take out this samurai.

213
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,700
<i>Okay?</i>

214
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,870
Okay?

215
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,246
Okay.

216
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,583
I'm gonna need some coffee.

217
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,761
Hello.

218
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,606
My, what a selection.

219
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,228
You got any recommendations?

220
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,943
Yeah. Drink somewhere else.

221
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,237
What can I get you?

222
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,815
Let's go with something sweet

223
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,243
but deceptively strong with lots of ice.

224
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,538
Shirley Temple coming right up.

225
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,701
What is a nice girl
with two doctorates and a PhD

226
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,751
doing in a rat's nest like this one?

227
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,376
Working. How'd you find me?

228
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,425
I'm great with computers, and I have
my own satellite. You do the math.

229
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,792
You vibed me.

230
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,378
I vibed you. Yes.

231
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,674
You're looking a lot less frosty
than the last time I saw you.

232
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,260
You said you weren't her,
but you weren't Caitlin either.

233
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,017
It's just me, Cisco. I'm just Caitlin.

234
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,349
How'd you do it?

235
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,559
What do you want?

236
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,062
Well, a stiffer drink for starters.

237
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,111
If you're back to normal,
I have to know.

238
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,442
<i>Why didn't you come back to us?</i>

239
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,745
Okay, I get it. That's fine.

240
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,700
I'm not gonna make you answer that,
but we really could've used you.

241
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,788
Barry's still stuck in the Speed Force?

242
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,661
You knew about that?

243
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,877
I'm gonna get him out,
but I need your help.

244
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,796
Everything okay?

245
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,423
Everything's fine.

246
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,134
Yeah, everything's great, pal.
Do you mind?

247
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,218
I'm talking to the lady.

248
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,769
I'm sure there's someone else
you can find in here

249
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,642
to commiserate with
over poor life choices.

250
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,728
Thank you.

251
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,281
Look, I figured out how to save Barry,

252
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,318
but I can't do it without you.

253
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,786
You see that samurai
that showed up today?

254
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,033
Yes.

255
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,162
He's threatening to blow up the city,
and we need Barry to stop him.

256
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,210
So help us out, please,

257
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,079
Caitlin?

258
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,840
My shift's over in an hour.

259
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,922
Girl, I got time.

260
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,134
Oh... This is good.

261
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,924
Is there anything you can't do?

262
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,433
Move on, apparently.

263
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,721
Hang tight.

264
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,976
You're coming home, buddy.

265
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,567
Hey, Cisco, can you pull up
the Mockingbird satellite?

266
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,398
We're tracking down this samurai.

267
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,400
Cisco?

268
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,069
Wally?

269
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,673
Mr. West. Mr. West.

270
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,428
So what are we doing out here, Cisco?

271
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,922
It seemed an appropriate venue.

272
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,348
We've had good luck here before.

273
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,344
- Why do we need good luck?
- Because we're bringing Barry back.

274
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,855
- Cisco, Iris said...
- I know what Iris said, Joe.

275
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,232
I also know Barry said everyone would
look to me after he was gone.

276
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,310
So look to me.

277
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,070
The four of us? We can do this.

278
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,860
What do you mean, "the four of us"?

279
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,232
Hi, Joe.

280
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,616
It's okay. She's Caitlin again.
Our Caitlin.

281
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,868
<i>She's here to help us. So?</i>

282
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,075
What do you say?

283
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,749
You better be right.

284
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,748
I am.

285
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,637
Joe, I know that I can never make up

286
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,431
for the things that I did
to you, to Cecile.

287
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,634
I just hope...

288
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,095
I just hope that one day
you can forgive me.

289
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,599
Come here.

290
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,358
Let's bring everybody home today, okay?

291
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,480
You got it.

292
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,905
So how are we going to bring Barry back
without blowing a hole in the world?

293
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,657
Ha! In the spirit
of bringing back old friends,

294
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,536
may I present the Speed Force bazooka.

295
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,704
Ah.

296
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,832
I've made a few slight modifications,
as Captain Solo would say.

297
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,255
Caitlin and I spent all of last night
working out some kinks,

298
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,502
fine-tuning the Quark Sphere.

299
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,833
<i>- The what?
- The Quark Sphere.</i>

300
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,843
Filled with Barry's
unique genetic marker

301
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,795
and programmed to track his specific DNA

302
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,801
using the electrical current
of the Speed Force.

303
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,803
Once we track Barry and we pull him out,

304
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,850
the Quark Sphere
will trick the Speed Force

305
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,348
- into thinking he's still there.
<i>- Hey, Wally,</i>

306
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,430
can you put that on the center pylon?

307
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,609
- Ready.
- Let's bring our boy home.

308
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,240
Quark Matter
scanning electrical current.

309
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,336
Triangulating Quark Matter
on his location.

310
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,297
I've got a lock on something.

311
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,832
It's him.

312
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,168
It's him!

313
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,627
Now, Cisco!

314
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:14,651
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

315
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,537
I can't believe you did this
behind my back.

316
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,169
- You would've tried to stop us.
- Because it was a waste of time!

317
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,375
I don't understand.
This should have worked.

318
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,669
Or you could have killed us all.

319
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,719
I don't know, Iris.
I think we were pretty close.

320
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,850
I'm sorry, "we"? Where have you been
the last six months again?

321
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,052
She was only trying to help.

322
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,436
Look, guys, we need to concentrate

323
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,560
on stopping this samurai
who's trying to destroy the city,

324
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,267
- not on Barry.
- Dude, what is your deal?

325
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,478
It's like you don't even want him back.

326
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,691
Hey, hey, hey!

327
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,820
Cecile, can I call you back in a minute?

328
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,151
<i>We're in the middle of something here.</i>

329
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,570
What?

330
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,907
State police picked him up
on the 112 outside Ivy City.

331
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,037
That's 300 miles away.

332
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,870
Yeah, one of the cops
was a Keystone vet, recognized him.

333
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,579
I knew it would work. I knew it.

334
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,919
You should prepare yourselves.

335
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,635
Barry.

336
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,809
<i>Barry.</i>

337
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,161
Nora shouldn't be here.

338
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,581
Your mom isn't here, Barry. It's...

339
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,200
It's me, Iris.

340
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,661
<i>You're home.</i>

341
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,837
Your Honor, I'm innocent.
I didn't do this.

342
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,133
I didn't kill anyone.

343
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,468
Can you hear the stars? Singing.

344
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,177
Rhyming. Chiming. Timing.
Every hour, every minute.

345
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,844
You said the city was safe,
that there was no residual danger.

346
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,054
But that's not true.
What really happened that night?

347
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,308
The city is safe. You saved it.
You saved us all.

348
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:23,069
Stars melting like ice cream.

349
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,573
Dream. Gleam.

350
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,666
Nothing seems... Nora shouldn't be here.

351
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,914
I'm guessing this isn't just shock?

352
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,041
<i>Shock results from a drop
in blood pressure.</i>

353
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,497
This is neurological.

354
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,174
It's a whole new way
of looking at physics.

355
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,636
It will change the way
that we think about everything.

356
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,092
From a single atom to an entire galaxy.

357
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,771
The stars are so loud.
Loud. Cloud. Proud.

358
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,026
Dad and I are both okay.

359
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,565
We're going to be fine.

360
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,738
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

361
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,450
We need to get him back
to S.T.A.R Labs now.

362
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,211
<i>What's the diagnosis?</i>

363
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,209
Does he have brain damage or something?

364
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,915
He's actually scary healthy.

365
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:22,086
His neural transmitters are functioning
at five times the normal speed.

366
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,050
- Then what's wrong?
- I have two theories.

367
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,723
One is that he's suffering
from a form of schizophasia.

368
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,301
That's where you assign
the wrong definitions to words.

369
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,893
So from his perspective,

370
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,642
all that nonsense he's saying
makes sense.

371
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,730
It's too bad we don't have a translator.

372
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,852
No, but we can make one.

373
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,562
<i>If his brain's schizophastic,</i>

374
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,067
and these symbols
represent different words,

375
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,569
he could be sending us a message.

376
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,818
And we just need the right algorithm
to decrypt it.

377
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,454
You said you had two theories.
What's the other one?

378
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,166
We know that the Speed Force
exists beyond space and time.

379
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,368
To us, Barry was only in there
for six months,

380
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,297
but to him,
it could have been 10,000 years.

381
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,548
All that time in isolation,
it could have caused dementia.

382
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,255
That may be all of him that's left.

383
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,183
So how do we find out which one it is?

384
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,853
I can decrease the sedative,
wake him up.

385
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,773
I think I've got
the perfect song for that.

386
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,904
Are you sure this is appropriate?

387
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,866
Yeah, it's a good luck charm.
I mean, it worked before.

388
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,244
Last time, he was in a coma,
not a pantemporal extradimension.

389
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,072
Well, then waking up to Gaga
shouldn't seem too freaky.

390
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,408
Hey, Barry.

391
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,661
Hey, it's me.

392
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,829
Cisco,

393
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,919
a.k.a. Vibe, a.k.a. your BFF. Yeah.

394
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,220
Hey, buddy.

395
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,383
Hey.

396
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,854
While you were gone,
I made you a new suit.

397
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,603
Do you want to take it out for a spin?

398
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,442
The stars are raining.

399
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,322
Draining. Paining. Too soon.

400
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,076
I think maybe later. No, thank you.

401
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:14,031
I'm not hungry.
He didn't do those things.

402
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,162
He didn't hurt my mom.
I was there that night.

403
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,789
There was a man. Plan.

404
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,912
No plan.

405
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,425
We're going to need more diapers.

406
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,586
Diapers.

407
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,301
You keep drawing, buddy.

408
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,723
You keep drawing.
I'm going to figure this out.

409
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,929
- Caitlin?
- I don't know.

410
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,355
Guys, can I get the room for a second?

411
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,651
Barry.

412
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,788
I don't know if you can hear me,

413
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,286
<i>or if you're trying to send us
a message somehow.</i>

414
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,872
Hey, I did what you told me to.

415
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,757
I kept running. I kept moving forward.

416
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,887
Because I knew that
if I stopped to look back,

417
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,511
then I would remember
that you weren't behind me anymore.

418
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,686
And it's been so hard.

419
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,516
And when Cisco said
that he could bring you back,

420
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,897
you know, I didn't know what to think.

421
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,573
What if it didn't work?
What if you were dead?

422
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,365
I mean, I thought it would be like
losing you all over again.

423
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,879
I never imagined this, though.

424
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,211
I don't know what I would do
if this is all that's left of you,

425
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,884
if this is all that's left of
the amazing man that I know and love.

426
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,263
Please come back to me.

427
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,235
Tell me you're still my Barry.

428
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,359
Guys.

429
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,085
Barry. Barry, stop!

430
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,171
Bring him to the Pipeline.

431
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,665
He's too fast.

432
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,927
Expecting someone else?

433
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,682
We need to get him in a containment cell
before he does that again.

434
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,016
Samurai's back.

435
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,276
More like Samurai Jackass.

436
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,649
No, that's a rough draft.

437
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,275
It hasn't even been a full day yet.

438
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,365
He said he'll level the city
if we didn't bring him the Flash.

439
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,444
Well, let's give him what he asked for.

440
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,491
You wanted me.

441
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:07,787
Here I am.

442
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,352
<i>You're not the Flash.</i>

443
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,853
Wally.

444
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,197
<i>If I don't get the real Flash
by nightfall,</i>

445
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,119
<i>the city goes down.</i>

446
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,389
How long till I can get back out there?

447
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,265
Wally, he sliced
right through your fibula.

448
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,684
If you weren't a speedster,
I'd be amputating your leg right now.

449
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,515
Okay. How long?

450
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,730
Four to five hours.

451
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,184
We don't have that kind of time.

452
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,268
You know what? I'm fine.

453
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,188
Son, son, son.

454
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,774
You've done everything you can do.

455
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,150
Relax.

456
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,035
- Any luck?
- No, not yet.

457
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,162
The computer keeps telling me
it's random gibberish.

458
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,544
- Maybe it is.
- No, it's not.

459
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,621
Barry's trying to send us a message,
I know it.

460
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,665
I mean, he spent all this time
in the Speed Force.

461
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,048
Maybe now he knows the answers
to life, the universe, and everything.

462
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,547
So you think all this crazy writing
is Barry's way of telling us 42?

463
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,886
Yes, exactly.

464
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,017
Have I mentioned
how much I miss having you around?

465
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,361
I'm gonna keep working on this.

466
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,821
Unless you have any ideas.

467
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,693
Nope. It's all Greek to me.

468
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,906
Great Caesar's ghost.

469
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,824
This analysis is based on
a monoalphabetic substitution cipher,

470
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,663
but what if it's polyalphabetic?

471
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,244
What if it's like Greek?

472
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,413
Like the symbols are a unique alphabet.

473
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,383
Excelsior.

474
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,794
- What is it?
- Cisco figured it out.

475
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,174
He figured out
how to crack Barry's code.

476
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,301
You did? What does it say?

477
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,223
Hold on one sec. It's loading.

478
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,550
Come on.

479
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,139
Loading, loading, loading.

480
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,390
And it says...

481
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,140
"This house is bitchin'."

482
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,943
"This house is bitchin'"?

483
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,153
That doesn't sound like Barry.

484
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,438
No.

485
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,944
No. No, it doesn't.

486
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,359
It's because it's not.

487
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,749
Whoa.

488
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,423
Don't tell me you have Frankenstein
under there.

489
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,592
It's Barry's new suit.

490
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,141
Right now, I'm having trouble
seeing it as anything

491
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,388
other than a waste of time.

492
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,973
- Cisco...
- I know.

493
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,230
I should have listened to you.

494
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,813
Barry was never trying
to communicate with us.

495
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,352
But I believed in him.

496
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,563
I really did.

497
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,617
Sometimes, I feel like, if I believe
in something hard enough,

498
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,910
that'll make it real.

499
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,410
You know what the worst part is?

500
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,493
I didn't do this to save the city.

501
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,630
I did it because it gave me an excuse
to bring him back.

502
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,054
I did it because I miss my friend.

503
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,702
Much better.

504
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,628
You said it yourself.

505
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,090
She goes looking for danger.

506
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,604
I thought cleaning him up
would make me feel better, but...

507
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,523
Yeah.

508
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,194
The more he looks like himself,

509
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,870
<i>the more it reminds you how lost he is.</i>

510
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,616
<i>You have to believe
that things can get better.</i>

511
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,169
There is an answer for every question.

512
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,165
I don't think I know
how to anymore, Dad.

513
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,259
I know that feeling.
I was struggling with it, too.

514
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,846
But I figured it out.

515
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:12,675
How?

516
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,926
Church.

517
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,227
You haven't gone to church
since I was a kid.

518
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,307
I know.

519
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,481
Cecile suggested it.
Thought it would help.

520
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,689
But I swear,

521
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,612
one of the priest's homilies...

522
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,109
It was like...

523
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,778
It was like he wrote it for me.

524
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,912
"Strength means nothing without faith."

525
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,458
And I started realizing

526
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:47,210
that my strength
didn't stop me from thinking

527
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,258
I'd lost you to Savitar

528
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,014
or that we'd never see Barry again.

529
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,436
Cecile reminded me to have faith,

530
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,061
and I believed.

531
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,189
And here you two are.

532
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,157
You've got strength, baby girl.

533
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,659
You just need a little faith.

534
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,412
<i>Joe, Samurai's 24 hours are up.</i>

535
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,658
Got to go.

536
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,566
Come get me.

537
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,608
<i>I don't see the Flash.</i>

538
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,861
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to make do with us.

539
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,464
Iris! Hold your fire.

540
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,667
You want the Flash?

541
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,460
Take me.

542
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:12,962
<i>Why?</i>

543
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,673
Because he'll come for me.

544
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,427
<i>And how do you know this?</i>

545
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,387
I believe.

546
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,813
Iris!

547
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,239
Hey, Samurai's got Iris.

548
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,536
She gave herself up to him.

549
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,075
- What?
- Why would she do that?

550
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,663
<i>How do we get her back?</i>

551
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,049
Barry, Iris is in trouble.
She needs your help.

552
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,174
I doubt restraint is how
you got to be the man you are today.

553
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,302
Play way, no way, highway, byway!

554
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,763
Please, son. Please.

555
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,269
<i>I wanna help you with all this,
and I will.</i>

556
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,813
But right now, she needs our help,
or she's gonna die.

557
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,353
Barry, did you hear what I said?
Iris is gonna die.

558
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,115
Barry's gone.

559
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,584
You know what else is gone?

560
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,416
The new suit.

561
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,373
What's happening?

562
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,300
The Flash is back.

563
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,224
Do you see how fast he's running?

564
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,180
I've never gone that fast.

565
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,344
No one has.

566
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,740
Where is this samurai taking Iris?

567
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,033
They're already way past Danville

568
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,202
and the only thing out there is
the flat lands and...

569
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,862
And what?

570
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,992
Come on, Barry. Catch her.

571
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,409
<i>Flash. Welcome home.</i>

572
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,120
<i>Barry.</i>

573
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,293
You came back to me.

574
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,714
Always.

575
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,738
Pupils are equally reactive to light,

576
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,032
and your vitals are amazing.
You're in perfect health,

577
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,154
even for you.

578
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,532
I'd like a urine sample
just to confirm,

579
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,871
<i>but everything looks great.</i>

580
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,323
Man, you love urine.

581
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,575
You love the testing of urine.

582
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,252
The testing of the urine...
You know what I meant.

583
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,832
Why do you have to ruin science?

584
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,379
It's good to have you back.

585
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,165
Right back at you.

586
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,001
Good to have you back.

587
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,587
- How you feeling?
- I feel great.

588
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,302
Yeah, I feel incredible.
I don't know. It feels like...

589
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,433
I've been reborn.

590
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,561
Well, okay, speedy Jesus.

591
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,314
Seriously, though, I mean,
it hurts me to admit it,

592
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,609
but you may be
the fastest speedster ever.

593
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,729
I mean, you were in the Speed Force
for six months.

594
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,314
Maybe you were soaking up its energy.

595
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,023
Maybe.

596
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,992
How was everything while I was gone?

597
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,910
Oh, yeah. It was really cool.

598
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,329
Team Kid Flash had
everything under control, so...

599
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,657
That's not our name.

600
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,202
But still we have some mysteries
left to solve.

601
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,955
Like our flying samurai robot.

602
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,964
Android samurai...

603
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,503
Samuroid.

604
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,585
Oh-oh, we back, baby!

605
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,926
Yeah, someone created this,
and it must be for a reason.

606
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,634
Does the phrase,
"This house is bitchin',"

607
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,097
mean anything to you?

608
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,720
No.

609
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:14,722
Should it?

610
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,317
No. Just know that when you were
in your <i>Beautiful Mind</i> phase,

611
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,360
you were talking straight up nonsense.

612
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,233
I don't remember any of that.

613
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,032
Last thing I remember was going
into the Speed Force with my mom

614
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,609
and then saving Iris.

615
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,990
So how'd you know Iris was in trouble?

616
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,948
I don't know.

617
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,325
<i>Mmm.</i>

618
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,373
Well, thanks for bringing me home.

619
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,210
You're very welcome.

620
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,135
Hey, Cisco.
Thanks for believing when I couldn't.

621
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,097
- See you tomorrow, boss.
- Yeah.

622
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,930
I know we left some
questions unanswered,

623
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,640
but I have to know.

624
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,693
Are we gonna see you tomorrow?

625
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,986
Yeah, you will.

626
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,275
We back, baby.

627
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,239
We back, baby.

628
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,167
- Where have you been?
- Doesn't matter.

629
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,664
Really?

630
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,050
Tell Amunet I'm out.

631
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,087
You wanna quit, Snow?
It doesn't work that way.

632
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,007
You do what Amunet says
for as long as she tells you.

633
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,594
Not anymore. Now, leave me alone.

634
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,847
You don't tell us what to do.

635
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,441
Don't make me frosty.

636
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,023
You wouldn't like me when I'm frosty.

637
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,781
What's the matter? Brain freeze?

638
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,367
Touch my hand again,
and I'll freeze yours off,

639
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,202
maybe some other parts, too.

640
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,333
Tell Amunet I'm done.

641
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,004
Don't let your beer get warm.

642
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,341
Time to have some fun.

643
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,678
Not yet.

644
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,357
Oh, no. No, no, no.

645
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,433
No, no, no.

646
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,773
Not again.

647
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,204
Are you tired?
Do you wanna get some sleep?

648
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,294
No, I feel like
I've been asleep for months.

649
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,256
I... I couldn't bring myself
to sleep in our bed alone.

650
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,886
I couldn't even look at that.

651
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,228
It's been really hard, Barry.

652
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,523
Hey, I'm back.

653
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,234
And I'm never going anywhere ever again.

654
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:08,980
I tried to keep going,

655
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,699
to keep fighting,
to keep running like you said.

656
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,775
You did.

657
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,404
You kept everyone together.

658
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,915
I'm so proud of you, okay?

659
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,372
Look, it sounds funny,

660
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,205
but maybe this was a blessing.

661
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,167
You being gone for six months
was a blessing?

662
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,675
I just... I can't tell you
how I feel, Iris. It's like...

663
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:38,926
Everything that was wrong in my life,
the pain of my past, my mistakes,

664
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,352
it's all just washed away,

665
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,521
and all I see is you and us

666
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,439
and our future together.

667
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,442
Iris, it's gonna be great.

668
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,779
Central City needs the Flash.

669
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,330
I'll be right back, I promise.

670
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,469
The samurai served its purpose.

671
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,688
<i>As in 12th century
feudal Japan,</i>

672
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,357
<i>a time when the military class
was powerful,</i>

673
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,737
<i>their execution methodical
like ours.</i>

674
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,160
Well, it worked.
The Flash is back in Central City.

675
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,908
<i>It appears things are going
as planned.</i>

676
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,249
As if there were any doubt.

677
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,999
What's our next step?

678
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,295
I'm thinking.

679
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:04,319
