1
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,588
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,841
<i>I'll find my way out.</i>

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,136
<i>'Cause this place is just one big puzzle,
and puzzles are my forte.</i>

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:11,930
Oh, my.

5
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:14,669
I don't know who you are anymore.

6
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:17,102
Please. That is such a ridiculous cliché...

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,604
<i>It's time for me to look out
for number one.</i>

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,275
The man who contracted Matches Malone
to kill your parents

9
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,819
<i>called himself the Philosopher.</i>

10
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,946
"Hugo Strange, the Philosopher."

11
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:32,283
I was one of the ones who forced
Thomas Wayne to shut down the program.

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,370
You're lying. I needed to be sure
you were behind all this.

13
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:36,788
And now I am.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,584
<i>Our creations need new personae
to give their minds focus.</i>

15
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,129
<i>That sword was made yesterday.</i>

16
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:47,674
Our replica is central to his acceptance
of his new identity.

17
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,300
I am Azrael.

18
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:51,261
My Lord Dumas...

19
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:52,929
Command me.

20
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:56,850
A murderer walks the streets
of the city a free man.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,811
By your blade, he must be destroyed.

22
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,064
- Tell me his name.
- James Gordon.

23
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:09,237
That is not possible.

24
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:14,576
You?

25
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,078
You're dead.

26
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:18,830
Not anymore.

27
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,003
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

28
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,880
You are upsetting the inmates.

29
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,131
Where's your boss, darling?

30
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,675
We got a warrant to search his office
and everything in it.

31
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,761
He's busy with patients.

32
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,555
That's quite all right, Ms. Peabody.

33
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:38,695
We're gonna tear this place apart,
Strange. We're gonna get answers.

34
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:40,518
Answers to what?

35
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:45,148
Records indicate Theo Galavan's dead body
was brought here, that it was cremated.

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,483
Seems likely.

37
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,943
Then why the hell
was he at the GCPD last night

38
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,237
running our captain through
with a sword, huh?

39
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:52,530
I'm surprised as you are.

40
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,377
And while you're at it,
explain to me this.

41
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:56,534
Why Victor Fries, also last seen here,

42
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:01,164
very dead, is alive and kicking
and dressed like a spaceman.

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,875
You stink, Strange.

44
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,211
This whole damn place stinks.

45
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,129
Excuse me.

46
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:11,966
- Is this your office?
- Yes.

47
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,760
<i>But, Detective, please.</i>

48
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,222
What the...

49
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,307
Shredded? Son of a...

50
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,518
Spring cleaning.

51
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,186
You are free to look around.

52
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,897
I'm just not sure
there's much more to see.

53
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,237
Do you think shredding a few documents
is gonna save you? It won't.

54
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:33,988
We're onto you.

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,533
Bad guys come in and monsters come out.

56
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,576
Just like Pinewood, right?

57
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,246
Seeing as how you no longer work
for the police department,

58
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,873
I'm not required to speak with you.

59
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:45,959
Mr. Gordon.

60
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,589
You have a lot of anger, James Gordon.

61
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,259
I can help you with that.

62
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,806
We're gonna tear this damn building apart.
Every square inch.

63
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,182
Check your warrant, Detective.

64
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,687
It clearly states that you have permission
to search my office. Nothing more.

65
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,023
Of course, I am more than happy
to accommodate you.

66
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,234
If you come back with a different warrant.

67
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,281
Just know
that I will also be calling the judge,

68
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,947
and telling him how disruptive it is
to have the GCPD

69
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,490
and others,

70
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:19,909
traipsing about this place of healing

71
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:23,580
and disrupting the patients unnecessarily.

72
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,708
This ain't over yet.

73
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,300
Has Azrael returned?

74
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:37,802
Nope.

75
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:40,889
Troubling.

76
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,950
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

77
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,932
What are you doing out of your cell?

78
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:06,331
Big mistake. Sorry. My bad. Just got lost.

79
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:07,999
Escort me back, would you?

80
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,585
Thank you.

81
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,506
Thank you. Have a nice day.

82
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,596
I've gotta get out of here.

83
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,371
Damn kids.

84
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:50,792
Did you break the lock?

85
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,543
Hey, you.

86
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,755
This is God's house, a place of worship.
Not a homeless shelter.

87
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,757
Get out before I call the cops!

88
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:04,555
I need a weapon to fulfill my holy quest.

89
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,516
I don't have any weapons.

90
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,017
Oh.

91
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,560
Then what good are you?

92
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,637
<i>Captain Nathaniel Barnes</i>

93
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,746
<i>remains in critical condition
at Gotham General</i>

94
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:33,292
<i>after suffering a violent attack
by a masked assailant late last night.</i>

95
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,421
<i>So far, no arrests have been made,</i>

96
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,590
<i>but reports coming from
within the locked down GCPD</i>

97
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,135
<i>have confirmed that the masked man
is, in fact,</i>

98
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,846
<i>former Gotham mayor, Theo Galavan.</i>

99
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,314
<i>Search parties
continued throughout the night,</i>

100
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:50,601
<i>but as of yet,
Galavan's whereabouts remain a mystery.</i>

101
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:56,357
There's nowhere to hide, Galavan.

102
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,276
I'm coming for you.

103
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,015
Alvarez, any sign of him yet?

104
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,498
No, but we've got
six choppers in the air

105
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,459
and every sniffer dog in the state
out there looking.

106
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,794
Call the brass upstate,
tell them to get more men down here.

107
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,401
That freak couldn't have gotten far.

108
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,965
Tom, get Judge Bam Bam on the phone.

109
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,551
Tell him I need a new warrant
to search Arkham.

110
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,137
Every frigging room, all of it.

111
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,897
What are they all doing?

112
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,399
They don't have a captain, Harvey.

113
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,359
Guess you're it.

114
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,111
I ain't no captain.

115
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:45,364
- Say something to them.
- I don't work here anymore. You do.

116
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,829
All right, everyone, listen up.

117
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,665
I know we're all a bit freaked out
right now.

118
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:57,043
It's understandable, hmm?

119
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,798
Some nutjob in a Halloween costume
and cape comes in to our house,

120
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,133
and takes out four of our brothers.

121
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:08,346
He does this to our captain.

122
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,681
Now, I've been around a long time.

123
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:15,561
It's like the bad guys in this town
just keep getting weirder and weirder.

124
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,688
But under that mask,

125
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,818
he's just a man, and he can bleed.

126
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,861
Just like you and me.

127
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,532
And if he bleeds, he can be beaten.

128
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,869
So let's do what the cap would tell us
to do if he were here.

129
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,915
Let's go out there
and let's find that son of a bitch.

130
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:38,376
And let's get him, whatever it takes!

131
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,961
All right.

132
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,471
- I'm not one for speeches.
- No, no, no. You did fine.

133
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,973
But?

134
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:56,352
If that was Galavan that I saw,
he'll know how to stay out of sight.

135
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,104
We gotta think outside the box.

136
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,480
Like what?

137
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,440
Who knows him best?
Who's still in the city?

138
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,902
His sister.

139
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:07,989
<i>Alfred, pull over.</i>

140
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,575
Master Bruce, are you out of your tiny,
bloody mind?

141
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,956
There's a madman loose on the streets.

142
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,917
Now is not the time to go running around
on your own, is it?

143
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,253
I don't plan on being on my own.

144
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,338
With all due respect, sir,

145
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,092
what good will a 15-year-old little
girl do, even if Galavan does turn up?

146
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,760
Strange lied to the police.

147
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,429
I know and so do you.

148
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,098
- I can't stay at home and do nothing.
- We need to trust Jim Gordon.

149
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,975
I'm tired of trusting Jim Gordon.

150
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,476
Aren't you?

151
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,481
I am your guardian, Master Bruce.

152
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,234
And it's my job to protect you.

153
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,112
Is it your job to watch me sit on my hands
and do nothing?

154
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,951
Alfred, please.

155
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:56,495
Let me go.

156
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,707
<i>- Hey, buddy. Move your car.</i>

157
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,294
Just... Just be careful, all right?

158
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,048
I will.

159
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,960
<i>- Hey! Let's go!</i>
- Yeah, all right, mate. Keep...

160
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,886
Just keep your bloody hair on.

161
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,430
Don't go, baby, come on.
Let's talk about this, huh?

162
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,558
- Is this because I kicked Barbara out?
- Just let me go, Butch.

163
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,102
Come on, I'll do whatever you want.
 I'll eat more fruit.

164
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,104
I'll work on the snoring.
I swear to God, whatever you need...

165
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,791
Catch you guys at a bad time?

166
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,858
Seriously?
How do people keep getting in here?

167
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,401
Do I have no security at all?

168
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,736
Why the rush?

169
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,572
- Just time to move on.
- Oh, yeah, is that it?

170
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,116
Or are you worried
Galavan's coming after you, too?

171
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,743
Don't worry, Butch.

172
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,286
It's not about you.

173
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,497
She's just scared of her brother.

174
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,583
Come on, help me find him.

175
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,795
You two hardly left on the best of terms.

176
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,421
Must have been weird
to see your dead brother

177
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,216
show up dressed like a ninja
from Medieval Times.

178
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,018
That thing that stabbed your captain
last night?

179
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,437
It wasn't my brother.

180
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:07,024
That was a 300-year-old
assassin called Azrael.

181
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:09,735
Azrael?

182
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,239
That image I saw on the news, his clothes,
the way he moved...

183
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,615
It was Azrael.

184
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,411
A mythical figure worshipped by the monks
who raised my brother.

185
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,374
A cold-hearted killing machine sent into
the night to kill his master's enemies.

186
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,876
And he wants you.

187
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,045
An ancient assassin?

188
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:29,964
A legend.

189
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,300
My family used to tell stories of him.

190
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,218
He was real?

191
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,720
Who knows?

192
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,055
It was 300 years ago. Probably, yes.

193
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,975
So your brother's gone nuts?

194
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,561
You tell me.

195
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:47,189
Theo convince you that he was Azrael
last night, or was he acting?

196
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,736
Someone got inside my brother's head.

197
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,196
It's not a safe place to be.

198
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,073
If you're right, I wanna find this person,

199
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,034
but first I have to find your brother.

200
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,411
So, help me.

201
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,539
If a search team finds him,
they're gonna kill him.

202
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,292
He is still your brother, after all.

203
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,252
He's blood.

204
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,301
The sword that was used last night?
The one that broke?

205
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,428
- It was fake.
- And you know this how?

206
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,529
The real one belonged to my grandfather.

207
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,017
He was an antiquities collector,
obsessed with Dumas history.

208
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,519
I saw it once. It was beautiful.

209
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,064
Forged by the monks themselves.

210
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,442
It's said to hold supernatural powers.

211
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,277
Theo knew this.

212
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,038
It's possible
he'll attempt to steal it back.

213
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,931
Does your grandfather still have it?

214
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,327
And where is he?

215
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,704
Gotham Cemetery.

216
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,458
He's been dead for 20 years.

217
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,796
But he was buried with his treasures.

218
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,437
Selina?

219
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,818
What's up?

220
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,905
I remember you telling me you were
still feeding your friend's birds.

221
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,199
Someone has to.

222
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,119
Why are you here?

223
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,621
- Have you seen the news?
- Walking zombies in Gotham?

224
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,665
What's new?

225
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,501
Strange worked for my father
on a project designed to help people.

226
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,336
He perverted it
and now I believe he's found a way to...

227
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,712
Bring back the dead?

228
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,549
- A little far-fetched, don't you think?
- Perhaps.

229
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,815
But he's hiding something.
The police have failed to find out what.

230
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:41,846
I think I can do better.

231
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,681
That so?

232
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,644
When my father shut down Strange,
he was killed.

233
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,023
Selina, I just want the truth, that's all.

234
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,901
You just won't be happy
until you get yourself killed, will you?

235
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,696
Victor Fries and Theo Galavan
both went to Arkham as dead men.

236
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,030
Both returned.

237
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,533
- I don't care.
- So did your friend Bridgit.

238
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,038
Wait, they sent her to Arkham?

239
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,170
She may still be there right now.

240
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,422
<i>- Alive.</i>

241
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,553
I told her to leave town.

242
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,638
<i>To run, but she didn't listen.</i>

243
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,559
It's my fault she's there.

244
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,812
Selina, we can put this right.

245
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,232
Strange was ready for the police.

246
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,387
He may even have been tipped off.

247
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,154
The only way we're gonna find out
what's really going on in there,

248
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,490
is if we break in ourselves.

249
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,658
Break in?

250
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,785
To Arkham?

251
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,331
A highly guarded place
that's packed with crazy people?

252
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,246
If that's too dangerous for you,
I'll just go myself.

253
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,422
I didn't say that.

254
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,511
Prisons are meant to stop people
from breaking out, not in. It can be done.

255
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,304
It's a looney bin.

256
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:06,805
Not a prison.

257
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,599
I know it can be done.

258
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,352
But I go alone.

259
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,479
Why?

260
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,190
I get caught, they'll just toss me out.

261
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,900
Nobody cares about me.

262
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,695
But you? They see you coming,
and they'll shut that whole thing down

263
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,322
quicker than you can say rat.

264
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,276
And then you'll never find out
what they've been up to.

265
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,038
That, or they'll just kill you.

266
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,458
Besides,

267
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,294
I already know a way in.

268
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:56,146
This is it.

269
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,898
The Dumas crypt.

270
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,401
Dozens of my relatives are buried here.

271
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,071
So, does someone have a key?

272
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,661
All right. Key. Crowbar.

273
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,891
This one. My grandfather's.

274
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,060
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

275
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,190
I'm sure we're breaking
more than a few laws right now.

276
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,359
Really? This is where you draw the line?

277
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:43,861
Come on.

278
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,030
This doesn't creep you out
even a little bit?

279
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,866
- It's frigging grave robbing.
- Whatever it takes, Harvey.

280
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,630
Little help?

281
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,724
Oh!

282
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,562
That was said to be Azrael's sword
up until the end.

283
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,650
- He died?
- No, he disappeared.

284
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,569
Azrael's thought to be immortal.

285
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,748
It's beautiful.

286
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,124
<i>I will take that.</i>

287
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,183
James Gordon.

288
00:16:57,393 --> 00:17:00,771
Time. To. Die.

289
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,737
Step aside. He must die.

290
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,114
It's me, brother.

291
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,491
Don't you recognize me?

292
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,744
My quarrel is not with you. Step aside.

293
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,665
Tabitha. Your sister.

294
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,294
I have what you're looking for.

295
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:55,159
Tabitha?

296
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,411
That's right.

297
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,964
You remember where we grew up?

298
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,426
The estate by the sea?

299
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,679
Before the monks took you.

300
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,724
Our dogs, the horses?

301
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,312
We were happy once.

302
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,193
You are Theo Galavan.

303
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,029
My brother.

304
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,200
Theo?

305
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,162
Yes.

306
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,960
<i>Theo Galavan, the new mayor.</i>

307
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,547
Do you remember now?

308
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,384
<i>Death to the Son of Gotham.</i>

309
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:55,844
<i>Death to the Son of Gotham.</i>

310
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,723
Bruce Wayne.

311
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,727
We were sent to kill him.

312
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,021
Yes. Yes, but...

313
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,315
He dishonored our family name.

314
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:09,900
Yes.

315
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,444
Death to the Son of Gotham.

316
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,384
Thank you for reminding me.

317
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,136
Traitor.

318
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,241
<i>Go through the folding iron.</i>

319
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,955
<i>There you go.</i>

320
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,040
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

321
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,262
<i>- Harvey?</i>
- He's gone.

322
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,558
This is Bullock.

323
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,768
I need a backup down at the cemetery.

324
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,979
Galavan's in the wind, again.

325
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,023
Okay.

326
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,818
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,321
- I made him remember.
- Remember what?

328
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,573
Bruce.

329
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,327
Death to the Son of Gotham.

330
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,998
Stay with her. I need to find Bruce.

331
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,150
Hey!

332
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:16,652
Stop!

333
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,737
- I need this car.
- You ain't a cop anymore.

334
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,405
I need the damn car.

335
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,429
It's okay.

336
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,934
<i>- What do we got here?
- Looks good.</i>

337
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,817
Put that with the other one.

338
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,568
All right. This looks good.

339
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:04,968
Ugh.

340
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,489
Come on, come on.

341
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,084
- Master Bruce?
<i>- No, it's me. Where's Bruce?</i>

342
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,252
I don't know, he was in the city.

343
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,420
Where in the city?

344
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,506
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I haven't got the foggiest.

345
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,466
He's got a mind of his own at the moment,
that one, ain't he?

346
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,886
All right, well, we need to find him.
Galavan could be coming after him.

347
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,764
Well, you having a laugh, ain't you?
I thought he was after you.

348
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,683
He was.
Tabitha must have jogged his memory.

349
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,977
Reminded him of his original mission.

350
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,646
To kill Bruce Wayne.

351
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,359
- Right, well, I'll get the motor.
<i>- No, no, no. You stay there.</i>

352
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,029
In case he comes back. Where was the last
place you saw him in the city?

353
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,572
Uh, Collins and Delaney.

354
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,076
Last I saw of him, he was headed
for the roof to see that Selina, I reckon.

355
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,869
<i>All right, I'll head over there.</i>

356
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,914
<i>Till then, be safe.</i>

357
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,459
Right, so. Will do.

358
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,173
Oh, for Pete's sake, Master Bruce.

359
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,717
Creeping up on someone like that,
I could've filleted you.

360
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,052
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,389
- What's wrong?
- Galavan, Master Bruce.

362
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,517
Theo bloody Galavan is what's wrong.

363
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,410
Okay. Okay.

364
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,745
Holy cow!

365
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,581
Forensic guy?

366
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,833
- Street trash girl?
- You framed Gordon.

367
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,459
And you tried to get a reward
by turning him in.

368
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:02,627
Mmm, yeah.

369
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,672
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

370
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,972
I gotta get out of here.
This place is crazy.

371
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,434
They'll be looking for me.
Which way is out of here?

372
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,895
I'll help you if you help me.

373
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,313
Where's Strange right now?

374
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,814
Okay.

375
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,941
Look, I barely know you.

376
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,389
But that is the last person
that you wanna be looking for.

377
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,486
Why is that?

378
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,615
The basement here. It's horrible.

379
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,951
Just trust me. Stay away.
He is a very dangerous man.

380
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,161
Basement?

381
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,662
Alive people.

382
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,247
Dead people.

383
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,277
Dead-alive people. It's horrible.

384
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,459
Okay, how do I get there?

385
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,544
It's like I'm saying things
and you're just not hearing them.

386
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,255
He has a friend of mine
and I'm here to get her out.

387
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,969
Now, how do I get there?

388
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,265
- You'll tell me the way out?
- Yes.

389
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:58,767
Okay.

390
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,936
There's an elevator.

391
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:05,232
I'll tell you where it is,
but can you pick a lock?

392
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,331
Why'd you have to be brave, huh?

393
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,168
I just got used to you being around.

394
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,421
Partners, right?

395
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,428
How am I supposed
to keep people in line now, huh?

396
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,808
I don't think I can do this without you.

397
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,864
You're one of the only people in the world

398
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,939
who looks me in the eye
when they talk to me.

399
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,191
You know that?

400
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,863
You laugh at my jokes.

401
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,825
And you actually like the way I look.

402
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:03,006
I didn't think
I'd ever feel like this again.

403
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,840
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

404
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,601
Well, don't stop now,
I was just getting misty.

405
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,397
What are you doing here?

406
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,233
Paying my respects.

407
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,408
She's looked better, I must say.

408
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:40,452
You will not hurt her.

409
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,163
Why would I do that?

410
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,790
Oh, I know.

411
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:51,671
Because she stabbed my mother in the back!

412
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,344
If you touch her, I will kill you.

413
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,014
I like this new side of you.

414
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,185
Soft. Sentimental.

415
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,439
He has to pay, Butch.

416
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,276
- Who? Azrael?
- No!

417
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,403
Galavan!

418
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:19,783
See, I will not buy
this whole über-villain nonsense.

419
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,911
I mean, if he wanted to wear leather,
he should just wear leather.

420
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:26,206
This is Gotham City. No one cares, right?

421
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,835
We have all suffered by his hand.

422
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,880
Me. You.

423
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,924
My mother.

424
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,635
And now, his own sister.

425
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,598
Galavan must die.

426
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,690
And when he does,

427
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,859
you'll leave us alone?

428
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,823
Mmm. I suppose.

429
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:01,574
Promise.

430
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,829
Jeez. Fine. Yes. Whatever.

431
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:08,373
Where is he?

432
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,294
- Yeah?
<i>- He's here.</i>

433
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,629
And he's safe.

434
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,340
Thank God. I'm coming.

435
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,609
You're more to me
than just a guardian, Alfred.

436
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:40,989
You're my friend.

437
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,909
Your timing really is quite impeccable,
Master Bruce.

438
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:48,121
But we haven't got time
for sentimental nonsense right now.

439
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,622
We need to make sure
that all the doors are locked,

440
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,207
all the windows are closed,
and the lights are off.

441
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:54,461
To make it hard as possible
for Galavan to find us. Do you get me?

442
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,309
Detective Gordon's sure he's coming here?

443
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,382
Nothing's certain, is it?
So we need to be ready.

444
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,092
Okay.

445
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:02,739
It's a big house, we should split up.

446
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,388
Fine.

447
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,390
But just you be quick.

448
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:12,187
<i>So, you take the upstairs.
I will take the downstairs.</i>

449
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:15,233
<i>You make sure the windows are closed,
you make sure the doors are locked.</i>

450
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,025
<i>You make sure the skylights are closed.</i>

451
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,524
<i>And then you meet me down here, as quick
as you can, in the study, all right?</i>

452
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,696
<i>Now go.</i>

453
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,494
Alfred! Alfred!

454
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,419
Ingenious.

455
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:45,803
You.

456
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,306
You will show me to the boy.

457
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,141
Over my dead body.

458
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,270
As you wish.

459
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,626
Let's check it out.

460
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,300
<i>What's that noise?</i>

461
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,137
Hey, Ed, what's that noise?

462
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,223
Nygma?

463
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,977
Son of a gun.

464
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,399
Nygma?

465
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,655
Sound the alarm. We've got a runner.

466
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,283
Go.

467
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,683
Come on, come on, come on.

468
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,520
Oh. Okay.

469
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,790
Alfred! Alfred!

470
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,503
Alfred!

471
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,922
Take one more step, mate,

472
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,133
I will put a bullet
right between your bloody eyes.

473
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:50,178
You think that'll stop me, you manservant?

474
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,138
I'd like to give it a go,
if you don't mind.

475
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,545
You think I am flesh and blood?

476
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,351
I am immortal,
and I have grown tired of you.

477
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,273
Alfred!

478
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:03,941
Run, Bruce!

479
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,072
Immortal? Let's see, shall we?

480
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:49,404
Alfred.

481
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,877
Come on, come on.

482
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:23,905
<i>Hey, just gonna need someone
to come down here and take a look.</i>

483
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,136
Give us a minute, please.

484
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,432
I think we can safely say
Azrael has gone rogue.

485
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,852
I'm not comfortable
making that assumption just yet.

486
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,688
But it's been more than 24 hours
since he's made contact.

487
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:09,025
Perhaps that's because
Jim Gordon still breathes.

488
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:11,861
But if the police
catch him first, how do we explain?

489
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:15,490
Something that cannot be explained?
We don't.

490
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,702
Theo Galavan is no more.
Azrael is his new creation.

491
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,038
A killer. A madman.

492
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:25,333
<i>The GCPD will fail
if they try to capture him.</i>

493
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,044
They'll have to kill him first
and when they do,

494
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,630
they'll be successfully
covering our tracks for us.

495
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,132
<i>In the meantime,
this facility needs to be shut down.</i>

496
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,884
<i>All subjects moved to the new location.</i>

497
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,427
Already happening.

498
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,221
That's my girl.

499
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,905
Damn it.

500
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,586
Don't hide, little boy.

501
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,796
Face me.

502
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:56,465
Face death.

503
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:03,180
<i>You know the Waynes were a blight
upon the city.</i>

504
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,143
<i>A selfish, arrogant family.</i>

505
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,023
A family with no beliefs.

506
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,317
No honor.

507
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,946
No respect.

508
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:24,744
You are your father's only son, Bruce.

509
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:26,954
When I kill you,

510
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:32,418
I eradicate the Wayne name forever.

511
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,303
It will be as though

512
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,597
you had never existed.

513
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:35,731
Enough of fun and games.

514
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,822
Prepare to die.

515
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:53,457
Unexpected.

516
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:09,682
You okay?

517
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:11,642
Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

518
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,477
Seems like I missed all the fun.

519
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:14,687
Where have you been?

520
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,647
I slowed him down for you, didn't I?

521
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,232
I'll call Bullock.

522
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,892
It's time I taught you
how to drive, Master Bruce.

523
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:42,423
<i>You should know by now
that bullets don't kill this monster, Jim.</i>

524
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,682
My last one got stuck in your throat, so,

525
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,849
I'm thinking about shoving this one
somewhere else.

526
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,854
Jim, a little tip for next time.

527
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,648
Always bring the right tools for the job.

528
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,611
See you in hell, Theo.

529
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,531
Oh.

530
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:30,763
You're welcome.

531
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:33,849
Let's go, Butch.

532
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:37,394
Night, fellas.

533
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,827
Oh, God!

534
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,468
Oh, the little sprite was right.

535
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:13,180
Freeze!

536
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,890
<i>Remain where you are.</i>

537
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,603
Oh, dear.

538
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,853
Are you my human subject?

539
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,064
What?

540
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:06,192
Were you sent here to test me?

541
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,030
- Bridgit?
- Who's Bridgit?

542
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,783
- It's me, Selina.
- What?

543
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,870
You burned yourself when the cops
tried to bust you, remember?

544
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:20,289
I don't remember anything before this.

545
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:23,292
Professor Strange told me I have amnesia.

546
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:24,877
No, don't trust him.

547
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:26,879
<i>Your name is Bridgit.</i>

548
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:29,381
He told me he'd send people to test me.

549
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:32,635
Well, I'm not here to test you.
I'm here to take you home.

550
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:34,845
That's what he said you'd say.

551
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,640
Bridgit, no. Bridgit, no. Bridgit, no.
Bridgit, no! Bridgit, no!

552
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:43,312
Bridgit, no.

553
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:44,980
Don't call me that.

554
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,316
My name is

555
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:48,817
Firefly.

556
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:36,907
English - SDH
