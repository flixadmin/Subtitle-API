1
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,063
That's your favorite, isn't it?

2
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,860
How are you feeling today?

3
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,610
Okay.

4
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,990
Are you up for some more lessons?

5
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,507
Afternoon, Dr. Brenner.

6
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,716
Dr. Ellis.

7
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,575
Okay.

8
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,412
What do you see?

9
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:14,962
Don't force it.

10
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:16,755
Let it come to you.

11
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,841
Just like we practiced.

12
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,843
It's...

13
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,221
...a yellow circle.

14
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:25,346
The sun.

15
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,725
Very good. Very good.

16
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,105
All right. Now, let's see...

17
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:39,862
Okay.

18
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,156
Now what do you see?

19
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,034
A...

20
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
cow?

21
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,420
It's supposed to be a dog.

22
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:57,754
It looks like a cow.

23
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,966
It does, doesn't it?

24
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,012
I never was much of an artist.

25
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,018
All right. Let's try something
a little bit more challenging.

26
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:13,187
Is that all right with you?

27
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:17,483
I want you to find Dr. Ellis.

28
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,735
Can you do that?

29
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,579
Have you found her?

30
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,163
Yes.

31
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,750
What's she doing?

32
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,920
Lessons with Six in his room.

33
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,963
What kind of lessons?

34
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,634
Six is trying to move a block.

35
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,887
A red block.

36
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,350
Can you hear what they're saying?

37
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:58,024
Something's wrong.

38
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,401
If you've lost the visual, just let it go.

39
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,819
Try to reorient.

40
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,033
They're screaming.

41
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,369
Why are they screaming?

42
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,247
Ten?

43
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,463
- Peter, Alec, what's going on out there?
<i>- Sir, we've got a situation.</i>

44
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:23,966
Six and Dr. Ellis...

45
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:26,634
Dead.

46
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,680
They're both dead.

47
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,054
What have you done?

48
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,270
What have you done?

49
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,767
<i>Dear Mike,</i>

50
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,937
<i>Today is day 185.</i>

51
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,315
<i>Feels more like ten years.</i>

52
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,525
<i>Joyce says time is funny like that.</i>

53
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,322
<i>Emotions can make it
speed up or slow down.</i>

54
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:18,451
<i>We are all time travelers
if you think about it.</i>

55
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,913
<i>For example, this week is going very fast.</i>

56
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,956
<i>I think because I am so busy.</i>

57
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:28,836
<i>I have to make something
called a visual aid.</i>

58
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,340
<i>I hope Mrs. Gracey will give me an A.</i>

59
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,967
I can send you
a previous edition as a loaner

60
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,679
to see if you like the product
before committing to purchasing it...

61
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,182
<i>Some exciting news.</i>

62
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,808
<i>Joyce got an amazing new job.</i>

63
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,645
<i>She gets to work at home.</i>

64
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,940
Yeah, I'm... I'm not a robot.
You do realize that, don't you?

65
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,610
<i>She says she loves the "freedom."</i>

66
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,692
Prick.

67
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,072
<i>Will is painting a lot,</i>

68
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,948
<i>but he... he won't show me
what he's working on.</i>

69
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,576
<i>Maybe it is for a girl.</i>

70
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,578
<i>I think there is someone he likes,</i>

71
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,246
<i>because he has been acting</i>

72
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:07,249
<i>weird.</i>

73
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,628
<i>Jonathan is acting weird also.</i>

74
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,839
<i>I think he is just nervous about college.</i>

75
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,174
<i>He is still waiting for his big letter.</i>

76
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,135
<i>I hope he and Nancy get to go together.</i>

77
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,428
Damn it.

78
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,808
<i>But I don't know how he'll get to college
because his car is still broken.</i>

79
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,774
<i>His funny friend Argyle
has been taking us to school.</i>

80
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:33,942
<i>His hair is longer than mine.</i>

81
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:37,196
<i>And he and Jonathan
like to smoke smelly plants together.</i>

82
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:42,076
<i>Jonathan says the plants are super safe
because they come from the earth,</i>

83
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:43,744
<i>but to not tell Joyce.</i>

84
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,374
<i>Me?</i>

85
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,835
<i>I am twice as happy now.</i>

86
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,171
<i>You were right. It just takes time.</i>

87
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:55,380
All right.

88
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,383
Hold on to your butts, brochachos.

89
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:02,471
<i>I think I have finally adapted.</i>

90
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,972
Slow down!

91
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,937

- The hell are you doing? It's ten after.
- Oh, shit. Shit!

118
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,448
Thirty seconds
or I'm leaving without you, okay?

119
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,450
Thirty seconds.

120
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,284
Okay, I have to find my pants.

121
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,504
- Michael, I know your D&D club is tonight.
- Hellfire.

122
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:00,923
Why don't you call it
the High School Dropout Club?

123
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,424
- I want you home no later than 9:00.
- I'll try.

124
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,135
- No trying. You need to go to bed early.
- Why?

125
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,931
- It's a 6:30 flight, Michael.
- Yeah, I know, but...

126
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,975
No buts. Nine or no California.

127
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:12,684
And no sweetie pie.

128
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,768
Mike!

129
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:15,855
Let's go.

130
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:19,066
Jesus. How am I gonna survive
a whole week without you guys?

131
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:23,571
Nine.

132
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:30,159
Remind me, when do they become
reasonable human beings again?

133
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,922
<i>That's a negative, Dustybun.</i>

134
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,631
Son of a bitch.

135
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,676
Try "Tigers86."

136
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:47,927
"Tigers86." Copy that.

137
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,268
Jiminy crickets, Dusty. I'm in.

138
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,561
Holy shit.

139
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,938
What's going on in there?
You're gonna be late.

140
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,356
Don't come in! I'm naked!

141
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm running out of time here.

142
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:04,736
Just hold your horsies, Dustybun.

143
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:11,451
Do you see it?

144
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:12,870
Yeah, I see it.

145
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:14,828
Yikes, Dusty.

146
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:15,871
Yeah.

147
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,297
I will repent later.

148
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,179
Then there's Heidi tomorrow night,
but the problem with Heidi

149
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,474
is that she's going
out of state for college.

150
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,644
Do I wanna start another relationship
that has no point other than sex?

151
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,230
I mean, I don't know.
Does that make sense to you?

152
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:42,066
- Robin, are you listening?
- Uh, yes.

153
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,902
- What did I just say?
- Something about sex with Linda.

154
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,528
No, I'm talking about Heidi.

155
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,572
- Cut me some slack, please.
- Well...

156
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,783
Your love life
is one of labyrinthine complexity.

157
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:53,619
It is 7:00 in the morning,
we have the stupid pep rally,

158
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,537
and I woke up looking like a corpse.

159
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,414
You're worried about a pep rally?
Expect me to believe that?

160
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,085
- Yeah? So?
- So we both know what this is about.

161
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,087
- Not buying that. This is about Vickie.
- Absolutely not.

162
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,298
- It is. You know what else?
- I don't care...

163
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:09,759
You gotta stop pretending to be
someone else when you're around her.

164
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,427
You just gotta be yourself.

165
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,472
You're literally quoting me to me.
You do realize that.

166
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,225
Maybe you need to listen to yourself.
Ever think about that?

167
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,561
I listened. Look at me.
Boom. Back in business.

168
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,813
- It's not the same thing. Okay?
- Well...

169
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,774
You ask out a girl and she says no.

170
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,860
Big deal. Nothing happens.
Maybe your ego's a little bruised.

171
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,738
I ask out the wrong girl,
and bam, I'm a town pariah.

172
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,950
I'd buy that, except Vickie
is definitely not the wrong girl.

173
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,909
We just don't know that, do we?

174
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,538
She returned <i>Fast Times</i>
paused at 53 minutes, 5 seconds.

175
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,332
Know who pauses <i>Fast Times</i>
at 53 minutes, 5 seconds?

176
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,503
- People who like boobies, Robin.
- Ew!

177
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,462
- Gross. Don't say boobies.
- Boobies.

178
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,091
Not a big deal, okay?
I like boobies. You like boobies.

179
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,220
Vickie likes boobies. Definitely.

180
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:56,222
It's boobies.

181
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,682
<i>♪ On and on and on and on ♪</i>

182
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,312
<i>♪ Jump! ♪</i>

183
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,487

184
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,323
- To the gym, everyone.
- Hey, wait up!

185
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,826
Pep rally! Pep rally!

186
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:19,078
Kyle, good to see you.

187
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,999
Hey, Josh.
To the gym, everyone. To the gym.

188
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,376
Go support your Tigers! Go, Tigers!

189
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,587
To the gym! Hi, Amber.

190
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,757
Max! Max!

191
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,551
Where were you yesterday?

192
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,637
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I forgot it was Thursday.

193
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,892
I'd like to see you today.
Come straight after lunch, okay?

194
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:28,022
Look, I'm not saying
that my girlfriend is better than yours.

195
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,317
It's just that Suzie's,
like, a certified genius.

196
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,778
You do realize El
saved the world twice, right?

197
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,073
And yet you still have a C in Spanish.

198
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,045
And let's hear it for your Tigers!

199
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:51,586
Whoo!

200
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,727
Good morning, Hawkins High!

201
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,897
First off... Hey.

202
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,733
First off, I'd like to thank
each and every one of you.

203
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:15,069
Without your support, we wouldn't be here.

204
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,779
Give yourselves a big hand.

205
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:28,750
And of course, of course,
I have to give a special shout-out

206
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,711
to the best
and the prettiest fans of all time,

207
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,462
the Tiger Cheer Squad.

208
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,133
Yeah!

209
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:37,384
Chrissy...

210
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,762
Chrissy, I love you, babe.

211
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,891
Aww!

212
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,895
You know...

213
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:54,942
I think I can
speak for all of us when I say

214
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,403
it's been a tough year for Hawkins.

215
00:19:58,822 --> 00:19:59,990
So much loss.

216
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,496
And sometimes I wonder,
"How much loss can one community take?"

217
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,627
In dark days like this,
we need something to believe in.

218
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:15,253
So, last night,

219
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,384
when we were down by ten points at half
to Christian Academy,

220
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
I looked at my team,

221
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,970
and I said,

222
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:25,388
"Think of Jack."

223
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,851
"Think of Melissa."

224
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,685
"Think of Heather."

225
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,064
"Think of Billy."

226
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,068
"Think about our heroic police chief,
Jim Hopper."

227
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:41,615
"Think about every one of our friends
who perished in that fire."

228
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,115
"What did they die for?"

229
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,451
"For us to lose
to some... some crap school?"

230
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,535
- "No."
- No!

231
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:49,455
"For us to return home
with our heads hung low in defeat?"

232
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:51,375
- "No!"
- No!

233
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,750
"No."

234
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,211
"Let's win this game."

235
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,173
"Let's win this game for them."
And that's exactly what we did!

236
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,556
We embarrassed those candy-asses
in their own house,

237
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,808
and now tonight, tonight,

238
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,936
we're gonna bring home
the championship trophy!

239
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,105
Let's go!

240
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,527
Tonight?

241
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:21,613
- How is that possible?
- They call it a tournament.

242
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:24,657
You win one game, you go on
until there's only one team left.

243
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,381
I don't get the big deal.
Just talk to Eddie.

244
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:41,383
Get him to move Hellfire to another night.

245
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:42,550
"Just talk to Eddie."

246
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,511
Why don't you <i>just</i> talk to your coach
and get him to move the game?

247
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,140
- I think that's a great idea, Mike.
<i>- </i>Thank you, Dustin.

248
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:52,144
- This is the championship game.
- And this is the end of Eddie's campaign.

249
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,314
A semester of adventuring
has led to this moment, and we need you.

250
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,982
Yeah, and the Tigers don't.
You've been on the bench all year.

251
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,194
- That's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

252
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,071
If I get in good with these guys,

253
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,907
I'll be in the popular crowd,
and then you guys will be too.

254
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:10,662
Has it ever occurred to you
that we don't want to be popular?

255
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,707
You wanna be stuck with the nerds
and freaks for three more years?

256
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:15,125
We <i>are</i> nerds and freaks.

257
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,835
But maybe we don't have to be.

258
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:21,798
Look, I'm tired of being bullied.

259
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,134
I'm tired of girls laughing at us.

260
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,926
I'm tired of feeling like a loser.

261
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:29,472
We came to high school
wanting things to be different. Right?

262
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,143
So now we have that chance.

263
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,729
I skip tonight, that's all out the window.

264
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:37,314
So I'm asking you guys,

265
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:38,731
as a friend,

266
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,816
just talk to Eddie.

267
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,276
Get him to move Hellfire.

268
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,818
Come to my game.

269
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,489
Please.

270
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,332
Shit.

271
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:12,432
<i>Mrs. Ergenbright,
let me ask you something.</i>

272
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,451
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- Have you ever wished

273
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,604
you could have the answer to any question,
right at your fingertips?

274
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:18,855
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

275
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:23,151
Yes. It's just like those...
those big fancy books you see on TV.

276
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:24,961
<i>Oh, yes, they're lovely.</i>

277
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,865
Yeah, just imagine, you'd never
have to go to the library again.

278
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,119
Or, hey, think of the money
that you'll save on gas alone.

279
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:34,578
<i>- Oh, good point.</i>
- Anything?

280
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,747
Nothing.

281
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,708
Acceptance letters tend to come
end of week to make you sweat.

282
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:39,917
Well, I'm sweating.

283
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,463
- It's coming, Mrs. Byers. Don't you worry.
- I always worry. Thanks.

284
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,799
<i>Oh, gosh. Did I lose you? Hello?</i>

285
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,885
No, sorry. Carol? Can I call you Carol?

286
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,888
<i>- Of... Of course.</i>
- Great. So, what are we thinking?

287
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:58,228
Could do volumes A through C,
or we could do the... the whole alphabet.

288
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,147
<i>Well, uh, remind me how much money...</i>

289
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:03,900
<i>I can't remember...</i>

290
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:06,486
Carol, uh, can I call you back?

291
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:07,570
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

292
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,240
<i>After learning to speak,</i>

293
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,617
she traveled the world
to spread her message,

294
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,036
and along the way,

295
00:24:56,118 --> 00:25:00,207
changed how the world perceived
those like her with disabilities.

296
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,960
And that is why I have chosen

297
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,880
Helen Keller as my hero.

298
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,094
That was wonderful, Angela.

299
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,137
Truly wonderful.

300
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,723
What an inspiring story.

301
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,434
Okay. Now let's see
who has to follow that.

302
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,022
Jane.

303
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,958
Hi.

304
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,170
For my hero,

305
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:49,337
I...

306
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,217
I chose my dad.

307
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,804
And for my visual aid,

308
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,224
I made a "direyama" of our cabin.

309
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:01,601
More like diarrhea.

310
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:05,102
Quiet, everyone.

311
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:06,480
Let's be respectful.

312
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:12,069
This is my dad.

313
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,655
His name is Hopper.

314
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,450
He made the best Eggos,

315
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,788
and...
...we liked to watch <i>Miami Vice</i> on Fridays.

316
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,208
This is Mr. Fibbly.

317
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,671
He is a squirrel.

318
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:31,964
What?

319
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:40,390
And this is the alarm that my dad made.

320
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,184
I... I was never scared because...

321
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,980
beca... because...

322
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:51,233
Uh, Angela, let's save questions
until the end of Jane's presentation.

323
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:52,943
Yeah. Sorry.

324
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,820
I'm just, like, confused.

325
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:59,075
I thought this was
a presentation about a historical hero.

326
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,826
My dad was in the newspaper.

327
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,412
Your local paper?

328
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,961
I just don't think that's
what Mrs. Gracey meant by historical.

329
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,381
This is supposed to be
about famous people.

330
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,050
My dad is famous.

331
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,260
He... He saved lots of lives.

332
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,429
In a mall fire.

333
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,684
He was a hero for people.

334
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:28,938
And he was my hero too.

335
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:37,197
That's not what I'm saying at all,
but it's okay.

336
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,240
I am so sorry, Mrs. Gracey.

337
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,785
I didn't mean to interrupt.

338
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:45,163
I just wanted clarity
on the rules of the assignment.

339
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,666
Well, technically, you are correct,

340
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,920
but Jane has decided to do her father.

341
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:53,002
So,

342
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,757
please, continue
with your presentation, Jane.

343
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,223
El, it wasn't that bad.

344
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,474
Friends don't lie.

345
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:06,601
I'm not lying.

346
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,227
El.

347
00:28:08,644 --> 00:28:09,645

Can you remove
your headphones, please?

369
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,929
Sorry.

370
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:32,436
A C in English and a C-minus in Spanish.

371
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:36,356
Yeah.

372
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,067
Well, that's not normal for you.

373
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,027
If you say so.

374
00:29:41,153 --> 00:29:42,572
How's your mom holding up?

375
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,490
She's fine.

376
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,536
I mean, she hates our new place,
which is, like...

377
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:51,205
Yeah, it's terrible, but...

378
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,374
she's fine.

379
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,417
Is she still drinking?

380
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,172
Like, yeah, a little, but...

381
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:02,717
Well, she's working two jobs.

382
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,635
So, it's not easy.

383
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,096
It must not be easy for you either
with your stepdad gone.

384
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,724
It's kind of better, honestly.

385
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:11,808
Better how?

386
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:14,938
He was an asshole.

387
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,605
So, there's less

388
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:18,566
assholery.

389
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:21,443
Are you sleeping better?

390
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:23,779
Yeah, fine.

391
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:25,698
No more headaches?

392
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:29,243
Nightmares?

393
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,997
Billy!

394
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,169
Nope.

395
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,298
Max?

396
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:48,805
What you've been through,
what you're still going through,

397
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:51,348
it's a lot for anyone.

398
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,059
And it's okay to not be okay.

399
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,895
But I can only help you
if you're truthful,

400
00:30:57,896 --> 00:31:00,275
if you open up to me.

401
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,568
Yeah, I... I know.

402
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,112
I'm... I'm being open.

403
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,782
I'm being open.

404
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,371
Max, hey.

405
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,207
Are you stalking me or something?

406
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,125
Oh, no, I... I just wanted to give you this.

407
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,461
- What is this?
- A ticket to the game.

408
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:24,382
I know you never want to go to my games,
but this one is kind of a big deal.

409
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:26,925
A big deal?
Lucas, you really care about this?

410
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:30,680
Yeah, I... I do. Maybe you should
find something you care about too.

411
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,017
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

412
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,518
Uh...

413
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,602
You're just...

414
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,398
It's... It's like
you're not even here anymore.

415
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,359
It's... It's like
you're a ghost or something.

416
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:47,447
A ghost?

417
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,990
Really?

418
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,284
Max,

419
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:55,538
I know something's wrong.

420
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,373
Yeah, right.

421
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,667
Something must be wrong with me
because I broke up with you.

422
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:01,752
No.

423
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,172
No, that... that's not what I meant.

424
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,298
Lucas, look,

425
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,468
people just change, okay?

426
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,010
That's it.

427
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,136
I've changed.

428
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:13,387
It's that simple.

429
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,228
Good luck.

430
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,239
Hey, are you all right?

431
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,281
Yeah... Yes, I'm...

432
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:15,741
I'm fine.

433
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,372
Okay, um...

434
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,791
You're sure?

435
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:25,920
Please, just go away.

436
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,686
Are you deaf? I said go away.

437
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,770
Chrissy?

438
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,401
Chrissy?

439
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,319
Mom?

440
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:53,780
You ready
to try on the dress again?

441
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,825
I loosened the back a little for you.

442
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,334
Chrissy! Did you hear me?

443
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,295
Open the goddamn door, Chrissy...

444
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:10,465
...or I'm gonna gut you
like the fat pig that you are.

445
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:13,259
Go away! Go away! Go away!

446
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,219
- Did you hear me?
- Go away!

447
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:18,306
Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away!

448
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,748
Can you hear me?

uh,

00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:33,565
And I know there's no way we can beat
your sadistic campaign without him.

485
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:34,817
So, me and Mike,

486
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:36,902
we were talking,

487
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:38,237
shooting the shit,

488
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,617
and we were thinking
that maybe we might...

489
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:43,992
Postpone.

490
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:47,204
- Postpone? Can't just drop this on us!
- Over my dead body.

491
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,373
Shut up!

492
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:51,791
You saying Sinclair's
been taken in by the dark side?

493
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,795
- Uh, something like that.
- Something like that?

494
00:36:53,835 --> 00:36:54,670
Jesus Christ.

495
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:58,715
And rather than find a sub for him,

496
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:01,677
you want... you want to postpone

497
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,721
"The Cult of Vecna"?

498
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,514
I... I don't want to postpone it.
We don't want to postpone it.

499
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,103
It's just that, you know, most of the subs
will be at the championship game.

500
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:13,648
- Oh, it's the championship game?
- Yeah.

501
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,023
Can I level with you?

502
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:16,817
Jeff graduates this year.

503
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,737
Gareth's got, what? A year and a half?

504
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,784
Me, I am army-crawling my way
toward a D in Ms. O'Donnell's.

505
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,494
If I don't blow her final,

506
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,206
I'm gonna walk that stage next month,

507
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,501
I'm gonna look Principal Higgins
dead in the eye,

508
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,835
I'm gonna flip him the bird,

509
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:38,172
I'm gonna snatch that diploma.

510
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:41,717
I'm gonna run like hell outta here.

511
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,052
- Didn't you say that last year?
- And the year before?

512
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:46,137
Yeah, yeah, and I was full of shit.

513
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,722
This year's different.

514
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:50,393
This year is my year.

515
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:52,519
I can feel it.

516
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:54,688
'86, baby.

517
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:57,190
You know what that means?

518
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,902
It means you boys

519
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,114
are the future of Hellfire.

520
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:06,284
I knew it the moment I saw you.

521
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,369
You sat on that table
right over there, looking like...

522
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,871
looking like two little lost sheep.

523
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:14,750
You were wearing a Weird Al T-shirt,

524
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,168
which I thought was brave.

525
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:17,878
Thank you.

526
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:21,840
Mike, you were wearing whatever shit
your mommy bought you from goddamn Gap.

527
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,346
And we showed you

528
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:30,974
that school didn't have to be
the worst years of your lives, right?

529
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:32,559
- No.
- Okay, no, no.

530
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,144
Well, I'm here to tell you

531
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:38,231
that there are other little lost sheepies
out there who need help.

532
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,900
Who need you.

533
00:38:41,443 --> 00:38:43,070
And all you guys gotta do

534
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:46,407
is get your Bo-Peeps on
and go and find one.

535
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,492
Where the hell have you been?

536
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,873
I have karate
from 1:00 to 3:00 on Fridays.

537
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,210
So let me see if I have this right.

538
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,465
You received a doll in the mail.

539
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,842
- Yes.
<i>- And it's creepy.</i>

540
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,760
Oh, yes.

541
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:08,387
And you believe it's from Russia, huh?

542
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,889
<i>- I know it is.</i>
- Hmm.

543
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:14,726
The... The stamps on the package have
that hammer with that hook thingamajig.

544
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:16,644
- Sickle.
- Whatever.

545
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:19,481
Sounds like it came from Russia.

546
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,525
Wow, I am so glad I called you.

547
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:23,860
Should I be worried?

548
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:24,945
I would be.

549
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,074
Ah!

550
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,199
Could be a threat.

551
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,996
<i>After all,
you did sabotage their U.S. operation</i>

552
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,498
and killed about two dozen comrades.

553
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:38,958
But how would they know my name?

554
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,628
If it's the KGB, Joyce,

555
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,797
and they wanna find out
who you are, they will.

556
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,467
Wait, can you undress her?

557
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,969
- What?
- The creepy doll.

558
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,931
Can you remove her dress?

559
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:53,597
I don't...

560
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,224
Okay.

561
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,396
Jesus.

562
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,688
<i>What?</i>

563
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,358
She has nipples.

564
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:05,402
<i>Yeah!</i>

565
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,244
Okay, now,
do you see anything taped to her?

566
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,038
<i>Wires or a bug or something?</i>

567
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:18,456
I don't know. It's... It's cracked.

568
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,666
Cracked?

569
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,795
Yeah, like, the porcelain's cracked
and they tried to glue it back together.

570
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:26,632
Okay, okay. Uh, do you have rope

571
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,092
<i>and something heavy?</i>

572
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:29,675
What for?

573
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,429
Smashing.

574
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:38,518
What do you think, Byers?

575
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:40,938
I call it a weeder.

576
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,565
You get it, man? Like a feeder?

577
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,483
Weeder?

578
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,693
Clever.

579
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,362
Hey, where are you going, man?

580
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,907
Look, I'm just trying
to turn that frown upside down, man.

581
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,117
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,534
Okay, come on, man.

583
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:57,454
What, are you gonna be
moping around all break or what?

584
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,123
- I'm not moping.
- You're moping.

585
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,916
- Really?
- Mopey Dick.

586
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,876
Wow, wow, that's clever.

587
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,128
Is this because your girl is ditching you?

588
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:06,755
What? Nancy's not ditching me.

589
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:08,132
Oh, so she's coming now?

590
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,175
No.

591
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,760
Ah, so she's ditching you.

592
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,721
Dude, no, she's not ditching me.

593
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,889
She has to work.

594
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,016
Who the hell works over spring break?

595
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,893
Nancy. Nancy does.

596
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:23,396
Maybe I'm missing something, but why can't
Jonathan come down here for break?

597
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,440
- Because.
- Because why?

598
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:27,400
Because a lot of reasons.

599
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,485
Curious.

600
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:33,615
Um, do you mind
if I take a crack at this, Candace?

601
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,117
Um, go ahead. All yours.

602
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,746
You said there's lots of reasons
he's not coming. Such as?

603
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:42,916
- Why are you being so nosy?
- Call it journalistic instinct.

604
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,795
Okay, well, there's no story here,
if that's what you're after.

605
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,047
His mom works,

606
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,382
so he has to watch over his brother.

607
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:52,842
On top of that,
he's not early decision like me,

608
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,597
so he's waiting on his acceptance letter,
and he wants to be there when it comes.

609
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,764
Which I totally get.

610
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:58,681
Okay.

611
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,684
Um, I don't. It just...

612
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:03,394
...doesn't make any sense, dude.

613
00:42:03,478 --> 00:42:05,356
Okay, let me sift through this mess.

614
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:07,983
Nancy is the supposed love of your life.

615
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,070
In fact, you're so smitten
that you have this grand plan

616
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:14,657
to go to some fancy-schmancy college,
AKA money pit, together?

617
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,951
And yet he's so nervous
about this acceptance letter,

618
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,454
he doesn't have time to visit
the most desired girl in Hawkins?

619
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,414
That doesn't pass the smell test.

620
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,458
In fact, it stinks to high heaven.

621
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,543
Whoo!

622
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,878
Look, you're a good boy, okay?

623
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:29,505
You've been a good boy, man.

624
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:33,300
And I think it's way past due you give
that right hand of yours a vacation

625
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,510
and get you
some well-deserved hanky-panky.

626
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:39,847
Okay, first of all, Fred, I'm going to try
to forget that you said any of that.

627
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:41,266
- It's...
- Gross, dude.

628
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:43,226
- It's natural.
- You don't understand Nancy.

629
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:47,815
He's not like you.
He's caring and compassionate and...

630
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,402
...incredibly ambitious. She's never done
a single thing halfway in her life.

631
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,572
He's so protective
over the people that he loves.

632
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,782
If she takes on
the editor of the school paper,

633
00:42:56,864 --> 00:42:59,577
she's gonna make that
the best paper that ever existed.

634
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:02,621
And he'll never back down
from what's right, what's moral.

635
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,373
No matter the pressure,
no matter the personal cost...

636
00:43:05,456 --> 00:43:08,001
- That's why I love her.
- That's why I love him.

637
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,211
- Everything between us is...
- Perfect.

638
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:12,840
Eh, I'm still rooting for my alt.

639
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,260
Nancy!

640
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,311
Nancy, hey.

641
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:29,231
Um, do you wanna join Hellfire tonight?

642
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,985
Just move your date this one time.

643
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:34,987
Come on.

644
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,364
What, to hang out with you
and Eddie "the freak" Munson?

645
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:39,240
Uh, yeah, I'll pass.

646
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,677
You're just jealous
'cause I have another older male friend.

647
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,411
Ew. Ugh. Whatever.

648
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:45,539
Besides, I mean, I really dig this girl.

649
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,873
<i>I think that she could...</i>

650
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,958
Who knows, she could be the one.

651
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,211
Oh, I got some customers.
Call you back. Bye.

652
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:54,422
No, you can't. I'm at...

653
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:55,505
...school.

654
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,599
So you fight with dice?

655
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:08,311
Yes, but these aren't your normal dice.

656
00:44:08,394 --> 00:44:11,065
They have up to 20 sides.

657
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,778
If I play,
do I get one of those cool T-shirts?

658
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,530
- Yes.
- Really?

659
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,784
Everyone gets a T-shirt.
We make 'em ourselves, and if you...

660
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:24,952
You're being sarcastic.

661
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,498
You being sarcastic?

662
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,083
<i>♪ Do you wanna... ♪</i>

663
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,835
She was being sarcastic.

664
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:34,420
Mom says the game promotes
Satanism and animal cruelty.

665
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,422
That's just bullshit media propaganda.

666
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,384
<i>60 Minutes</i> begs to differ.

667
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:42,846
- No.
- No.

668
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:43,972
No.

669
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,056
- No.
- No.

670
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,811
I hate high school.

671
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,902
So, screw it.

672
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,737
Screw what?

673
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,699
Screw high school.

674
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,702
What? What? Dustin, where are you going?

675
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,786
Just trust me!

676
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,081
Come on, just talk to me.

677
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,833
Tell me things!

678
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,418
- Wear a helmet!
- What are you talking about?

679
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Hello?

680
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,644
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

681
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,563
Sorry.

682
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,231
Didn't mean to scare you.

683
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:00,148
You okay?

684
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:16,541
There's, uh...
There's nothing to worry about. Okay?

685
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,293
No one ever comes out here.

686
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:20,168
We're safe.

687
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:23,507
I promise.

688
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:31,056
So, how does this work exactly?

689
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,724
Oh, just like any other old sale,

690
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,061
except, uh, cash only,

691
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:38,105
and, uh, for obvious reasons,

692
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,898
no receipts.

693
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:46,153
I'll do you a half ounce for, uh... 20.
What do you say?

694
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:48,614
Plenty of bang for your buck.
Should last a while.

695
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,829
Hey, uh, we don't need to do this.

696
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:56,039
Just give me the word and I'll walk away.

697
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,500
- Okay?
- It's not that. I don't want you to go.

698
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:00,793
It's just...

699
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,505
Do you ever feel like

700
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,300
you're losing your mind?

701
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,804
Um,

702
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:14,599
you know, just... on a daily basis.

703
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,518
I feel like I'm losing my mind right now

704
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,731
doing a drug deal with Chrissy Cunningham,

705
00:48:20,813 --> 00:48:23,317
the queen of Hawkins High.

706
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,197
You know,
this isn't the first time that we've, um...

707
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:32,199
hung out.

708
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,159
No?

709
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:34,411
You don't remember?

710
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,704
I'm sorry. I...

711
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:36,786
That's okay.

712
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,835
I wouldn't remember me either, Chrissy.

713
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,503
Honestly, do I have stuff in my hair?

714
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,507
You don't remember me?

715
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,925
I'm sorry.

716
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,760
Middle school, talent show.

717
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,637
You were doing this cheer thing.

718
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,641
You know, the... the thing you do.

719
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,309
It was pretty cool, actually.

720
00:48:57,391 --> 00:48:58,726
And I...

721
00:48:59,226 --> 00:49:01,103
- I was with my band.
- Corroded Coffin.

722
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,606
- Corro... You do remember.
- Oh my God! Yes, of course.

723
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,400
With a name like that, how could I forget?

724
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:06,693
I dunno. You're a freak.

725
00:49:08,402 --> 00:49:09,487
No, you just...

726
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,864
- You looked so...
- Different?

727
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,576
Yeah. Well, uh, my hair was buzzed,

728
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:17,746
and I didn't have
these sweet old tatties yet.

729
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,456
- You played guitar, right?
- Uh-huh.

730
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,875
Still do. Still do.

731
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,668
You should come see us.

732
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,213
Uh, we play at The Hideout on Tuesdays.

733
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:29,257
It's pretty cool.
We... We actually get a crowd

734
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,550
of about five drunks.

735
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:36,931
It's not exactly the Garden,
but you gotta start somewhere, right? So...

736
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:41,143
You know,
you're not what I thought you'd be like.

737
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,313
- Mean and scary?
- Yeah.

738
00:49:43,396 --> 00:49:48,485
Yeah, well, I actually kinda thought
you'd be kinda mean and scary too.

739
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,402
Me?

740
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:50,528
Terrifying.

741
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,614
Uh, so,

742
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:57,369
in other good news,
flattery works with me, so...

743
00:49:58,494 --> 00:50:01,164
Twenty-five percent discount for the half.

744
00:50:01,914 --> 00:50:05,626
Fifteen bucks.
You're robbing me blind here, you know.

745
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,757
Do you have anything

746
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,050
maybe

747
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:16,262
stronger?

748
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:23,894
Nice job, Kate.

749
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,773
Excellent work, Paul. Nice improvement.

750
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,485
Very disappointing, Jane.

751
00:50:30,985 --> 00:50:32,695
Let's talk after break.

752
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,969
- Oh!
- Oh my God.

753
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:59,139
I am so sorry.

754
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,266
I hope Mr. Fibbly's okay.

755
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,777
Whoops!

756
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:19,701
Oh my God.

757
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,251
Angela!

758
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:42,849
Holy shit!

759
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,643
What the hell was that?

760
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:54,735
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

761
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,862
Hey, what's going on here?

762
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,489
What's going on? Jane?

763
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,784
Jane.

764
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,867
Did someone do this?

765
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:05,704
I tripped.

766
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:10,501
It was just an accident.

767
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,630
All right, Angela.
You come with me.

768
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,048
- Ooh!
- What? Why?

769
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,134
Let's go.

770
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,887
I didn't do anything.
Tell her, Jane. Tell her!

771
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:29,521
Shit. El. El.

772
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,188
Shit.

773
00:52:33,023 --> 00:52:34,025
El...

774
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,318
I'm sorry.

775
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:38,822
It's gonna be okay.

776
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,324
It... It's not that bad.

777
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,327
We'll fix it together, okay?

778
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:47,581
Okay? Shit.

779
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,313
Come on, kids.

780
00:53:12,396 --> 00:53:13,396
Don't stare.

781
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,192
Oh, hi.

782
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,068
Mommy, what's she doing?

783
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,612
Was this really necessary?

784
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:23,617
If that porcelain belly
is pregnant with an explosive device,

785
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,659
you will soon be thanking me.

786
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,371
And remember, you are not
lowering this bucket. You are...

787
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,956
Releasing it. Got it.

788
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,085
We want to make sure
that we destroy that doll

789
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:36,880
with as much force as possible.

790
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,215
Yep. Got it.

791
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,007
One more thing.

792
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:44,762
Joyce. Are you there?
Talk to me! Joyce! Joyce!

793
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,306
<i>Joyce! Joyce! Joyce!</i>

794
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:49,266
<i>- Joyce!
- </i>Yeah?

795
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:51,518
What happened?

796
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,896
It broke.

797
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:55,106
Do you see a bug?

798
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,315
<i>Anything with wires?</i>

799
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:59,777
<i>Or anything that... that doesn't look like
the insides of a doll.</i>

800
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,862
<i>Anything like that?</i>

801
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,155
<i>Joyce! Joyce!</i>

802
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,199
<i>Where'd you go? Where'd you go now?</i>

803
00:54:05,282 --> 00:54:07,661
<i>Why are you not answering me again?</i>

804
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:09,746
<i>Joyce!</i>

805
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:17,170
Oh my...

806
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,932
Let's go, Tigers!

807
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,894
Let's go, Tigers!

808
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,282
Does it bother you that, like,

809
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:48,117
we might win a championship
right after you graduated?

810
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,036
Yeah, that's an interesting point.

811
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:52,831
Thank you so much
for bringing that up, Brenda.

812
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,630
Everyone now please rise
for our national anthem.

813
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:07,052
Singing for us tonight,
we have a very special guest.

814
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,514
All the way from Nashville,

815
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,726
our very own Tammy Thompson!

816
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,152
Go, Tammy!

817
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,074
We love you, Tammy!

818

Muppet.

822
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,346
Okay, she does sound like a Muppet.

823

Oh my God, totally.

824
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,349
She sounds like Kermit.

825
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:54,391
I was thinking
it was more like Miss Piggy.

826
00:55:56,518 --> 00:55:59,159
I used to think she sounded good
'cause I had this massive crush...

828

Um, we... we took
a... a massively hard class together.

829
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:07,322
We were... We were
in Mrs. Click's class together.

830
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,615
Yeah.

831
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:11,326
Uh...

832
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,786
- Sorry, were you asking me a question?
- No.

833
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:15,163

You asked for a sub. We delivered.

843
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,860
This is Hellfire Club.
Not Babysitting Club.

844
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,237
I'm 11, you long-haired freak.

845
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,905
My, my, the child speaks.

846
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,871
So, what's your name, child?

847
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,289
Erica Sinclair.

848
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,210
So this is Sinclair's infamous sister.

849
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,297
He's sharp.

850
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:51,342
What's your class and level?
Level one dwarf?

851
00:57:55,012 --> 00:57:56,931
My name is Lady Applejack.

852
00:57:57,014 --> 00:57:59,934
And I'm a chaotic good
half-elf rogue, level 14.

853
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,436
I will sneak behind
any monster you throw my way

854
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,273
and stab them in the back
with my poison-soaked kukri.

855
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:10,277
And I'll smile as I watch them die
a slow, agonizing death.

856
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,487
So, we gonna do this,

857
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:15,282
or we gonna keep chitchatting
like this is your mommy's book club?

858
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,168
Welcome to Hellfire.

859
00:58:30,797 --> 00:58:33,885
Push 'em back, defense!
Push 'em back...

860
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,818
Hey! Yo, you gotta stay on 'em.

861
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,570
Stay on 'em! Let's go! Go!

862
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,740
Looks like my headline has a shot.

863
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:01,079
The hooded cultists chant,

864
00:59:02,454 --> 00:59:05,875
"Hail Lord Vecna."

865
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,713
"Hail Lord Vecna."

866
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:12,798
They turn to you,

867
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:15,385
remove their hoods.

868
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,679
You recognize most of them from Makbar.

869
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,849
But there is one you do not recognize,

870
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,811
his skin shriveled,

871
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:27,396
desiccated.

872
00:59:27,896 --> 00:59:29,315
And something else.

873
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:33,152
He is not only missing his left arm,

874
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:34,653
but his left eye!

875
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,240
No! No!

876
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,242
- Vecna's dead.
- He was killed by Kas.

877
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:43,579
So it was thought, my friends.
So it was thought.

878
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,081
But Vecna lives.

879
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,338
Yo, what the hell was that?

880
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:55,967
What the hell was that?
That's not me, that's him.

881
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,469
<i>You are scared.
You're tired. You are injured.</i>

882
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,056
Do you flee Vecna and his cultists?

883
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:05,726
Or stand your ground and fight?

884
01:00:06,518 --> 01:00:07,603
Come on.

885
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,315
- Sinclair, you're in.
- Huh?

886
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,190
You're in. Son, let's go!

887
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,945
I say we fight.

888
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,489
To the death.

889
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,699
To the death.

890
01:00:20,782 --> 01:00:21,951
To the death.

891
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,161
To the death! To the death!

892
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,123
To the death! To the death!

893
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,333
To the death!

894
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,333
To the death!

895
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:30,418
To the death!

896
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,461
To the death!

01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,481

- Didn't we just agree "to the death"?

That wasn't literal.

915

We can't kill him with two players.

916
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:42,072
You too? He only has 15 hit points left.
Don't be pussies.

917
01:01:42,155 --> 01:01:44,867
Pussies? Really?
'Cause we're not delusional?

918
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,452
- Delusional? How about not cowards?
- Hey!

919
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:53,251
If I may interject,
gentlemen, Lady Applejack.

920
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,795
Whilst I respect the passion,

921
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,755
you'd be wise to take

What do you think?

927
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,855
How many hit points
do you and Applejack have left?

928
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:14,938
Twelve.

929
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,481
Here, on inbound,

930
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:19,193
they're gonna try and take away Jason
and double-team him.

931
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,945
That is gonna free up Patrick.

932
01:02:21,027 --> 01:02:23,197
Wait, no. You gotta let me take the shot.

933
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,740
It's risky as hell.

934
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:27,492
But you're the ones on the battlefield.

935
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,827
So it's your call.

936
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,456
- What do you say, Lady Applejack?
- You really gotta ask?

937
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:38,753
Screw it.

938
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:41,965
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

939
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,719
Winners find a way to win.
Let me find a way.

940
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,721
The chances of success are 20-to-1.

941
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,724
Never tell me the odds.

942
01:02:49,806 --> 01:02:51,934
Just get me the ball. Get me the ball.

943
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,393
Give me the D20.

944
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:13,748
That's a miss!

945
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,750

- Shit! Shit!

- Come on!

948
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,592
Please!

949
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,637
Come on!

950
01:04:34,202 --> 01:04:35,663
- Crit hit!
- Yeah!

951
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,248
What? What?

952
01:04:43,503 --> 01:04:45,255

969
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,873
- <i>It'll be 3.07.
- Yeah.</i>

970
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:03,083
<i>But this is your old friend Billy talking.</i>

971
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:06,211
<i>You know, just... just a little favor.
And I don't think...</i>

972
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,840
<i>No. I don't wanna do that stuff.</i>

973
01:06:09,923 --> 01:06:12,050
<i>Not for you, not for anybody.</i>

974
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,213
<i>I'm trying to be normal, Billy.</i>

975
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,690
I'm coming. I'm coming.

976
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:31,152
Here you go. Good boy.

977
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:45,333
This is, uh, my castle.

978
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,096
Okay. All right.

979
01:06:57,679 --> 01:06:59,389
One more. That's it though, right?

980
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,141
Good boy.

981
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,695
Sorry for the mess.

982
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:16,574
Uh, the maid took the week off.

983
01:07:17,157 --> 01:07:18,157
You, um...

984
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:20,286
You live here alone?

985
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,369
With my uncle.

986
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,039
But, uh, he works nights at the plant.

987
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,418
Bringing home the big bucks.

988
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,918
How long does it take?

989
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,003
Sorry?

990
01:07:30,795 --> 01:07:33,882
The Special K. How long to kick in?

991
01:07:33,965 --> 01:07:37,844
Oh, uh, well,
it depends if you snort it or not.

992
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:39,429
Uh, if you do,

993
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:41,264
then, uh, yeah.

994
01:07:41,347 --> 01:07:43,349
It'll, uh, kick in pretty quick.

995
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:44,976
Oh, shit.

996
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,228
- You're sure you have it?
- No, no, I got it.

997
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,190
Um, somewhere.

998
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:51,692
Uh...

999
01:07:55,278 --> 01:07:56,905
Sorry I'm late, sweetheart.

1000
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,536
You're beautiful.

1001
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:45,246
Eddie? Did you find it?

1002
01:08:46,663 --> 01:08:47,663
Eddie?

1003
01:08:54,587 --> 01:08:55,631
Eddie?

1004
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:57,882
Eddie?

1005
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,219
Mom?

1006
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:02,680
Just loosening this up for you,
sweetheart.

1007
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:06,809
- You're going to look...
- ...absolutely beautiful.

1008
01:09:25,743 --> 01:09:26,744
Chrissy!

1009
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:28,956
- No!
- Chrissy, open the door!

1010
01:09:29,038 --> 01:09:32,167
- No!
- Let go! Let go!

1011
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:33,836
Chrissy!

1012
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,470
Dad.

1013
01:09:45,722 --> 01:09:47,474
Dad! Dad?

1014
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,523
Gotcha.

1015
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:57,984
Found it.

1016
01:09:58,484 --> 01:10:01,238
Peaceful bliss, just moments away.

1017
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,533
Chrissy?

1018
01:10:08,703 --> 01:10:09,829
Chrissy.

1019
01:10:11,247 --> 01:10:12,247
Hello?

1020
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:15,586
Chrissy.

1021
01:10:17,128 --> 01:10:18,255
Hey, Chrissy, wake up.

1022
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:20,506
Hey. Hello?

1023
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:22,926
Chrissy. Hello?

1024
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,927
Hey, Chrissy.

1025
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,813
Chrissy?

1026
01:10:59,087 --> 01:11:00,296
Chrissy.

1027
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,221
No!

1028
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:11,015
Help! Help!

1029
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,810
Somebody, help me!

1030
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,936
Time to wake up. Hello? Can you hear me?

1031
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,771
Wake up, Chrissy.

1032
01:11:17,355 --> 01:11:18,731
Chrissy, wake up!

1033
01:11:18,815 --> 01:11:21,609
I don't like this, Chrissy! Wake up!

1034
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,112
Help!

1035
01:11:23,194 --> 01:11:24,529
Chrissy.

1036
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,033
No.

1037
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:00,024
Chrissy! Chrissy! Chrissy!

1038
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:02,443
Chrissy, wake up now! Chrissy!

1039
01:12:04,694 --> 01:12:07,780
Don't cry, Chrissy.

1040
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:11,327
It's time

1041
01:12:12,243 --> 01:12:13,996
for your suffering...

1042
01:12:16,289 --> 01:12:17,916
to end.

1043
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:25,422
Chrissy!

1044
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:29,926
What...

1045
01:12:38,186 --> 01:12:39,645
Jesus Christ!
