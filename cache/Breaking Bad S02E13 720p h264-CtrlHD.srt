1
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,685
Come on.

2
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:56,939
Come on.

3
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,191
Come....

4
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:02,235
Come on. Come on, baby.

5
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:07,908
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

6
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:38,438
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

7
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,261
Yeah.

8
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:15,475
Slow down. Slow-- Slow down.

9
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:18,729
And just-- Just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:20,564
Do it.

11
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:22,816
All right.

12
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,569
Now, what happened?

13
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:42,169
All right. All right. Now...

14
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:47,507
...listen-- Listen to me.
Are you listening?

15
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:51,219
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:53,472
No, no-- Listen. Calm down.

17
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,182
Just....

18
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:59,603
Sit tight. I know who to call.

19
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,131
Saul Goodman sent me.

20
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:40,519
Come on. Inside.

21
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:49,736
Watch the door.

22
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:54,574
Where is she?

23
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,500
Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:35,467
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

25
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,513
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,600
Here's your story.

27
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:47,354
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,439
Say it.

29
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:55,028
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:01,034
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,120
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:04,663
Again.

33
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,499
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,293
Again. Again.

35
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,462
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:16,049
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:23,348
Once you call,
the people who show up...

38
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:26,143
...will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,729
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,231
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

41
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,525
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:36,236
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:38,697
There's nothing to incriminate you...

44
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:41,241
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:46,872
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,207
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,627
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:55,255
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:59,384
I was not here.

50
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:11,229
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

51
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:13,357
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

52
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:20,697
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

53
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,505
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

54
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:05,242
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,329
-Two.
-Two. All right.

56
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:13,709
Thank you.

57
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:19,172
Junior.

58
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:26,388
Junior.

59
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:29,391
-Flynn.
-What?

60
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,019
Flynn.

61
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:35,981
Flynn.

62
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,692
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,532
You all right?

64
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,915
Flynn, get your butt in here.

65
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,961
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,172
Seriously.

67
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:07,554
-What?
-Look right there. Look at that.

68
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,183
Are those donations?

69
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:13,060
-Yes.
-Actual donations for your dad?

70
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:20,859
Total strangers gave us $490.

71
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:25,906
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

72
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:29,576
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

73
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:33,163
And it's all real, actual money.

74
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:37,501
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

75
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,588
And look what they're saying.

76
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:46,093
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

77
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:49,221
Isn't this awesome?

78
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:55,727
That's-- Wow, that is something.

79
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:00,399
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

80
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:04,695
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:08,115
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

82
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:14,663
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

83
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:19,876
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

84
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:31,513
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you.:</i>

85
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:32,723
<i>"Do-not-call list."</i>

86
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:35,726
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

87
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,562
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

88
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,814
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

89
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:46,612
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

90
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:33,951
Sir, you may not wanna
be here for this.

91
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,849
I just woke up and I found her.

92
00:13:58,058 --> 00:13:59,893
That's all I know.

93
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:02,396
What's her date of birth?

94
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,239
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

95
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:14,658
April....

96
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:18,745
-April 4th, 1982.
-Okay.

97
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:23,625
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

98
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:27,170
-My mother?
-Your daughter's mother.

99
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,007
Bishop.

100
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:35,012
-And place of birth?
-Phoenix.

101
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:37,973
Phoenix, Arizona?

102
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:43,895
This is our address.

103
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:46,356
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

104
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:47,983
I can drive.

105
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,152
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

106
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,779
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

107
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,282
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

108
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,825
Okay?

109
00:14:57,034 --> 00:15:00,579
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

110
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:28,148
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

111
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:30,359
-Forty from Te--
-Terre Haute.

112
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,568
Walt.

113
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,080
<i>It's me.</i>

114
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,415
<i>Are you there? Hello.</i>

115
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,878
I'm just checking in.

116
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:54,424
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

117
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,969
That's-- That's good.

118
00:15:57,177 --> 00:16:01,348
So listen. Just call me, all right?

119
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:06,520
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

120
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:12,442
All right. I'm coming.

121
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,863
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

122
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:20,033
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

123
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:24,496
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

124
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:26,790
Biggest donation...

125
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,835
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

126
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:32,546
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

127
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:34,590
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

128
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:37,926
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

129
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:39,177
...here's what we know.

130
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:41,763
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

131
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:44,558
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

132
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:46,393
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:50,564
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:53,400
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:56,153
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

136
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,947
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:03,118
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

138
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:05,162
So why am I talking about him?

139
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:08,790
Anyone? Anyone?

140
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,000
Bueller?

141
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,419
-He was dealing Blue Sky.
-That's right.

142
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:15,422
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

143
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:20,260
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

144
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:21,929
But wait. It gets better.

145
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:25,265
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

146
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:27,517
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

147
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:30,646
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,234
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

149
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,529
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

150
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:42,157
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

151
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:48,080
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

152
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:50,290
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

153
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,126
-He copped to it, didn't he?
-For an extra pudding cup...

154
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,670
...every night at Los Lunas?

155
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,964
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

156
00:17:57,172 --> 00:18:00,425
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

157
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:01,927
I've been thinking.

158
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:06,640
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

159
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,767
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

160
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:11,645
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

161
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:15,232
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

162
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,610
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

163
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:21,363
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

164
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:24,574
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

165
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:28,912
In fact, everywhere but here.

166
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:34,042
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

167
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,587
Now...

168
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,007
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

169
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:43,176
I say he's gone regional.

170
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:45,596
Only he's still right here in town.

171
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:49,516
Come on, 2800.

172
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:53,020
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

173
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:55,856
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

174
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:59,693
Fo-- Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

175
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,361
-Yes!
-Yes!

176
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,158
Who's gonna be next?

177
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:08,160
Your guy found him?

178
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,412
Where is he?

179
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:11,622
Okay, listen.

180
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,332
No, no, I don't care.

181
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,167
You have your guy pick--

182
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,377
Saul. Just shut-- Saul.

183
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:20,881
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

184
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:25,677
I don't recommend it.

185
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,014
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

186
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:31,892
..keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

187
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:33,977
Are they here now?

188
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:38,065
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

189
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,360
Police could be the least of it.

190
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:43,528
You could just get mugged or shot.

191
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:48,909
How about you go on home, Walter?

192
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:51,119
Let me handle this.

193
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,359
Yo.

194
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:23,295
Jesse.

195
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,384
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

196
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:32,512
-Wake up. Wake up.
-Hey.

197
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:36,391
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

198
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,602
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just--

199
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,064
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

200
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,398
Jesse.

201
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:46,276
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:50,113
No, no, no.

203
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:52,324
-I'm good.
-Come on. Help me out now.

204
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:55,869
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

205
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:59,247
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

206
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,625
You are not good at all. You hear?

207
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:05,504
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

208
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:07,089
You're gonna stand up...

209
00:22:07,297 --> 00:22:09,758
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

210
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:12,010
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

211
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:15,472
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

212
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,419
I killed her.

213
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:48,672
-What?
-I killed her. It was me.

214
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,507
-I killed her, man. I killed her.
-No.

215
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:53,844
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

216
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:55,470
You didn't kill anybody.

217
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:59,141
I loved her.

218
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,480
I loved her more than anything.

219
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:19,620
No, no. No.

220
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:10,754
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

221
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:13,173
I guess they should be....

222
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:17,928
I don't know.
Just use your best judgement.

223
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:21,556
There's no yellow dress here.

224
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:25,394
It's all-- It's all black and grey.

225
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:30,065
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

226
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:33,902
What about blue?

227
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:37,406
Blue's better than black, right?

228
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:41,243
No, no. Not dark blue. More like....

229
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:45,455
Not super-bright, either.

230
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:47,332
I mean, blue is blue.

231
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:51,128
No. No cleavage.

232
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,423
Long sleeves.

233
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:58,885
Yeah. It's nice.

234
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:02,139
It's nice.

235
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:09,646
Big yawn, Holly.

236
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:12,858
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

237
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:17,946
-Okay, sweetie.
-Yes.

238
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:21,867
Yes!

239
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:24,536
Here we go.

240
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:28,373
Here we go. Yes.

241
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:37,799
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

242
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:40,677
Junior. Hey.

243
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,598
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

244
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:49,436
-Dad, it's money.
-Just please do it.

245
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:52,147
Okay, the noise
is disturbing the baby.

246
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:56,944
Marie, slow down. I can't--

247
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:02,115
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

248
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:05,827
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

249
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:09,831
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna-- Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

250
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,416
Okay.

251
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:14,753
-Guess what.
-What?

252
00:26:14,962 --> 00:26:17,464
-You are gonna be in the newspaper.
-No way.

253
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:19,675
<i>One of Marie's patients
works at the Journal.</i>

254
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:22,177
She told him about the website
and the donations...

255
00:26:22,386 --> 00:26:24,721
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

256
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,931
-For real?
-Yep.

257
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:29,142
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

258
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:30,936
Awesome.

259
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:35,732
-It'll mean more hits.
-And more contributions.

260
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,447
East of Scottsdale?

261
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:45,075
Let me guess. Not talking.

262
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:47,744
Nope. Not a one.

263
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:50,872
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

264
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,627
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

265
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:57,588
Yeah. You too.

266
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:03,260
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

267
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,637
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

268
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,476
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

269
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:15,772
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

270
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,733
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

271
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:20,027
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

272
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:22,070
-Hey, it's a pleasure.
-Good to meet you.

273
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,782
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

274
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:28,076
-Please, just Gus.
-Hi, Gus.

275
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:30,078
You guys make some killer chicken.

276
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:31,872
Thank you very much.

277
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,583
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

278
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,627
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

279
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:39,421
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

280
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,715
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

281
00:27:41,924 --> 00:27:43,425
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

282
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:46,261
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

283
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,222
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

284
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:53,226
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

285
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:56,438
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

286
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,982
-Terrible.
-Yeah. It is indeed.

287
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,776
We've had
some successes locally...

288
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:03,070
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

289
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,865
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

290
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:09,242
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

291
00:28:09,451 --> 00:28:10,661
Anything we can do.

292
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,287
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Hank.

293
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:13,622
-Gentlemen.
-Thanks.

294
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,499
Sure. Thank you.

295
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,168
Is this one of your agents?

296
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:22,339
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

297
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,508
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to--

298
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:28,136
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

299
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:32,975
-Lung cancer.
-Oh, that's a rough one.

300
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:38,939
-Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
-Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

301
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,734
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

302
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:05,048
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

303
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:08,844
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

304
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,849
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

305
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:18,854
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

306
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:22,274
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

307
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,914
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

308
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:42,336
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

309
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:45,380
I deserve this.

310
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,841
What?

311
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,721
What you said in the desert.

312
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,642
I get it, what you meant.

313
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:03,231
I deserve whatever happens.

314
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:25,629
Oh, shit.

315
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:42,813
There he is!

316
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:46,692
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

317
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,278
We called you about 50 times.

318
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:52,864
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

319
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:56,493
<i>I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...</i>

320
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:00,247
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

321
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:02,916
-This is him?
-Yes.

322
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,501
This is Dad. Great.

323
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,963
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

324
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:10,090
...Mom and Dad on either side.

325
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,717
Mom and Dad?

326
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,555
How much money
have you raised so far?

327
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:20,809
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

328
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:23,061
But there's more coming in
all the time.

329
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,106
-Wow, that's amazing.
-We don't even know what to say.

330
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:29,776
It's just-- It's been incredible.

331
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:32,195
Judging from things you have
written about him...

332
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:38,118
-...your dad must be quite a guy.
-Yeah. He is. He's the best.

333
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:40,787
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

334
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:45,167
None of us do. We love him.

335
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:50,130
-He's a good man, isn't he?
-Absolutely. Ask anyone.

336
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:54,217
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

337
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:57,012
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

338
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:01,516
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

339
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:06,188
He's just decent.

340
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:09,858
And he always does the right thing.

341
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:13,528
And that's how he teaches me to be.

342
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:18,533
-Would you say he's your hero?
-Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

343
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:21,370
My dad is my hero.

344
00:32:29,795 --> 00:32:31,421
Does that put him to sleep?

345
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:34,091
This one just relaxes him a little.

346
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,052
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

347
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:38,887
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:44,059
Well....

349
00:32:45,852 --> 00:32:49,189
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

350
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,295
Relaxed yet?

351
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,630
As a matter of fact....

352
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:22,389
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

353
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:25,851
Yeah, it looks like it.

354
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,772
We'll be here when you wake up.

355
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:34,401
Well, I'll be looking for you.

356
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,279
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

357
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:39,197
Yeah, you better.

358
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:43,744
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

359
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,289
Where's your phone?

360
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:49,708
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

361
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,627
Which one?

362
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:00,344
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

363
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,306
Okay.

364
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,010
Well, first things first.

365
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,554
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

366
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:28,724
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but....

367
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:31,143
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

368
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:32,352
-Seven, right?
-Yeah.

369
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:37,065
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

370
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:39,109
...here somewhere.

371
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:42,946
-She's beautiful.
-Thanks.

372
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:45,866
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

373
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:50,871
-How's your pain level, Walter?
-It's....

374
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,081
Very low, basically.

375
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,167
Shortness of breath?

376
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,128
-A bit, but much better.
-Good.

377
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:01,048
Well, your margins look good.

378
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:02,758
I can't foresee the future...

379
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:04,760
...but even
conservatively speaking...

380
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:07,596
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

381
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:11,183
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

382
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:13,185
That's great.

383
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:16,980
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

384
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:21,777
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

385
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:24,321
-He can ease into it now.
-Okay.

386
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:29,952
-And can he go back to work or...?
-I'd give it a few more weeks.

387
00:36:30,494 --> 00:36:34,331
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

388
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,125
But he can be on his own?

389
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:40,587
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

390
00:36:41,046 --> 00:36:43,590
Yes. Use your best judgement.

391
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:45,717
Well....

392
00:36:45,926 --> 00:36:48,512
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

393
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,014
One less baby in the house.

394
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,569
-Don, hey.
-Hey, Stew.

395
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:07,239
Hey, welcome back.

396
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:09,408
Thanks. It's good to be back.

397
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:15,998
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

398
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,959
Yes. Thanks.

399
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:21,378
Terrible thing. Just....

400
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:25,299
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and....

401
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:28,176
-You been doing okay?
-I'm doing okay.

402
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:32,097
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

403
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:35,851
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

404
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:40,355
-Focus on work.
-Sure. Absolutely.

405
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:42,316
Yeah.

406
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:45,319
Well, see you inside.

407
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:50,324
Continue to descend through 1500.

408
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:53,535
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

409
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:57,497
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

410
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:01,460
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

411
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:06,548
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

412
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:10,260
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

413
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:15,098
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

414
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:17,893
I think I may just keep this.

415
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:19,186
Sky?

416
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:22,356
What do you think?

417
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:26,234
Doesn't look so bad, right?

418
00:38:28,528 --> 00:38:29,738
What are you doing?

419
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:32,491
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

420
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,578
-Since when?
-I'm taking the baby with me.

421
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:38,705
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

422
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:42,334
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

423
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,504
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

424
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:47,714
Why would I do that?

425
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:51,093
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

426
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:53,762
-Skyler.
-I want you gone by Monday morning.

427
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:55,389
I want--

428
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:57,015
I want you gone.

429
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:10,737
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

430
00:39:11,738 --> 00:39:14,074
Because you're a liar, Walt.

431
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:17,911
Two cell phones, after all.

432
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,372
What?

433
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:23,542
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

434
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,629
...and you said, "Which one?"

435
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,090
When?

436
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:32,843
Skyler, I was medicated.

437
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:35,220
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

438
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:36,430
You know what I think?

439
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:41,518
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

440
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:44,605
Honey, we have been over this.

441
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,773
Asked and answered, right?

442
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:49,901
Then it got me thinking again...

443
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:53,697
...about all the strange behaviour.

444
00:39:53,905 --> 00:39:56,366
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

445
00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:59,036
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

446
00:39:59,244 --> 00:40:01,163
...checking the morgue.

447
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:04,166
Your fugue state?

448
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,338
I had to believe that, didn't I?

449
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,299
I had to find a way.

450
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:18,180
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

451
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:20,182
You tell me, Skyler.

452
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,477
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

453
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:26,855
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

454
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:29,274
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

455
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:32,152
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

456
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:34,738
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

457
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,284
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

458
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:43,038
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

459
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:45,040
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

460
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:48,293
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

461
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:54,383
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

462
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:56,510
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

463
00:40:57,469 --> 00:40:58,887
So I finally left a message:

464
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:02,933
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

465
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,560
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

466
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:09,356
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

467
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:13,235
The money for your treatment...

468
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:18,448
...Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

469
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:21,868
They paid for nothing.

470
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:24,496
You refused every offer
they made you.

471
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:25,998
But that didn't make sense...

472
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:28,667
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

473
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:32,170
...and not including your surgery...

474
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:34,381
...we're nearly paid up.

475
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:37,426
Over $100,000.

476
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:43,265
Out of where? Out of thin air?

477
00:41:51,732 --> 00:41:53,483
But then...

478
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,154
...I called your mother.

479
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,782
Yeah.

480
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:03,660
Thanks for that too.

481
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:06,663
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

482
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:10,959
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

483
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:14,212
It's possible.

484
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:20,844
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

485
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:26,099
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

486
00:42:29,353 --> 00:42:31,647
You never went to see her.

487
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:35,400
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

488
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:37,027
You were gone for four days...

489
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:41,031
...and yet she swears...

490
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:43,867
...that you were never there.

491
00:42:48,622 --> 00:42:52,960
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

492
00:42:54,878 --> 00:42:55,879
Skyler.

493
00:42:56,964 --> 00:42:58,757
Could you...

494
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:01,677
...just once...

495
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:08,267
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

496
00:43:17,442 --> 00:43:19,027
Skyler.

497
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:22,364
Skyler, don't do this, please.

498
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:24,825
I....

499
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:27,953
Skyler, please don't go.

500
00:43:36,795 --> 00:43:41,508
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

501
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:46,430
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

502
00:43:47,764 --> 00:43:49,600
Whatever it is...

503
00:43:50,726 --> 00:43:52,686
...I'm afraid to know.
