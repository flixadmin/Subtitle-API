167
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,875
[sighs]

168
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,416
[wind whooshing]

169
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,875
[Elrond] <i>We ask for something sacred</i>
<i>from this mountain.</i>

170
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,166
And so we offer
something sacred in return.

171
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,208
In exchange for access
to your <i>mithril</i> mines,

172
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,750
the Elves are prepared
to furnish this city

173
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,291
with game, grain,

174
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:47,333
and timber from the elder forests
of Eriador for the next five centuries.

175
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,083
[in Khuzdul] Five centuries?

176
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,708
Quite a promise, if they can keep it...

177
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,625
[in English] I never made a promise
I didn't.

178
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,500
I see you've learned
a few words of stone-tongue.

179
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,791
Impressive.

180
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,958
Tell me, why should we trust any Elf?

181
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,041
You should not.

182
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,750
But you can trust me.

183
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,333
For I am no common Elf,
but Elrond Half-elven.

184
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:23,458
And I see in Elves
that which they cannot see in themselves.

185
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,708
That is why I stand
before you now, alone...

186
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,750
Pleading.

187
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,791
For you to save my people.

188
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,750
Please, noble King. Help us.

189
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,750
I will speak to my son now.

190
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,375
[door creaks open]

191
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,750
[door closes]

192
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
What is to be your answer, Father?

193
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:32,666
It is said that
when Aulë created our people,

194
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,875
he crafted us of two elements.

195
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,500
Fire and rock.

196
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,041
The rock that lives within us
hungers for the eternal,

197
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,125
resisting the pull of time.

198
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:51,125
But the fire embraces truth.

199
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,916
That all things must one day
be consumed...

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,958
[sighs]

201
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,000
- ...and fade away to ash...
- Father...

202
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,416
We do not dig in earth
that cannot support it.

203
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,291
- [sighing]
- Delving into depths beyond the darkness.

204
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:09,166
Tempting shadow, rock, and mine
to bury us all beneath the mountain.

205
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,333
I will not risk Dwarven lives

206
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,541
to help the Elves cheat death.

207
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,208
[exclaims] Cheat death?

208
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,833
Father!

209
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,458
My friend is drowning,

210
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,583
reaching for me to pull him to shore.

211
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,833
You expect me to swat his hand away

212
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,166
because you're afraid
of a bloody rock fall?

213
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,708
The fate of the Elves
was decided many Ages ago.

214
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,166
By minds much wiser,

215
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,375
much farther-seeing than our own.

216
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,833
[sighs]

217
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:51,916
Defy their will,
and this entire kingdom might fall.

218
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,875
Perhaps the entire Middle-earth.

219
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,541
[sighs]

220
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,166
I am sorry, my son.

221
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,541
But their time has come.

222
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,750
- Lice-bearded, uncaring, old fool!
- [clanking]

223
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,041
What if he's right?

224
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,791
You're not thinking
of lettin' this happen!

225
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,041
[Prince Durin sighs]
What choice do we have?

226
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:32,166
You said the other Dwarf-lords
were open to the proposal.

227
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,833
If we reopen the mine ourselves,

228
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,791
prove to them there's a safe way
to gather <i>mithril,</i>

229
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,541
perhaps they'd make him listen.

230
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,625
Perhaps we could force your father's hand.

231
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,833
[sighs] He's more
than just my father, Disa.

232
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,333
He's our king.

233
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,708
What kind of father would I be

234
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,125
if I teach our children the will of a king

235
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,166
should be counted as dross
to be cast to the wind?

236
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,333
[Disa sighs]

237
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,708
- All right, fine.
- [hissing]

238
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,833
I shouldn't have said
he had lice in his beard.

239
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,208
[chuckles]

240
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,458
- Or called him a fool.
- Yeah.

241
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,625
No.

242
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,041
[sighs] No, I detest it
when you heap slag on my mother.

243
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,666
Uh, well, in your mother's case,
she actually does have lice in her...

244
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm joking. I'm joking.

245
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,500
[door opens]

246
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,250
[sighing]

247
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,000
[Prince Durin] Don't suppose I can
elbow you into staying for dinner?

248
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,125
Gil-galad must be informed.

249
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:17,583
And soon, he will no longer be a king,
for there will no longer be a Lindon.

250
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,833
So this is goodbye, then?

251
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,625
We do not say goodbye.

252
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,916
- We say <i>namá...</i>
<i>- Namárië.</i>

253
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,625
It means more than simply "farewell."

254
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,166
[breath trembling]

255
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,208
It means... "Go towards goodness."

256
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,666
[sniffling]

257
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,291
[crying]

00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,375
[door closes]

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,166
[sighs]

260
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,166
[sighs]

261
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,250
[clinking]

[shouts] Elrond!

[thunder breaking]

266

[Orcs grunting, growling]

267
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,791
[Theo] Why'd they do this?

268
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,958
[Galadriel] To make this their home.

269
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,708
Their Shadow Land.

270
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,833
So we take it back, and drive them off.

271
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,250
[Galadriel] We have neither position,
nor reinforcement.

272
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,500
These lands are dead.

273
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,625
We must rally to the living.

274
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,583
Or put steel down their throats!

275
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,833
[Theo grunts]

276
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,041
It is over.

277
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,833
Not for me. I won't allow it!

278
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,166
We must!

279
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,166
[both panting]

280
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,916
We must.

281
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,958
What are you so bothered about?
It isn't your fault.

282
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,291
Yes, it is.

283
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,208
[man] Keep moving. That's it.

284
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,833
[people coughing]

285
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,791
Help those people at the back there.

286
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,291
Isildur?

287
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,208
[horse grunts]

288
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,083
- [man] The Queen!
- [woman] She's alive.

289
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,083
- [man 2] Is she hurt?
- [woman 2] Save us!

290
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,125
- [man] Is she hurt?
- [woman] Is she all right?

291
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,291
[woman 3] Thank goodness!

292
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,958
My Queen.

293
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,333
Take my horse.

294
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,875
[sighing]

295
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,333
[voice breaking] Captain, you...

296
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,416
- Captain...
- Where is he?

297
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,500
Where is my son?

298
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,458
They're dead, aren't they?

299
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:12,333
Arondir. My friends. My...

300
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,541
[voice breaking] My mother. Everyone.

301
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:22,791
What cannot be known hollows the mind.
Fill it not with guesswork.

302
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,875
[Theo] Where are we even going?

303
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,333
[Galadriel] Númenor set their camp
upon that ridge line,

304
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,833
beyond that far peak.

305
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,375
That is where they shall hie to,
along with any survivors.

306
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,000
[wind whooshing]

307
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,541
Your mother included.

308
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,916
And be wary.
The Orcs will move in daylight now.

309
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,833
[Theo] I've killed Orcs before, you know.

310
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:56,333
[Galadriel] When I was your age,
there was no such thing as Orcs.

311
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,541
[Theo] And now? How many have you killed?

312
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,708
- [Galadriel] Many.
- Good.

313
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I would not use such words.

314
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,583
Why not?

315
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,583
It darkens the heart,
to call dark deeds "good."

316
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,666
It gives place for evil
to thrive inside us.

317
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,458
Every war is fought
both without and within.

318
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,000
Of that, every soldier must be mindful.

319
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:26,291
Even I. Even you.

320
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,208
[Theo] Am I a soldier, then?

321
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,208
Perhaps we can make one of you yet.

322
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,916
[horse snorts]

323
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,666
How much further
until we reach the encampment?

324
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,583
It's just beyond this rise.

325
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,333
How much further
until we're clear of this smoke?

326
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:47,791
[man] Hold here.

327
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,750
How long have we been clear of it?

328
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,583
Nearly a mile.

329
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,125
[sighs]

330
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,458
[Queen Míriel] I see.

331
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,333
Do you?

332
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,458
Only gray.

333
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,833
Keep walking, both of you.

334
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:40,083
Guide my horse. No one need notice.
[breath trembling]

335
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,875
Elendil?

336
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,291
Elendil, please.

337
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,541
Keep walking.

338
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,250
[indistinct chatter]

339
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,208
They call it Greenwood the Great.

340
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,791
Keep your head down
and your eye on that line of cliffs.

341
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,958
You'll find the big folk settlements
on the far side.

342
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:30,708
With any luck, the people there
can help you find your stars.

343
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,125
[breathing heavily]

344
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,458
'Cause all I can tell you is,

345
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,250
Harfoot-folk haven't seen 'em

346
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,291
since the days our ancestors
lived in parts unknown

347
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,416
over a thousand years ago.

348
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,208
And that's a long time to wander.
Even for a fellow with big legs.

349
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,333
[breathing heavily]

350
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,750
[sniffling]

351
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,416
[sighing]

352
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,708
[sniffling]

353
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,833
[Nori] <i>Should've just stayed on-trail.</i>

354
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,541
When I saw that star falling,
I should've just let it alone.

355
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,500
- Elanor...
- You tried to tell me, Mother.

356
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,833
But now I understand.

357
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,708
I'm just a Harfoot.

358
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,833
That's all I'll ever be.

359
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:36,791
[scrapes]

360
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,208
Off to bed, Nori.

361
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,916
We can tend to the rest in the mornin'.

362
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,416
[Theo] Have you ever lost someone close?

363
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,291
To them?

364
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,541
Kin, I mean.

365
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,083
My brother. Finrod.

366
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,750
And my husband.

367
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,666
Husband?

368
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:44,041
Celeborn was his name.

369
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,875
We met in a glade of flowers.

370
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,750
I was dancing and he saw me there.

371
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,791
You were dancing?

372
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,458
The war seemed so very far away then.

373
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,291
When he went to it, I chided him.

374
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,125
His armor didn't fit properly.

375
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,458
I called him a silver clam.

376
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,875
I never saw him again after that.

377
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,458
[inhales] My lady.

378
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:33,625
[panting]

379
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,166
What you said before...

380
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,875
You're wrong.

381
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,625
It isn't your fault.

382
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,083
It's mine.

383
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,500
You did not intend for this to happen.

384
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,583
I gave power to the enemy.
So that makes me responsible.

385
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,458
Some say that is the way of things.

386
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,666
But I believe the wise
also look upon what is in our hearts.

387
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,291
And this was not in yours.

388
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:08,541
Do not take the burden of this day
upon your shoulders, Theo.

389
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,541
You may find it difficult
to put it down again.

390
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,083
But how am I to let it go?

391
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:25,166
[breathes deeply]

392
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:34,208
There are powers beyond darkness
at work in this world.

393
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,291
Perhaps on days such as this,

394
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,375
we've little choice
but to trust to their designs.

395
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,166
And surrender our own.

396
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,333
My home is gone.

397
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,208
Where's the design in that?

398
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,541
[softly] I cannot yet see it.

399
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,583
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Orcs grunting]

400
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:12,041
[Orcs grunting]

401
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,750
[Orcs grunting]

402
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,541
- Stop.
- [Orcs chattering]

403
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,666
Shut it.

404
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:27,583
- [footsteps approaching]
- [panting]

405
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:38,250
[breathing raspily]

406
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,625
[breathing raspily]

407
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,500
[sniffing]

408
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:17,041
[Orc] What is it? What do you smell?

409
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,708
Huh?

410
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,041
[growls]

411
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,916
[sniffing]

412
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:27,958
[Orc 2] Ashes.

413
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,875
Nothin' but ashes.

414
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,458
Come on. We're wasting time.

415
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,458
- [sheathes]
- [sighing]

416
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,416
[Galadriel] Rest while you can.

417
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,208
We move at first light.

418
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,791
What light?

419
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,791
[wind whooshing]

420
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:07,833
- [Prince Durin grunting]
- [clanking]

421
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,583
- [Prince Durin grunting]
- [clanking]

422
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,416
[clattering]

423
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,375
[loud rumbling]

424
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,041
[Prince Durin panting]

425
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,458
Another tremor.

426
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,541
[Elrond] We need to give the rocks
time to resettle.

427
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:34,666
- [clangs]
- [panting]

428
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,916
No. [panting]

429
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,541
Self-discipline, master Elf.

430
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:50,041
Think that'll bring you success?

431
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,541
[chuckles]

432
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,125
It did in our contest.

433
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,083
Did it?

434
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,750
[breathing heavily]

435
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,083
[Prince Durin] No.

436
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,583
You lost on purpose?

437
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,541
My aim was never to defeat you,

438
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,666
but to gain your ear a while longer.

439
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,125
Elf lies.

440
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,250
[chuckles]

441
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,541
I was...

442
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:27,958
Winded.

443
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,750
[groans]

444
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:38,958
Blast it.

445
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:47,166
I always thought you were
a mite Dwarvish for an Elf.

446
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,500
And you are a rather Elvish Dwarf, Durin.

447
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,458
- Son of Durin.
- [exhales]

448
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,375
- Grandson of...
- Scoff if you like.

449
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:03,958
The mightiest thing a Dwarf can do
is to be worthy of the name of his father.

450
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,083
[Prince Durin chuckles]

451
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,208
We do have our secret names,

452
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,875
for use only amongst ourselves.

453
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,291
And we reveal them only to family.

454
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:25,333
Wives, parents, sisters, brothers.

455
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,583
- [softly] Elrond...
- Save it, Durin.

456
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,208
For the far side.

457
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:43,750
Aye.

458
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,041
- [clanking]
- [rocks clattering]

459
00:37:56,208 --> 00:38:00,208
[loud rumbling]

[wind whooshing]

464
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,500
Durin...

465
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,166
[Prince Durin breathing heavily] Father...

466
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,166
It's more than we ever imagined.

467
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,666
- King Durin, there is a...
- [shouts] Enough!

468
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:27,083
Father, just look at it.

469
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,416
Seize the Elf.

470
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,958
[gate whirring]

471
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,708
[Dwarf grunting]

472
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:39,833
[Dwarf shouts]

00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,708
[gate slams]

474
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:47,333
[gate whirring]

[sighing]

476
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,333
[sighs]

477
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,625
[King Durin] When your mother bore you,

478
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,166
something inside you was ill-formed.

479
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,666
Your breathing was ragged and dry.

480
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:43,500
A tiny, pitiful sound,
like scraping chalk stones.

481
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,750
Folk said you'd never see
your first winter.

482
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,333
And every night,

483
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:58,708
after your mother's weeping eyes
had found refuge in sleep,

484
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,375
I held you to the firelight,

485
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,625
kept your chin up all night long.

486
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,833
Seemed to ease the burden a little.

487
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,416
And one night,

488
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,750
I gazed down on your tiny, naked face,

489
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,583
and I saw upon it

490
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:28,875
the great gray beard
of an old Dwarven-king.

491
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:34,458
Mighty and terrible
as an army with banners.

492
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:41,500
And when your mother woke, I told her,

493
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,333
she need cry no more.

494
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:52,416
Our son would live
and he would move mountains!

495
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,791
[Prince Durin sighs]

496
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:02,083
How do you expect me
to move mountains, Father,

497
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:05,500
if you fall to pieces
when I dig a single hole?

498
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,500
You speak of greatness for me,

499
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,208
but you suffocate in me any ambition,

500
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:15,250
any desire,

501
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:20,458
any thought
that does not originate in you.

502
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,833
The iron that must bear
the most heavy of burdens

503
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,250
must also endure
the most rigorous tempering!

504
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,958
Consigning your allies to death
is not tempering.

505
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,958
Elrond is as much a brother to me

506
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:40,583
as if he'd been fired
in my own mother's womb.

00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,875
How dare you...

508
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,500
[yells] How dare you!

509
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,708
Invoke your mother's memory

510
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:58,416
to defend your decision
to betray your own kind?

511
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,375
No! It's you that's betrayed our kind!

512
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:05,291
Squandering our future
so you can cling to the past!

513
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,958
You profane the crown you wear!

No, the vittles. Stop eatin'!
We have to save those.

Why don't you take a look outside,

I don't understand. How?

How do you think?

539
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,125
He fixed it.

[Largo] Can you believe it, Nori?

541
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,208
There's enough bounty here
to feast tonight

542
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:11,208
and still have enough left over
to last to Frozen Fish.

Thank you, Malva.
Where's your sister gone?

Not much for diggin' jewels.

No matter how the path winds,
or how steep it gets,

we face it,

To help my friend.

[Poppy] She won't be alone.

658
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,833
We've left enough folk behind,
we're not leavin' him.

659
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,416
[Marigold]
You girls aren't goin' anywhere.

660
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,625
Not without me.

661
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,833
You sure about this, Goldie?

662
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:49,750
You go into those woods,
you might never come out alive.

663
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:53,541
They might if a trail-finder
were to go with them.

664
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:59,375
Brandy foot girl was right to help him.
Was right all along.

665
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:02,958
And if you think Malva Meadow grass
is too proud to admit it,

666
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:07,041
well, what's the good of livin', Sadoc,
if we aren't livin' good?

667
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:14,125
You know, Malva, just once...

668
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:18,458
Once, it would be grand
if you weren't right all the time.

669
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:22,375
I'll fetch provisions and get me stick.

670
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,458
I'm comin' with ya.

671
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,041
[Harfoots chattering]

672
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:30,500
It doesn't matter anyway,
we're all gonna die.

673
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,666
Come on, otherwise we'll be here all day.

674
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,666
[Nori] Think we'll be able to find him?

675
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,791
[Sadoc] He's a bloody giant.
How could we miss him?

676
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,333
[birds chirping]

677
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,708
[people chattering]

678
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:05,541
[Arondir] You believe
she'll keep her promise?

679
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,541
[Galadriel] No.

680
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm certain of it.

681
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:16,208
Bones have been set, [sighs]
wounds bound. We can travel.

682
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:18,708
Where will you go?

683
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:22,083
[Bronwyn] An old Númenórean colony
by the mouth of the Anduin.

684
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:27,541
<i>Pelargir,</i> they called it.
They say there's fresh land, fresh water.

685
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,875
A fresh start.

686
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,708
[Galadriel] Then I will report
to our High King.

687
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
To face whatever awaits me.

688
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,208
But what of our king?

689
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,833
Your king?

690
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,166
Has no one informed you?

691
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,291
Informed me of what?

692
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,416
Halbrand.

693
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,958
I thought you had died.

694
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:05,500
Better for me if I had done.

695
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,458
[sighs]

696
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:11,125
Southlanders found him on the road
like this yestereve.

697
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,666
[Bronwyn] The wound soured overnight.

698
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,208
I thought to try and treat him
on the road, but...

699
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,125
[breathing heavily]

700
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:25,875
This wound needs Elvish medicine.

701
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,333
Can he ride?

702
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:31,791
I'll have the healers
gather what provisions they can.

703
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,375
Well, my friend.

704
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,500
It seems fate has in store for us
one more raft.

705
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,291
This is not over.

706
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:51,791
I will not abandon these lands
and condemn them to burn.

707
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,416
Nor will you.

708
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
[indistinct chatter]

709
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,083
Strength to the king!

710
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:28,291
[all shouting] Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

711
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:32,666
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

712
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,750
Strength to the king!
Strength to the king!

713
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,625
[grunts, gasping]

714
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:51,583
Keep it... Soldier.

715
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,166
Commander.

716
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,208
[shouts] Strength to the South lands!

717
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:11,041
[all shouting] Strength to the South lands!
Strength to the South lands!

718
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,000
Strength to the South lands!

719
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,291
Strength to the South lands!

720
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,375
Strength to the South lands!

721
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,541
I failed him.

722
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:41,625
It's all my fault.

723
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:44,791
No.

724
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,750
No, it isn't.

725
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,875
Whose is it, then?

726
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,000
It's your father's.

727
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:00,708
He's grown too old, too suspicious.

728
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,958
His mind, too feeble.

729
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:07,125
His eyes too dim to see

730
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,583
that no matter how many crests
he hurls to the floor,

731
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,791
one day this will be your kingdom.

732
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:19,041
Durin IV's.

733
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,750
Not your brother's.

734
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,000
[clanks]

735
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:26,708
Not some other Dwarf-lord's. Yours.

736
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:29,250
And mine.

737
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,958
And together, we will rule this mountain
and all others before our time is done.

738
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:42,416
That <i>mithril</i> belongs to us.

739
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,458
To you and me.

740
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,791
And together, one day,

741
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,208
we are going to dig.

742
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,375
[both sigh]

743
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:23,375
[King Durin echoing] Seal it up.

744
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:26,833
[wind whistling]

745
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,791
[blazing]

746
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:46,583
[growling]

747
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:48,583
[blazing]

748
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:50,000
[roaring]

749
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,708
[crackling]

750
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,291
[Adar] My children.

751
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:59,041
Cast off your sun-cloaks and your helms.

752
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,583
You are no longer
to be burdened by the day.

753
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,541
This is our land now.

754
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:08,708
[Orcs grunting]

755
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:10,208
It is our home.

756
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,541
[Orcs agreeing]

757
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:15,333
[Waldreg] Hail Adar,
Lord of the South lands!

758
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:19,166
[Orcs shout] Hail Adar,
Lord of the South lands!

759
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,458
[Waldreg] Hail Adar,
Lord of the South lands!

760
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:26,000
[Orcs shout] Hail Adar,
Lord of the South lands!

761
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:28,458
No...

762
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:35,583
That is the name of a place
that no longer exists.

763
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:39,125
What should we call it instead,
Lord-father?

764
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,250
[Orcs grunting]

765
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,375
[chanting] Adar! Adar!

766
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,791
[Orcs chanting] Adar! Adar!

767
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:53,208
Adar! Adar!

768
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:56,500
- Adar! Adar!
- [thunder breaking]

769
01:06:56,958 --> 01:06:58,541
Adar!

770
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:02,625
[loud rumbling]
