1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,520
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,080
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,160
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,360
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,160
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,920
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,400
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,800
I was her.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
Tragedy or heartbreak.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
That's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,760
Time Master Druce?

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,160
You and your band
of rogues have run rampant

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
throughout history.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
This is why we work alone.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,040
A team is a liability.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,640
The Time Masters have issued
Omega Protocols on all of us.

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,320
- They've sent the Pilgrim.
- Who's the Pilgrim?

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,000
The Pilgrim is the Time Masters'
most deadly assassin.

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
She's hunting our younger selves.

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,040
Kaylex Druzan,
you have been found guilty

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,080
of time piracy in the first degree...

25
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,240
{\an5}and sentenced to death
via Omega Protocol.

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,520
The Pilgrim has made contact
with your younger self.

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,760
This will all be over quickly.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,080
Well done.
Here's your next assignment.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,920
These individuals
have manipulated the timeline

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,680
without authorization
on multiple occasions.

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,240
You are hereby ordered to hunt down
these individuals' younger selves

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
and eliminate them.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,360
This isn't my element.

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
- It's mine.
- Just keep a weather eye open

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
for the Pilgrim.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,920
Gideon calculates a 97 percent chance

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,240
that she will attack
your younger self

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,200
in this exact time and place.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Roll it.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
Young Rory's not in there.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,240
But we found his parents.
They're dead.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,440
Then where the hell is he?

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,720
Come with me if you want to live.

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,040
I always wanted to say that.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,720
{\an5}- That's younger you?
- What'd you tell him?

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,840
{\an5}That we work for a secret
agency called A.R.G.U.S.

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
- I think he bought it.
- Course he did.

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
He's an idiot.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,480
{\an5}Hey, no offense, but do you
really think it's a good idea

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,840
{\an5}to leave him unsupervised?

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,720
You're right. Have fun.

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
You seem calm.

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,840
You mean considering
a temporal bounty hunter

54
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,640
is trying to murder
our younger selves?

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,840
{\an5}I was gonna put it a little more
delicately than that, but yeah.

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,120
{\an5}I think at some point, you just learn
to live with a sword over your head.

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
{\an5}Either you're getting better
or I'm getting lazy.

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,120
So it seems like you decided
to ignore the advice

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
from Old West you
about not being with Ray.

60
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,720
Ignoring her advice about Ray
was your advice, remember?

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
{\an5}Don't listen to my advice.

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,240
{\an5}- So did you tell him what she said?
- Oh, sure.

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,360
{\an5}"Hey, Ray, by the way,
the woman I met in 1871 was me.

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,600
And she told me our love
was doomed to fail

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,760
because you're not Carter."

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,400
- So that was a no?
- Look, Ray and I are happy together.

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,040
We should be able to enjoy that
before I have to drop

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,920
the whole doomed love affair thing
on his head.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,600
{\an5}Yeah, I mean, who wants
a relationship based on honesty

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,760
{\an5}and communication?

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
{\an5}Believe me.

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,280
A relationship based
on an ancient Egyptian curse

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,440
doesn't work much better.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,080
Mr. Rory, how are you feeling?

75
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,400
{\an5}I mean, your younger self.

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
{\an5}Jax is watching him.

77
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,680
{\an5}That young man,
you, just lost his family.

78
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,280
You might want a shoulder to cry on.

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
{\an5}I don't cry, Professor.

80
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,320
{\an5}Oh, and Haircut,
thanks for saving me.

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
You're welcome.

82
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,880
{\an5}You know what I don't get
is why doesn't the Pilgrim

83
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,040
{\an5}just go back a week earlier
and kill younger Rory then?

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,080
{\an5}'Cause the Omega Protocol
calls for precision.

85
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,080
{\an5}Multiple attempts from the Pilgrim
could do irreparable temporal damage.

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,840
{\an5}Which means she's only got one shot
at killing each and every one of us.

87
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,400
{\an5}And we only have one shot
to extract your younger selves

88
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,720
{\an5}from the timeline
before she pulls the trigger.

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,960
{\an5}<i>Sir, based on the temporal wake
generated by the Pilgrim's time ship,</i>

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
{\an5}<i>I calculate a 96 percent likelihood</i>

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,640
{\an5}<i>that she is heading
to Starling City circa 2007.</i>

92
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,520
{\an5}Pilgrim is targeting Miss Lance.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,120
- Name?
- Lance.

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,240
Sara Lance.

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,880
This is ridiculous.

96
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,840
{\an5}Come on. I thought it was
Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

97
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,840
{\an5}Yeah, if I was in grade school.

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,560
{\an5}"Daddy, I'm doing a paper
on the criminal justice system.

99
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,080
I want to see what it looks
like on the inside".

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
{\an5}Well, I didn't mean
inside a jail cell.

101
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,240
{\an5}Too bad, 'cause that's the next stop
on our little tour.

102
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I think you're enjoying this
a little too much.

103
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Honey, it's the dream of every father

104
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,480
to keep their daughters
locked up until they're 30.

105
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Maybe even 40.

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
What the...

107
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Daddy!

108
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,600
Get out of here. Get out of here!
Go, go, go!

109
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,400
- God, she's...
- Quite the badass.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,640
{\an5}I put her in the cargo bay
with mini you,

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
told them both to stay put.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,760
{\an5}The less they know
what's going on, the better.

113
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,920
{\an5}You sure you want to leave
daddy's little girl with that punk?

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,920
{\an5}Even before the League of Assassins,
I knew how to handle guys like you.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,320
Has Gideon figured out
the Pilgrim's next target yet?

116
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,520
{\an5}- That's peculiar.
- Peculiar or bad?

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,040
{\an5}Gideon, run another scan
for the whereabouts of the Pilgrim.

118
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

119
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
<i>The timeline shows
no temporal distortions.</i>

120
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,240
<i>I seem to be unable
to track the Pilgrim.</i>

121
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,480
That doesn't sound good.

122
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,960
No, it's quite the opposite.

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,360
Without a way to track
the whereabouts of the Pilgrim,

124
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
she could target any one of you

125
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,760
at any point in time.

126
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,680
Gideon was tracking
the Pilgrim's temporal wake.

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,960
I didn't think it was possible

128
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,680
to conceal one's movements
through time.

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,680
Well, it is if the Time Masters
are on your side.

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
How does this all work?

131
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,400
If she can travel to any place
at any time,

132
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,000
she could be killing any of us
right now.

133
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,640
- And if we die in the past...
- We die in the present.

134
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,360
Wow. So interesting.

135
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,000
How long does it take
for what happens in the past

136
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,000
to affect the present?

137
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,720
Could I be dead right now
and not know it?

138
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,920
Maybe I am dead right now.

139
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,760
- Hello? Can anybody hear me?
- No.

140
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,240
Look, the important thing
is not to panic.

141
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,600
Somebody's playing Russian roulette
with our younger selves.

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Why would we panic?

143
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
Well, there are a few exceptions.

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,640
Kendra's ability to reincarnate

145
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,720
means that it would do the Pilgrim
no good to target her.

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,040
And as a former Time Master,
to remove me from history

147
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,280
would be quite dangerous
to the timeline.

148
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,480
Well, that's convenient.

149
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,280
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,120
It just occurs to me you've never
told us about your past, Rip.

151
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,440
And I don't trust a man with secrets.

152
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
Look, the less information
you have to offer on me,

153
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,640
the less valuable you are
to our now numerous enemies.

154
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,080
Like I said, convenient.

155
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,040
- Are they fighting?
- This is not a fight.

156
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
It's merely an exchange of ideas.

157
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
No, not you. Them.

158
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
She slapped me.

159
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,280
The little weirdo said that he liked
the way that I smelled.

160
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
I'm usually a lot smoother,

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
but I'm sort of freaking out
right now.

162
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
You, hands to yourself.

163
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,720
The next time,
hit with a flat palm.

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
And you...

165
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,960
you're not her type.

166
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
Now, do I need to separate you two?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No.

168
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,120
Hey, when do I get to go home?

169
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,360
You're safer here. Trust me.

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,680
Well, where is here?

171
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,120
And why do you look like me?

172
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,880
Please, will you just tell me
what the hell's going on?

173
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,320
Look, it's safer for you if I don't.

174
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
And we look alike, because...

175
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
because we're like family.

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,400
And I need you to trust me.

177
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,920
Look, my dad,
he's got to be freaking out.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If he ever lost me...

179
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
He won't lose you.

180
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Ever.

181
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
I promise.

182
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Hey.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hey.

184
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,680
Did you know that Rip has
a secret stash of vintage cereals?

185
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,840
Fruit Brute was always my favorite.

186
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Are you okay?

187
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,680
I'm a little on edge.

188
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,680
You know, we've been
through a lot together,

189
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
and you've never quite resorted
to eating sugary cereals.

190
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,560
Look, I've spent a lot of my life
thinking about the future.

191
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,200
And now, I have to think
about the past,

192
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
which is sometimes the present.

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
And...

194
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
the point is,

195
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
do you know where I go to
when things get crazy?

196
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
Which for us is always.

197
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,840
I go to those two years
in Hub City,

198
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,160
when it was just you and me,
and it felt like we had forever.

199
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,680
Yeah.

200
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
That's what kept me grounded.

201
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
In fact...

202
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,080
seconds before Rip
and the team came back,

203
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,440
I was about...

204
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Ray!

205
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
What's wrong?

206
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Oh, my God.

207
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,400
Gideon, we need help!

208
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,120
What's happening to him?

209
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,480
<i>He is suffering
from severe internal injuries.</i>

210
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,120
Who's doing this?

211
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,880
<i>A deep scan
of Mr. Palmer's timeline</i>

212
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,280
<i>reveals a temporal anomaly
on December 19, 2014,</i>

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,280
<i>in the vicinity
of Palmer Technologies.</i>

214
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
The Pilgrim.

215
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,640
Gideon, get us to that location now!

216
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,120
- Who are you?
- I'm no one.

217
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,960
We have that in common.

218
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,520
We need to get you to cover.

219
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,560
What is that thing? Who is she?
Who are you?

220
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,640
No time to explain.

221
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,280
No.

222
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,720
Rip and the team
are saving you in the past,

223
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,880
and I'm here now.

224
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,160
However long we have,
I want to spend it with you.

225
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
My suit.

226
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
It works.

227
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,840
Mr. Palmer's vitals are stabilizing.

228
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,160
They did it.

229
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
Actually, I think you get most
of the credit.

230
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,960
I couldn't miss spending
the rest of our lives together.

231
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I meant it, Ray.

232
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,520
I love you.

233
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,760
I guess you found the ring.

234
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
The ring?

235
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,560
Kind of a strange way
to get engaged, but...

236
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I'll take it.

237
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,960
What the Pilgrim did, the way
she turned our attacks back on us,

238
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,280
it was as if she was reversing time.

239
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,080
It's called
temporal micromanipulation.

240
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,800
The ability to control time
in one's immediate vicinity.

241
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,920
We are lucky to have
saved Dr. Palmer.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,320
So basically we have no idea
who she's going after next.

243
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
We know it's not Rip

244
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,000
because he doesn't have a past
to go back to.

245
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
Gideon, prepare
for multiple time jumps.

246
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,840
Plot points here, here, and here.

247
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,040
My birthday? Why are we...

248
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,320
The only way to ensure
you're not harmed in your past

249
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,920
Is to abduct ourselves as newborns,

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,280
thus removing ourselves
from our future timelines.

251
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
It's brilliant.

252
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,520
- It's morally questionable.
- It's suicidal.

253
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,280
If we take too long
in getting them home

254
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,840
Then history is altered.

255
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,160
There won't be a home to go back to.

256
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,880
You'll disappear from the minds
of everyone who's ever known you.

257
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,800
You mean, my own mom
won't even know me?

258
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
My wife.

259
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Yeah, and my...

260
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,640
Oh, yeah.

261
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
I don't have anyone.

262
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,360
Sure as hell beats dying.

263
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,000
Hey.

264
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Hey.

265
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
- How's Ray?
- Fine.

266
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,960
His younger self is in the hospital,
so our Ray is healing rather quickly.

267
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,680
You know, you don't seem
too happy about it.

268
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,080
I'm not unhappy. I'm...

269
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm engaged.

270
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,000
- What?
- Yeah.

271
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,320
Ray proposed to me while he was...

272
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,440
You know what, it's a long story.

273
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,200
But you said yes.

274
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
At the time.

275
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
I... I never thought about marriage.

276
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,880
I didn't think I was able
to think about marriage.

277
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,400
I don't know what to do.

278
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
That's hard.

279
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,800
Do you like babies?

280
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,960
Yeah, but that sounds
like doubling down to me.

281
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,160
I need your help.

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,000
And then I'll help you figure out
what you should say to Ray.

283
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Okay.

284
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Let's go.

285
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
{\an5}All right. This is just like
any other mission.

286
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,600
{\an5}The mark may be a newborn,

287
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
but it might as well be a diamond
or a microchip.

288
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,200
You know what? You're starting
to sound like Snart.

289
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,400
Okay, which one is Snart?

290
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,040
Look for the one with horns.

291
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,960
Found him.

292
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,200
Great, grab him. Let's go.

293
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,160
Well, hello, baby Snart.

294
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,760
Look at you.

295
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,960
Kendra, come on.
We don't have time for this.

296
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Look.

297
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,960
Oh, look at those little cheeks.

298
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,240
You are the cutest little baby
in the world.

299
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,760
Poor kid.

300
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,680
He's gonna have a rough life
ahead of him.

301
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,440
Good thing we're kidnapping him.

302
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,320
What are you doing?

303
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I'm getting us out of here.

304
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,520
We don't even know where here is.

305
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,200
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

306
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

307
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,120
Let's go.

308
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,720
Where do you think you're going?

309
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,360
Give me that. Inside.

310
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,240
Is that a baby?

311
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,040
Yes, and you guys
are in charge of him.

312
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,400
- Wait, I...
- You made five grand

313
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,840
last summer babysitting.

314
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
You'll be fine.

315
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,920
- No, I don't do babies.
- You do now.

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,840
Think of it as a thank you
for saving your life.

317
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,240
You better not drop my future
criminal partner.

318
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,360
Otherwise you're in trouble,
<i>comprende?</i>

319
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,600
We've got Mr. Snart's younger self.

320
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,760
Next stop is you, Professor,
and you, Mr. Jackson.

321
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,160
How strange to imagine,
holding one's infant self.

322
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,640
Actually, none of you should
participate in your own abductions.

323
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,560
Let's call it paradox prevention.

324
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,720
It's almost worth the risk.

325
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,720
To experience how our own fathers
must have felt the day we were born.

326
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Yeah, well, not my dad.

327
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
He shipped out before my mom
went into labor.

328
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,360
Yeah, he died two weeks later
in Somalia, so...

329
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,200
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

330
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
{\an5}I think I see the head.

331
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Look at that.

332
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,600
What do you think of Jeremy
as a name?

333
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
Oh, I think he looks more
like a Martin.

334
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,760
You guys asked for a doctor, right?

335
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Yeah, how would we?

336
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,280
He means that we were
on our way to the hospital

337
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,920
and we saw your automobile.

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, and this little munchkin
needs a checkup.

339
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,120
Prenatal care, it's very important.

340
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,720
He means postnatal.

341
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,840
We'll take him straight
to the hospital.

342
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
We'll meet you there.

343
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
What about my wife?

344
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,600
{\an5}It's somewhat disconcerting
that my father

345
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,320
{\an5}would give me up so willingly
to two complete strangers.

346
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Well, the 1950s was a much
more trusting time.

347
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Trust me, I lived then.

348
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,560
- He's not in Somalia.
- Huh?

349
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,680
We need to hold off
on taking Baby Jefferson.

350
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,160
I need to find grown Jefferson.

351
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
But Rip said that we...

352
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,640
I doubt very much that giving the boy

353
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,240
a moment with his
soon to be dead father

354
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,560
will do the universe any harm.

355
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
What are you doing, Gray?

356
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,040
Trust me, Jefferson,
there's someone here

357
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,400
I really think you should meet.

358
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Go talk to him.

359
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
And say what?

360
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,880
Speak from your heart.

361
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Go.

362
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,160
You were supposed to be shipping out.

363
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
How do you know that?

364
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
Oh, right.

365
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,400
My transport got delayed.

366
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,200
I told my CO my wife's giving birth.

367
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,160
He got me a pass and a Jeep.

368
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,840
And I made it. I saw him.

369
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
My boy.

370
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Which one's yours?

371
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,440
Oh, oh, no, I'm, I'm not a dad.

372
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
I just...

373
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm here for my family.

374
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Well, I hope you get to experience
this for yourself one day.

375
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,760
Imagining all the things my boy's
gonna be when he grows up.

376
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
How do you know?

377
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
'Cause he's my son.

378
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,680
Jefferson Jackson,
remember that name.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,040
He's destined for great things.

380
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I've got to go.

381
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Will you give the nurse
a message for my wife?

382
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
You're leaving already?

383
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Be AWOL if I don't.

384
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,080
I just want her to know
that I saw my son,

385
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,320
and that I couldn't be
more proud and happy.

386
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,240
And tell her I'll be home
as soon as I can.

387
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Can you do that?

388
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Wait.

389
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
I got to tell you something.

390
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,680
Congratulations.

391
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Thanks.

392
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Appreciate that.

393
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
We're here.

394
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,560
- Where is here?
- Come, I'll show you.

395
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,360
Again, where is here?

396
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,600
We need a safe harbor
to keep your younger selves.

397
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I've been waiting.

398
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
It's good to see you.

399
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
It is good to see you too, Mother.

400
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,640
Don't forget to take your boots off
before you come back in.

401
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Oi!

402
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Off you go.

403
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,880
So, this is where Rip plans
on keeping our baby selves.

404
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,040
If all goes according to plan,

405
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,240
we'll only be here for a few minutes,
then presumably never remember.

406
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,360
When's the last thing
anything went according to plan?

407
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,040
I don't think there was a last time.

408
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,360
I really would sit up if I were you.

409
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,080
She'll kill you
if she catches you slouching.

410
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,440
Don't be fooled by appearances.

411
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,480
That woman is as tough as nails.

412
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,480
Funny how you never mentioned
having a mother.

413
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,960
Adoptive mother.

414
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Now, can I interest any of you
in some more tea?

415
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Thank you.

416
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
So, Michael.

417
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,080
- Michael?
- That's me.

418
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,320
My birth name.

419
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,000
The Time Masters insist
on the adoption

420
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,000
of new identities
for their protection.

421
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
How do you know so much
about the Time Masters?

422
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I work for them.

423
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Oh, don't worry.

424
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,640
My true loyalty is to my children.

425
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Thank you. The Time Masters
fill their ranks with children,

426
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,520
orphans pulled from throughout
the course of history.

427
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
When Michael arrived at the Refuge,

428
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,600
he had nothing
but the clothes on his back.

429
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,640
There's a reason
it's called the Refuge,

430
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,640
and a reason that it exists
in a secret location in history.

431
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,640
The Time Masters will never
think to look for you here.

432
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,840
Thank you for your assistance.

433
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,600
Look, I know I make a gorgeous
baby, but I should warn you.

434
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,040
You've got your hands full with me.

435
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
I assure you,
you're not the first tough case

436
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,320
to arrive at my door.

437
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,720
Where'd you find the match?

438
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
You can always find them.

439
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Beautiful, isn't it?

440
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,440
Not as beautiful as a whole house
going up in flames, though.

441
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,160
- It was an accident.
- Sure it was.

442
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
You don't know me.

443
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,000
You think I wanted to kill my family?

444
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,560
I think you fell in love
with your dad's lighter fluid.

445
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,360
I think you fell in love
with the flames dancing around.

446
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,520
But then you realized
you couldn't control them,

447
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,320
and you ran
without waking your family.

448
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,040
The only thing you were concerned
about was your own skin.

449
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Now, while I'm gone,
there better not be any accidents.

450
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,440
If there is,
I'm gonna come looking for you.

451
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm gonna kill you.

452
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,040
You sound just like my dad.

453
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,480
I couldn't quite bring myself
to leave this place just yet.

454
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,760
I've made you something
for your travels.

455
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,640
Some mince pies for your friends.

456
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,200
My friends.

457
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,200
They're the people
whose relationships

458
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,480
with their friends and family
I've put at risk to save my family.

459
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,880
- You think you've been selfish?
- I do, yes.

460
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,480
What a load of old codswallop.

461
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,800
I've always known that you were
brought to me for a reason, Michael.

462
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,800
That you were ready for great things,

463
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,840
but you won't accomplish
anything by wallowing.

464
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,280
So for goodness' sake, pull yourself
out of it and get the job done.

465
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,480
And what about you?
I have put you in terrible danger.

466
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,440
You don't honestly think I'd let you
go away with my best serving dish

467
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,880
if I didn't think
I'd see you again, do you?

468
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,280
I can manage quite happily

469
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,520
with a house full of 10-year-old
Time Masters.

470
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,800
So I think I can perfectly deal
with the adult version.

471
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,360
- Go on!
- Yes, yes. Thank you.

472
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Jefferson?

473
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,520
Hey.

474
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
What's up, man, we good?

475
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,840
Oh, please.
We share a psychic connection.

476
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,440
I know how you're feeling,
and I'm sorry.

477
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,800
I thought affording you time
with your father

478
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
would lift your spirits.

479
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Yeah.

480
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
II thought so too.

481
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
I just...

482
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,760
I should have said something.

483
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,440
I should've told him about
what happens to him in Mogadishu.

484
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,920
- I could've saved him.
- You don't know that.

485
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
It's highly unlikely
you could've said anything

486
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,280
that would've changed his fate.

487
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
My whole life,

488
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,480
everything good I ever did,
every report card,

489
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,160
every touchdown,
in the back of my mind,

490
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,880
I always wondered,
what would my dad think about this?

491
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,400
Hey.

492
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,200
Hey, I was just on my way
to the bridge.

493
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,760
No, wait. Wait, please.

494
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,480
I didn't mean to be a lurker,
but I heard you and Sara talking.

495
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,000
And I get it.
You thought I was dying.

496
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,680
You told me what I needed to hear.

497
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
And it worked.

498
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,280
So if you need a reason,
a way to let me down easy...

499
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Ray, no.

500
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,840
I want to be with you.

501
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,320
It's just that I know
that we can't last.

502
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,160
- Says who?
- Me.

503
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,040
The woman I met in 1871...

504
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
was me.

505
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,560
And she warned me

506
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,480
that it would end in heartbreak
if I ever tried to be with someone...

507
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Other than Carter.

508
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,400
God, this is just too complicated.

509
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,960
No, it isn't, really.

510
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,600
I mean, if I make you happy,

511
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,080
if being with me makes you happy,
then you can be happy.

512
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,440
Or you can choose to listen
to some former version

513
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,600
of yourself who believes in curses.

514
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,920
When you decide, let me know.

515
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,840
Everyone please report
to the main deck immediately.

516
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,560
What's going on?

517
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,000
Gideon has intercepted
a transchronal beacon.

518
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,720
Gideon, show them.

519
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,440
<i>This message is for Rip Hunter.</i>

520
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,280
<i>I'm going to make this
very quick and very simple.</i>

521
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,920
<i>If I can't find you...</i>

522
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
<i>I can find those you love.</i>

523
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Anna?

524
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,160
- Dad!
<i>- All of them will suffer</i>

525
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,960
<i>and die because of you.</i>

526
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,360
<i>Your family, friends,
anyone you've ever cared about.</i>

527
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,480
<i>Unless you surrender
your younger selves to me.</i>

528
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,120
So she can erase you all
from history.

529
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,560
<i>If it's of any comfort,
you won't feel a thing.</i>

530
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,760
<i>As for your loved ones,</i>

531
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,760
<i>I cannot promise the same thing.</i>

532
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,720
Gideon, I take it

533
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,160
that the Pilgrim's transmission
included a carrier frequency

534
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,640
through which she can be contacted?

535
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,800
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

536
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,320
Hail her, please.

537
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
What are you planning to do?

538
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,120
<i>- Captain Hunter.</i>
- Look, I'm gonna make this easy.

539
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,520
<i>I already have.</i>

540
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
<i>The lives of your team's nearest
and dearest for their younger selves.</i>

541
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,960
And I'm gonna counter that demand
with an offer of my own.

542
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,360
I will surrender myself

543
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,760
if you spare the lives of my crew
and their loved ones.

544
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,560
<i>A noble gesture.</i>

545
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,080
<i>But worthless.</i>

546
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,080
<i>My directive is to eliminate
your entire team, not just you.</i>

547
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes, well,
I'm not talking about me now.

548
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,040
I'm offering you me in the past.

549
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,120
Rip Hunter before he became
a Time Master.

550
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,240
Eliminate him and this team
will never have been.

551
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,520
<i>If this is some kind of trick...</i>

552
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,680
It's no trick.

553
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,680
Enough people have died
at my expense.

554
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Gideon will send you the location.

555
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,400
And, Mr. Snart, your wish
is about to come true.

556
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,800
You're going to meet my younger self.

557
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,920
- What is this place?
- Neutral ground.

558
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,240
It's a defunct Time Masters outpost.

559
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,560
I thought we were supposed
to be picking up your younger self.

560
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,520
He's being brought to us, actually.

561
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,120
That little boy was at the Refuge.

562
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
He's you.

563
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,880
- You got my message?
- I don't approve

564
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,000
of what you're planning.

565
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
Not that it ever stopped you before.

566
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,880
Your younger selves
are all still safe and sound.

567
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Thank you.

568
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,960
You're a naughty one.

569
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
That's right.

570
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,440
I think it's probably about time
that you left.

571
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Give her hell.

572
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,320
Where's my dad?

573
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,480
On board my ship,
along with the rest.

574
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,560
All in perfect condition,

575
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,480
as long as your captain honors
his end of our bargain.

576
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
You'd murder a child?

577
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,480
I'd murder as many children
as is necessary

578
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
to accomplish my mission.

579
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,360
Do you know what this will do to
the timeline, killing a Time Master?

580
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,480
In case you've forgotten,

581
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,960
I am sanctioned
by the Time Masters

582
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,320
to do what my former colleague
Chronos here failed to do.

583
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Enough of that.

584
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,600
Let's get down to business.

585
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
Where's the rest of your group?

586
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
They're around.

587
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,920
I'll be taking the boy.

588
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
Before you do that,

589
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,480
we don't believe for a second
their loved ones are on your ship.

590
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,960
A show of good faith, then.

591
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,120
A prisoner exchange.

592
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,200
Send the boy,
and I'll send the father.

593
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,400
Once I have the future
Captain Hunter in my possession,

594
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,080
then I'll release the rest.

595
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,240
- What the hell's going on?
- You don't need to understand.

596
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Only walk.

597
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,760
You are gonna be absolutely fine.
I promise.

598
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,440
As soon as my dad's in the clear,
let's light this up.

599
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,640
Remember, we wait for Ray's cue.

600
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,080
I'm in position.

601
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,640
You wanted to see me?

602
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,080
Have I done something wrong, miss?

603
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,200
Not yet.

604
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Now!

605
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,760
Fool me once.

606
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,600
Now, Kendra!

607
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,120
I was willing to proceed
in good faith.

608
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,680
Now you'll watch those closest
to you die.

609
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,880
Thought you could snuff me out?

610
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,760
You don't know me at all, miss.

611
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,920
Hey, are you okay?

612
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
Not really.

613
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Yeah, let me explain.

614
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,280
You poor boy.

615
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,280
I'll take you. Are you all right?

616
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
That's you.

617
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Yeah.

618
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
I was a cutpurse
from the age of five.

619
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,120
Starved more than I ate.

620
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,520
I knew what I'd do
if she tried to harm me.

621
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,320
Lucky for us,
you didn't forget your roots.

622
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Believe me, Mr. Snart,

623
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
I've tried.

624
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
There you are.

625
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,880
The Pilgrim may have been dealt with,

626
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,080
but the Omega Protocol
is still in effect.

627
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,880
I'll look after your friends,
don't worry.

628
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,600
Oh, I know you will, Mum.

629
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
You did the same for me.

630
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,640
It must be strange for you
to see yourself as you were.

631
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,560
Do you remember the first day
you were here?

632
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,360
Yes, I think
I tried to steal your purse.

633
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,080
God, I was a mean little bastard.

634
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,240
- You were tough.
- I was selfish.

635
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,400
Well, you were surviving.

636
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I was home.

637
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,720
Which is why I know you'll be back.

638
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,200
Here to give me another
"don't burn down the house" speech?

639
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,400
You think by hurting yourself,

640
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,360
it's gonna make you feel better
about the fire?

641
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,520
You don't know anything
about me, man.

642
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Guess again, kid.

643
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm you.

644
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
What?

645
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
That's right.

646
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,440
You're too young to understand.

647
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
But understand this.

648
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
It wasn't your fault.

649
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,240
I let that flame get out of control,
like you said.

650
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,800
I ran out without waking anybody,
like you said.

651
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,680
I was just so afraid.

652
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
You were just a kid.

653
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,320
I spent my whole life blaming you,
hating you

654
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,280
for something you didn't mean to do.

655
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,200
Why are you telling me this?

656
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,560
You can't change the things you did.

657
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,120
But you can change what you become.

658
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Don't be like me.

659
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Be better.

660
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,520
Clarissa, it's me, Martin.

661
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,080
I'm sorry, you look so familiar,
but I just can't place you.

662
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Spaceship?

663
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,880
What next, Martians?

664
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,640
No, actually, amnesia pill.

665
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Oh, yeah.

666
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
This will just wipe
your short term memory.

667
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,520
Of course, it's up to you,
but we don't want to mess

668
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
with time too much.

669
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,440
I always knew that you'd end up
caring for people...

670
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,160
protecting people.

671
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
Well, I learned it from my dad.

672
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Proud of you, honey.

673
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Is everything all right?

674
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,440
My wife doesn't seem to remember me.

675
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,240
Because until we return
your younger selves to the timeline,

676
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,080
you, none of you
will have ever existed.

677
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,520
But we will return you.

678
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,760
When we left 2016,
I just assumed I would return

679
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,400
to the exact moment I left,

680
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
that Clarissa wouldn't even know
I was gone.

681
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,120
So I didn't say goodbye.

682
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,040
And now I fear I will never
have that chance.

683
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
You will.

684
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,480
Look, I've told you before

685
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,920
that I am not going
to risk your marriage

686
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,280
in order to save my wife.

687
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I promise you that.

688
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Thank you.

689
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Not even gonna pretend
to understand any of this.

690
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,520
It's pretty crazy, huh?

691
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,360
That was you in the hospital,
on the day you were born.

692
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,640
And earlier, on fire.

693
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Amazing.

694
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,560
- Where'd you learn those moves?
- From my dad.

695
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,680
You know, the day
you were born in the hospital,

696
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,720
I'd never been so scared.

697
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,000
I mean, even in combat.

698
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,520
But now, I know for you to be the man
I see standing here,

699
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I must do something right.

700
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,080
I can't wait to be there
to watch it happen.

701
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,680
Dad, listen.

702
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,360
On September 26th,

703
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,640
you're gonna be deployed
along the K4 circle.

704
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,200
Keep your head on a swivel
for an IED.

705
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
You know this because...

706
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,240
You're from the future.

707
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,280
Please. Promise me you'll be careful.

708
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
I'll be back soon, okay?

709
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,720
Hey.

710
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Hey.

711
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,240
Hope you don't mind, my fiancee...

712
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,480
my other fiancee
is in our quarters, resting.

713
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,400
Yeah, no, that's, that's fine.

714
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- No, really, it's fine.

715
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,640
No, I mean, being at death's door

716
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,480
is not the right time
to pop the question.

717
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,080
Look, when you proposed...

718
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,120
I was so afraid of losing you.

719
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,680
And then facing the Pilgrim,

720
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,720
I realized there is never going to be
a right time for this.

721
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,840
So we should stop waiting
for the right time.

722
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
I don't understand.

723
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
I want to marry you, Ray.

724
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
I mean it.

725
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,160
How's your sister?

726
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,600
She's a tough kid.

727
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,800
How's your dad?

728
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,720
Sleeping off that amnesia pill
from Rip.

729
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Hey.

730
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,840
I might have just stopped my dad
from getting killed in Mogadishu.

731
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,800
I just thought I should tell you

732
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,400
in case there's a time paradox
or whatever.

733
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,960
Well, as I've been saying,
Mr. Jackson, time wants to happen.

734
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,240
Yeah, I know. But I had to try.

735
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,840
And perhaps what time wants

736
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,080
is to see you
and your father back together.

737
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,400
Just pulled younger me's head
from out of his ass.

738
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,880
- I'm not sure it stuck.
- Me either.

739
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,080
Then I saw younger Rip change,

740
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,840
and I thought,
why not give it a shot?

741
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,760
Surprised you didn't advise
your teenage self

742
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,560
to not get on a certain boat.

743
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,600
- Yeah, me too.
- Yak, yak, yak.

744
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,960
I thought we were on a clock here.

745
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Indeed we are.

746
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,760
Time, the history from which
your younger selves were removed,

747
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,280
is beginning to set...

748
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,240
as is evidenced by the change
in Clarissa's memory.

749
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,560
Okay. So how long do we have
'til these changes stick?

750
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,680
No one knows.

751
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,080
Which is why we need to move swiftly
to locate Vandal Savage

752
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,400
if any of your lives
are to be restored to normal.

753
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,880
So how long will it take to determine
a new location for Savage?

754
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,360
Longer than we have.

755
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,400
Fortunately,
there is one place in time

756
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,240
that we know Savage to be.

757
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,480
You said he conquered
the world in 2166.

758
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,760
You also said it was too dangerous

759
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,200
to strike at Savage while he was
at the height of his powers.

760
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,360
That it is.

761
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,720
But with your younger selves
removed from history,

762
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,040
we have quite literally
run out of time.
