It was good to see you

It was lovely.

It's been a while

It was no joke, Moira.

Mark was telling the truth.

328
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,668
A significant number of people
in Starling City feel that...

329
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,589
...your actions with Malcolm Merlyn
were justified to protect your family.

330

-Forty-three-point-six percent, in fact.
-You polled people about me?

331
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,429
Prudent course of action when vetting
a potential candidate, yes.

00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:50,100
Six hundred thousand people in Starling City.
I'd think you could find someone...

333
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,312
...not responsible for destroying it
with an earthquake machine.

334
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,940
Not with your name recognition.

335
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,527
We need a game-change candidate, Moira.

336
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,112
And there's no one in Starling
with a higher profile.

337

Charles Manson is rather well-known,
and no one is going to vote for him.

True. Equally true,
voters like redemption stories.

-Martha Stewart.
-I don't believe she ran for office.

341

No. No, it's not.

...and as a newly-minted voter...

How do you keep secrets
from people in your life?

362
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,573
By remembering it's the only way
to keep them safe.

363

No, keeping them safe
