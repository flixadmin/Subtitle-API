1
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,120
Peter.

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,560
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,840
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,680
Peter?

6
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,440
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,560
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,320
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,840
You even look like him.

10
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,400
-Composed out of pure light.
-Mer?

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,480
You got a present there for Peter,
don't you?

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,880
Of course.

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,320
There.

15
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,720
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,120
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,200
-Your grandpa...
-

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,640
...is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,600
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
Take my hand.

21
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,680
Peter.

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,360
-Pete, come on.

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
Take my hand.

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,520
PETER: Mom?

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,800
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,360
Mom! No!

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,920
-Come with me.
-No!

28
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,800
No!

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,360
No...

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,240
Okay?

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
No.

33
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,960
Mom!

34
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,640
Drop it!

35
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,080
Uh, hey.

36
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,880
-Drop it, now!
-Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
No problem at all.

38
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,280
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,960
PETER: I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.

44
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
What is your name?

45
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

46
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
-Move!
-Why?

47
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Ronan may have questions for you.

48
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,720
PETER: Hey, you know what?

49
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,960
There's another name
you might know me by.

50
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,640
Star-Lord.

51
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Who?

52
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

53
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,800
-Guys?
-Move!

54
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,880
Ah, forget this.

55
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,160
WOMAN: Peter?

56
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
What happened?

57
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,680
Hey, uh...

58
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,800
Uh... I...

59
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,440
-Bereet.
-Bereet!

60
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,080
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

61
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,720
REPORTER ON TV:
Scattered riots broke out

62
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
across the Kree Empire today

63
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,880
protesting the recent peace treaty
signed by the Kree Emperor

64
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,280
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

65
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,240
Peter, you have call.

66
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,840
-No, wait, don't!
-Quill?

67
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
Hey, Yondu.

68
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
I'm here on Morag.

69
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

70
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,280
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

71
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,760
Well, where are you at now, boy?

72
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,320
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

73
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
-I slaved putting this deal together.
-Slaved?

74
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

75
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
And now you're gonna rip me off!

76
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,880
We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.

77
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

78
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,120
When I picked you up on Terra...

79
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
"Picked me up."

80
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,240
...these boys of mine
wanted to eat you.

81
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Yeah?

82
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,840
They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.

83
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!

84
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,400
I will find you, I will...

85
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,880
Put a bounty on him!

86
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,520
Forty K.

87
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
-But I want him back alive.
-Yeah, Cap.

88
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
-Alive?
-That's what I said.

89
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,280
I told you when you picked that kid up,

90
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,360
you should have delivered him
like we was hired to do!

91
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,080
He was cargo!

92
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
You have always been soft on him.

93
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,400
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

94
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,360
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

95
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
As soon as we get him back here,

96
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,920
I'm gonna kill him myself.

97
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
What we do need to worry about,

98
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,360
is who else out there wants that Orb!

99
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,080
RONAN: They call me "terrorist,"

100
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,320
"radical," "zealot,"

101
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,320
because I obey the ancient laws
of my people, the Kree,

102
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,520
and punish those who do not.

103
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,920
Because I do not forgive your people

104
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
for taking the life of my father,

105
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,480
and his father,
and his father before him.

106
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,360
A thousand years of war between us
will not be forgotten!

107
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,600
XANDARIAN: You can't do this!
Our government signed a peace treaty.

108
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
RONAN: My government
knows no shame.

109
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,080
You Xandarians and your culture
are a disease.

110
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
You

111
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,960
will never rule Xandar.

112
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,080
No.

113
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,120
I will cure it!

114
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,320
Ronan,

115
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,320
Korath has returned.

116
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,280
KORATH: Master, he is a thief,

117
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,920
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

118
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,400
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

119
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,320
to retrieve the Orb
for an intermediary known

120
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,040
as The Broker.

121
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,520
I promised Thanos
I would retrieve the Orb for him.

122
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

123
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,480
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

124
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,440
It will be my honor.

125
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,560
It will be your doom.

126
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

127
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
without his prize.

128
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

129
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
Just like you.

130
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,000
But I know Xandar.

131
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,640
Ronan has already decreed that I...

132
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Do not speak for me.

133
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
You will not fail.

134
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,640
Have I ever?

135
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,520
ROCKET: Xandarians.

136
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,000
What a bunch of losers.

137
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,400
All of them in a big hurry
to get from something stupid,

138
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,520
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

139
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Look at this guy!

140
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,600
Can you believe they call us criminals,

141
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
when he's assaulting us
with that haircut?

142
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,040
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

143
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,560
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

144
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,640
-Look at Mr. Smiles over here.
-

145
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,120
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

146
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,280
Right, Groot?

147
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,960
Groot?

148
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

149
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,200
-That's disgusting!
-Mmm.

150
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,480
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

151
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,680
Why are you lying?

152
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,240
-Whoop.

153
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Looks like we got one.

154
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Okay, humie, how bad
does someone wanna find you?

155
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,160
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

156
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,440
-Mr. Quill.
-Broker.

157
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
The Orb.

158
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,760
-As commissioned.
-Where's Yondu?

159
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,600
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

160
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
And told me to tell you,

161
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,200
that you got the best eyebrows
in the business.

162
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,400
What is it?

163
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,480
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

164
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Yeah, well, I almost died
getting it for you.

165
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,600
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

166
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,560
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

167
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,040
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

168
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,160
I truly am.

169
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,800
But I want no part of this transaction

170
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
-if Ronan is involved.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

171
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,120
Who's Ronan?

172
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,400
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

173
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,760
who will not rest
until Xandarian culture, my culture,

174
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
-is wiped from existence!
-Whoa, whoa!

175
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,560
-Come on.
-He's someone

176
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

177
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
What? What about my bad side?

178
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

179
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,120
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

180
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
What happened?

181
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,320
Ah, this guy just backed out of a deal
on me.

182
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,520
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity.

183
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

184
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,200
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

185
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,400
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

186
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,160
People say it about me, all the time,

187
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,680
but it's not something
I would ever say about myself.

188
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,200
-

189
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,680
-Ooh!
-

190
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,640
This wasn't the plan.

191
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Ah!

192
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,400
ROCKET: Put him in the bag.
Put him in the bag!

193
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,720
No! Not her, him!

194
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,360
Learn genders, man.

195
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
-Ow!

196
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,840
Biting? That's not fair!

197
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,120
-ROCKET: Take it easy!
-

198
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,720
Ow!

199
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Fool. You should have learned.

200
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,400
I don't learn. One of my issues.

201
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
PETER: What the...

202
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,160
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

203
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,800
You gotta be kidding me.

204
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
Ooh. Hey!

205
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
I live for the simple things.

206
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,240
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

207
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,880
-

208
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

209
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,640
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

210
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,360
Quit whining.

211
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,800
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

212
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,960
Aw, crap.

213
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,600
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

214
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,520
-you are under arrest...
-All right. Come on up.

215
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,720
...for endangerment to life
and the destruction of property.

216
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,920
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

217
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,400
-Star-Lord.
-Oh, sorry. "Lord."

218
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,560
I picked this guy up a while back
for petty theft.

219
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,240
-He's got a code name.
-

220
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
OFFICER: Yeah. Stay out of the way.

221
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,280
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

222
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,920
Just relax, pal.

223
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,360
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

224
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,360
ROCKET: Fascists.

225
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,840
NOVA PRIME: Ronan is destroying

226
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,280
Xandarian outposts
throughout the galaxy.

227
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,360
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

228
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,960
We signed your peace treaty,
Nova Prime.

229
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,400
What more do you want?

230
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
At least a statement
from the Kree Empire

231
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,560
saying that they condemn his actions.

232
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,040
He is slaughtering children.

233
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,680
Families.

234
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,040
That is your business.

235
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,320
Now, I have other matters to attend to.

236
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Prick.

237
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
-Well, some good news.

238
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,560
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

239
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,040
DEY: Gamora.

240
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,320
Surgically modified
and trained as a living weapon.

241
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,840
The adopted daughter
of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

242
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,480
Recently, Thanos lent her
and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

243
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,760
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

244
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,080
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

245
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,760
The result of illegal genetic

246
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,440
and cybernetic experiments

247
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,720
-on a lower life form.
-

248
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,840
What the hell?

249
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,760
DEY: They call it "Groot."

250
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,440
A humanoid plant
that's been travelling recently

251
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,680
as 89P13's
personal houseplant/muscle.

252
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,800
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

253
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Raised from youth by a band
of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

254
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,920
led by Yondu Udonta.

255
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

256
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,680
I didn't know how this machine worked.

257
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,880
-What a bunch of a-holes.
-

258
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,880
SAAL: Transport all four to the Kyln.

259
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,080
ROCKET: I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

260
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,680
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

261
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,000
But, hey, that's not my problem.

262
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,800
I ain't gonna be here long.

263
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,440
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

264
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,800
You're lucky the broad showed up,

265
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,040
because otherwise, me and Groot

266
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,960
would be collecting that bounty
right now,

267
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,960
and you'd be getting
drawn and quartered

268
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,040
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

269
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,480
I've had a lot of folks
try to kill me over the years.

270
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,400
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

271
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Hold.

272
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,480
-What's a raccoon?
-PETER: "What's a raccoon?"

273
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
It's what you are, stupid.

274
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,720
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

275
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,680
So, this Orb has
a real shiny blue suitcase,

276
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,800
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

277
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,720
-What is it?
-I am Groot.

278
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,560
So what? What's the Orb?

279
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,840
I have no words for an honorless thief.

280
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,120
Pretty high and mighty
coming from the lackey

281
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,520
of a genocidal maniac.

282
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
Yeah, I know who you are.

283
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Anyone who's anyone
knows who you are.

284
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,160
Yeah, we know who you are.

285
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,800
-Who is she?
-I am Groot.

286
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,840
Yeah, you said that.

287
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,000
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

288
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,840
I was betraying him.

289
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I had an agreement
to sell it to a third party.

290
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,440
I am Groot.

291
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,760
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you told me that.

292
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,880
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

293
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,440
Well, he don't know
talking good like me and you.

294
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,560
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

295
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,160
Exclusively in that order.

296
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,600
I tell you what,
that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

297
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,120
Hey.

298
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,520
Put that away.

299
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,840
-Hey!

300
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,120
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

301
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,960
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

302
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,960
That tape and that player is mine!

303
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,920
-

304
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,600
Hooked on a Feeling,
Blue Swede, 1973.

305
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
That song belongs to me!

306
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,800
-

307
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,800
-You first! You first!
-Murderer!

308
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,800
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

309
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,080
-You're scum! You're scum!
-

310
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,160
It's like I said,

311
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,200
she's got a rep.

312
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,160
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

313
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,560
to Ronan and his goons.

314
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,800
She'll last a day, tops.

315
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,120
Murderer!

316
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,760
The guards will protect her, right?

317
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,320
They're here to stop us from getting out.

318
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,600
They don't care
what we do to each other inside.

319
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,120
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

320
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,960
are dreams
compared to what's behind me.

321
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,840
Check out the new meat.

322
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm gonna slather you up
in Gunavian jelly,

323
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,080
and go to town...

324
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,640
Let's make something clear.

325
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,800
This one here is our booty!

326
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,200
You wanna get to him,

327
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,680
you go through us!

328
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,800
Or, more accurately,

329
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,680
-we go through you.
-

330
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm with them.

331
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,720
INMATE: I hate you.

332
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,960
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

333
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,800
-You're dead!

334
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Dead!

335
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,000
GUARD: Take her down to the showers.

336
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
It'll be easier to clean up
the blood down there.

337
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
Quill, where you going?

338
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,720
Quill.

339
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
-Quill!
-

340
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,000
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

341
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,200
for your crimes against the galaxy.

342
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,440
DRAX: You dare?

343
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,720
You know who I am, yes?

344
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,720
PRISONER: You're Drax.

345
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,920
The Destroyer.

346
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Quill!

347
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,040
DRAX: And you know
why they call me this.

348
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,800
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

349
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,280
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

350
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,800
and my daughter, Camaria.

351
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,320
He slaughtered them where they stood.

352
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,080
And he laughed!

353
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,120
ROCKET: Quill?

354
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,320
DRAX: Her life

355
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,120
is not yours to take.

356
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,120
He killed my family.

357
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,000
I shall kill one of his in return.

358
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,360
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

359
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,120
-

360
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
Quill! What are you doing?

361
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,440
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

362
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,840
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

363
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
-Ah!

364
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,360
Woman, your words
mean nothing to me!

365
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,120
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
-Oh, crap.

366
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,360
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

367
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,920
I don't think this is
the best way to go about it.

368
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,520
Are you not the man
this wench attempted to kill?

369
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,040
Well, I mean,
she's hardly the first woman

370
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,360
Look, this is from
a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

371
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,040
Stabbed me with a fork.

372
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Didn't like me skipping out on her
at sunrise.

373
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,840
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

374
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
She caught me with
this skinny little A'askavariian

375
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,080
who worked in Nova Records.

376
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,840
I was trying to get information.

377
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,480
You ever see an A'askavariian?

378
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,400
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

379
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,920
If you think I'm seriously interested
in that, then...

380
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,400
-You don't care. But here's the point.
-

381
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,040
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

382
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,840
And when he does,

383
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,200
that's when you...

384
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,920
Why would I put
my finger on his throat?

385
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,280
What?

386
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,480
Oh, no, it's a symbol.

387
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,000
This is a symbol
for you slicing his throat.

388
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,360
I would not slice his throat.

389
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,240
I would cut his head clean off.

390
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,440
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

391
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,160
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

392
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,280
-You know what that is.
-Yeah. Yeah.

393
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,440
-Everyone knows.
-No, no.

394
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,480
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

395
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,560
Don't do his work for him.

396
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

397
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,240
-That was my favorite knife.
-PETER: Listen!

398
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,440
I could care less
whether you live or whether you die.

399
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,320
-Then why stop the big guy?
-Simple.

400
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,160
You know where to sell my Orb.

401
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,480
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

402
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,960
My friend Rocket, here,

403
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
has escaped 22 prisons.

404
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,480
Oh, we're getting out.

405
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,480
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

406
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,320
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

407
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
Four billion units.

408
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,520
-What?
-Holy shit.

409
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,480
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

410
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,480
If you free us,

411
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

412
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,640
and I'll split the profit
between the three of us.

413
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
I am Groot.

414
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
ROCKET: Four of us.

415
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Asleep for the danger,
awake for the money,

416
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
as per frickin' usual.

417
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,640
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

418
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
We know only that
she has been captured.

419
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,040
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

420
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,400
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

421
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,200
Look, your partnership with Thanos

422
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,120
is at risk.

423
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,520
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

424
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,200
RONAN: With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

425
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,720
and yet you summon me.

426
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,720
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

427
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,000
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

428
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,720
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

429
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,640
RONAN: Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

430
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,640
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

431
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,960
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

432
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,240
Lower your tone!

433
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I may be your...

434
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,480
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

435
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,360
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

436
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,080
is you.

437
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,280
Your politics bore me.

438
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,480
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

439
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,320
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

440
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,760
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

441
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,680
if you bring me the Orb.

442
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,240
But return to me again empty-handed,

443
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,600
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

444
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,760
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

445
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,040
This is one fight you won't win.

446
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,760
Let's head to the Kyln.

447
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,520
ROCKET: If we're gonna get out of here,

448
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,400
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

449
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,280
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

450
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,800
The guards wear security bands

451
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,440
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

452
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,280
Leave it to me.

453
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,240
ROCKET: That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

454
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,080
PETER: His leg?
ROCKET: Yeah.

455
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,280
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

456
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,640
All right.

457
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,160
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

458
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,280
-Do you see it?
-Yeah.

459
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,440
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

460
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,640
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

461
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,240
How are we supposed to do that?

462
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,560
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

463
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,320
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

464
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,520
You must be joking.

465
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,400
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

466
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,200
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

467
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,600
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

468
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,480
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

469
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,600
I got one plan,

470
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,760
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

471
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
so figure it out!

472
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,240
Oh!

473
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,360
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

474
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,360
Now, this is important.

475
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,080
Once the battery is removed,

476
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,480
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

477
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,320
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

478
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,320
so you definitely need to get that last.

479
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,160
Or we could just get it first
and improvise.

480
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,320
-I'll get the armband.
-Leg.

481
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
GUARD: Prisoner,

482
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,400
drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

483
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,400
or we will open fire.

484
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,480
I am

485
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,400
Groot!

486
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,800
Fire!

487
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,760
All prisoners return
to your sleeping areas.

488
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
You idiot!

489
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,640
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

490
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,440
The animal is in control.

491
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Fire on my command!

492
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,440
Creepy little beast!

493
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,960
Oh, yeah.

494
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,760
You need my what?

495
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,480
-I'll need this.
-Good luck.

496
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,960
It's internally wired.

497
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,880
Drop the leg!

498
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,640
Drop the leg
and move back to your cell!

499
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,840
GAMORA: Rocket!

500
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,000
Move to the watchtower!

501
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,000
You!

502
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,680
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

503
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,080
It was one time, man.

504
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,520
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

505
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,920
Whoa!

506
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,000
-

507
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,440
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

508
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,600
Why is this one here?

509
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,600
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

510
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,920
I always keep my promises,

511
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,680
when they're
to muscle-bound whack-jobs

512
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,960
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

513
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,520
Oh, I was just kidding about the leg.

514
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,680
I just need these two things.

515
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,520
-What?
-No, I thought it'd be funny.

516
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,640
Was it funny?

517
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,520
Oh, wait, what did he look like
hopping around?

518
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,520
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

519
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,560
DRAX: How are we going to leave?

520
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,040
Well, he's got a plan.

521
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,880
Right? Or is that
another thing you made up?

522
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,640
I have a plan! I have a plan!

523
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,400
Cease your yammering

524
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
and relieve us
from this irksome confinement.

525
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, I'll have to agree
with the walking thesaurus

526
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,520
on that one.

527
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,960
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

528
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,840
It's just a metaphor, dude.

529
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,880
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

530
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,640
Nothing goes over my head.

531
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,840
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

532
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

533
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,880
Those are some big guns.

534
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,480
On my command!

535
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Number one!

536
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

537
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,120
Hold on!

538
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,000
Number two!

539
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,720
I recognize this animal.

540
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,960
We'd roast them over a flame pit
as children.

541
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,440
Their flesh was quite delicious.

542
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,680
Not helping!

543
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Number three!

544
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,720
All fire on my command!

545
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
Three!

546
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,880
Two!

547
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,560
One!

548
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,720
GAMORA:
He turned off the artificial gravity,

549
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,800
everywhere but in here.

550
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,040
-

551
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,480
I told you I had a plan.

552
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,280
That was a pretty good plan.

553
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,800
Huh?

554
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,960
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

555
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,960
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one
over in the corner.

556
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,840
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

557
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
That's rude! They folded yours.

558
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,120
The Orb's there. Let's go.

559
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,920
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What?

560
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,800
That bastard didn't put it back.

561
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,800
-Put what back?
-Here.

562
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,680
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

563
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,240
-How are you gonna possibly...
-Just keep the Milano close by.

564
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,720
Go.

565
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,080
Go!

566
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,160
Ah, my neck!

567
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,160
ROCKET: Well,
how's he gonna get to us?

568
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,680
GAMORA: He declined to share
that information with me.

569
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Well, screw this, then!

570
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,680
I ain't waiting around
for some humie with a death wish.

571
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,040
You got the Orb, right?

572
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,800
Yes.

573
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,080
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

574
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,120
No!

575
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
We're not leaving without the Orb.

576
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,200
Behold.

577
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,880
This one shows spirit.

578
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,880
He shall make a keen ally
in the battle against Ronan.

579
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,320
Companion, what were you retrieving?

580
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
You're an imbecile.

581
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,760
PETER: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

582
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,160
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

583
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,920
You can't take apart my ship
without asking me!

584
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,920
-See, what is this?
-Don't touch that!

585
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's a bomb.

586
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,120
-A bomb?
-Yup.

587
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,920
And you leave it lying around?

588
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,680
I was gonna put it in a box.

589
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,840
What's a box gonna do?

590
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,120
-How about this one?
-No! Whoa. Hey!

591
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,200
-Leave it alone.
-Why? What is it?

592
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,880
-Shut up.
-Hey!

593
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,160
What is that?

594
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,080
That's for if things get really hardcore.

595
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,840
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

596
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
No one's blowing up moons.

597
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,720
You just wanna suck the joy
out of everything.

598
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,920
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

599
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,160
We're heading in the right direction.
For now.

600
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,800
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

601
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,280
And how much do you trust me?

602
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,440
I'd trust you a lot more
if you told me what this was.

603
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,320
Because I'm guessing
it's some kind of weapon.

604
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,840
I don't know what it is.

605
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,160
If it's a weapon,
we should use it against Ronan.

606
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,240
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

607
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,320
Or just you, murderess!

608
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,160
I let you live once, princess!

609
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,320
-I am not a princess!
-PETER: Hey!

610
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,080
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

611
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,280
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

612
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,480
I have no interest in money.

613
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,040
Great.

614
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,320
That means more money
for the three of us.

615
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,520
Mmm?

616
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,840
For the four of us.

617
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,240
Partners.

618
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,960
We have an agreement,

619
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,520
but I would never be partners
with the likes of you.

620
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,160
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

621
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,440
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

622
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
Oh, she has no idea.

623
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
If I had a black light,

624
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,880
the place would look like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

625
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,200
You got issues, Quill.

626
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,440
GUARD: I swear.
I don't know where they went! I swear.

627
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,800
NEBULA: If he knew
where they were headed,

628
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,000
he would have already told us.

629
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,080
Yeah.

630
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,560
Ronan,

631
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,920
the Nova Corps sent a fleet
to defend the prison.

632
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Well, then,

633
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,240
send Necrocraft
to every corner of the quadrant.

634
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,920
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

635
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,400
And this place?

636
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,040
The Nova can't know what we're after.

637
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,400
Cleanse it!

638
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Do you got any other
cute little buggers like this one?

639
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,440
I like to stick 'em all in a row
on my control console.

640
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,040
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

641
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,240
He's being fully serious.

642
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,560
-In that case, I can show you...
-

643
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,520
But first, you gonna tell me
what this Orb is,

644
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,960
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

645
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,240
And then you gonna tell me,

646
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,440
who out there might wanna buy it.

647
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,280
Sir, the high-end community is a...

648
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,320
-The high-end community is a...
-

649
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,920
It's a tight-knit...

650
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,200
Tight-knit...

651
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,120
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

652
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,240
-

653
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,600
I cannot possibly betray

654
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,040
the confidentiality of my buyers!

655
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,440
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

656
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,480
TIVAN: Carina.

657
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,880
Yes, Master.

658
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,960
TIVAN: Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

659
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,880
We do, Master.

660
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,960
TIVAN: Then use them.

661
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,560
I don't have to remind you

662
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,640
what happened to the last attendant
who disappointed me.

663
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,640
Do I?

664
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,480
Chop, chop.
Our guests will be here soon.

665
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,000
ROCKET: Heads up! We're inbound.

666
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,560
Whoa.

667
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,360
What is it?

668
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,360
GAMORA: It's called Knowhere.

669
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,400
The severed head
of an ancient celestial being.

670
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,560
Be wary headed in, rodent.

671
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,000
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

672
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,200
GAMORA: Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

673
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,960
to mine the organic matter
within the skull.

674
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,240
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

675
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,240
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

676
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,200
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

677
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,080
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

678
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,680
Billy the Kid,

679
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,000
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

680
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,480
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

681
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,600
Yeah, you should.

682
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,200
KID: Excuse me.

683
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,560
-Watch your wallets.
-Can you spare any units?

684
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,640
PETER: Get out of here.

685
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,000
Your buyer's in there?

686
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,280
We are to wait here
for his representative.

687
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,760
-BOUNCER: Get out of here!
-

688
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,240
This is no respectable establishment.

689
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,400
What do you expect us to do
while we wait?

690
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,320
Yes! Yes!

691
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,240
Whoa!

692
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,640
Yahoo!

693
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,440
My Orloni has won,

694
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,440
as I won at all things!

695
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,720
Now, let's put more of this liquid
into our bodies.

696
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,800
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

697
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,360
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

698
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,640
I might actually lose money on this job.

699
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,480
GAMORA:
My connection is making us wait.

700
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,800
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

701
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,080
Where yours is more,

702
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,080
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

703
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,640
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

704
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,840
Thanos?

705
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,120
He's not my father.

706
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,600
When Thanos took my home world,

707
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,160
he killed my parents in front of me.

708
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,480
He tortured me,

709
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,160
turned me into a weapon.

710
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,560
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

711
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
I couldn't stand by and...

712
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,560
Why would you risk your life for this?

713
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,560
-

714
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,320
My mother gave it to me.

715
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,120
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

716
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
I happened to have it on me,

717
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,440
when I was...

718
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,120
The day that she...

719
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,240
You know, when I left Earth.

720
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,360
GAMORA: What do you do with it?

721
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,200
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

722
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,880
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

723
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,320
Really?

724
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,600
On my planet,
there's a legend about people like you.

725
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,160
It's called

726
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,600
Footloose.

727
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,720
And in it, a great hero

728
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,320
named Kevin Bacon,

729
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,760
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

730
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,880
It's the greatest thing there is.

731
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,400
Who put the sticks up their butts?

732
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,920
What? No, that's just a...

733
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,880
-That is cruel.
-It's just a phrase

734
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,360
people use.

735
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,920
The melody is pleasant!

736
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,320
-No!
-Ow! What the hell?

737
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,720
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

738
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,240
And I am not some starry-eyed waif
here to succumb to your...

739
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,480
Your pelvic sorcery!

740
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,960
That is not what is happening here.

741
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,920
Oh, no.

742
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,560
Stop it!

743
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,880
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

744
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,480
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

745
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,560
-That is true!
-He has no respect!

746
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,000
-That is also true!
-Hold on! Hold on!

747
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,320
ROCKET: Keep calling me
vermin, tough guy!

748
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,480
You just wanna laugh at me
like everyone else!

749
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,280
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

750
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,000
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

751
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,320
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

752
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,720
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

753
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,800
and put back together, over and over

754
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,440
Some little monster!

755
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,480
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

756
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,680
He called me "vermin"!

757
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,520
She called me "rodent"!

758
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,920
Let's see if you can laugh

759
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

760
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,680
No, no, no, no!

761
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,960
Four billion units! Rocket!

762
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,280
Come on, man. Hey!

763
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,360
Suck it up for one more lousy night

764
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,960
and you're rich.

765
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,880
Fine.

766
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,840
But I can't promise, when all this is over

767
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,640
I'm not gonna kill
every last one of you jerks.

768
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,360
See? That's exactly why
none of you have any friends!

769
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,560
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

770
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,600
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

771
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,720
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

772
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,040
-Drax!
-Let him go.

773
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,560
We don't need him.

774
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,880
CARINA: Milady Gamora.

775
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,880
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

776
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,080
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

777
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,520
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

778
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,640
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

779
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,560
I present to you,

780
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,680
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

781
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,600
Oh, my dear Gamora.

782
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,760
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

783
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,560
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

784
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,520
We have what we discussed.

785
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,960
What is that thing there?

786
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,840
I am Groot.

787
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,640
TIVAN: I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

788
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,120
Sir...

789
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,080
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

790
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,120
At the moment of your death, of course.

791
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,640
I am Groot.

792
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,560
Why, so he could turn you
into a frickin' chair?

793
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,640
That's your pet?

794
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,640
-His what?
-Tivan.

795
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,920
We have been halfway
around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

796
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,120
Very well, then.

797
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,800
Let us see what you brought.

798
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,160
DISPATCHER: Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

799
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,760
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

800
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,920
Uh...

801
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,160
You shall send a message for me.

802
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,080
Oh, my new friends.

803
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,680
Before creation itself,

804
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,560
there were six singularities.

805
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,520
Then the universe exploded
into existence,

806
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,680
and the remnants of these systems

807
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,200
were forged into concentrated ingots.

808
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,200
-Infinity Stones.

809
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,920
These stones, it seems,

810
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,920
can only be brandished

811
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,640
by beings of extraordinary strength.

812
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,800
Observe.

813
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,800
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

814
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,520
like wheat in a field.

815
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,080
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

816
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,160
Once, for a moment,

817
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,520
a group was able to share
the energy amongst themselves,

818
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,600
but even they
were quickly destroyed by it.

819
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,520
Beautiful.

820
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,720
Beyond compare.

821
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,800
Blah, blah, blah.

822
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,600
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

823
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,840
TIVAN: How would you like to get paid?

824
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,000
ROCKET: What do you think,
fancy man? Units!

825
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,640
TIVAN: Very well, then.

826
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,600
Carina.

827
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,880
Stand back.

828
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,120
I will no longer be your slave!

829
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,800
No!

830
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,160
What the...

831
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,320
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

832
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,680
What do you still have it for?

833
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,000
PETER: What are we gonna do,
leave it in there?

834
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,000
I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

835
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,920
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

836
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,840
We have to bring this
to the Nova Corps.

837
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,800
There's a chance they can contain it.

838
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,880
ROCKET: Are you kidding me?

839
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,880
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

840
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,200
So he can destroy the galaxy?

841
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,160
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

842
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,280
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

843
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,160
Because I'm one of the idiots
who lives in it!

844
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,760
Peter, listen to me.

845
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,040
We cannot allow the Stone
to fall into Ronan's hands.

846
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,840
We have to go back to your ship,

847
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,360
and deliver it to Nova.

848
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,000
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

849
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,760
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

850
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,080
who's really nice

851
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,960
for a whole lot of money.

852
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,720
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

853
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
You're despicable.

854
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Dishonorable.

855
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,080
Faithless!

856
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,320
-Oh, no.
-DRAX: At last!

857
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,360
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

858
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,240
You called Ronan?

859
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,160
YONDU: Quill! Don't you move, boy!

860
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,400
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

861
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,840
Ronan the Accuser!

862
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,320
You are the one
who transmitted the message?

863
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,880
DRAX: You killed my wife.

864
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,680
You killed my daughter!

865
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,920
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

866
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,880
It is Gamora.
She is escaping with the Orb.

867
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,240
No!

868
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,320
RONAN: Nebula,

869
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,920
-retrieve the Orb.
-

870
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,280
NEBULA: The Stone
is in the furthest pod.

871
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,240
Bring it down!

872
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,280
Ah!

873
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,000
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

874
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,480
How? We've got
no weaponry on these things.

875
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,400
These pods are industrial grade.

876
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,840
They're nearly indestructible.

877
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,120
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

878
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,200
That's not what I'm saying.

879
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,480
Oh!

880
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,360
PETER: Let me borrow your ride.

881
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,080
I don't recall killing your family.

882
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,600
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

883
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,160
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

884
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,880
I have to head out.

885
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,240
Wait! These things
aren't meant to go out there.

886
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,200
You are a disappointment, sister.

887
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,960
Of all our siblings,

888
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,240
I hated you least.

889
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,000
GAMORA: Nebula, please.

890
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,640
If Ronan gets this stone

891
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,000
-he'll kill us all.
-NEBULA: Not all.

892
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,280
You will already be dead.

893
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,720
NEBULA: Ronan, it is done.

894
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,960
ROCKET: Quill, come on.

895
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,000
Her body mods should keep her alive
a couple more minutes,

896
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,160
but there's nothing we can do for her.

897
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,680
These pods
aren't meant to be out here.

898
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,320
In a second, we're gonna be
in the same boat.

899
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,200
Aw, damn it.

900
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,000
ROCKET: Quill?

901
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,720
Yondu! Yondu.

902
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,240
This is Quill!

903
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,760
-My coordinates are 227K324.
-ROCKET: Quill.

904
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,280
Quill, what are you doing?

905
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,760
Just outside Knowhere.

906
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,200
If you're there, come get me.

907
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,360
I'm all yours.

908
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,720
ROCKET: Quill, don't be ridiculous.

909
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,480
Get back into your pod!

910
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,080
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

911
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,120
You'll die in seconds!

912
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,480
Quill.

913
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,280
Quill?

914
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,400
What happened?

915
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,560
I saw you out there.

916
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,480
I don't know what came over me.

917
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,320
But I couldn't let you die.

918
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,520
I found something inside of myself.

919
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,200
Something

920
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,280
incredibly heroic.

921
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,520
I mean, not to brag,

922
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,880
-but, objectively...
-

923
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,200
Where's the Orb?

924
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,240
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

925
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,400
-What?
-

926
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,560
Welcome home, Peter.

927
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,280
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

928
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,760
Quill just got himself captured.

929
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,320
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

930
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,640
take on a frickin' army!

931
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,640
You're right.

932
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,480
I was a fool.

933
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,600
All the anger,

934
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,200
all the rage,

935
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,600
was just to cover my loss.

936
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:57,520
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
"My wife and child are dead."

937
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,320
Oh, I don't care if it's mean!

938
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,360
Everybody's got dead people.

939
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,600
It's no excuse to get everybody else

940
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,680
dead along the way!

941
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,280
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

942
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,600
The only chance we got is
to get to the other side of the universe

943
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,600
as fast as we can and maybe,

944
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,440
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

945
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,320
I am Groot.

946
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,640
Save them? How?

947
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,600
I am Groot.

948
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,440
I know they're the only friends
that we ever had,

949
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,320
but there's an army
of Ravagers around them.

950
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,960
And there's only two of us!

951
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,360
Three.

952
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,280
Aw!

953
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,640
You're making me

954
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,400
beat...up

955
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,560
grass!

956
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,760
RONAN: The Orb is in my possession,

957
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,480
as I promised.

958
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,000
Bring it to me.

959
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,600
Yes, that was our agreement.

960
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,920
Bring you the Orb,

961
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,680
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

962
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,480
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

963
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,600
I wonder what use I have for you.

964
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,360
Boy,

965
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,960
I would reconsider your current course.

966
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,480
Master! You cannot!

967
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,040
Thanos is the most powerful being
in the universe.

968
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,440
Not anymore.

969
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,520
You call me "boy!"

970
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,080
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice
on Xandar,

971
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,840
and burn it to its core!

972
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,920
Then, Thanos,

973
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,040
I am coming for you.

974
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,480
After Xandar,
you are going to kill my father?

975
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,720
You dare to oppose me?

976
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,680
You see what he has turned me into.

977
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,960
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

978
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,440
-YONDU: You betray me?
-

979
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,360
Steal my money?

980
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,920
Stop it! Leave him alone!

981
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,520
When I picked you up as a kid,

982
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,920
these boys wanted to eat you.

983
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,600
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

984
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,480
I saved your life!

985
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,680
Oh, will you shut up about that? God!

986
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,040
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

987
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,880
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

988
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,640
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

989
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,120
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

990
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,600
You abducted me, man.

991
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,800
You stole me from my home
and from my family.

992
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,000
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

993
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,640
You're scared

994
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,840
because you're soft in here.

995
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,960
Here, right here!

996
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,480
GAMORA: Yondu!

997
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,760
Listen to me.

998
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,040
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

999
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,960
I know what he's got, girl.

1000
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,560
Then you know we must get it back!

1001
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,000
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

1002
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,160
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

1003
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,920
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

1004
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
-Sentiment?
-

1005
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,480
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1006
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,160
No!

1007
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,840
Sorry, boy.

1008
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,560
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

1009
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,880
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

1010
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,960
If you kill me now,

1011
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,200
you are saying goodbye to
the biggest score you have ever seen.

1012
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,840
The Stone?

1013
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,600
I hope you got something
better than that.

1014
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,440
Because ain't nobody stealing
from Ronan.

1015
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,880
We got a ringer.

1016
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,520
Is that right?

1017
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,920
She knows everything
there is to know about Ronan.

1018
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,440
His ships,

1019
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,040
his army.

1020
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,040
He's vulnerable.

1021
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,120
Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh?

1022
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,840
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

1023
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,680
Let him go!

1024
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,880
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1025
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,760
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1026
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,000
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1027
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,480
ROCKET: Attention, idiots.

1028
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,200
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

1029
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,080
It's a weapon of my own design.

1030
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,560
What the hell?

1031
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,640
If you don't hand over
our companions now,

1032
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,040
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

1033
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,960
A very big new one!

1034
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,960
-I ain't buyin' it.
-I'm giving you to the count of five.

1035
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,720
-5, 4, 3...
-No! Wait, hold on!

1036
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,640
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1037
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,760
We figured it out! We're fine!

1038
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,120
ROCKET: Oh, hey, Quill.
What's going on?

1039
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,680
You call that "figured it out"?

1040
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,040
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

1041
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,680
Oh, you want to talk about senseless?

1042
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,040
How about trying to save us
by blowing us up?

1043
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,960
We were only gonna blow you up
if they didn't turn you over!

1044
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,880
And how on earth
were they gonna turn us over

1045
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,120
when you only gave them
a count of five?

1046
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,000
We didn't have time
to work out the minutiae

1047
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,120
of the plan.

1048
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,640
This is what we get
for acting altruistically.

1049
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,800
-I am Groot.
-They are ungrateful.

1050
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,000
What's important now

1051
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,840
is we get the Ravagers' army

1052
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,120
to help us save Xandar.

1053
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,760
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1054
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,320
who's just gonna sell
to somebody even worse?

1055
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,120
We'll figure that part out later.

1056
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,000
We have to stop Ronan.

1057
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,640
How?

1058
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,800
I have a plan.

1059
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,880
You've got a plan?

1060
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,320
Yes.

1061
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,000
First of all, you're copying me from

1062
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,600
-when I said I had a plan.
-No, I'm not.

1063
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,640
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1064
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,240
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

1065
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,320
I have part of a plan!

1066
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,040
What percentage of a plan
do you have?

1067
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,720
You don't get to ask questions

1068
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,000
after the nonsense
you pulled on Knowhere.

1069
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,080
I just saved Quill.

1070
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,160
We've already established

1071
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,960
that you destroying the ship
that I'm on is not saving me.

1072
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,160
-When did we establish it?
-Like three seconds ago!

1073
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,920
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

1074
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,120
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1075
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,040
What percentage?

1076
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,640
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1077
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,000
Twelve percent?

1078
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,120
That's a fake laugh.

1079
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,040
-It's real!
-Totally fake.

1080
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:45,800
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1081
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,960
because that is not a plan.

1082
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,600
It's barely a concept.

1083
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,720
You're taking their side?

1084
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,040
I am Groot.

1085
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,600
So what, it's better than 11%?

1086
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,120
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1087
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,360
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1088
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,320
See? Groot's the only one of you
who has a clue.

1089
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,360
Guys.

1090
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,280
Come on.

1091
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,640
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1092
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,080
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1093
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,360
I need your help.

1094
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,400
I look around at us.

1095
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,000
You know what I see?

1096
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,960
Losers.

1097
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,160
I mean, like,

1098
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,240
folks who have lost stuff.

1099
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,640
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1100
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,000
Our homes,

1101
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,080
our families,

1102
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,120
normal lives.

1103
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,040
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1104
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,320
Today, it's given us something.

1105
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,080
It has given us a chance.

1106
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,720
To do what?

1107
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,880
To give a shit.

1108
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,320
For once.

1109
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,680
Not run away.

1110
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,920
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

1111
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,120
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1112
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,840
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1113
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,920
it's impossible.

1114
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,760
You're asking us to die.

1115
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,240
Yeah, I guess I am.

1116
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,200
GAMORA: Quill.

1117
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,800
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1118
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,040
I will be grateful
to die among my friends.

1119
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,200
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1120
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,160
I will fight beside you.

1121
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,920
And in the end,

1122
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,920
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1123
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,000
I am Groot.

1124
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,480
Oh, what the hell.
I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1125
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,880
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1126
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,360
We're all standing up now.

1127
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,920
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1128
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,560
GAMORA: The Stone reacts
to anything organic.

1129
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,880
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1130
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,080
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

1131
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,920
All plants, animals,

1132
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,440
-Nova Corps.
-GAMORA: Everything will die.

1133
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,120
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1134
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,080
PETER: Rocket will lead a team
to blow a hole

1135
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,320
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1136
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,480
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1137
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,400
Won't there be
hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1138
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,360
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1139
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,520
Once they know we're on board,

1140
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,160
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1141
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,600
Which I can disable
by dismantling the power source.

1142
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,520
PETER: We'll make it to the flight deck,

1143
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,600
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer
to kill Ronan.

1144
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,280
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1145
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,960
Use these devices to contain it.

1146
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,600
If you touch it,

1147
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,840
it will kill you.

1148
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,440
PETER: I'll contact
one of the Nova officers

1149
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,880
-who arrested us.
-

1150
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,480
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

1151
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,280
There's one more thing
we need to complete the plan.

1152
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,280
That guy's eye.

1153
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,640
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1154
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,200
that guy's eye.

1155
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,960
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1156
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,240
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,

1157
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,440
and will arrive in T-minus

1158
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,280
fifteen minutes.

1159
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,120
Remember, boy.

1160
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,400
At the end of all this,

1161
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,960
I get the Stone.

1162
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,440
You cross me, we kill you all.

1163
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,400
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1164
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,240
This is a terrible plan.

1165
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,440
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1166
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,520
Nova Prime.

1167
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,320
I received a transmission

1168
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,640
from one of the Ravagers.

1169
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,960
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1170
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,360
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1171
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,600
Good God.

1172
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,720
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1173
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,360
NOVA PRIME: Did he say
why we should believe him?

1174
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,600
He said his crew
just escaped from prison

1175
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,720
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1176
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,720
He says that he's an

1177
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,960
"a-hole."

1178
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,400
But he's not,

1179
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,320
and I'm quoting him, here,

1180
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,600
"100% a dick."

1181
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,160
Do you believe him?

1182
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,960
I don't know that I believe anyone
is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1183
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,960
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1184
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,560
Yeah.

1185
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,200
A fleet approaches.

1186
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,240
They appear to be Ravagers.

1187
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,360
Fire!

1188
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,760
YONDU: Cover it down.

1189
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,080
Submerge!

1190
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,160
Rocket, hurry!

1191
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,760
All pilots, dive!

1192
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,200
They're beneath us!

1193
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,400
NOVA PRIME: Evacuate the city.

1194
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,120
Our priority is to get our people
away from the battle.

1195
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,160
Forward thrust, now!

1196
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,600
Come on!

1197
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,840
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1198
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,680
YONDU: Aw, hell!

1199
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,360
-I'm going down, Quill!
-

1200
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,280
No more games with me, boy!

1201
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,440
I'll see you

1202
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,360
at the end of this!

1203
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,120
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1204
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,520
We'll never make it up there!

1205
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,640
SAAL: Peter Quill.

1206
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,280
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1207
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,640
For the record,
I advised against trusting you here.

1208
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,240
They got my "dick" message!

1209
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,720
Prove me wrong.

1210
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,440
Yes!

1211
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,840
-

1212
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,600
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1213
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,320
The starboard kern has been breached!

1214
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,680
We have been boarded.

1215
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,280
Continue our approach.

1216
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,640
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1217
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,480
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1218
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,600
Seal security doors!

1219
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
Now!

1220
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,800
NEBULA: Get out of my way!

1221
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,640
Oh, man.

1222
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,280
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1223
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,280
The Dark Aster
must not reach the ground.

1224
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,840
NOVA CORPS PILOT 1: Locked in!

1225
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,840
NOVA CORPS PILOT 2: Locked in.

1226
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,480
We're locked in.

1227
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,880
I can barely see.

1228
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,960
When did you learn to do that?

1229
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,680
Pretty sure the answer is

1230
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,480
"I am Groot."

1231
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,040
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1232
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,760
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1233
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,520
It is pleasing to once again have

1234
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,040
friends.

1235
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,000
You, Quill, are my friend.

1236
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,400
Thanks.

1237
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,360
-This dumb tree, he is my friend.
-GROOT: Mmm.

1238
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,920
And this green whore, she, too...

1239
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,640
Oh, you must stop!

1240
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,360
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1241
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,920
You have always been weak.

1242
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,440
You stupid, traitorous...

1243
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,840
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1244
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,000
Head to the flight deck.

1245
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,840
I'll shut down the power
to the security doors.

1246
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,680
GUARD: Yondu Udonta.

1247
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,440
Order your men
to turn on the Nova Corps.

1248
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,640
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1249
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,640
-Time to die...
-

1250
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,680
-

1251
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,440
Nebula, please.

1252
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,680
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1253
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,840
enact immolation initiative.

1254
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,840
STARBLASTER PILOT:
They're dive-bombing the city!

1255
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,760
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1256
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,600
No! Hold your positions.

1257
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,680
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1258
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,480
We'll take care of the people
down here.

1259
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,720
I can't believe
I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1260
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,080
Star-Lord.

1261
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,640
Finally.

1262
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,280
Ah!

1263
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,600
-You thief!
-

1264
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,200
You will never make it to Ronan.

1265
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,200
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1266
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,200
Come on!

1267
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:18,680
Finger to the throat means death.

1268
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,840
Metaphor.

1269
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,200
Yeah, sorta.

1270
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,680
Oh, no.

1271
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,000
RONAN: Xandar!

1272
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,240
You stand accused.

1273
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:05,120
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1274
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,400
save you now.

1275
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,200
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1276
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:35,880
Rocket!

1277
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,840
Hold on, Saal, just...

1278
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,800
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1279
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,440
The city's been evacuated,

1280
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,200
but we're getting our asses
kicked down here.

1281
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,800
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1282
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,400
GAMORA: Nebula!

1283
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,480
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1284
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,200
You know he's crazy.

1285
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,840
I know you're both crazy.

1286
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,080
No!

1287
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
-What the...?
-Ah!

1288
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,840
-NEBULA: Get out!
-

1289
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,160
You did it!

1290
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,000
I was mistaken.

1291
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,560
I do remember your family.

1292
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,080
Their screams were

1293
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,280
-pitiful. I...
-

1294
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,520
No, Groot!

1295
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,280
You can't.

1296
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,680
You'll die.

1297
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,240
Why are you doing this?

1298
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:15,960
Why?

1299
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,080
We

1300
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,480
are

1301
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,560
Groot.

1302
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,120
I called him an idiot.

1303
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,640
You killed Groot!

1304
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,240
Behold!

1305
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:08,520
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1306
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,160
What fruit have they wrought?

1307
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:15,320
Only that my father and his father

1308
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,840
shall finally know vengeance.

1309
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,360
People of Xandar,

1310
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,680
the time has come

1311
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,680
to rejoice and renounce

1312
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,160
your paltry gods!

1313
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,280
Your salvation is at hand.

1314
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,520
Listen to these words.

1315
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,320
Now bring it down hard!

1316
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,720
What are you doing?

1317
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,760
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1318
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:10,640
Gamora.

1319
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,720
Subtle. Take it back.

1320
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,440
What are you doing?

1321
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,120
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1322
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,720
No!

1323
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,840
Peter! Take my hand!

1324
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,400
Take my hand, Peter.

1325
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,680
Mom.

1326
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,280
GAMORA: Take my hand!

1327
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,640
You're mortal!

1328
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,000
How?

1329
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,480
You said it yourself, bitch.

1330
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,840
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1331
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,920
YONDU: Well, well, well.

1332
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,640
Quite the light show.

1333
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,600
Ain't this sweet.

1334
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,640
But you got some business to attend to

1335
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,320
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1336
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:16,040
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1337
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,400
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1338
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:20,440
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1339
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,440
but the only way
the universe can survive

1340
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,320
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1341
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,320
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1342
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,400
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1343
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,600
Hand it over, son.

1344
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:52,480
Yondu.

1345
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,760
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1346
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:01,840
You've seen what it does to people.

1347
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:14,840
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1348
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,480
It's probably good
we didn't deliver him to his dad

1349
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,560
like we was hired to do.

1350
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,440
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1351
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,720
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1352
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,440
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1353
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,160
Oh, I know.

1354
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,720
But he was about the only family I had.

1355
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:45,680
No.

1356
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:48,080
He wasn't.

1357
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,720
PETER: Why would you
even know this?

1358
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,800
DEY: When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1359
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,200
so we had it checked out.

1360
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,160
I'm not Terran?

1361
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,880
NOVA PRIME: You are half Terran.

1362
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:50,720
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1363
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,520
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1364
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:55,880
That could be why you were able

1365
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,240
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1366
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,160
-Your friends have arrived.

1367
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,480
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1368
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,480
we'd like to express
our profound gratitude

1369
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,920
for your help in saving Xandar.

1370
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,560
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1371
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,160
he has something to show you.

1372
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,080
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1373
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:31,160
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1374
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:32,920
Yes.

1375
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,960
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1376
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,920
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1377
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,280
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1378
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,920
We salvaged as much as we could.

1379
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,280
Wow.

1380
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I...

1381
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,120
Thank you.

1382
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,280
I have a family.

1383
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,280
They're alive because of you.

1384
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,280
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1385
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:09,640
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1386
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,120
ROCKET: Question.

1387
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,560
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1388
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,880
and it belongs to someone else?

1389
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,200
DEY: You will be arrested.

1390
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,640
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1391
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
-It's still illegal.
-That doesn't follow.

1392
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,160
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

1393
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,960
What are you laughing at?

1394
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,680
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1395
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,640
What if someone
does something irksome

1396
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,880
and I decide to remove his spine?

1397
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,640
That's...

1398
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,920
That's actually murder.

1399
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:39,160
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1400
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:42,160
So...also illegal.

1401
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,040
Hmm.

1402
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,880
They'll be fine, Dey.

1403
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,800
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1404
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:49,920
You?

1405
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,240
Yeah. Me.

1406
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:16,880
MEREDITH: Peter,

1407
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,840
I know these last few months
have been hard for you.

1408
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,720
But I'm going to a better place.

1409
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,200
And I will be okay.

1410
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:31,120
And I will always be with you.

1411
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,640
You are the light of my life.

1412
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,960
My precious son.

1413
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:41,880
My little Star-Lord.

1414
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:44,640
Love, Mom.

1415
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,840
-

1416
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:46,840
PETER: So, what should we do next?

1417
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,080
Something good?

1418
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,200
Something bad?

1419
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:52,360
A bit of both?

1420
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:57,000
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1421
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,200
Bit of both.

1422
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,800
HOWARD: What do you let it
lick you like that for?

1423
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,720
Gross.

1424
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,320
Yeah!

1425
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:36,240
But it burns going down.
