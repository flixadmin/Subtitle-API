00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,704
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,240
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:10,175
by something impossible.
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,212
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:17,649
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,052
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,221
But secretly I use my speed

9
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,790
to fight crime
and find others like me.

10
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,559
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,361
and get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,698
I am... The Flash.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,733
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

14
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,468
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,637
But you really did see something
that night your mom died

16
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,372
and your dad <i>is</i> innocent.

17
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,709
The explosion that put you
in a coma also killed my fiance.

18
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,877
Can you imagine if
you could control his power?

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,246
If you could harness it,

20
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,715
you could change
what it means to be human.

21
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,416
He's called the Flash.

22
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,853
Or, at least,
he will be one day.

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,890
He must be kept safe.

24
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,264
It doesn't matter
if you're the slowest kid

25
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,566
in gym class
or the fastest man alive.

26
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,370
Every one of us is running.

27
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,638
Being alive means running...

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,239
running from something,

29
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,741
running to something

30
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,743
or someone.

31
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,745
And no matter how fast you are,

32
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,747
there's some things
you can't outrun.

33
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,717
Some things always manage
to catch up to you.

34
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,420
Regular movie scale,
that was a seven or an eight.

35
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,556
Zombie movie scale,
it was, like, a four, tops.

36
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,292
There's a zombie movie scale?

37
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,694
Did you know that zombies
exist in nature?

38
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,630
There's a species of fungi
that infects ants,

39
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,599
causing the ants
to attack plants

40
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,968
that can release spores
which in turn infect new hosts.

41
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,403
I'm going full nerd again,
aren't I?

42
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,537
- Yep.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,972
Yeah.
It's okay though.

44
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,074
You are still the cutest nerd
that I know.

45
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,809
Anyways,
I'm a lot more interested

46
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,377
in the amazing as of late.

47
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,313
You mean 'cause of
this "Streak" thing?

48
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,148
He's out there.
People are talking about him.

49
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,416
How do you even know
he's a he?

50
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,450
Maybe it's a she.

51
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,185
It's a man, okay?

52
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,454
You know I am really intuitive
about this kind of stuff.

53
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,822
Someone even posted a picture

54
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,424
after being yanked
from a car accident.

55
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,125
It's a red blur
leaving the scene.

56
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,594
Here, what do you see?

57
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,299
I see
your boyfriend's calling.

58
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,701
Oh,
I should probably get this.

59
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,369
I'm crashing at his place
tonight,

60
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,338
and he's supposed to leave
a key for me somewhere.

61
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,039
Hey, babe.
What's up?

62
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,508
Not much,
just hanging out with Barry.

63
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,509
You off yet?

64
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,613
Hello.

65
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,882
Code 237 on Waid boulevard.

66
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,684
Public indecency?

67
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,419
Wait, I think I meant a 239.

68
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,355
Dog leash violation?

69
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,990
Bad man with a gun
in a getaway car.

70
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,692
Go.

71
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,362
You don't have a mat.
Do you have a planter?

72
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,708
He's got a gun.
Look out!

73
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:03,949
Where'd he go?

74
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,822
What the...

75
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,057
Key's in the mailbox.

76
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,726
I'll see you later.
Bye.

77
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,561
Eddie says hi.
Nice of him.

78
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,896
You wanna grab a bite?

79
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,698
I'm feeling a little famished.

80
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,867
After the Mongolian barbecue
we had before the movie

81
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,735
and the extra large popcorn
you had at the movie?

82
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,071
How are you not fat?

83
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:29,174
I've been jogging.

84
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,409
Oh, okay.

85
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,115
Why so public a meeting,
uncle?

86
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,519
We're dining out to show
our enemies we're not afraid.

87
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,187
Relax, nephew.

88
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,424
We've replaced the windows
with bulletproof glass.

89
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,691
Close it up.

90
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,692
Come.

91
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,927
Have a drink.

92
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:04,910
Our own drivers
are ripping us off.

93
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,612
Someone is paying them

94
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,415
to steal from us.

95
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,953
None of you will sleep
until we find out who.

96
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,155
And then those thieves...

97
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,925
those thieves...

98
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,328
will draw

99
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,629
their last breath.

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,734
Uncle!

101
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,754
- Where'd you cut him off?
- So we cut him off at eighth.

102
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,723
I mean, the perp was in
the backseat of the cruiser

103
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,091
Before he even knew
what happened.

104
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,259
Congratulations, Paulson,

105
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,727
On that arrest last night.

106
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,395
Hell of a job.
You come by later, Joe.

107
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,098
I'll give you a driving lesson,
okay?

108
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,200
Wasn't even him last night.
It was me.

109
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,335
I figured.

110
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,636
I just didn't realize

111
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,238
You were helping people
for the glory.

112
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,907
It's not like I want a museum
built in my name.

113
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,543
Keeping what I can do a secret
from Iris and everyone,

114
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:12,878
It's harder than I thought.

115
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,746
I know,
but it is safer that way.

116
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,582
Besides, me and you
got work to do.

117
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,187
The evidence
from my mom's case.

118
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,889
I had it brought up
from storage.

119
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,790
I've been through this box
1,000 times.

120
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,561
Before, your story about what
really happened that night...

121
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,530
The lightning storm,
the man in the middle of it...

122
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,964
I thought that was a kid

123
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,699
Trying to protect his father
from prison.

124
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,301
But now that I know it's true,

125
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,137
We're gonna go through
every scrap of evidence

126
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,739
Until we find something
that helps us.

127
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,741
It took the jury 52 minutes
to come back

128
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,009
With a verdict of guilty.

129
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,044
They moved too fast,

130
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,913
Which is why we got to
take our time.

131
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,584
Barry, Joe,
we got multiple homicides.

132
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,120
Do you know
the Darbinyan crime family?

133
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,629
Barry?

134
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,765
Ah.
Anything?

135
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,267
Signs of histotoxic hypoxia.

136
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,237
The cells in their bodies
were unable to utilize oxygen.

137
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,639
It's consistent with exposure
to poison gas.

138
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,041
What kind of poison?

139
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,409
I'll need to take
a lung sample,

140
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,144
See if I can narrow it down.

141
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:22,581
The only other exit was bolted
from the inside.

142
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,215
They were trapped.

143
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,651
I was thinking someone
pumped gas in from the outside,

144
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,087
But witnesses say
the street was empty.

145
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,722
So it was from the inside.

146
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,390
That means there should be
a canister

147
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,426
Or a container left behind.

148
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,628
The gas just didn't
come in by itself.

149
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,797
Unless it had
a mind of its own.

150
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,970
Eddie, would you mind
canvassing again?

151
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,639
Somebody had to have seen
something suspicious.

152
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,643
Okay, explain.

153
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,245
The boss collapsed
by the table.

154
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,114
This guy made it 10 feet away.

155
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,582
That guy had a chance
to move off

156
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,984
And fire three shots
into the window

157
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,385
Trying to break the glass.

158
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,587
But they all started
in the same spot,

159
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,789
Which means they should have
all been affected by the gas

160
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,491
At the same time, but instead,
it's as if...

161
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,327
They were attacked one by one.

162
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,764
My gut feeling,
if we're gonna solve this one,

163
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,499
You and me are gonna need...

164
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:18,036
Backup.
Yeah.

165
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,705
Fascinating, a meta-human
that can manipulate poison gas.

166
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,107
Is it just poisonous gas,

167
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,808
Or can he control
all aerated substances?

168
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,944
And how is he able
to formulate the connection?

169
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,846
Is it physiological
or psychological?

170
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,280
This individual can create

171
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,949
A mental nexus
using gaseous substances.

172
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,951
You mean connect with gases
on a molecular level?

173
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,419
- Yes.
- That is ridiculously cool.

174
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,121
They get really excited
about this stuff.

175
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,455
The only thing
I'm excited about

176
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,257
Is putting criminals
behind bars.

177
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,860
Except Iron Heights
isn't exactly equipped

178
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,428
To handle meta-humans.

179
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,096
Then I guess it's fortunate
the ones

180
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,631
You've encountered so far
are no longer with us.

181
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,600
Well, unless we're planning
on executing

182
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,869
Every super criminal we stop,

183
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,470
You geniuses are gonna have to
come up

184
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,372
With someplace else
to hold them.

185
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,275
A meta-human prison.
Sweet.

186
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,111
Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

187
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:04,749
There is one place here
that might hold them.

188
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,217
You can't be serious.

189
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,853
I mean, we haven't been
down there since...

190
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,188
It's cordoned off.

191
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,189
Cisco is right.

192
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,190
It could be modified to act

193
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,358
As a makeshift prison.

194
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,427
What could?

195
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,128
The particle accelerator.

196
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,736
Tonight, the future begins.

197
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,005
The work my team and I
will do here

198
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,507
Will change our understanding
of physics,

199
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,710
will bring about
advancements in power,

200
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,945
advancements in medicine.

201
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,780
And trust me, that future

202
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,516
will be here faster
than you think.

203
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,852
Dr. Wells, we just got
the latest weather report.

204
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,321
A big thunderstorm
is rolling in.

205
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,856
We're not launching
a space shuttle.

206
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,593
We'll be fine.

207
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,095
Tahiti?

208
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,730
I know it's a long flight,
Ronnie,

209
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,665
But we can binge watch
<i>orange is the new black.</i>

210
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,899
Oh, okay.

211
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,735
But what about Italy?

212
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:00,705
Pizza and wine and more pizza.

213
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,408
Yes, but Italy
doesn't have Mai Tais,

214
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,110
And a honeymoon
isn't a honeymoon

215
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,845
Without Mai Tais.

216
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,780
Dr. Wells,
the accelerator is primed

217
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,348
And ready
for particle injection.

218
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,219
Well, I feel I should
say something profound

219
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,890
Like "one small step for man,"

220
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,126
But all I can think of
to say is,

221
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,461
I feel like I've waited
for this day for centuries.

222
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,174
That's it?

223
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,510
You'd think there'd be, like,
a loud bang.

224
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,578
If there was a loud bang,
we'd all be in big trouble.

225
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,614
Take it from the guy
who helped build it.

226
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,950
Ladies and gentlemen,
we did it.

227
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,924
Mai Tais it is.

228
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,909
Was that...

229
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,846
A loud bang.

230
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,849
Caitlin.

231
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,184
Caitlin.

232
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,819
Did you hear me?

233
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,755
We're going down
to the accelerator ring.

234
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,957
Actually, Dr. Wells,
I could use Caitlin's help

235
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,793
identifying the poison gas.

236
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,263
Okay.

237
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,665
If that's okay with you?

238
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,201
Let's go.

239
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,811
Welcome to the CCPD.

240
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,046
So this is your day job.

241
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,447
Mm-hmm.

242
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,682
I'm gonna rip out your hearts

243
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,217
and eat 'em for lunch.

244
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,651
Delightful.

245
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,955
Lab rat, I need prints
off this gun pronto.

246
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,790
Allen!

247
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,959
Where the hell is the fiber
analysis on the Orloff case?

248
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,494
Upstairs.
It's all finished.

249
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,029
I can just run up
and bring it down.

250
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,764
With you, that could be
three days from now.

251
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,399
I'll go with you.
Who are you?

252
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,268
Dr. Caitlin Snow,

253
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,170
Barry's personal physician.

254
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,276
The fiber analysis
for the Orloff case,

255
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,844
Like you asked for,

256
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,779
Sir.

257
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,450
Clean up your lab.

258
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,951
It's a mess.

259
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,726
The lightning
was in the house.

260
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,994
I told my son to run,

261
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,862
He disappeared,

262
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,431
And that's when
I saw the blood.

263
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,066
Your prints were
on the murder weapon.

264
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,702
I needed
to stabilize the knife.

265
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,437
I'm a doctor.

266
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,207
I was trying to save her.

267
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,508
I didn't kill my wife.

268
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,278
Joe, tell them.

269
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,113
You know me.
Our kids are friends.

270
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,648
You tell them, Joe.

271
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,719
Do I even want to know
what you were looking at?

272
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,454
It's just work.

273
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,158
Some old cases
weren't filed properly.

274
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,969
Detective.
What are you doing here?

275
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,504
Joe, I thought
you were at the morgue.

276
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,674
I decided
to bring some work home.

277
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,409
Why are you here?

278
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,813
Yes, well,
I've been looking for you.

279
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,815
I thought maybe we could
go back to the crime scene,

280
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,818
Re-canvass,
see if we missed anything.

281
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,253
Always work the case, right?

282
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,788
That's what you taught me.

283
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,123
Wow, you've been listening.

284
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,992
Okay, let's hit it.

285
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,927
You mind
if I use your bathroom?

286
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,462
It's the first door
on the right.

287
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,664
I'll be in the car.

288
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,166
Bye, baby.

289
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,567
Bye, dad.

290
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,673
Okay, this has got to stop.

291
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,342
I came here
to surprise my girlfriend,

292
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,844
And now I'm going
to a crime scene with her dad...

293
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,679
Not exactly the afternoon
I was planning on.

294
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,014
I know, I know, it's just...

295
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,382
It's not the right time
to tell him.

296
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,751
When is, Iris?

297
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,287
I know my dad.
He'll kill us.

298
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,191
Right now, you're killing us.

299
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,340
The copper in the tube
is arranged to form cavities,

300
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,878
And we can use those cavities
as containment cells.

301
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,915
Of course, we'll have to
design them to counteract

302
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,752
Meta-human abilities, but...

303
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,887
Might just work.

304
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,989
First, we have to decouple
the main injection system

305
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,990
On the gantry level.

306
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,225
I'll be right back.

307
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,960
Why don't I do that?

308
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,628
I need the exercise.

309
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,405
There's an anomaly
in the core chamber.

310
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,306
The ring's
structural integrity is holding.

311
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,875
It's started a chain reaction.

312
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,810
The system is collapsing.
We need to shut it down.

313
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,278
We can't ramp down
the accelerator from here.

314
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,613
We need to do it manually.
Go.

315
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,814
- I'll come with.
- Ronnie, no.

316
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,282
I'm the lead engineer.

317
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,917
I know how to operate
the shutdown valve.

318
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,953
- It's not safe.
- Cait, I have to go.

319
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,097
Okay, you stay here.

320
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,199
We've only got a few minutes
before this thing blows,

321
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,435
And if I'm not back in time,
you need to initiate lockdown.

322
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,236
No way.
I am not closing this door.

323
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,738
I won't be able
to open it again.

324
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,306
Cisco, if you don't seal off
the blast,

325
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,808
Everyone in this building
will die,

326
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,243
Including Caitlin.

327
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,711
Okay, now promise me.

328
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,316
Set your watch.

329
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,384
Two minutes.

330
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,957
You're coming back.

331
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,348
Cisco.

332
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,250
Cisco, we're ready to go.

333
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:27,592
Must be hard,
coming back down here.

334
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,594
A lot happened that night.

335
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,828
If you feel the need to talk...

336
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,763
I was just thinking,

337
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,032
We need to nail
those voltage calculations.

338
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,101
One fault,
and the helium blowback

339
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,971
Could damage the mountings.

340
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,939
Smart.

341
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,481
Can I ask you something

342
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,049
That you don't have to answer?

343
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,218
My least favorite
kind of question.

344
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,420
Shoot.

345
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,192
Ronnie.
What was he like?

346
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:05,329
You just never talk about him
that much.

347
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,366
We met when we were working
on the particle accelerator.

348
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,768
He was the structural engineer.

349
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,236
He liked to joke
that he was basically

350
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,338
A very high-priced plumber.

351
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,744
We were very different.

352
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,246
You might have noticed
I can be a bit...

353
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,015
Guarded.

354
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,117
Ronnie knew how
to make me laugh.

355
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:30,154
He used to say we were
like fire and ice.

356
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:37,161
He wasn't supposed to be there
that night.

357
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,530
He was just there for me.

358
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,765
If he hadn't...

359
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,839
This says that there was
no residue of gas in the tissue,

360
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,741
Poisonous or otherwise.

361
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,944
It must have evaporated.

362
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,245
We'll need to get
a fresh sample.

363
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,247
Wait, this can't be right.

364
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,217
This says that there are
two distinct strands of DNA

365
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,619
Inside the tissue.

366
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,322
How did someone else's DNA
get inside the victim's lungs?

367
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,828
Well, my docket was clear,
so I stopped by the mall

368
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,331
To pick up
your homecoming dress.

369
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,766
I <i>am</i> a great mom.

370
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,835
I'll see you for dinner,
sweetie.

371
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,009
There's no DNA match
in the database.

372
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,277
I don't understand.

373
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,079
Why would a chemical attack

374
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:32,617
Leave behind another person's
DNA inside the victim?

375
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,285
What if the meta-human
we're looking for

376
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,454
Doesn't control gas?

377
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,623
What if he becomes it?

378
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,937
Judge Howard.

379
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,640
It's nice to see you again.

380
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,174
You died.

381
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,311
You say that like
it was an accident.

382
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,013
You remember the last thing
you said to me

383
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,648
In the courtroom?

384
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,985
May god have mercy
on <i>your</i> soul.

385
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,199
All available units,
we have a report

386
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,534
Of a toxic gas attack

387
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,902
In the Central City
shopping mall.

388
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,038
Barry, don't.

389
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,541
We don't know enough
about what we're facing yet.

390
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,742
It's not safe.

391
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,278
Caitlin, I have to go.

392
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,228
I patched into
the mall's security system.

393
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,830
According to witnesses,
the gas attack

394
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,865
Was in the main elevator
in the north wing.

395
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,200
Which one is the north wing?

396
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,837
The one
with the big belly burger.

397
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,739
I eat.

398
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,175
Back up.
Please, keep back.

399
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,962
Why did you kill that woman?

400
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,571
She deserved to die.

401
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,973
Now go run away.

402
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,343
I still have one more name
on my list.

403
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,480
Don't make me add you to it.

404
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,637
Barry.

405
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,339
Barry, can you hear me?

406
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,274
His vitals are weak,
but he's alive, Dr. Wells.

407
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,576
I'm sure he's fine.

408
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,479
I can't breathe.

409
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,549
He needs oxygen.
Get the crash cart!

410
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,488
Barry!

411
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,323
Barry.
Cut me open.

412
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,626
The poison's still in me.
He brought us a sample.

413
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,895
Caitlin, we need to do
a pulmonary biopsy,

414
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,430
Extract an active portion
of that gas.

415
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,931
I can't give you
any anesthetic.

416
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,666
Your metabolism will burn
right through it.

417
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,635
I heal quick, remember?

418
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,903
Do it.

419
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,070
Cisco, give me the syringe.

420
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,239
This is gonna hurt a lot.

421
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,341
It's a small needle.
You probably won't even feel it.

422
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,677
You're definitely
going to feel it.

423
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,223
The Streak lives.

424
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,558
You'd be dead
if your lung cells

425
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,059
Didn't regenerate so quickly.

426
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,961
My chest feels like
that one time

427
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,564
I had a cigarette.

428
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,365
Yeah, teen me lived for danger.

429
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,733
This isn't funny.
You could've...

430
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,869
I didn't.

431
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:15,039
Now that we have a sample,
we'll get to work analyzing it,

432
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,540
Figure out the makeup
of the poison,

433
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,676
Maybe get a clue as to
his human identity.

434
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,912
Or at least a way to stop him
from turning into a mist.

435
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,849
The mist.
Okay, that's his name.

436
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,183
End of discussion.

437
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,551
I have to get to the station.

438
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,186
You should be resting.

439
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,722
I have to talk to Joe.

440
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,227
Joe.
I had him.

441
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:37,862
The meta-human.
We were wrong.

442
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,731
He's not controlling
airborne toxins.

443
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,534
He can literally transform
himself into poison gas.

444
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,470
That's new.

445
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,138
The victim was a judge.

446
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,740
We're going through
some of her old cases

447
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,008
To see if there's a connection.

448
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,310
It's too late.

449
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,745
I should have been faster.

450
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,347
Focus on the job.

451
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,016
Don't think about that
right now.

452
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,452
You don't want to know
what I'm thinking about.

453
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,527
My dad has spent 14 years

454
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:14,398
In a 6x8-foot cell
for a crime he didn't commit.

455
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,700
I couldn't save my mom,
but I can save him.

456
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,302
Didn't I promise you

457
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,971
That we would get your father
out of prison together?

458
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:24,408
I don't need your help, Joe.

459
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,976
I could be in and out of there
with him

460
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:29,647
Before anyone even sees me.

461
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,615
Okay.

462
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,552
You break him out of there.

463
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:37,054
Then what?

464
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,057
He's on the run
for the rest of his life.

465
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,259
And something tell me
he's not as fast as you are.

466
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,727
You don't know
what it's like there.

467
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,296
You think I don't understand

468
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,197
What you're feeling?

469
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,466
I have been a cop
for almost as long

470
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,368
As you've been alive.

471
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,037
So you should know,
putting on that suit

472
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,139
Does not make everybody safe.

473
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,640
For every person you save,

474
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,309
There's gonna be somebody
you can't.

475
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,144
And the hardest thing
you're gonna have to face

476
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,179
Is not some monster out there
with powers.

477
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,648
It's gonna be that feeling
of uselessness

478
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,785
When you can't do anything.

479
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,661
Or the guilt that weighs on you
when you make a mistake.

480
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:28,105
Some things, Barry,
you can't fight.

481
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:32,676
Some things
you just have to live with.

482
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,896
Yes, I'm writing this down.

483
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,765
Red Streak at the mall

484
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,934
During the gas attack.

485
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,204
Thank you for calling.

486
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,905
Never fails.

487
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,008
Tip lines bring out
the potheads and the crazies.

488
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,076
Did they get a good look
at the Streak's face?

489
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,780
Not you too.

490
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,983
What are you doing here anyway?

491
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,386
We need to talk.

492
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,822
I thought about what you said,
and...

493
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,891
I know what you're gonna say.

494
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,126
I understand.

495
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm your dad's partner.

496
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,796
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

497
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,667
I have never really had
a serious boyfriend.

498
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,102
Between dad and Barry and work,

499
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,737
My life has been full.

500
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:37,074
And I really like you,

501
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,176
But I thought that if I told
my dad about us,

502
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,011
Then it would make this real,

503
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,814
And suddenly, it's something
that I could lose

504
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,618
Or screw up.

505
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,054
I wanted it to be real.

506
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,355
Eddie.

507
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,651
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,386
I didn't mean to scare you,
leaving like that.

509
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,888
It's okay.
I get it.

510
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,525
You had to go.

511
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,528
It's just...

512
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,031
That's the last thing that
Ronnie said to me that night.

513
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,807
My mother died 14 years ago.

514
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,979
I used to think that
the further away I got from it,

515
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:53,484
The less it would hurt.

516
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:56,954
But some days, the pain,

517
00:25:56,956 --> 00:26:01,291
It's worse than the day
that it happened.

518
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,193
Some things you can't fight.

519
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,566
For so long,

520
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,737
I've been terrified
of going into that hole.

521
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,039
What if I went with you?

522
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,791
Where's Ronnie?
Cisco, where is he?

523
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:35,959
- He's still inside.
- What? Open the door.

524
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,795
I can't.
We're in lockdown mode.

525
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,797
Cisco, we have to get him
out of there or he'll die.

526
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,366
- Cisco, can you hear me?
- Ronnie, it's me.

527
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,971
Caitlin.

528
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,276
Is Cisco there?

529
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,211
Yeah, Ronnie, I'm here.
I'm listening.

530
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,480
I adjusted the magnets
to redirect the beam

531
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,881
To try and vent the system

532
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,917
So the blast goes up
and not out.

533
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,885
I'll need to reset
the particle parameters

534
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,921
To compensate.

535
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:06,290
Cisco's doing it.

536
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,858
There has to be another way
out of there.

537
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,128
You have to find it.

538
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,097
Cait, the chain reaction,

539
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,133
I can't reverse it.

540
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:21,371
The doors need to stay shut
to protect you.

541
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,639
You still there?

542
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,941
I'm here.

543
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,949
Caitlin, whatever happens...

544
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:32,950
Ronnie.

545
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,453
Ronnie!

546
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,863
He saved so many lives
that day,

547
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,432
And no one will ever know
what he did.

548
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,840
I do.

549
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,444
He was a hero.

550
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,847
I didn't want him
to be a hero.

551
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,849
I wanted him to be my husband.

552
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,757
Barry, Caitlin,
you down there?

553
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,659
You got to come look at this.

554
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,231
Hey, check this out.

555
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,900
It's a 3D molecular model
of the gas

556
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:26,136
we retrieved from your lungs.

557
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,898
We have identified the toxin.

558
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,740
Hydrogen cyanide?

559
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:32,509
What's interesting
is what's mixed in

560
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:36,246
With the cyanide...
a sedative.

561
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,081
Of course.

562
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,717
The night of the explosion,
find out if anyone was executed.

563
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,252
Why?

564
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,187
That sedative is given
to criminals on death row

565
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,489
Before they go
to the gas chamber

566
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:46,757
And breathe in hydrogen cyanide.

567
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,025
That's right.

568
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,426
There was someone executed.

569
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:50,994
- Kyle Nimbus.
- That's him.

570
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,530
He was a hit man
for the Darbinyan crime family.

571
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,399
They turned on him
and testified.

572
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,268
Judge Theresa Howard
was the judge at his trial.

573
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,336
She sentenced him to death.

574
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:00,704
He must have been affected

575
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,839
By the explosion
while he was being gassed.

576
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,108
Records indicate
the execution was completed.

577
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,677
That's why
there wasn't a match.

578
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,512
The DNA database only has
records of the living.

579
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,113
Right.

580
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,915
He said there was
one more person on his list.

581
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,850
Check the arrest record.
Who caught him?

582
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,485
That could be his next attack.

583
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,822
Barry, the lead Detective...

584
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,731
Here to see Henry Allen.

585
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,066
Sign here.

586
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,467
Personal effects here.

587
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,155
- Eddie.
- Barry, what's up?

588
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,557
Hey, do you know
where Joe went?

589
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,825
He's not picking up his cell.

590
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:56,760
Uh, not sure.

591
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,562
Eddie, it's really important
I speak to him.

592
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:01,098
I need to know where he went.

593
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,901
He went to Iron Heights
to see your dad.

594
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,671
Barry.

595
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:10,007
I reverse-engineered
an antidote to the toxin.

596
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,775
I hope you won't need it.

597
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:34,264
What are you doing here?
Is Barry all right?

598
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,799
He's fine.

599
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,705
Then to what
do I owe this visit?

600
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,408
I know I should have
come to see you sooner.

601
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,743
You just weren't up
for a little chitchat

602
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:50,047
With a man who murdered his wife
in front of his own son?

603
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,350
Except now I know
you didn't kill your wife.

604
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,225
Barry, I pulled up the specs
on Iron Heights prison.

605
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,894
It's maximum security,

606
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,997
But I think I can talk you
through breaking in there.

607
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:07,998
Don't bother.

608
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,999
I've been figuring out

609
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,067
How to break into that place

610
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,902
Since I was 11.

611
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:14,905
Some new evidence
has come to light.

612
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,107
I can't go into detail.

613
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,176
It's just...

614
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:22,512
Look, the important thing is,

615
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,948
I'm reopening the case.

616
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,118
I'm gonna find out
who really killed Nora,

617
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,453
And I promise you, Henry,

618
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,254
I'm going to get you
out of here.

619
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,593
I am so sorry.

620
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,396
It doesn't matter
that you didn't believe in me...

621
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,568
Because you always believed
in my son.

622
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,660
Nimbus.

623
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,896
You're supposed to be dead.
Same to you.

624
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,036
Joe?

625
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,972
Joe!

626
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:22,973
Help!

627
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,541
Guards!

628
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:25,809
Somebody help!

629
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,801
Go get him.

630
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:08,718
So you've come to finish
what the gas chamber couldn't?

631
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,122
You're going somewhere you
can't hurt anyone ever again.

632
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:15,425
Wrong.

633
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,203
He used the antidote on Joe.

634
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,271
You need to stay away from him,
Barry.

635
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,806
Do not breathe him in.

636
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:38,081
I'm not sure
how that helps me, guys.

637
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,127
You can't fight him, Barry.

638
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,863
Just keep him coming at you.

639
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,265
That should sap his strength.

640
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,367
Gas is the least stable form
of matter.

641
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,602
This meta-human will not be able

642
00:33:58,604 --> 00:33:59,970
To stay in his mist form
for long.

643
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,838
His particles will need
to reform.

644
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,100
Barry.

645
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,871
Barry.

646
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,439
We win.

647
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,389
It's been a while
since I watched you sleep.

648
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,064
Rescuing you is exhausting.

649
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,232
I really miss the ability

650
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,268
To be able to ground you.

651
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,970
Sorry I went and grew up.

652
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,678
I could have got my dad
out of Iron Heights tonight.

653
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,681
I know.

654
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,949
But you were right.

655
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,984
That's not the way.

656
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,252
- Daddy.
- Oh.

657
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,888
Baby, I'm fine.
Don't worry.

658
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:06,296
I'll let you guys talk.

659
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:10,066
Partner.

660
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,769
You two arrive at the same time?

661
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,775
Dad, we have something
that we need to tell you.

662
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,079
Dad, the thing is...

663
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,082
You two are dating.

664
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,584
- I know.
- You do?

665
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:30,687
I'm a Detective, remember?

666
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,624
And both of you
are lousy liars.

667
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:35,859
So you're not mad?

668
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,894
Oh, I'm mad.

669
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,829
And if the doctor
hadn't confiscated my gun,

670
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,132
we'd be having an entirely
different conversation.

671
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,802
Well, I should let
you two talk,

672
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:48,638
And I'll just be outside

673
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,040
Looking into
the witness protection program.

674
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,412
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:58,314
Iris,
this is going to be complicated.

676
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,583
You know
I don't like complicated.

677
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,222
Do you like him?

678
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,425
Yeah, I do.

679
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,627
Then I will do my damnedest
not to shoot him.

680
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,762
That is all I ask.

681
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,571
Will it hold?

682
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,039
The barrier is powered by

683
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,875
An 8.3 tesla superconducting
electromagnet,

684
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,478
Which is about 100,000 times
the strength

685
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,114
Of earth's magnetic field.

686
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,817
In other words, yes.

687
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,254
Hmm.
He's mad.

688
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,991
Well, good night.

689
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:49,098
So we're just supposed
to get used to

690
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,401
Working above a makeshift prison

691
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,804
Housing evil people
with superpowers.

692
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,307
You'd be surprised what
you can get used to, Caitlin.

693
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,281
Caitlin.

694
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,016
Could I talk to you
for a second?

695
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,119
Sure.
What's up?

696
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,288
It's about the night
that Ronnie died.

697
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,326
I...

698
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:20,630
Look, Cisco, I'm okay.

699
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,633
I thought coming down here
would undo me,

700
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:28,204
But thinking about
what Ronnie did to protect us...

701
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,941
It just made me love him more.

702
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,481
Come on.

703
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,483
I need ice cream or a drink.

704
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,352
Let's see which one
we hit first.

705
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:53,096
Joe's gonna be okay.

706
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,905
You know, lately I've been
thinking about mom.

707
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,274
A lot.

708
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,578
I miss her.

709
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,848
Did I ever tell you about
the time you learned to walk?

710
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,052
A couple times.

711
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,754
Everyone was walking
before you.

712
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,923
All the little babies
running around the neighborhood,

713
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,558
Not you.

714
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,825
But your mom was never worried.

715
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,094
She just said, "he'll walk

716
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:29,666
When he has someplace to go."

717
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,702
And sure enough, the first time
you took a few steps,

718
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:37,607
You moved so quick,
you didn't just walk,

719
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,608
You started...

720
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:42,245
To run.

721
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,949
And you ran to your mom,
Barry.

722
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:49,419
Right into her arms.

723
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,592
You had someplace to go.

724
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,103
I thought being
the fastest man alive

725
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,172
Would make my life easier...

726
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,341
That I could outrun anything.

727
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,180
Turns out,
no one can outrun pain.

728
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,848
Somebody help!
Please, somebody!

729
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,383
Life is tragic.

730
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,257
But it's also precious...

731
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,628
And sweet...

732
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,334
And extraordinary.

733
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,710
And the only way I know
to honor my mom's life

734
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,779
Is to keep running.

735
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,567
Dr. Wells.

736
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,136
Dr. Wells, Ronnie did it.

737
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,504
He vented the system.

738
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:15,972
S.T.A.R. Labs should hold.

739
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,107
Good man.

740
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,742
I'm on my way down.

741
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,849
See you soon, Barry.

742
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,140
Greg, move your head.
