1
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,832
Amado Carrillo Fuentes!

2
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,378
The Lord of the Skies!

3
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,714
How fucking elegant, motherfucker.

4
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,802
- Don't tease.
- God damn, fucker.

5
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,931
- Your little brother?
- Yes. Alvaro.

6
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,432
Come here, son.

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,727
- You also get a hug.
- Sir.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,107
How are you doing?

9
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,695
320 million kinds of okay.

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,615
Doesn't it smell like the
fucking U.S. Treasury in here?

11
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,785
- This half is yours.
- Yes?

12
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,455
- Don't forget it.
- All right. We came at a good time, then.

13
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,542
A Tuesday like any other,
Pacho. You know how it is.

14
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,752
Motherfucker.

15
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,438
- Let's go to the house.
- Let's go.

16
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,508
- All right. Son, do you like margaritas?
- Of course I do.

17
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,802
Great, because I have
a Margarita for you.

18
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,346
She'll suck you dry.

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,019
Welcome to Mexico, motherfucker.

20
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,603
Let's go.

21
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,360
Take the money and destroy the plane.

22
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,214
First off, Senator Martin
and I would like to thank you

23
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,174
for having us down, Ambassador.

24
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,345
But, you gotta know what's
going on in Washington.

25
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,099
Folks are wondering if
we're gonna win this thing.

26
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,894
And as senior members of
the Appropriations Committee,

27
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,397
those questions are directed at us.

28
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,652
Now, everyone's proud of the work
you guys did to bring down Escobar.

29
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,489
And it's particularly an
honor to meet you, Agent Peña.

30
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:04,786
But cocaine continues to flow
north, and the American people wonder

31
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,081
if the Colombians share our
enthusiasm to take this threat head-on.

32
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,044
Our colleague, Senator Helms, put
forward some tough language on them.

33
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,882
But we wanted to come down here
and get the real from you all.

34
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,633
See firsthand what's at stake.

35
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:24,681
See how and... if we can give
you all the support you need.

36
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,936
Let's extend the senators every
courtesy while they're here.

37
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,230
Their mission is a priority.

38
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,775
They ask... you answer.

39
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,942
Thank you.

40
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,571
Money makes the world go 'round.

41
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,116
Legal or illegal, good guys and
bad guys, we all chase money.

42
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,870
For the DEA, it's about budget
meetings and kissing the right ass

43
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,073
to keep the funding flowing.

44
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,083
But if you're a trafficker,
getting the money is easy.

45
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,127
It's holding onto it that's hard.

46
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,922
♪ C.R.E.A.M., get the money ♪

47
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,715
♪ Dollar, dollar bill, y'all ♪

48
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,777
♪ I grew up on the crime side... ♪

49
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,261
In the early days, cash
was flown back to Colombia

50
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,139
on the same planes that
carried coke into the States.

51
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,227
Then it was converted into pesos,
or, if you were Pablo Escobar,

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,895
stuck in a hole somewhere.

53
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,191
One trafficker died with so much cash
buried on his property, when it rained,

54
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,736
the river downstream became clogged
with bills that had washed free.

55
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,406
The biggest problem with illegal
money is the trail that it leaves.

56
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,744
Once upon a time, American banks would
take your money, no questions asked.

57
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,706
That changed when President
Nixon signed the Bank Secrecy Act,

58
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,125
requiring all U.S. banks
to report transactions

59
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,836
involving more than $10,000 in cash.

60
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,882
And from that law, money
laundering was born.

61
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,761
The first stage of money
laundering is called placement,

62
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,513
and Cali had it down to an art.

63
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,266
Bringing workers from
the comunas to the U.S.,

64
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,393
where their job was to buy money orders,

65
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,771
each just under ten grand,
so they wouldn't be reported.

66
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,565
No I.D. was required.

67
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,318
And the orders could even remain blank
until they were deposited or cashed.

68
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,698
Once they bought a bunch of money orders,
they packed them up and sent them south

69
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,951
to a land of sunshine and lax oversight.

70
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,496
Switzerland on the Caribbean: Panama.

71
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,625
Since they didn't regulate wire
transfers, Panama was the perfect place

72
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,461
for the second stage of
money laundering: layering.

73
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,297
And here's where the
master goes to work.

74
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,926
The behind the scenes MVP of any
drug cartel is the money launderer,

75
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,847
the guy that takes the dirty money
and scrubs it clean. Here's how:

76
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,517
The money orders were deposited
into local bank accounts,

77
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,395
and then bounced through shell
companies and limited partnerships,

78
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,774
creating an untraceable web of phony
purchase orders and transaction reports,

79
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,027
wiping clean the
money's criminal origins.

80
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,697
But no matter how well you hide
it, money always leaves a trail.

81
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,783
And the best way to hurt the
Cali cartel was to find it.

82
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,702
♪ Dollar, dollar bill, y'all ♪

83
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,912
Cali. Muy hermosa, right?

84
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,289
Fuck you, Chris.

85
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,709
The man asked me if I had a partner,
and your desk is across from mine.

86
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,336
You really fucked me, man.

87
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,380
You gonna ride a desk all the
way to Special Operations Unit?

88
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,257
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

89
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,010
Agents Feistl, Van Ness...?

90
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,095
- Feistl.
- Welcome to Cali.

91
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,847
- Gracias.
- Captain Calderón.

92
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,515
We're happy to be here.

93
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,768
And what brings you to Cali?

94
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,521
We've got some addresses
we want to investigate.

95
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,024
Cartel-related?

96
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,402
Not necessarily.

97
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,614
What a surprise. DEA
agents that don't trust us.

98
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,033
How did that work out
for the last two guys?

99
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,913
Friend, in Cali, there are more
corrupt cops than there are churches.

100
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,082
You don't trust me? I understand.

101
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,086
But if you want to get anything done
in Cali, you need the police's help.

102
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,006
If not me, someone else.

103
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,050
Not my rule.

104
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,760
- I understand.
- Good.

105
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,765
The addresses are linked to
cartel financial operations.

106
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:59,854
We want to put eyes on them. See if
any of the dots start connecting...

107
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,065
You've come a long way to connect dots.

108
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,901
We work with what we've got.

109
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:09,364
Unless you can tell me where I can
find Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez.

110
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,286
If they didn't own half of the city,
I couldn't even be sure they exist.

111
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,332
The Rodríguez brothers are ghosts.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,292
It was true.

113
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,962
While the terms of surrender
were being finalized,

114
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,589
the brothers had gone
underground to avoid capture.

115
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,343
They abandoned their swank estates,
secretly moving to new homes,

116
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,227
where they could continue
running their empire

117
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,432
without setting foot in one
of their legitimate businesses.

118
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,854
And all this while Chepe continued
to expand their New York operation.

119
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,441
But sometimes, even
the best get unlucky.

120
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,902
A computer glitch in Monaco
led authorities to notice

121
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,364
that one limited partnership had
multiple accounts at the same bank.

122
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,366
When they looked closer,

123
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,203
they found it had ties to hundreds
of bullshit accounts across Europe.

124
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,205
And they all led back to one bank...

125
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,750
right here in Bogotá.

126
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,004
Lucky for us, the president had
given the DEA our best weapon yet:

127
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,547
the Clinton list.

128
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,050
If we suspected a company
of working with traffickers,

129
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,509
their name went on the list.

130
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,153
And then they were banned from
doing business with U.S. companies

131
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,598
and U.S. companies were banned
from doing business with them.

132
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,266
You get fucked both ways.

133
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,144
And you want to know
what the best part is?

134
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,480
We don't even have to prove it.

135
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,399
We just... put you on the list.

136
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,360
And the OFAC takes care of the rest.

137
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,907
How can I help you, Agent Peña?

138
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,869
Armed with the threat
of the Clinton list,

139
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,329
we could get pretty much
any information we wanted,

140
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,041
and that's how we were able to give
Cali's number one money launderer a name:

141
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,793
Franklin Jurado.

142
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,669
Because it was illegal
for Colombian citizens

143
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,755
to have U.S. currency
in their possession,

144
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,091
a money launderer became
more than just a connection

145
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,927
to the financial institutions
that washed their cash.

146
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,013
For all intents and
purposes, he is their money.

147
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,893
Jurado was the perfect bridge between
the narcos and the world of high finance.

148
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,230
He spoke five languages and
traveled on multiple passports.

149
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,775
He married an American girl he met
while at business school in the States,

150
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,236
took her down south, and
got her in on his action.

151
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,573
That American passport was
solid gold in any Caribbean bank.

152
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,370
Jurado was smooth. But
now, we knew his name.

153
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,622
These are cash transfers.

154
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,292
The accounts are controlled
by a man named Franklin Jurado.

155
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,047
- You know him?
- Of him.

156
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,217
He served as director at Interamericas.

157
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,886
- The Rodríguez
brothers' bank. - Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,181
They later gave him
a more important job.

159
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,517
Do you have an address for Jurado?

160
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,435
I can get it for you.

161
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,732
So what happened since
the last time I saw you?

162
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,485
Are you going to take
these men on, or what?

163
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,157
- I'm going to do my job.
- And your bosses?

164
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
Do they know what you're doing?

165
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,662
No comment.

166
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,623
♪ Dance with me ♪

167
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,295
♪ In my world of fantasy ♪

168
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,506
♪ Won't you dance with me ♪

169
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,678
♪ Ritual fertility ♪

170
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,814
I was thinking...

171
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,026
maybe I could come with you.

172
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,615
Oh, come on, this could be our last
chance to travel like we used to.

173
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,285
- Remember that place in Milan?
- With the leaking roof?

174
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,330
On your birthday. And
that terrible risotto.

175
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,874
That balcony.

176
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,421
The brothers are pushing now, baby.
They are opening more accounts.

177
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,840
- It's dangerous.
- I don't care.

178
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,723
How high are you right now?

179
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,768
Hey, fuck you!

180
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,811
Give me your passport.

181
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,607
I can't stay in this
apartment anymore, Franklin.

182
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,902
I can't watch another movie
with subtitles by myself.

183
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,756
I don't want to listen to the cartel
wives talk about their husbands...

184
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,717
- With an English degree from Harvard...
- Please don't tell me I can teach.

185
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,326
Then what did you want me to say?

186
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,161
Fuck.

187
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,456
We'll do this another time.

188
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,004
The dining room is over here.

189
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,882
You have a room over here.

190
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,093
You have another one over here.

191
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,096
And here, you have the living room.

192
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,063
The dimmer is over here.

193
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,442
And you can adjust the light.

194
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,530
Well... you get the idea.

195
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,243
- No. I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

196
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,161
Does this seem normal to you?

197
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,746
You indicated to Mr. Rodríguez

198
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,708
you were uncertain about
returning to the North Valley.

199
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,378
And that's why he bought
me a palace. With dimmers.

200
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,840
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

201
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,926
but I need to think
about his generous offer.

202
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,430
We have that dinner tonight.

203
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,266
With your friends?

204
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,977
With the investors.

205
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,689
They're not going to
like the six-month delay.

206
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,527
And I think it's best if we don't
mention the Rodríguez brothers by name.

207
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,533
I know you're embarrassed by what I do.

208
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,751
I know you did it for your family.

209
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,046
But if these people like
everything they hear tonight,

210
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,007
you'll have your own security firm
the second these six months are up.

211
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,927
- Ready!
- Good!

212
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,012
A choir!

213
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,058
All right, say bye
to Dad. We're leaving.

214
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,893
- Bye.
- Bye.

215
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,562
All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.

216
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,773
Will you make it on time?

217
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,525
If you're wearing the
dress with the flowers, yes.

218
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,448
Let's go, girls.

219
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,410
Today is a busy day for us, boys.

220
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,331
Bosses have meetings all
day at the National Hotel.

221
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,169
I need you to pre-sweep each and
every location on this schedule.

222
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,340
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked
like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

223
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,677
- He's looking at you, Montez.
- Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

224
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,057
Don Miguel's team on channel six.
Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

225
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,559
Jorge says that the
DEA is visiting Cali.

226
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:58,648
Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.
They're working with the National Police.

227
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,485
But they don't have
warrants. They're tourists.

228
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,904
They need permission
to wipe their own asses.

229
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,868
Regardless, while they're in
Cali, we'll be watching them.

230
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,747
- That's your job, Enrique, my brother.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,374
That's all, gentlemen.

232
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,335
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

233
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,676
I have to duck out early.
It's a work thing for Paola.

234
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,760
Of course.

235
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,096
Do you want to practice your English?

236
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,765
Starkman, the American
lawyer, arrives today.

237
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,809
Can you pick him up from the airport?

238
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,729
Aren't you worried about the tourists?

239
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,358
The second team's never
as good as the first.

240
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,874
Got a look at the directory. That
company moved out three months ago.

241
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,710
If they were ever there at all.

242
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,014
Quiet part of the city here.

243
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,142
Cartel keep Cali buttoned down?

244
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,478
Nobody talks.

245
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,064
All the multinationals used
to have offices here in Cali.

246
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,149
"Used to"?

247
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,236
Pulled out because of the city's
ties to the narcotics trade.

248
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,240
The Rodríguez brothers are
the only game in town now.

249
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
Fucking drug dealers
pretending to be stockbrokers.

250
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,874
Motherfuckers ruined this city.

251
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,671
Where are we headed next?

252
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,965
Please.

253
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,012
This way, Mr. Starkman.

254
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,891
How the hell are you supposed to
fly international if you can't smoke?

255
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,684
I guess you can always quit.

256
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,481
And let United Airlines
tell me how to live?

257
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,570
Remind me again... Kansas City?

258
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,782
- Leavenworth.
- What the fuck for?

259
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,493
My father was in the
army. There's a base there.

260
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:20,373
They sent him to train. I
was like... seven years old.

261
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,042
What? It's America.

262
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,502
That's for sure.

263
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,922
So am I meeting the
brothers at the hotel?

264
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,005
Yes.

265
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,677
Serious stones on these guys.

266
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,347
Retiring, like they run Lehman Brothers.

267
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,100
It's a good break for you, though.

268
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,769
You'll get immunity when
the surrender goes through.

269
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,688
I don't sell cocaine.

270
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,439
I don't shoot anyone.

271
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,441
You're a member of the Cali cartel.

272
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,694
You ever hear of conspiracy, amigo?

273
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,824
Relax. I got this. Look, they're
lucky to have us both, Jorge.

274
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,577
You can't put a price on freedom.

275
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,667
Though Lord knows I try.

276
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,592
I assume you would prefer U.S. currency?

277
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,010
Of course.

278
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,511
Currency aside,

279
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,431
we aren't in the habit of
paying for things in advance.

280
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,475
What guarantee do we have that
you will provide what you promise?

281
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,102
Forgive my brother.

282
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,564
We are grateful for the support
you and your people have offered.

283
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,692
This afternoon, our
associate, Mr. Pallomari,

284
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,070
will prepare the contribution
and arrange delivery.

285
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,281
Very well.

286
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,744
The contribution should
be divided among seven men.

287
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,245
Their names are on the list.

288
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,960
All right, very well. Going forward,

289
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,881
I think it's best if Mr. Pallomari
deals with my colleague, Mr. Giraldo.

290
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,008
As you wish.

291
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,428
Have a great day, gentlemen.

292
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,023
Well, our surrender has been
bought. Now it must be paid for.

293
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,694
And they say we're the criminals.

294
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,614
Sons of bitches.

295
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:21,035
Small price to pay, brother,
for the rest of your life.

296
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,122
Gentlemen, I will prepare these payments
myself, as soon as I'm back in the office.

297
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,709
And I'll make sure that
all of this is in order.

298
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,879
Mr. Starkman is next, the lawyer.

299
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,008
If you ever make it to Miami
and you need a lawyer...

300
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,344
hit me up.

301
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,764
I wasn't planning on it,
but thank you, Mr. Starkman.

302
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,849
Yeah, nobody ever plans on it.

303
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,893
Mr. Starkman.

304
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,020
- Welcome to Cali.
- Yeah.

305
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,732
The Rodríguez brothers
are pleased to welcome you.

306
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,319
No offense, but remind
me again what you do?

307
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,739
I'm the chief accountant
to the Rodríguez brothers.

308
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,702
What happened to the other guy?
The good-looking one? Pacho?

309
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,495
Mr. Herrera?

310
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,165
Yeah, I bet he's the guy who's got
all the pussy in town on speed dial.

311
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah. Please, sir.

312
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,671
- Feistl.
- How's it going?

313
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:18,592
Well, slow so far, but
Calderón seems like good police.

314
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,677
Yeah. Good.

315
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,637
That journalist come through?

316
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,347
I'm on the money man right now.

317
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,308
- See where he takes me.
- Gracias.

318
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,601
Eyes open, Feistl.

319
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,146
- Everything by the book.
- Will do.

320
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,857
- Keep me posted.
- Baby, wait.

321
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,321
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
Come here.

323
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,814
The Arellano Felix brothers

324
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,733
are still wasting time with heroin.

325
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,361
Hey! What? You're not
going to say hello?

326
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,906
- Hello.
- Are you in a bad mood or what?

327
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,798
Amado... this is the life.

328
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,633
You guys helped me.

329
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,719
I moved the last 100
tons in less than 50 days.

330
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,305
You tell me if we're
a great team or not.

331
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,349
That's why we're here.

332
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,893
Can you handle a bigger package?

333
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,564
I'm the Lord of the Skies,
brother. What do you think?

334
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,817
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

335
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,152
Leader of the Juárez cartel.

336
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,113
He was one of the most
enterprising traffickers in Mexico

337
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,700
and one of the first to get into business
with his Colombian friends to the south.

338
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,954
While Escobar saw the Mexican
traffickers as a threat,

339
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,705
Cali saw them as a partner.

340
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,210
A partner that shared over 1,900
miles of virtually undefended border

341
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,213
with Cali's biggest
customer: the United States.

342
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,258
And right about the time
the Caribbean corridor closed

343
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,679
along came NAFTA, when the U.S.
- Mexico border was open for business.

344
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,347
And Amado took full advantage,

345
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,225
agreeing to ferry Cali
cocaine into the States.

346
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,811
They called it "the Mexican trampoline,"

347
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,565
bouncing cocaine into America,
and bouncing cash right back.

348
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,192
I can move however much you give me.

349
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,529
I just have two questions: How much?

350
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,491
And for how much longer, Pacho?

351
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,160
Because I know about your deal.

352
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,413
I know you want to turn yourselves in.

353
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,417
There is a deal on the table, Amado.

354
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,795
But we have six months to turn
ourselves in. That's the truth.

355
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,300
Until then, we will honor
our commitment to you.

356
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,551
Right, and after?

357
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,470
What happens after that?

358
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,017
The business will adjust.

359
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,022
This I know. It will always
adjust. This will never end.

360
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,692
There will be other partners and
more drugs. But what about you?

361
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,236
What will happen to you?

362
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:30,534
You can't tell me you're going to retire,
as if this was any normal business.

363
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,828
You know this is a way of life.

364
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,956
It retires you when it's done with you.

365
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,462
Or are you going to start
playing golf like an old man?

366
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,810
We need to count on you maintaining
the same terms on this last shipment.

367
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,774
Done.

368
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,654
It'll be my gift to
the Gentlemen of Cali.

369
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,408
All right? But... you have
to come with me to Juárez.

370
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,288
- I want to show you something.
- What is it?

371
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,709
The future, Pacho.

372
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,587
The fucking future, that's all.

373
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,804
- Here's your passport.
- Thank you.

374
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,725
All right, and you
board through Gate 15.

375
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,810
Okay.

376
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,023
- Have a great trip.
- Thank you.

377
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,401
Have a great day.

378
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,194
Next.

379
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,702
I'm going to Panama.

380
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,246
I need you to radio
ahead to the DEA office.

381
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,498
I'm afraid not. This plane
can't take off. New orders.

382
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,999
What are you talking about?

383
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,482
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not looking
for that kind of trouble.

384
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,464
Oh, shit.

385
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,596
What the fuck is going on?

386
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,975
Orders are orders. You
heard the ambassador.

387
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,815
Our friends from the Senate here want
the down-low from a real-life hero.

388
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,359
Guess that's you.

389
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,696
You got somewhere better to be?

390
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,741
You wore the wrong shoes.

391
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,166
Fuck.

392
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,382
Is that the Río Negro?

393
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,271
What do we got here?

394
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,023
The captain likes this one.

395
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,525
You won't find their name on the lease,

396
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,528
but the Rodríguez brothers
own the top six floors.

397
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,239
Oh, fuck. For real?

398
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,658
I told you, there are
some honest cops in Cali.

399
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,620
Let me reach out to men I trust.

400
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:24,666
Quietly. Keep an eye on this
place. You go back to Bogotáand...

401
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,585
get a warrant.

402
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,048
Come on, guys, the place
isn't moving anywhere.

403
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,968
Get that paper and we'll
turn this place upside down.

404
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,053
Why wait?

405
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,139
Judge in Bogotásigned a
warrant for us before we left.

406
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,648
Which you never told me about.

407
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,403
This is the kind of bullshit I don't
like. Are you playing me or what?

408
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,782
Hey, man, it's like you said.
It's hard to know who to trust.

409
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,743
I wasn't even sure
we were gonna need it.

410
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,205
There's no address on this warrant.

411
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,375
You said this place is connected,
so let's put in some work.

412
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,752
Do you know the kind
of shit I could land in?

413
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,628
Huh?

414
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,757
I don't have a DEA
pension waiting for me.

415
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,219
Pensions aren't that
great, to be honest.

416
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,601
Fuck.

417
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,980
Let's do it.

418
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,195
I need a tactical team sent to
15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?

419
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,573
Copy that. Requesting a tactical team

420
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,700
at 15th Street and 4th Avenue.

421
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,535
You do realize, don't you,

422
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,080
after we surrender, all
of this shit will end.

423
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,877
No more sitting by the
pool, smoking your cigar,

424
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,713
telling everyone what to do.

425
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,632
Look, Miguel, I'm tired of
telling people what to do.

426
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,553
And no one has ever listened to you.

427
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,431
What's the difference?

428
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,899
But you know what?

429
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,988
Never, in human history, have two
brothers accomplished what we have.

430
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:24,494
We aren't the first people in
history to build an empire, Gilberto.

431
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,206
But we're the first to retire
leaving the empire intact.

432
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,754
If Mom were alive, she'd be proud.

433
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,716
Brothers are well, nephews
are well, sons are well.

434
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,976
Boss, we just heard a call

435
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:47,017
that a tactical team left Jamundí
station heading to 4th Avenue.

436
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,520
Enrique, where are you?

437
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,065
Watching our visitors from the DEA.

438
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,442
They've been checking
addresses all over town.

439
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,694
But right now, they're
stopped, just doing nothing.

440
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,071
Yes, but where are you?

441
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,324
At 15th Street and...
4th. On 4th Avenue.

442
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,911
Enrique, fuck! There's a
police convoy coming at you!

443
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,496
Get Pallomari out of there now!

444
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,730
Answer, you bastard, answer.

445
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,319
- Hello? What's up?
- Listen, it's Salcedo.

446
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,030
You're going to have
unwelcome guests. Leave now.

447
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,118
I don't have time for this. I'm
supervising an important project.

448
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,829
That's exactly why I
need you to get out.

449
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,038
Just because you say so?

450
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,810
I know you're arranging an important
transaction for the bosses this afternoon.

451
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,877
Listen, this is none of your business.

452
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,380
I'll bet your desk is
covered with American dollars.

453
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,257
Look, Guillermo, please.

454
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,969
You've got papers. You've got names.
You've got things that shouldn't be seen.

455
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,262
- Jorge...
- Get out of there!

456
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,097
You do your job and I'll do mine.

457
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,435
This is my job! I'm telling
you... Son of a bitch!

458
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,338
Fuck your mother.

459
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,632
I need you to check the paper shredders

460
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,676
and the floppy disks
still in the computers.

461
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,889
Invoices. Bills of lading.
Anything on the computers.

462
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,993
- Warrant says paper only.
- Yeah? Warrants say a lot of things.

463
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:52,893
Let's go.

464
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,978
At least someone's willing to get wet.

465
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,502
Don't worry, you'll be back in
Intelligence Group soon enough.

466
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,564
It's not...

467
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,859
This is a waste of our time, Chris.

468
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,528
And more importantly, this
is a waste of a warrant.

469
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,404
You know what?

470
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,868
Andrew Jackson here says all we
find in this fucking high rise

471
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,554
- is a nice view of the city.
- All right.

472
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,831
Well, I got... whoever this
guy is and he says otherwise.

473
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,255
Fucking shit!

474
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,786
Gentlemen, how may I help you?

475
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,567
Seventh floor. Mr. Pallomari's office.

476
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,861
I'll let them know you're
here so you can head up.

477
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,032
Oh, oh, oh... People love surprises.

478
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,701
Gentlemen, you can't...

479
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,822
You. What the fuck are
you still doing here?

480
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,745
What the fuck am I doing? My job. We
told your associate the same thing.

481
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,505
Sorry, boss, I tried,
but he won't listen.

482
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,412
- You go get the car.
- Please get out.

483
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,695
- I have to finish. Fuck your mother.
- The back stairs.

484
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,624
- Yes, sir.
- Finish what?

485
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,376
My job, Jorge.

486
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,173
No. Please, we have to
get rid of all of that now.

487
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,383
We aren't arguing. You
aren't touching anything.

488
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,343
I've got a method and a system.

489
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,737
- Method and a system?
- Yes, sir.

490
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,140
Yes? What you've got is ten years of
jail time sitting on your desk, you idiot.

491
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,766
- Get out.
- No.

492
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,436
Attention! Colombian National Police!

493
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,189
Where are the files?

494
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,357
Get to work. Let's go!

495
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,234
This is an office.

496
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,281
We're working. How can I help you?

497
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,659
We need access to your files, invoices,
and all of your correspondence.

498
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,619
Ah...

499
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,665
If that's the case, I
need to see a warrant.

500
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,627
Are you supposed to be in charge?

501
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,381
Well, yes, I'm in charge.

502
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,311
Come on.

503
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,910
Good morning. I have to
see every invoice you have.

504
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,667
Hey!

505
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,754
This says documents
only. Fuck your mother.

506
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,217
Could you repeat that, sir? My
Spanish is... is a bit rough.

507
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,885
You didn't get that?

508
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,137
- Only papers.
- Documents only.

509
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,533
- All right.
- Claudia.

510
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,934
Keep an eye on the things
they're taking. Now!

511
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,017
Yes, sir.

512
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,238
Leave it. Let it be.

513
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,615
Chivo, check everything and
make an inventory, all right?

514
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,335
Hey, I like presents. What'd you get us?

515
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,670
That's private.

516
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,993
Ignacio, please show the
gentleman last year's documents.

517
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,047
This way, please.

518
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,812
Excuse me, sir.

519
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,723
I must insist.

520
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,586
Your phone's off the hook.

521
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,248
Do you have a bill of
lading? Yes? Let me see.

522
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,876
More? Everything.

523
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,294
- Just these?
- And copies below.

524
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,754
- These as well, no?
- Yes, sir.

525
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,924
- All right. '93. Yeah?
- Those are the most recent.

526
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:25,767
Grab that.

527
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,605
Looks like you owe me that 20.

528
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,773
Oh, yeah.

529
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,068
You were right.

530
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,439
This area saw the biggest spike in
trafficking after Escobar was killed.

531
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,817
Can't we just spray chemicals on
this place and be done with it?

532
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,696
Unfortunately, agricultural concerns
in the region won't allow it.

533
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,031
That's right. Chiquita
Bananas is down here.

534
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,909
I know those guys. Big contributors.

535
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,706
Okay. Here we are.

536
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,087
Jesus H. Christ.

537
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,675
Must've been one hell
of a firefight, huh?

538
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,759
No doubt, sir.

539
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,471
- Gentlemen, this is Captain Mills.
- Captain.

540
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,056
- Our advisor on this mission down here.
- How you doing, sir?

541
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,226
He liaised with a team of Colombian
commandos on this raid here.

542
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,898
These guys FARC or traffickers?

543
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,024
Both.

544
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,112
Probably started out doing security
for the traffickers, or extorting them.

545
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,616
FARC wants to overthrow the government.

546
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,243
Cocaine finances their struggles.

547
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,870
Top of the line.

548
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,166
There's an arms race going on down here.

549
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,249
And this shit...

550
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,586
is jet fuel.

551
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,757
You guys ready for lunch?

552
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,344
Lunch? Yeah. Sure. Why not?

553
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,684
Go. Go. Go.

554
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,614
This 24-hour party thing...

555
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,368
is tiring after a couple of days.

556
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,916
Can you imagine if it was your life?

557
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,047
What's on your mind?

558
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,511
Dad, and the last thing he said to me.

559
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,388
What? "Get the fuck out"?

560
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,431
No.

561
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,436
He said... that in this world...

562
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,692
there was no place for a man like me.

563
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,990
I made a place for myself.

564
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,785
I proved him wrong.

565
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,832
And now, I have to give it all up.

566
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,590
What kind of man would
I be if I gave it all up?

567
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,633
I don't know, brother.

568
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:51,222
But what I do know is that you
have a couple billion dollars...

569
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,226
and the rest of your
life to figure it out.

570
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,777
What are they giving me?

571
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,621
What do you mean, "What
are they giving you?"

572
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,406
They took my son, didn't they?

573
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,284
They have to give us something.

574
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,080
Have they offered you something?

575
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,499
An apartment.

576
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,626
Accept it.

577
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,669
Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.

578
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,214
We'll take their money now.
Later, we'll take vengeance.

579
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,551
- Do it, then get back up here.
- Can you wake Pedro up?

580
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,263
- I want to speak with him.
- Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.

581
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,273
I heard we cut it close today.

582
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,776
I thought they didn't have a warrant.

583
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,487
That's what I was told by
our friend on the force.

584
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,657
A few more seconds and
we'd have had real trouble.

585
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,619
Those new DEA guys are
sharper than they look.

586
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,705
Well, luckily, we have you.

587
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,125
Did they get anything?

588
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,585
Some files.

589
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,379
So nothing. Good.

590
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,339
I'll take care of the rest today.

591
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,802
That thing you've got tonight
with Paola, enjoy yourself. Go on.

592
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,566
We got names, addresses.
These files are legit.

593
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,528
How are you guys?

594
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,611
Captain.

595
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,865
We'll catalog and seal
the ones from today.

596
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,284
If you could help us with transport...

597
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,997
Okay... there must
be a misunderstanding.

598
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,375
The files stay here.

599
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,670
We need to sort through these.

600
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,464
As you can see, we know how
to process evidence, Feistl.

601
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,386
- That wasn't the deal. This was our intel.
- It was a CNP operation.

602
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,013
We let you join, support.

603
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,848
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

604
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,976
I'm not.

605
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,271
But anything we find we'll
be sure to share with you.

606
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,232
I was instructed you should
be back in Bogotátonight.

607
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,359
You're going out on the last flight.

608
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:14,863
He burned us.

609
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,492
Who's that, Chris?

610
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,202
The last honest cop in Cali?

611
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,415
No, man. He clowned me,
too. I'm calling the boss.

612
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,094
Fuck!

613
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,642
Those things ain't
going 25 feet down here.

614
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,980
Thanks. Hey, you DOD?

615
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,026
So they say. But I still ID as a Marine.

616
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,612
I'm part of the military
assistance package.

617
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,031
- CIA?
- Oh, shit. Fuck, no.

618
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,075
Can I get a smoke?

619
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:03,914
Thanks.

620
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,251
Where you from?

621
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,004
The last place? Pendleton.

622
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,508
I was out there teaching Saudi
soldiers how to do jumping jacks.

623
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,635
That shit's a lot harder than it sounds.

624
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,724
- So is it really that bad down here?
- Yeah. It is.

625
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,770
You got paramilitary,
FARC, traffickers, us.

626
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,856
Some pretty hairy bullshit down here.

627
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,193
Right, but not hairy enough
for the truth to make its case.

628
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,240
Magazines on those bodies
are 7.62 millimeter.

629
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,952
They go in an AK-47, right?

630
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,582
Those guns, the fancy ones,
they chamber in a 5.56.

631
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,588
This whole thing is staged.

632
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,801
Those are run-of-the-mill
guerrillas. Peasants, not traffickers.

633
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,262
You know your guns.

634
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,975
I'm gonna head on down.

635
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,274
Not very original, Stechner.

636
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,735
Even for the CIA.

637
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:20,533
Yeah, well, sometimes you need to
make the truth a little more... plain.

638
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,373
Well, how's this for truth?

639
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:33,296
They go home and tell everyone the
war on drugs is a fucking stage show.

640
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,050
And all the money they
put in is pissed away.

641
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,971
Even the hero said it's fucked up.

642
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,392
What's that do to your plan?

643
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,313
I'm gonna level with you.

644
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,481
Sending a five-billion-dollar
aid package

645
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:57,153
to a country that's on the verge
of becoming a narco-democracy,

646
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,696
that's a bad look in the Senate.

647
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,742
All due respect, Senator, you're looking
at a petri dish for the next Castro,

648
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,702
and this one's fed by narco dollars.

649
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,039
And not just here. Venezuela, Honduras.

650
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,167
Rich dictators with
anti-American hard-ons.

651
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,711
We turn our back on this
place, it all goes to hell.

652
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:24,096
Colombia is perfectly situated to help
us in both Central and South America.

653
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,934
The right American footprint
here, Black Hawks, small arms,

654
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,353
night vision, advisors like Mills...

655
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:35,149
we help secure a stable Colombia,

656
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,818
and it becomes a beacon for the region.

657
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,696
Well, if you want the American people

658
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,616
to get behind sending billions
of dollars to Colombia...

659
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,453
we need a no-fucking-around
victory down here.

660
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,206
Look, gentlemen, the
Colombian government

661
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:54,752
is months away from dismantling one
of the biggest drug cartels in history.

662
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,339
And they will do it
without firing a shot.

663
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,968
No body count, no dirty hands.

664
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,804
I can't imagine the folks
back home won't like that.

665
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,139
Agent Peña.

666
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,268
What do you think?

667
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,523
Is it true? Is a big win coming?

668
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,195
Agent Stechner and I...

669
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:27,201
we have a long-standing difference
of opinion on just about everything.

670
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,331
But he and I can both agree...

671
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,960
a big win is coming.

672
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,769
Glad we're on the
same page, Agent Peña.

673
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,857
So the whole surrender plan
is about fucking fundraising!

674
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,445
The Colombians get a check and you
get to play army men in the jungle?

675
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,823
I'm thinking about the next
battle, the one that really counts.

676
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,617
Which means you're
willing to lose this one!

677
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,120
The drug war?

678
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,124
Oh, come on, man! We lost it!

679
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,459
You were there!

680
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,840
Ever stop and think that anyone that
takes this as personally as you do

681
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,800
is doing it wrong?

682
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
- Fuck you!
- Yeah.

683
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,266
See ya!

684
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,583
Where are they now?

685
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,807
I just put them on a plane to Bogotá.

686
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,725
- And the files?
- We've got them.

687
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:15,726
Are you sure?

688
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,979
Look, they tricked me with
that fucking warrant, all right?

689
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,860
And I couldn't warn you because we
were all together like a fucking family.

690
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,197
These Americans know what they're doing.

691
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,616
They aren't fucking idiots.

692
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,697
I ever tell you I did
a rotation in Chile?

693
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,210
No, Dan, you never told me you
did a rotation in fucking Chile.

694
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,380
The accountant.

695
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,759
- You clock his accent?
- No.

696
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,013
A little off. You know, he said
something: "Concha su madre. "

697
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,808
Okay, what's that? "Fuck
your mother" or something?

698
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:56,891
Exactly.

699
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,104
But then he said another word:"Cachai. "

700
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,357
It's a phrase that they
typically only use in Chile.

701
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,902
And if he's from Chile...

702
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,155
He can be extradited.

703
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,709
Panama DEA said no
warrant, no detention.

704
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,670
- Fuck.
- Plus, Jurado didn't stay in Panama.

705
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,880
They know where he went?

706
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,506
No.

707
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,218
So Jurado could be anywhere. Fuck!

708
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:35,472
Also, boss, Feistl and Van Ness
have been trying you. A lot.

709
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,684
All right, well, put them through
when you get them. I'm on my way back.

710
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,561
- And Stoddard?
- Yeah, boss?

711
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,856
Jurado has a wife in
Bogotá. She's American.

712
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,858
Put a tap on her phone.

713
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,403
- I don't think I can do that.
- Just do it.

714
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,997
Well, the truth is, we're very
interested in your proposal, Jorge.

715
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,166
And in your potential for growth.

716
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,460
You've exceeded Paola's description,

717
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,253
which wasn't easy.

718
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,550
Of course, we were inconvenienced
by the six-month delay, which...

719
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,510
took us by surprise.

720
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,557
I take my commitments
very seriously, gentlemen.

721
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,061
And I couldn't leave without ensuring
my replacement met the standard

722
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,938
they've come to expect.

723
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,439
Go wait for him over there.

724
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,192
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good, thank you.

725
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,324
Well, I think that merits
another bottle of wine, no?

726
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,408
Yes.

727
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,162
Look at that son of a bitch.

728
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,041
Thinks his shit doesn't stink, or what?

729
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,425
Thank you.

730
00:50:53,634 --> 00:51:00,015
So, a security expert married to a rising
star in one of Cali's top law firms.

731
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,725
Have you worked together before?

732
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:05,645
My compliments.

733
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,316
David Rodríguez.

734
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:13,945
How are you?

735
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,162
Don't let the elegant suit fool you.

736
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,792
This guy's a real son of a bitch.

737
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,376
Seriously.

738
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,380
In fact, he's one of our best men.

739
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,631
You see?

740
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,303
Enjoy it.

741
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,555
Ma'am.

742
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,655
You... Where do you know him
from? Is he a friend of yours?

743
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,366
You know Cali is a very small city.

744
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,871
Even more so when one is
in the security business.

745
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,915
One must deal with all sorts of people.

746
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,090
Is that the paperwork
I'm supposed to deliver?

747
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,427
These documents are very sensitive.

748
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,514
And I don't feel comfortable
transferring possession to anyone else.

749
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,601
All right. Let's go, then.

750
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,485
Open the door, Córdova.

751
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,820
Go fuck yourself, Pallomari.

752
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,323
- Huh?
- In the front seat.

753
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,076
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Open the door. Fuck your mother.

754
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,328
In the front. I'm not
your fucking employee.

755
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,753
Making friends everywhere he goes.

756
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,505
No shit.

757
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,984
Look at this fucking neighborhood.

758
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,487
This guy's doing more than filing W-9s.

759
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,697
Es el cabrón.

760
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,950
The fucking man.

761
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,297
I haven't been able
to reach an agreement.

762
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,347
He's very stubborn.

763
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,143
Listen to me, Pacho. We
have to seal the deal.

764
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,061
It's very important.

765
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,399
Amado has to go to Juárez tomorrow.
I'll go with him and close the deal.

766
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,068
All right. Keep me informed.

767
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,862
Good night.

768
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,280
Good night, Gilberto.

769
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,172

Come in, please.

00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,512
Take a seat.

786
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:11,642
Sir... your offer of this
apartment is very generous.

787
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,686
But?

788
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,191
But... I would like to know the terms.

789
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,403
The terms?

790
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,822
How often will you
come here to visit me?

791
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,536
As often as you like.

792
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,579
Or never.

793
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,957
This is your home.

794
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,084
Is there a monthly stipend?

795
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,878
A stipend?

796
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:45,092
Mr. Rodríguez, I married Claudio
Salazar when I was 18 years old.

797
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,843
I knew nothing.

798
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,682
Now I need to get away from his
family, and I need my son back.

799
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,810
If you could help me with that...

800
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,313
I can.

801
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,359
Then I accept.

802
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,616
It's great to hear that.

803
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,506
Why don't you get some rest?

804
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,092
Eat something.

805
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,137
Tomorrow morning,
I'll send for your son.

806
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,390
How does that sound?

807
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,268
Good.

808
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,644
Take a seat.

809
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,401
Fifty miles an hour, you could
jump into water and survive.

810
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,614
- You can't leave her on the bus.
- I guess you do. You leave her on the bus.

811
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,282
No.

812
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,119
- I would leave her.
- You would leave her?

813
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,413
Shh...

814
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,539
All right. Here we go.

815
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,509
Dan.

816
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,888
Is that who I think it is?

817
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,475
Gilberto fucking Rodríguez.

818
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,852
Fuck.

819
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,564
Oh, my fucking God. Okay.

820
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,027
- Peña.
- Boss, it's Feistl.

821
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,031
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Sir, I got eyes on Gilberto Rodríguez.

822
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,534
- You're looking at him right now?
- Yes.

823
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,870
Just say the word and
we can take him down.

824
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,372
What's the move, boss?

825
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,674
Sorry to interrupt.

826
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,131
You want to go after
Gilberto Rodríguez?
