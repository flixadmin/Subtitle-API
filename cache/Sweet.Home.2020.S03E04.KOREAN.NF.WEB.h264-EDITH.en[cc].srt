Mm.

Why?

122
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,494
So I don't have to hate you.

123
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,705
Hate me?

124
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,460
You hate me?

125
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,258
'Cause I thought you hated me so.

[Yi-kyung] Why did you do it again?

129
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,182
That's why I locked you up,
for your own sake.

130
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,435
I did it so you couldn't do
something like that again!

131
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,187
I make you uncomfortable when I'm around.

132
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,191
It scares you, and it hurts you.

133
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,485
Don't you hate me for being a monster?

134
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,409
I thought you might understand me...

135
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,079
if you were a monster, too.

Your mother doesn't hate you.

139
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,865
I tried to ignore the fact that...

140
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,619
you were special and a little different.

141
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,750
I didn't want to accept that it was true.

142

Why?

[sobbing]

144
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,469
Because I was afraid.

I let my greed get the better of me.

It's too crowded and dangerous to be here.

150
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,868
I want us to go outside
and start over together.

151
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,328
Tell me.

152
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,873
Would you like that?

153
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,254
Will you join me?

Take your time to decide
if you'd like to come with me.

157
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,358
If you can give me another chance...

158
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,904
meet me right here in front of the vent.

159

You know, this uniform looks familiar.

00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,330
I think there were around four of them.

00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,207
Anyway,

171
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,209
why'd you send them to Bamseom?

172
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,130
You should take those off now.

173
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,550
And I advise you
to fix your habit of being nosy.

174
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,221
Blend in with the others,
and keep your head down.

175
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,807
- You bastard!
- [In-hwan] Lee Dong-jun.

176
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,350
- Go inside.
- [Dong-jun] Sergeant!

177
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,953
[Chi-seong] You're not going anywhere.

178
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,105
You must be punished. You broke the rules.

179
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,564
Ja-yeong,

180
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,734
mistakes need to be corrected.

181
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,778
[suspenseful rock music playing]

182
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
[Dong-jun] Sergeant!

183
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,347
You said symptomatic individuals
can roam freely.

184
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,142
[squeezing]

185

[flesh squelching]

186
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
Are we good now?

187
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,584
How did it go?

188
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,002
[music fades]

189
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,004
Sergeant Tak is symptomatic now.

190
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,094
[door shuts]

191
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,892
[knocking on door]

192
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,984
Ah, nearly locked in. Jeez.

193
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,403
Why were you stuck in there?

194
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,365
Let's say I was ambitious.

195
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,285
So,

196
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,580
what is it you came
to see me for, Sergeant?

197
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,834
I told the special infectees
that I'm symptomatic now.

198
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,418
[gasps]

199
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,797
We need to act while their guard is down.

[bold music playing]

201
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,549
Ah, that's good.

202
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,261
You remember what I said before?

203
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,306
Cutting alone doesn't remove it.

204
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,894
You gotta take advantage and kill them
while they're weak, you know?

205
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,105
So you're saying

206
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,399
I need to face at least one of them
in my current state?

207
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,653
I told you it'd be tough,

208
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,738
but it's better than not having an option.

209
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,823
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

210

Do you know how many of these
are out there?

211
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,828
[monster flesh trickling]

212
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,456
They're everywhere.

213
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,625
But those guys

214
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,754
can't seem to stand the sight of them.

215
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,714
I wonder why.

216
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,217
What is this?

217
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,221
[music fades]

218
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,642

[suspenseful music swells]

225
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,265
[Eun-hyeok] You waited patiently
and you weren't foolish.

226
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,198
No matter what I say,
most people don't listen.

227
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,119
[monster body crackling]

228
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,413
I've seen many die trying to run away.

[monster's footsteps receding]

230
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,923
Meaning you must be different.

231
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,718
You were a great help at Bamseom.

232
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,095
I'm back, thanks to you.

233

[trigger clicks]

234
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,141
But I confirmed
that you were clearly dead.

235
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,062
I'm sure we have a lot
of questions for each other.

236
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,149
Explain yourself.

237
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,902
What kind of monster are you?

238
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,695
It's not like that.

239
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,448
So then what? You control others?

240
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,077
I communicate with them.

241
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,996
Come closer.

242
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,876

[objects clacking]

244
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,426
You asked what I was, right?

245
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,137
Neohuman.

246
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,766
That's what we call ourselves.

247
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,227
[tense music playing]

248
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,356
A peace offering.

249
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,985
Thought it might help our relationship.

250
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,238

What's that cocoon thing?

255
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,747
A heart.

256
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,168
When we return to a heart, we're reborn.

257
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,296
I was symptomatic...

258
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,467
and underwent the monsterization process.

259
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,346
In the past, I was human just like you,

260
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,307
and now I'm a being
that can be born again.

[door opens]

[cocoon gurgling]

[In-hwan] Aside from that...

00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,745
what on earth are these?

268
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
[Sang-won] Ah.

269
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,998
The scraps.

270
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,920
These strange things would visit us
while I was at Bamseom.

[inhales deeply]

278
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,070
So, if they're born again?

279
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,697
I kill them again, simple as that.

280
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,327
They'll endure endless pain
the moment they're reborn.

281
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,747
They'll see me and give up eventually.

282
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,795
So, s-so you're saying
that they're reborn and...

283
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,878
Wait.

[groans]

The next stage of monsterization...

286
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,138
is becoming immortal?

They came here looking for their brothers.

290
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,449
There must be something
that they're not telling us.

[cocoon gurgling]

292
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,917
[Sang-won] They have a real knack
for sniffing each other out.

293
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,673
I've never seen this.

294
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,094
- And if you do see one?
- I'll deal with it and tell you.

295
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,185
They ruined the natural order of things.

296
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,439
The special infectees?

297
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,484
We're most vulnerable in the heart,

298
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,446
and they know
they can take advantage of that.

299
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,116
Then why did they lock you away?

300
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,995
They could've gotten rid of you
when you were in the heart.

301
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,587
[Eun-hyeok] I assume
they needed a better way.

302
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,417
Something faster
than killing us one by one.

303
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,170
So instead of that...

304
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,381
they wanted to locate our home.

The special infectees
headed to the stadium.

00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,182
If they were looking for your home,
why would they go there?

308
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,227
They probably had another motive.

309

You keep on saying "us."

How many people do you think
have become monsters?

It's only a matter of time now

313

before we're all neohuman.

314
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,876
Take me to the stadium.

315
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,338
Tell me what the special infectees
are afraid of first.

Then why do you want to go back?

You don't even have family there.

'Cause it's the only place I can go.

Is that a proposal, then?

You're saying
you'll take care of me, right?

Uh, it wasn't like that.

00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,175
Ugh, she's back so soon.

336
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,468
Clueless brat.

337
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,267
[Ha-ni] Hey, what's wrong?

338
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,270
Where'd Hyun-su go?

339

- [music subdues]
- [laughing continues]

343
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,795
What's so funny?

344
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,838
Let me in on the fun.

345
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,510
I just feel bad seeing you
walking to your own death.

346
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,428
- [laughing]
- Is that right?

347
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,806
You don't feel bad for yourself?

348
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,682
If you face him this time, then...

349
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,143
I know you will die for real.

350
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,898
They won't go easy on you any longer.

[Jae-jin yelps]

354
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,447
The experiments must've messed you up

355
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,449
'cause you only talk nonsense.

356
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,202
That man...

357
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,454
that you so respect...

358
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,541
I'll show you how weak he is.

359
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,670
Will I be able to wake him?

360
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,713
[fire crackling]

361
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,094
A bet like that was always ridiculous.

362
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,141
[sighs] Are you just
gonna let him go like that?

363
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,055
You just found him, though.

364
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,152
[sighs]

365
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,656
[tuts] What's with you?

366
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,283
Let go. I need to go.

367
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,409
Where are you going?

368
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,492
The stadium.

369
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,871
Hyun-su's heading there.

370
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,038
They're all in danger.

371
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,875
Hyun-su is a risk to them all!

372

[tense music playing]

373
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,343
Think you can walk?

374
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,013
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

375
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,766
I'll explain more on the way.

376
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,684
[tense music intensifies]

377
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,698
{\an8}Why did you reject the offer he proposed?

378
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,285
There aren't that many of us
left in the world.

379
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,121
There's no need to do this
for the sake of humans.

380
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,289
That's not why.

[crunching]

382
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,419
The only motive I have for doing this
is for personal reasons.

383
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,840
I only do things for Cha Hyun-su's sake.

384
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,011
You're so fucking lucky
it was only a mistake on your part.

385
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,514
- [thuds]
- [Jae-jin groans]

386
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,517
[Hyun-su] Don't think of it as unfair.

[exhales sharply]

388

There's nothing wrong with the strong
playing with the weak, right?

00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,413
That little piece of shit.

[music fades]

394
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,312
I saw you practicing.

395
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,274
We're able to learn everything fast.

396
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,858
[scoffs]

397
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,530
You don't die,
and you're able to learn fast?

398
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,367
What the hell will you do
with all that power?

399
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,372
We find and gather other neohumans
birthed from hearts.

400
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,165
There's nothing more.

401
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,084
We just exist.

402
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,338
One more question.

403
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,801
What happens to your old memories,
your human ones?

404
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,553
Is that really important?

405
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,309
We've achieved everything we had to.

406
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,853
That is what it means to evolve.

407

[engine starting]

408
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,893
My mom came back again.

409
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,481
I thought that she hated me,

410
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,360
maybe even abandoned me.

411
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,821
But she came to see me.

412
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,743
I didn't want to see her again.

413
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,746
But seeing her face

414
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,290
made me want to leave with her.

415
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,253
But if I go with Mom...

416
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,382
I will...

417
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,678
never see Yeong-su again.

418
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,041
[Yeong-su] When are you leaving?

419
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,103
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

420
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,439
You said she's waiting.

421
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,941
Go with your mom.

422
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,819
I want to see my mom but I can't do that.

423
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,155
She's already dead.

424
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,076
That's why Ms. Cha
is taking care of me instead.

425
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,704
You should go with her
while you still can.

426
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,749
I'm not sure, though.

427
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,876
[Yeong-su] That's a lie. You wanna go.

428
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,254
So you can ask her what your name is.

[gentle music playing]

430
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,056
You left this for me, didn't you?

431
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,058
Mm-hmm, it's yours.

432
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,144
Do you know what this is?

433
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,651
This is my older sister's.

436
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,164
You have to look after each other,
okay, hmm?

[sniffling]

438
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,271
[Yeong-su] But I'd like you
to have it now.

439
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,402
Why?

440
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,323
You said we won't see each other again.

441
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,407
You should take it.

442

You don't wanna go?

450
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,487
No, that's why I'm here.

451
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,571
I wanna go.

452
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
What is it?

453
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,955
I have a question.

454
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,999
Do I...

455
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,419
have a name?

456
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,007
They say all living things have names.

457
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,175
Does that mean...

458
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,432
You have one. Of course you do.

459
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,310
You definitely do.

460

[Kid] Really?

I have missed you.

466
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,935
This is weird
because I look so... different?

467
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,354
I understand.

468
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,818
But you should understand this.

469
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,655
You know the awful state my body was in.

470

You saw it yourself.

I may have moved to a different body, but...

I still ended up going
to Green Home to find you.
