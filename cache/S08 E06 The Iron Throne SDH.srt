1
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,053
(Man groaning quietly)

2
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,610
(Soft groaning)

3
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,031
I'll find you later.

4
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,744
It's not safe.

5
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,832
Let me send some men with you.

6
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,254
I'm going alone.

7
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,595
In the name of the one true queen,
Daenerys Targaryen,

8
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,306
I sentence you to die.

9
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,683
Jon: Grey worm!

10
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,025
It's over.

11
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,361
These men are prisoners.

12
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,738
It is not over until
the queen's enemies are defeated.

13
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,949
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

14
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,992
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

15
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,204
Look around you, friend. We won.

16
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,706
I obey my queen's commands,
not yours.

17
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,125
Jon: And what
are the queen's commands?

18
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,088
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

19
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,674
These are free men.

20
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,134
They chose to fight for her.

21
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,849
Davos: Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

22
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,818
Jon.

23
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,656
We should speak with the queen.

24
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,682
(Soldier groans)

25
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,627
(Faint rustling)

26
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,192
(Breathing shakily)

27
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,640
(Sobbing)

28
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,110
(Sniffles)

29
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,581
(Continues sobbing)

30
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,716
(Whimpers)

31
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,874
(Dothraki shouting indistinctly)

32
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,043
(Horses neighing)

33
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,268
(Shouting continues)

34
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,292
(Drogon roars)

35
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,130
(Sighs)

36
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,175
- (Drogon roaring)
- (Dothraki cheering)

37
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,121
(Drogon roaring)

38
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,421
(Dothraki cheering and ululating)

39
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,731
(Cheering continues)

40
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,613
(Speaking Dothraki)

41
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,824
Blood of my blood.

42
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,287
(Cheering grows quiet)

43
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,418
You kept all your promises to me.

44
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,965
You killed my enemies
in their iron suits.

45
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,884
(Dothraki cheering)

46
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,517
You tore down their stone houses.

47
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,519
(Dothraki cheering)

48
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,818
You gave me the seven kingdoms!

49
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,820
(Roaring)

50
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,906
(Cheering)

51
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,001
Torgo nudho.

52
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,920
(Speaking valyrian)

53
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,924
You have walked beside me
since the Plaza of pride.

54
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,011
You are the bravest of men,
the most loyal of soldiers.

55
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,265
I name you commander
of all my forces,

56
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,311
the queen's master of war.

57
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,484
(Spears continue thumping)

58
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,868
Unsumed.

59
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:17,375
All of you were torn from your
mothers' arms and raised as slaves.

60
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,377
Now...

61
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,838
You are liberators!

62
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:27,009
You have freed the people of king's
landing from the grip of a tyrant!

63
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,514
But the war is not over.

64
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,687
We will not lay down our Spears
until we have liberated

65
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,856
all the people of the world!

66
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,649
(Spears continue thumping)

67
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,694
From winterfell to dorne,

68
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,365
from lannisport to qarth,

69
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,453
from the summer isles to the Jade sea!

70
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,041
Women, men and children

71
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,087
have suffered too long
beneath the wheel.

72
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,380
(Drogon roars)

73
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,885
Will you break the wheel with me?

74
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,261
(Drogon roars)

75
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,768
(Dothraki cheering)

76
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,817
(Drogon screeches)

77
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,987
(Neighing)

78
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,032
(Breathes deeply)

79
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,375
(Drogon roars)

80
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,541
- (Spears continue thumping)
- (Dothraki continue cheering)

81
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,159
(Drogon roars)

82
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,937
(In English) You freed your brother.

83
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,876
You committed treason.

84
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,129
I freed my brother.

85
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,510
And you slaughtered a city.

86
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,409
(Cheering stops)

87
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,426
(Speaks valyrian)

88
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,803
Take him.

89
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,793
What are you doing here?

90
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,632
Hey, what happened?

91
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,467
I came to kill Cersei.

92
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,553
Your queen got there first.

93
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,765
(Arya sighs)

94
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,060
Jon: She's everyone's queen now.

95
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,895
Try telling sansa.

96
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,905
Wait for me outside the city gates.
I'll come find you.

97
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,073
Jon.

98
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,618
She knows who you are.

99
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,955
Who you really are.

100
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,748
You'll always be a threat to her.

101
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,253
And I know a killer when I see one.

102
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,823
(Door closes)

103
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,954
Did you bring any wine?

104
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,461
Well...

105
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,590
Thank you for coming to see me.

106
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,969
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

107
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,515
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

108
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,437
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

109
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,357
Now varys's ashes can tell my ashes:

110
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,735
"See, I told you."

111
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,158
It just occurred to me.

112
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm talking to the only man alive
who knows where I'm going.

113
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,830
(Jon sighs)

114
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,166
So is there life after death?

115
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,962
Not that I've seen.

116
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,799
I should be thankful.

117
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,511
Oblivion is the best
I could hope for.

118
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,180
I strangled my lover.

119
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,434
I shot my own father with a crossbow.
I betrayed my queen.

120
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,019
- You didn't.
- I did.

121
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,149
And I'd do it again,
now that I've seen what I've seen.

122
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,611
I chose my fate.

123
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,405
The people of king's landing did not.

124
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,910
I can'tjustify what happened.

125
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,704
I won't try.

126
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,669
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

127
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,216
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

128
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,261
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

129
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,480
She liberated the people
of slaver's bay.

130
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,608
She liberated the people
of king's landing.

131
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,527
And she'll go on liberating

132
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,613
until the people of the world
are free...

133
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,156
And she rules them all.

134
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,451
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

135
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,744
Until today.

136
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,664
Until today.

137
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,295
Varys was right.

138
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,380
I was wrong.

139
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,258
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

140
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,927
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

141
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,096
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

142
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,348
when we're born
and that's who we are?

143
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,767
Ah, then I'd be fire and blood too.

144
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,272
She's not her father,
no more than you're tywin Lannister.

145
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:23,569
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

146
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,114
Pile up all the bodies
of all the people they ever killed,

147
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,200
there still won't be half as many
as our beautiful queen slaughtered

148
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,452
in a single day.

149
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,661
Cersei left her no choice.

150
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,997
The moment the gates fell,
the battle was over.

151
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,458
She saw her friend beheaded.

152
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,376
She saw her dragon
shot out of the sky.

153
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,837
And she burned down a city for it.

154
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,049
Ah, it's easy to judge when you're
standing far from the battlefield.

155
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,717
Would you have done it?

156
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,637
What?

157
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,766
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

158
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,019
You've had that power.
Would you have burned the city down?

159
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,108
- I don't know.
- (Scoffs)

160
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,526
Yes, you do.

161
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,615
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

162
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,868
But you know.

163
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,462
What's it matter what I'd do?

164
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,423
It matters more than anything.

165
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,639
When she murdered
the slavers of astapor,

166
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,309
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

167
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,187
- After all, they were evil men.
- (Sighs)

168
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,818
When she crucified hundreds of
meereenese nobles, who could argue?

169
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,569
They were evil men.

170
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,282
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

171
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,910
They would have done worse to her.

172
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,541
Everywhere she goes, evil men die

173
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,793
and we cheer her for it.

174
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,629
And she grows more powerful

175
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,008
and more sure
that she is good and right.

176
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:19,184
She believes her destiny is
to build a better world for everyone.

177
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,686
If you believed that...

178
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,605
If you truly believed it,

179
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,609
wouldn't you kill whoever stood
between you and paradise?

180
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,212
(Jon breathes deeply)

181
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,768
I know you love her.

182
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,775
I love her too.

183
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,574
Not as successfully as you.

184
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,956
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

185
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,134
Love is more powerful than reason.

186
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,806
(Sniffles) We all know that.

187
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,307
Look at my brother.

188
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,648
"Love is the death of duty."

189
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,654
(Jon sniffling)

190
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,697
You just came up with that?

191
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,248
Maesteraemon said it
a long time ago.

192
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:14,258
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

193
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,301
(Jon sniffles)

194
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,892
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

195
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,228
You've always tried
to do the right thing.

196
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,980
No matter the cost,

197
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,358
you've tried to protect people.

198
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,655
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

199
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,874
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

200
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,169
It's also the right thing.

201
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,049
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

202
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,681
Who is more dangerous than
the rightful heir to the iron throne?

203
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,851
(Exhales)

204
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,530
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

205
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,291
I'm sorry it came to this.

206
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,842
(Jon knocks on door)

207
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,053
(Guard shouts indistinctly)

208
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,429
And your sisters?

209
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,768
Do you see them bending the knee?

210
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,437
(Keys jangling, footsteps approaching)

211
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,357
My sisters will be loyal
to the throne.

212
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,152
Why do you think sansa
told me the truth about you?

213
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,238
Because she doesn't want dany
to be queen.

214
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,115
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

215
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,659
But you do.

216
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,160
(Door unlocking)

217
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,079
And you have to choose now.

218
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,299
(Snow rustling)

219
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,099
(Growls softly)

220
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,944
(Growling softly)

221
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,205
(Woman vocalizing)

222
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,946
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

223
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,492
with 1,000 swords
from aegon's fallen enemies.

224
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,246
What do 1,000 swords look like

225
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,208
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

226
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,296
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

227
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,964
So many fallen enemies,

228
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,133
you could only see
the soles of aegon's feet.

229
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,345
Jon: I saw them executing
Lannister prisoners in the street.

230
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,556
They said they were acting
on your orders.

231
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,268
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

232
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,103
Have you been down there?

233
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,522
Have you seen?

234
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,274
Children, little children, burned!

235
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,110
(Jon breathing shakily)

236
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,696
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

237
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,244
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

238
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,621
- She thought it would cripple me.
- And Tyrion?

239
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,461
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

240
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,048
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

241
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,259
even when it broke your heart?

242
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,263
Forgive him.

243
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,809
- I can't.
- You can.

244
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,481
You can forgive all of them,
make them see they made a mistake.

245
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,358
Make them understand.

246
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,406
Please, dany.

247
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,954
We can't hide behind small mercies.

248
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,457
The world we need

249
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,294
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

250
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,214
The world we need
is a world of mercy. It has to be.

251
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,632
And it will be.

252
00:34:55,885 --> 00:35:00,682
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

253
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,894
A good world.

254
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,147
How do you know?

255
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,776
How do you know it'll be good?

256
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,570
Because I know what is good.

257
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,156
And so do you.

258
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,575
- I don't.
- You do.

259
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,869
You do. You've always known.

260
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,957
What about everyone else?

261
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,587
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

262
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,300
They don't get to choose.

263
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,432
Be with me.

264
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,144
Build the new world with me.

265
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,772
This is our reason.

266
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,231
It has been from the beginning,

267
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,777
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

268
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,988
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

269
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,658
We do it together.

270
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,537
(Softly) We break the wheel together.

271
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,209
You are my queen.

272
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,588
Now, and always.

273
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
- (Knife stabs)
- (Jon grunts)

274
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,979
(Both breathing raggedly)

275
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,694
(Daenerys gasping)

276
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,657
(Labored and ragged breathing)

277
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,039
(Exhales softly)

278
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,752
(Exhales sharply)

279
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,925
(Sobbing)

280
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,355
(Drogon screeching in distance)

281
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,742
(Drogon roaring)

282
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,881
- (Wingbeats)
- (Heavy thud)

283
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,176
(Drogon roars)

284
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,975
(Growling)

285
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,696
(Jon shudders)

286
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,659
(Drogon groans)

287
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,338
(Growling)

288
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,048
(Jon panting)

289
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,639
(Sniffing)

290
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,192
(Whimpering)

291
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,863
(Whines)

292
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,533
(Growling)

293
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,830
(Snarling)

294
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,667
(High-pitched roaring)

295
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,706
(Panting heavily)

296
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,948
(Growling)

297
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,566
(Panting)

298
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,670
(Heavy rustling)

299
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,402
(Drogon screeches)

300
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,779
(Footsteps approaching)

301
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,323
Where's Jon?

302
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,534
He is our prisoner.

303
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,785
Sansa: So is lord Tyrion.

304
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,829
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

305
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,790
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

306
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,333
This is our city now.

307
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,836
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

308
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,380
you'll find thousands of northmen
who will explain to you

309
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,259
why harming Jon snow
is not in your interest.

310
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,262
And you will find thousands
of unsullied who believe that it is.

311
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,931
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

312
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,183
The ironborn are not.

313
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,144
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

314
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,937
You swore to follow a tyrant.

315
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,856
She freed us from a tyrant.

316
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,357
Cersei is gone because of her,

317
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,901
and Jon snow put a knife
in her heart.

318
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,154
Let the unsullied give him
what he deserves.

319
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,490
Say another word about killing
my brother and I'll cut your throat.

320
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,033
Friends, please.

321
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,038
We've been cutting
each other's throats long enough.

322
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,083
Torgo nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

323
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,338
If it weren't for you and your men,

324
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,924
we would've lost the war
with the dead.

325
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,385
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

326
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,137
but let us try.

327
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,682
There is land in the reach.
Good land.

328
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,310
The people that used to live there
are gone.

329
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,436
Make it your own.

330
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,189
Start your own house
with the unsullied as your bannermen.

331
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,900
We've had enough war.

332
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,152
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

333
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,154
You know how it ends.

334
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,906
We need to find a better way.

335
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,450
We do not need payment.

336
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,035
We need justice.

337
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,286
(Sansa sighs)

338
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,079
Jon snow cannot go free.

339
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,959
It's not for you to decide.

340
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,502
You are not here to speak!

341
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,964
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

342
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,093
You're right.

343
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,596
And no one's any better for it.

344
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,225
(Softly) But it's not
for you to decide.

345
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,270
(In normal voice)
Jon committed his crime here.

346
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,732
His fate is for our king to decide.

347
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,150
Or our queen.

348
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,402
We don't have a king or queen.

349
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,782
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

350
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,202
Choose one.

351
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,628
(Sighs)

352
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,880
Make your choice, then.

353
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,239
My lords and ladies...
(Clears throat)

354
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:30,329
I suppose this is the most important
moment of our lives.

355
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:34,333
What we decide today will reverberate
through the annals of history.

356
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:39,005
I stand before you as one
of the senior lords in the country.

357
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,174
A veteran of two wars.

358
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:48,764
And I like to think my experience has
led to some small skill in statecraft

359
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,057
- and under...
- Sansa: Uncle?

360
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,186
Please sit.

361
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,939
(Scoffs)

362
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,125
(Sword thumps)

363
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,592
(Edmure sighs)

364
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,554
Well, we have to choose someone.

365
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,349
Um... (Clears throat)
Why just us?

366
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,568
We represent all the great houses,
but whomever we choose,

367
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,988
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

368
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,283
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

369
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,576
should be left to...

370
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,704
Well, everyone.

371
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,133
(All laughing)

372
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,846
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

373
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,348
I'll ask my horse.

374
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,110
I suppose you want the crown.

375
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,279
The imp?

376
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,784
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

377
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,953
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

378
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,375
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

379
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:50,177
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

380
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,764
About our bloody history.

381
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,852
About the mistakes we've made.

382
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,656
What unites people?

383
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,452
Armies?

384
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,455
Gold?

385
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,500
Flags?

386
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,925
Stories.

387
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,639
There's nothing in the world
more powerful than a good story.

388
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,602
Nothing can stop it.

389
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,897
No enemy can defeat it.

390
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,275
And who has a better story...

391
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,236
Than bran the broken?

392
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,368
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

393
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:01,957
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

394
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:07,129
He crossed beyond the wall,
a crippled boy,

395
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,381
and became the three-eyed raven.

396
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,345
He is our memory,

397
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,472
the keeper of all our stories.

398
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:21,519
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

399
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,521
Our triumphs,

400
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:26,148
our defeats,

401
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,399
our past.

402
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,071
Who better to lead us
into the future?

403
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,786
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

404
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,246
Good.

405
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,665
Sons of kings
can be cruel and stupid,

406
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,166
as you well know.

407
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,211
His will never torment us.

408
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,593
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

409
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,937
From now on, rulers will not be born.

410
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,943
They will be chosen on this spot by
the lords and ladies of Westeros...

411
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,528
To serve the realm.

412
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,205
I know you don't want it.

413
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,793
I know you don't care about power.

414
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,882
But I ask you now,
if we choose you...

415
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,969
Will you wear the crown?

416
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,765
Will you lead the seven kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

417
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,476
from this day until your last day?

418
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,068
Why do you think I came all this way?

419
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,952
To Brandon of house stark...

420
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,580
I say aye.

421
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,301
Samwell: Aye.

422
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,398
Lord 1: Aye.

423
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,202
Dornish prince: Aye.

424
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,662
Yara: Aye.

425
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,664
Lord 2: Aye. Lord 3: Aye.

426
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,294
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

427
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,894
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

428
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,646
You'll be a good king.

429
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,234
But tens of thousands of northmen
fell in the great war

430
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,319
defending all of Westeros.

431
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,279
And those who survived
have seen too much

432
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,199
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

433
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,663
The north will remain
an independent kingdom,

434
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,541
as it was for thousands of years.

435
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,444
All hail bran the broken,

436
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:02,197
first of his name, king of the andals
and the first men,

437
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:07,828
lord of the six kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

438
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,667
All: All hail bran the broken!

439
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,638
Bran: Lord Tyrion...

440
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,350
You will be my hand.

441
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,269
(Stutters)

442
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,606
No, your grace, I don't want it.

443
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,608
Bran: And I don't want to be king.

444
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,278
I don't deserve it.

445
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,073
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

446
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:49,244
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

447
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,413
(Stutters)

448
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,081
Choose ser davos.

449
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,583
Choose anyone else.

450
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,877
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

451
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,796
Yes, I can.

452
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,298
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

453
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,718
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

454
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,262
He's made many terrible mistakes.

455
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,265
He's going to spend
the rest of his life fixing them.

456
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,814
It is not enough.

457
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,359
(Tyrion sighs)

458
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,866
Tyrion: Giving you to the unsullied
would start a war.

459
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,537
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

460
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,958
So our new king has chosen
to send you to the night's watch.

461
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,628
There's still a night's watch?

462
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,925
The world will always need a home
for bastards and broken men.

463
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,303
(Sighs)

464
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,099
You shall take no wife,

465
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,309
hold no lands,

466
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,936
father no children.

467
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,067
The unsullied wanted your head
of course,

468
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,320
but grey worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

469
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,449
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

470
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:14,246
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

471
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,873
No one is very happy.

472
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,668
Which means it's a good compromise,
isuppose.

473
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,921
Was it right?

474
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,551
What I did?

475
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,055
What we did.

476
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,811
It doesn't feel right.

477
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,945
Ask me again in 10 years.

478
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,638
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

479
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,810
I wouldn't be so sure.

480
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,480
A few years as hand of the king

481
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,399
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

482
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,570
(Breath es shakily)

483
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,604
(Sighs)

484
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,155
(Birds calling)

485
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,535
(Horse neighs)

486
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,292
(Man shouts indistinctly)

487
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,678
(People chattering indistinctly)

488
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,041
(Both speaking valyrian)

489
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,418
All the men have boarded.

490
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,003
Good.

491
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,549
We sail for the isle of naath.

492
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,582
Sansa: I wish
there 'd been another way.

493
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,127
Can you forgive me?

494
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,552
(Breathes deeply)

495
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,850
The north is free, thanks to you.

496
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,771
But they lost their king.

497
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,608
Ned stark's daughter
will speak for them.

498
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,987
She's the best they could ask for.

499
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,636
You can come see me, you know,
at castle black.

500
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,597
I can't.

501
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:46,059
You think anyone will dare tell you
women aren't allowed?

502
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,561
(Chuckles)

503
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,233
I'm not going back north.

504
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,403
Where are you going?

505
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,657
What's west of Westeros?

506
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,953
(Chuckles) I don't know.

507
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,329
No one knows.

508
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,791
It's where all the maps stop.

509
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,587
That's where I'm going.

510
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,638
You have your needle?

511
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,016
Right here.

512
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,732
(Arya sniffles, cries softly)

513
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,331
Your grace.

514
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,134
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

515
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,931
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

516
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,152
(Sighs heavily)

517
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,746
(Exhales)

518
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,618
(Breathes deeply)

519
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,206
(Door opens)

520
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,422
(Clears throat)

521
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,476
(Chairs scraping)

522
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,644
That's not... uh...

523
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,276
What's this?

524
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,153
A song of ice and fire.

525
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,947
Archmaester ebrose's history
of the wars

526
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,325
following the death of king Robert.

527
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,577
I helped him with the title.

528
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,999
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

529
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,543
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

530
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:48,254
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

531
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,968
He's not kind?

532
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,387
- He...
- Tyrion: He what?

533
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:58,932
What does he say about me?

534
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,441
I don't believe you're mentioned.
(Clears throat)

535
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,041
(Door opens)

536
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,126
(Clears throat loudly)

537
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,170
(Bronn clears throat)

538
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,339
- Your grace.
- Your grace.

539
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,632
- Your grace.
- Your grace.

540
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,225
(Tyrion clears throat)

541
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,445
We appear to be missing
a master of whisperers.

542
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,655
And a master of laws.

543
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,783
- And a master of war.
- Yes, your grace.

544
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,535
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

545
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,620
for an audience in the coming weeks.

546
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,583
And drogon? Any word?

547
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,543
He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

548
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,836
The farther away, the better.

549
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,339
Perhaps I can find him.

550
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,925
Do carry on with the rest.

551
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,970
As you wish, your grace.

552
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,640
Ser podrick.

553
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,690
(Tyrion clears throat)

554
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,110
We serve at your pleasure,
king bran the broken,

555
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,863
ruler of the six kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

556
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,866
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

557
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,826
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

558
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,286
Long may he reign.

559
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,997
That will improve.

560
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,458
I'm sure it will.

561
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,298
(Samwell and davos clear throat)

562
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,176
Ser bronn of the Blackwater,

563
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,427
lord of highgarden,

564
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,680
lord Paramount of the reach
and master of coin,

565
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,225
would you say the crown's debt to you
has been paid?

566
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,061
In full, my lord hand.

567
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,354
Good.

568
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,689
Time to start incurring a new one.

569
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,066
We have hungry people to feed.

570
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,942
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

571
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,694
Bronn: Indeed we can.

572
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:20,323
Lord davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

573
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,575
We have.
These projects will begin as soon as

574
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:26,537
the master of coin and lord
of lofty titles provides funding.

575
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,207
The master of coin looks foward
to helping the master of ships,

576
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,001
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

577
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,795
or soon there won't be no more coin.

578
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,088
"Any more."

579
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,631
You master of grammar now too?

580
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,132
Grandmaester... (Clears throat)

581
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,261
It is my theory, based on my years
of work on the casterly rock sewers,

582
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,347
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

583
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,974
The archmaester has done
some research on this subject

584
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,477
- and it turns out...
- The strong live and the weak don't.

585
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,730
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

586
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:56,234
Bronn: Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

587
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,112
The master of coin
is willing to fund reconstruction.

588
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,073
Samwell: Uh, the archmaester
is less than enthusiastic

589
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,492
about the salutary effects
of brothels.

590
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,786
Bronn: Well, I imagine
he isn't using them properly.

591
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,873
Brienne: I think we can all agree that
ships take precedence over brothels.

592
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,292
Bronn: I think that's
a very presumptuous statement.

593
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,798
Tyrion: I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

594
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,636
(Wind whistling)

595
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,141
(Horn blowing)

596
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,499
(Takes deep breath)

597
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,497
(Soft whining, panting)

598
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:48,215
(Ghost snuffling)

599
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,351
Man: The queen in the north!

600
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,311
All: (Chanting)
The queen in the north!

601
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,021
The queen in the north!

602
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,773
The queen in the north!

603
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,149
The queen in the north!

604
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,943
The queen in the north!

605
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,601
(Wind whistling)

606
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,711
(Wildlings chattering indistinctly)

607
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,860
(Gate closing)

608
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,466
(Choir singing)
