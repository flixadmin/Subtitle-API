I can tell you
where Thanos is.

209
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,200
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

210
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,880
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

211
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,120
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

212
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
I'd ask...

213
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,920
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

214
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
And his answer
was always the same.

215
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
"To the Garden."

216
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,000
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

217
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,720
So, where is he?

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,120
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

219
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

220

it's gonna end any differently

that we could enter
the quantum realm

491
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,800
at a certain point in time...

492
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,440
but then exit
the quantum realm

493
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,680
at another point in time?

494
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,200
Like...

495
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,040
-Like before Thanos.
-STEVE: Wait.

496
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,760
Are you talking
about a time machine?

497
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,720
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

498
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,920
This is more like a...

499
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,880
Yeah. Like a time machine.

500
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,840
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

501
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,040
(STAMMERS) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

502
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,360
There's gotta be...

503
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
some way... (SIGHS)

504
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
-It's crazy.
-NATASHA: Scott.

505
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,840
I get emails from a raccoon...

506
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

507
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
So, who do we talk to
about this?

508
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,200
Chow time!

509
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,720
Maguna.

510
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,360
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

511
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

512
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,760
<i>-or be disintegrated.</i>
-Okay.

513
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,640
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

514
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,120
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

515
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm making for Mom.

516
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,640
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

517
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,720
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

518
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,600
-No.
-That's what you want.

519
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,880
How did you find this?

520
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,880
-Garage.
-Really?

521
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
-Were you looking for it?
-No.

522
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,800
-I found it, though.
-Hmm.

523
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,720
You like
going in the garage, huh?

524
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,840
So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)

525
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,760
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

526
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,720
So, I'm gonna...

527
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,760
(STAMMERS) No.
We know what it sounds like.

528
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,880
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

529
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
is anything really impossible?

530
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,280
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

531
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,120
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

532
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,240
Can we agree on that?

533
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,480
Thank you.

534
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,760
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

535
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,360
-I did.
-No.

536
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,400
You accidentally survived.
(SIGHS)

537
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,640
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

538
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,920
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

539
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,280
A time heist?

540
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,600
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

541
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,880
Why didn't we think
of this before?

542
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,520
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

543
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,760
The stones are in the past.

544
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,160
We could go back,
we could get them.

545
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,640
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

546
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,720
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

547
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
I don't believe we would.

548
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,000
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

549
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,600
However, high hopes
won't help...

550
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,720
if there's no logical,
tangible way

551
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,280
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

552
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,320
I believe
the most likely outcome

553
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
will be our collective demise.

554
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,320
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

555
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,160
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

556
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,800
no betting on sporting events.

557
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

558
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,000
Are you seriously telling me

559
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,880
that your plan
to save the universe...

560
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,720
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

561
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,600
-Is it?
-No.

562
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
Good. You had me
worried there.

563
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,920
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

564
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,400
That's not how
quantum physics works.

565
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,720
Tony.

566
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,120
We have to take a stand.

567
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,680
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

568
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,320
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

569
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,360
You got a wife, a daughter.

570
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,040
But I lost someone
very important to me.

571
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
A lotta people did.

572
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,960
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

573
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,280
to bring everyone back,

574
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

575
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,760
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

576
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,800
-I can't.
-(DOOR CLOSES)

577
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,200
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

578
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,280
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

579
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,800
Good job. I'm saved.

580
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,600
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

581
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,800
Anything else.

582
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,680
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

583
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,120
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

584
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,720
Tony. I get it.

585
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,200
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

586
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,480
But this is a second chance.

587
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,600
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

588
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,320
Can't roll the dice on it.

589
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,320
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

590
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Well, he's scared.

591
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,560
STEVE: He's not wrong.

592
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,760
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

593
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,120
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

594
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
No, I wanna do it right.

595
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,920
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

596
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
Bigger than his?

597
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,480
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

598
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,600
Try some of that.

599
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
Have some eggs.

600
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,520
I'm so confused.

601
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,360
These are confusing times.
(CHUCKLES)

602
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,360
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

603
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

604
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
I know, it's crazy.

605
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,760
I'm wearing shirts now.

606
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,760
Yeah. What? How? Why?

607
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,560
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

608
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,840
Except it was worse for me...

609
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
'cause I lost twice.

610
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,160
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

611
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,360
and then, we all lost.

612
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
No one blamed you, Bruce.

613
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,240
I did.

614
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,240
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

615
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,480
like he's
some kind of disease...

616
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,000
something to get rid of.

617
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,440
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

618
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,120
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

619
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,880
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

620
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
and now, look at me.

621
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,680
Best of both worlds.

622
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,760
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

623
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,280
Can we get a photo?

624
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
100%, little person.

625
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,880
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

626
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,360
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-SMART HULK: Thanks.

627
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,040
Say "green."

628
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,440
-FANS: Green.
-Green.

629
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Did you get that?

630
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,960
That's a good one.

631
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,000
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

632
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,600
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

633
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,840
-Nobody does.
-No, he wants you to take

634
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,640
-a picture with him.
-I don't want a picture.

635
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,800
BOY 1: Stranger danger.

636
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,400
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

637
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

638
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,720
But come on. The kid...

639
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,200
I don't want a picture
with them.

640
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
-He's gonna feel bad.
-Sorry.

641
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,800
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

642
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,440
SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
BOY 2: We can do it.

643
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,560
-SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
-Take the goddamn phone.

644
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,840
SMART HULK: Okay.

645
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

646
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,680
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

647
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,520

974
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,960
Ratchet, how's it going?

975
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
It's Rocket.

976
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,840
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

980
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
I'm being very careful.

981
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,000
No, you're being very Hulky.

982
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
I'm being careful.

983
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,600
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

984
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,040
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

985
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,360
out of existence, this is it.

986
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,200
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

-Scott, calm down.
-SCOTT: Sorry.

988

00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,520
I'll do it.

SMART HULK:
Clint, now you're gonna feel

998
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,880
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

999
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Don't worry about that.

1000
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,200
RHODES: Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

1001
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,000
If we can do this, you know...

1002
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,480
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

1003
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,800
You know, and...

1004
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,920
First of all, that's horrible.

1005
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It's Thanos.

1006
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,160
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

1007
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,480
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

1008
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,040
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

1009
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,360
before Thanos gets them...

1010
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,280
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

1011
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,280
-Bingo.
-That's not how it works.

1012
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,360
Well, that's what I heard.

1013
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,600
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

1014
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,560
<i>Star Trek,</i>
<i>Terminator, Timecop...</i>

00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,320

No, that's not one.

1022
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,520
This is known.

1023
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,880
I don't know
why everyone believes that,

1024
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,040
but that isn't true.

1025
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,120
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

1026
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,600
that past becomes
your future...

1027
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,720
and your former present
becomes the past...

1028
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,520
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

1029
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,920
Exactly.

1030
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,360
So <i>Back to the Future</i>

Yeah. Yeah. (PANTING)

1053
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,560
It worked.

1054
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,720
It worked.

1055
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,680
STEVE: Okay, so the how works.

1056
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,400
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

1057
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,000
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

1058
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,840
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1059
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,520
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

1060
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,760
for "damn near been killed"

1061
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,280
by one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1062
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,600
Well, I haven't...

1063
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,680
but I don't even know

1064
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,120
what the hell
you're all talking about.

1065
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,160
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

1066
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,040
for one round-trip each.

1067
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,400
And these stones have been

1068
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,400
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1069
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,880
Our history.

1070
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,040
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1071
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,000
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1072
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,720
Correct.

1073
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,680
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1074
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,040
Thor, what do you know?

1075
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,840
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

1076
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,560
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1077
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,320
Uh, where to start? Um...

1078
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,520
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1079
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,800
Someone called it
a stone before.

1080
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,200
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1081
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,000
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1082
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,240
and stop saying that.

1083
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,240
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1084
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,280
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1085
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,960
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1086
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,840
Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Scary beings.

1087
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,720
So, Jane, actually...

1088
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,840
Oh, there she is.

1089
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,680
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1090
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,880
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1091
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,880
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1092
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,080
and she became
very, very sick.

1093
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,160
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1094
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,400
which is where I'm from...

1095
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,520
and we had to try and fix her.

1096
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,320
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1097
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,880
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1098
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,240
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

1099
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,160
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1100
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,160
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1101
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,240
(MOUTHING)

1102
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,480
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1103
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,960
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1104
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,880
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

1105
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,600
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1106
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,080
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

1107
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,120
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1108
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,360
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1109
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,640
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1110
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,440
-SMART HULK: Is that a person?
-No, Morag's a planet.

1111
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,520
Quill was a person.

1112
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,600
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1113
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,200
Oh, look.

1114
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,960
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1115
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,320
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1116
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,600
I'll take you to space.

1117
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,920
NEBULA: Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1118
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,040
What is Vormir?

1119
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,360
NEBULA: A dominion of death...

1120
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,960
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1121
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,880
It's where
Thanos murdered my sister.

1122
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,120

1123
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,320

NATASHA: That Time Stone guy.
SMART HULK: Doctor Strange.

1125
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,680
NATASHA: Yeah,
what kind of doctor was he?

1126

TONY: Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

SMART HULK: Nice place
in the Village, though.

1128
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,040
TONY: Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1129
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,240
SMART HULK:
Mm... Bleecker Street.

but we can erase it.

1514
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,400
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1515

01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,400
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1924
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,920
You wanna know
how he does that?

1925
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:24,480
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1926
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
That's enough.

01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,240
You disgust me.

1930
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,440
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1931
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,840
How do I look?

1932
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,400
Wow.

1933
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,520
Under different
circumstances...

1934
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,720
this would be totally awesome.

NATASHA: (GROANS)
I bet the raccoon

1936
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,680
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1937
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,760
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1938
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,480
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

Oh, good.

You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

For the other...

In order to take the stone...

1958
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,600
you must lose
that which you love.

1959
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:01,120
An everlasting exchange.

Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1964
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,280
No.

1965
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:21,120
I don't think so.

1966
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,000
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1967
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:26,560
I didn't.

1968
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,400
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1969
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:32,640
without his daughter.

1970
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,880
That's not a coincidence.

1971
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,600
Yeah.

1972
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,200
Whatever it takes.

1973
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,200
Whatever it takes.

1974
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,520
If we don't get that stone...

1975
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,360
billions of people stay dead.

1976
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,400
Yeah.

1977
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,400
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1978
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,320
I guess we do.

1979
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,880
I'm starting to think we mean

1980
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:16,480
different people here,
Natasha.

1981
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,800
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1982
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,240
Get to right here.

1983
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,400
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1984
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,760
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1985
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,920
What, you think I wanna do it?

1986
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,280
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1987
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,760
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1988
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,880
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1989
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,360
You know what I've become.

1990
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,080
Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1991
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:48,480
Maybe you should.

1992
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,920
You didn't.

1993
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:59,280
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1994
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,600
Okay.

1995
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,880
You win.

Let me go.

No.

No. Please, no.

this actually worked?

Yeah.

Us.

What?

01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:05,840
Huh?

-What are you doing?
-Just asked him a question.

2024
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,520
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

2025

Why are we acting
like she's dead?

2026
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,120
We have the stones, right?

2027
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,320
As long as we have
the stones...

2028
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,240
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

2029
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,400
So, stop this shit. We're the
Avengers. Get it together.

What?

It can't.

Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

2036
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,320
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

2037
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,800
And we're talking
about space magic.

2038
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,960
And "can't" seems very
definitive. Don't you think?

isn't here, is she?

It can't be undone.

Or that's at least

2045
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:47,360
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

2046

Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

2047
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:52,240
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

It was supposed to be me.

2049
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:07,360
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

2050
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,000
She bet her life on it.

She's not coming back.

We have to make it worth it.

We have to.

01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,640
We will.

All right, the glove's ready.

01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,960
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

-I'll do it.

Thor. Just wait.

2064
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:09,040
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

2065
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

2066
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,320
waiting for
the right opportunity?

2067
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:13,640
We should at least discuss it.

2068
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,760
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

2069
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,640
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

-It's my duty.

Just let me do something good.
Something right.

2077
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,240
Look, it's not
just the fact...

2078
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,520
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

2079
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,520
to light up a continent.

I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

SAM: You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2577
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:39,360
You're a good man, Sam.

2578
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:41,440
This one's on me, though.

2579
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:47,840
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2580
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:50,920
How can I?

2581
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:52,880
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2582
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:02,240
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2583
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,120
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

How long is this gonna take?

2586
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:16,320
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2587
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:22,640
You ready, Cap?

2588
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:25,240
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

Where is he?

2598
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:52,160
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2599
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:53,760
He should be here.

2600
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:00,200
SAM: Get him back.

2601
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:01,480
SMART HULK: I'm trying.
SAM: Get him the hell back.

-Hey, I said I'm trying.
-Sam.

2603
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:29,080
Go ahead.

Cap?

2605
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:51,920
Hi, Sam.

2606
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:57,960
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2607
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:03,920
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2608
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,400
maybe...

2609
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:11,680
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2610
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:15,800
How'd that work out for ya?

2611
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:19,720
It was beautiful.

2612
02:46:21,080 --> 02:46:22,760
Good. I'm happy for you.

Thank you.

Only thing bumming me out...

2616
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,360
is the fact
I have to live in a world

2617

02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:15,680
How does it feel?

2622
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:20,000
Like it's someone else's.

2623
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:24,200

You wanna tell me about her?

No.
