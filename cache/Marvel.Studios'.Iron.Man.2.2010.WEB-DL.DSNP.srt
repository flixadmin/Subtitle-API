00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,120
Dig in. What do we
have today, Jack?

756
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,480
We have some
salmon carpaccio.

757
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,520
HAMMER:
Salmon carpaccio.

758
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,840
Mmm-mmm.
Anything you want
here, we got it.

759
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,000
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in
from San Francisco.

760
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,960
It's Italian, though.

761
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,840
Organic ice cream.

762
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,840
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do,
too, for Tony Stark.

763
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,560
What I saw you
do to Tony Stark
on that track,

764
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,320
how you stepped up
to him in front of
God and everybody,

765
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,520
that was... Wow!

766
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,160
You spoke to me
with what you did.

767
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,720
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

768
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,200
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off
to God knows where.

769
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,360
It would have been
such a waste of talent.

770
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,760
But if I might
make a suggestion,

771
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,560
you know,
you don't just go and
try and kill the guy.

772
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,080
I think, if I may,
you go after his legacy.
That's what you kill.

773
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,160
You and me,
we are a lot alike
in a lot of ways.

774
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,880
The only difference
between you and I is
that I have resources.

775
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,120
I think, if I may,

776
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,200
you need my resources.
Someone behind you,
a benefactor.

777
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,360
I'd like to be that guy.

778
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,600

Okay. Do you
speak English?

782
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,560
Because I can
get a translator.

783
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,480
I don't know. Have you
been understanding
everything I'm saying?

I want my bird.

A bird? You want a bird?

792
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,520
I want my bird.

00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,840
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

I want my bird.

795

Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible.
I could...

796
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,280
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird
back in Russia?

Listen. I've been
on the phone with
the National Guard all day,

821
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,920
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH,

knocking down
your front door
and taking these.

823

They're gonna take
your suits, Tony, okay?
They're sick of the games.

824

You have become
a problem, a problem
I have to deal with.

Contrary to your belief,
you are not the center
of my universe.

(GROANS) Oh, God,
are you gonna steal
my kidney and sell it?

1072
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,360
Could you please
not do anything awful
for five seconds?

1073

What did she
just do to me?

What did we
just do for you?

1075

That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

We're trying to get
you back to work.

Give me a couple
of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

It's not a cure,
it just abates
the symptoms.

Doesn't look like
it's gonna be an easy fix.

Trust me, I know.
I'm good at this stuff.

That's the bird.
This is the bird. Yeah!

1090
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,960
Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.
This is a great bird.

1091
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
It's a beautiful bird.

Wait a minute.
Jack, what is that?

1100
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,080
Is that...
That's not a helmet.
What is that?

1101
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,520
Um...

1102
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,120
Ivan...
What's this? Jack.

1103
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,160
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look
like a helmet to me.

1104
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,800
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

1105
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,680
Jack, could you put
your head in there?
No.

1106
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,000
Try to put your
head in there.

1107
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,040
Go ahead. Try to put
your head in there.

1108
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,520
See, Ivan? He can't put his
head in there. That's...

1109
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,200
That's not a helmet.
It's a head. I need
to put a guy in there.

1110
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,680
I need to fit
a person in that suit.

Why is drone better?

Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

Justin Hammer's
making a weapons
presentation at the Expo.

to introduce it.

Sir, I don't believe
that the Expo...

Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

We've got to make
this happen.

1135
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,800
Yes, General,
but...

1136
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,880
It's also an order.

1137
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,560
Yes, sir.

1138
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,440
Good work, Colonel.
You've made
your country proud.

1139
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,080
Thank you, sir.

1140
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:02,000
That thing in your
chest is based on
unfinished technology.

1141
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,040
No, it was finished.
It has never been
particularly effective

1142
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,320
until I miniaturized
it and put it in my...

1143
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,520
No. Howard said
the arc reactor

1144
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,360
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

1145
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,960
He was about to kick off
an energy race that was
gonna dwarf the arms race.

1146
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,200
He was on to something big,
something so big

1147
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,160
that it was gonna make
the nuclear reactor

1148
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,200
look like a triple-A battery.

1149
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,840
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko
in on this, too?

1150
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,000
Anton Vanko is the
other side of that coin.

1151
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,120
Anton saw it as
a way to get rich.

1152
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,560
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

1153
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,560
When the Russians
found out
he couldn't deliver,

1154
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,200
they shipped his
ass off to Siberia

1155
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,000
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

1156
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,680
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

1157
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,880
the son you had the
misfortune of crossing
paths with in Monaco.

1158
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,560
You told me I hadn't
tried everything.

1159
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,880
What do you mean
I haven't tried everything?
What haven't I tried?

1160
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,240
He said that
you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

1161
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,360
to finish what he started.

1162
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,960
He said that?
Mmm.

1163
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,720
Are you that guy?
Hmm? Are you?

1164
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:07,120
'Cause if you are,
then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

1165
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,880
I don't know
where you get
your information,

1166
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,200
but he wasn't
my biggest fan.

1167
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,680
What do you remember
about your dad?

1168
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,440
He was cold,
he was calculating.

1169
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,560
He never told me
he loved me.

1170
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,280
He never even
told me he liked me,

1171
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,920
so it's a little
tough for me to digest

1172
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,520
when you're telling me
he said the whole future
was riding on me

1173
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,560
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

1174
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,920
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

1175
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,440
was when he shipped me off
to boarding school.

1176
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,600
That's not true.

1177
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,360
Well, then, clearly
you knew my dad
better than I did.

1178
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,440
As a matter of fact, I did.
He was one of the founding
members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1179
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,720
What?

1180
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,240
I got a 2:00.

1181
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1182
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,960
What's this?
Okay,
you're good, right?

1183
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,800
No, I'm not good.
You got this?
Right? Right?

1184
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,760
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

1185
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,080
Natasha will remain
a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

1186
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,320
You remember
Agent Coulson, right?

1187
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,440
Yeah.

1188
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,000
Oh, and Tony,

1189
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,320
remember,
I got my eye on you.

1190
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,600
We've disabled
all communications.

1191

No contact with
the outside world.

1192
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,040
Good luck.

1193
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,360
Please.

1194
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,800
First thing, I need
a little bodywork.

1195
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,160
I'll put in a little
time at the lab.

one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

Cross Creek,
for a Starbucks run,

1198
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,120
or something like that,
that'd be nice.

1204
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,480
Okay?

1205
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,760
I think I got it, yeah.

1206
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,720
Enjoy your evening's
entertainment.

1207

Okay.

These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas,

1247
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,760

cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine
