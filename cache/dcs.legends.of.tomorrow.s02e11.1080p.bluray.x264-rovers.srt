00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,218
RORY: <i>Seriously, you idiots
haven't figured this out by now?</i>

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:09,093
<i>It all started when we blew up
the time pigs, the Time Masters.</i>

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,978
<i>Now, history is all screwed up.</i>

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,230
<i>But it's up to us to unscrew it up.</i>

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,434
<i>But half the time
we screw things up even worse.</i>

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,852
<i>So, don't call us heroes.</i>

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,019
<i>We're something else.</i>

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,813
<i>We're legends.</i>

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,277
<i>Who writes this crap anyway?</i>

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,451
SARA:
<i>Previously, on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,456
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,538
Yes, it was the spear that was reportedly
used to penetrate the side of Christ,

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,452
after he died on the cross.

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,249
And now it can be used to rewrite
reality itself.

15
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,416
And what would the speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,506
He could just go back
and change history himself.

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,719
Changes to history cause timequakes
and Aberrations which we can undo.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,930
Changes to reality, however,
those are permanent.

19
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,219
- Who's coming for you?
- It's not a who.

20
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,059
It's a... It's a... A what.

21
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,481
He can sense the Speed Force.

22
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,526
And it's trying to kill me.

23
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,487
You created an interface between
a mystical relic from the first century

24
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,573
<i>and a 22nd-century supercomputer.</i>

25
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,827
GIDEON: <i>A deep scan reveals that.</i>

26
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,241
<i>Captain Hunter's neural architecture
has been reprogrammed with a new identity.</i>

27
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,584
EOBARD: <i>It's a mnemonic archive
designed to store memories.</i>

28
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,747
<i>Rip Hunter's.</i>

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,088
Including the locations
of the other pieces of the Spear, I hope.

30
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,424
We would hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,090
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

32
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,883
<i>to redress some of his shortcomings.</i>

33
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,767
Can I help you with something, soldier?

34
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,937
Uh, no, General Washington. I'm fine.

35
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,686
You, on the other hand...

36
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,270
RIP: <i>Stand at ease!</i>

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,690
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

38
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,488
General Washington is dead.

39
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,200
RIP: Now, I know that you would all like
nothing more

40
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,081
than to return home
from these godforsaken colonies,

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,789
but the rebellion is not yet quelled.

42
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,830
The fight is not yet finished.

43
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,132
But that doesn't mean
we have to fight fair, now, does it?

44
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,095
These Americans,

45
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,675
they call themselves patriots,

46
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,478
<i>but they will die as traitors.</i>

47
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,264
Grab yourselves a rifle, lads!

48
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,071
After all, it's Christmas.

49
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,119
You killed George Washington.

50
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,279
Yes, I know.

51
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,164
Well, that should get
my former teammates' attention.

52
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,126
And when they travel back in time
to save him,

53
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,628
I'll be there waiting for them
with open arms.

54
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,084
Well, not too open, I hope.

55
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,716
Now, have no fear, Mr. Thawne.
I have no lingering attachment.

56
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,885
Ah, in that case, kill them all,

57
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,305
collect their fragment
of the Spear of Destiny

58
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,056
and bring it to me.

59
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,771
Whoever knew
time travel would be so much fun?

60
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,232
How long until Lily's interface

61
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,367
tracks down another piece
of the Spear of Destiny?

62
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,279
I don't know. I'm beginning to think
our supercomputer is not so super.

63
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,992
GIDEON: <i>I heard that.</i>

64
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,749
<i>You try processing 1.2 zettabytes of data.</i>

65
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,752
Rip's probably being tortured
by the Legion of Doom right now.

66
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,709
The sooner we can locate
another piece of the Spear,

67
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,873
the sooner we can set a trap
and rescue him.

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,714
GIDEON: <i>I could always reroute power
to my sub-neural processing unit</i>

69
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,298
<i>by shutting off life support.</i>

70
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,589
Oh, you're lippy this morning, Gideon.

71
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:34,965
I like it.

72
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,759
GIDEON: <i>I wasn't joking.</i>

73
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,016
Old buddy, old pal. New news.

74
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,225
Found rat droppings in my room.

75
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,685
You're telling me this because?

76
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,522
'Cause rats follow crumbs,
crumbs you drop any time you eat anything.

77
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,612
What would you have me do,
use a knife and fork?

78
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,568
I would have you clean up after yourself.

79
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:51,948
We've been all over time.

80
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,734
That rat could have bubonic plague.

81
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,952
I've overstepped. I see that now.

82
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,796
You know, I thought I was gonna hate
Ray's chore wheel,

83
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,797
<i>but breakfast duty is kind of fun.</i>

84
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,924
And it tastes way better
than the food fabricator.

85
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,636
- It feels almost normal.
- Right?

86
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,093
I don't know what day of the week it is.
That, I don't know how they got used to.

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,724
See, that's the problem
with the temporal zone.

88
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,931
You don't know if it's Sunday,
you don't know if it's Monday,

89
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,811
and Sunday should feel different
than Monday.

90
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,938
I love what we do, I do.

91
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,397
It's just sometimes, I just wish
I could get off the ship.

92
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,106
- Yeah, exactly.
- Hmm.

93
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,024
I just want to breathe some fresh air
and see some trees.

94
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,988
You know, when I first moved
from Zambesi to D.C.,

95
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,449
I used to go camping every weekend.

96
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,535
I just love being outside,
under the stars.

97
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,541
That sounds terrible,
and cold and miserable.

98
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,704
I'm a city guy and
that does not work for me whatsoever.

99
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,507
What? Is there something on my face?

100
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,924
A little.

101
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,502
Can you please get it off?

102
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,669
Okay.

103
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,600
- Um, I should go get the...
- No, um...

104
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,317
Urn, what was that?

105
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,732
- Hmm...
- Did you guys feel that timequake?

106
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,111
Must have been
a monster Aberration. Gideon?

107
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,618
GIDEON: <i>The shockwave's point of origin
was December 25th, 1776.</i>

108
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,740
That's the night George Washington led
the Continental Army across the Delaware.

109
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:23,907
GIDEON: <i>I'm afraid not.</i>

110
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,247
<i>General Washington
was murdered that Christmas.</i>

111
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,252
SARA: <i>This is a trap.</i>

112
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,122
It's Chicago all over again.

113
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,925
Thawne and his buddies are trying
to lure us into 1776.

114
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,007
- Very effectively, I might add.
- Yeah.

115
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,263
You wish to speak, Mr. Rory?

116
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,425
I notice the death of our forefather
hasn't diminished your appetite.

117
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,309
Mmm. Washington's a punk.

118
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,096
He led America to independence
and became its first president.

119
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,482
Without Washington,
America wouldn't have democracy.

120
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,941
Or Hamilton.

121
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,603
If Washington's so cool,
why is he on the $1 bill?

122
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,522
And Franklin's on the $100 bill.
Now, he's cool.

123
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,863
He is cool, but he didn't lead the troops
across the Delaware in a sneak attack.

124
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,117
Washington did.

125
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,030
And if that offensive fails,
the American Revolution fails,

126
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,119
and the United States ceases to exist.

127
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,784
Like I said, trap.

128
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,623
Well, surely,
you're not suggesting we do nothing?

129
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,372
No. We have to save Washington.

130
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,965
We just need to be careful about it.

131
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,085
Let's buckle up.

132
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,301
Wait, how do we even know
where to find Washington?

133
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,965
DR. HEYWOOD:
The night before crossing the Delaware,

134
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,011
Washington was in Pennsylvania
at the home of William Keith.

135
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,554
So, we're just gonna break into
someone's house on Christmas Eve?

136
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,223
Yep, just like Santa.

137
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,982
Keith would have thrown
a Christmas banquet

138
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,814
- for Washington and his men.
- Ah.

139
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,645
Secret mission on Christmas Eve.

140
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,987
SARA: Congratulations, Mick.

141
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,319
You just became a private in the US Army.

142
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,325
Nate, Amaya,
you two will pose as wealthy newlyweds

143
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,408
<i>eager to make a contribution
to the revolutionary cause.</i>

144
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,199
Jax and Stein,
quarterback the mission from the ship.

145
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,992
The first sign of trouble,
you Firestorm up.

146
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,582
Ray, I need you to miniaturize down
in the Atom suit.

147
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,918
A toy in a Christmas stocking.

148
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,916
SARA: <i>And run reconnaissance.</i>

149
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,591
All right.

150
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,219
Let's go save America.

151
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,871
ATOM: A Christmas banquet in 1776.

152
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,250
- This is so...
- Stupid.

153
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,377
- ATOM: Where's your Christmas spirit?
- Ho-ho-ho.

154
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,215
Ah, you're from Boston.

155
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,214
Tell me, are you familiar
with the Sons of Liberty?

156
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,225
Oh, intimately. My wife and I are avid...

157
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,769
We're avid supporters.

158
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,563
This is your wife?

159
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,811
- Yes.
- We're newlyweds actually.

160
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,226
- Brand new.
- Ah.

161
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,393
Well, they, um...

162
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,733
They certainly do things differently
up in Boston.

163
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,566
Could I interest you
in a glass of eggnog, ma'am?

164
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,109
Thanks.

165
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,156
It's got a kick.

166
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,574
It's my wife Martha's recipe.

167
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,454
A little heavy on the rum,

168
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,917
but in these trying times
I believe extra rum is warranted.

169
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,171
"Martha"?

170
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,425
You're George Washington.

171
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,134
At your service.

172
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,139
Now tell me, from which of
our 13 fair colonies do you hail from?

173
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,304
SARA: <i>The first one.</i>

174
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,809
Get him out of there, Sara.

175
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,262
General Washington, we have to go.

176
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,648
I don't have time to explain,
but your life is in danger.

177
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,028
GEORGE WASHINGTON: Hold position!

178
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,112
- We need to go.
- I will not retreat.

179
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,284
- I insist.
- Georgie, out the back, now.

180
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,120
You are a most unusual woman.

181
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,119
- Shall we dance?
- What?

182
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,503
Dip.

183
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,962
ATOM: Merry Christmas!

184
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,192
What happened to the power?

185
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,152
How would I know?
You're supposed to be the engineer.

186
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,323
Guys, my suit just died.

187
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,162
<i>Guys? Hello!</i>

188
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,248
Whoa! Hey! Ah!

189
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,828
Nate! Nate!

190
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,167
Hey! Hey, look down here!

191
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,545
Ray?

192
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,380
My gun's fried.

193
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,668
We should turn back.

194
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,508
Protecting you is our first priority.

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,932
Rip?

196
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,219
Rip!

197
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,263
How did you get here?

198
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
I don't like this.

199
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,390
Rip.

200
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,435
Hello, Sara.

201
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,523
Goodbye, Sara.

202
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,451
- Son of a bitch!
- Mr. Rory, we meet again.

203
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,571
What the hell's wrong with you?

204
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,365
On the contrary,
nothing has ever been more right.

205
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,246
If anything,
we're a bit more alike now, aren't we?

206
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,377
Take them away!

207
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,024
Come on,
hang in there, Sara. Hang in there.

208
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,985
Don't worry. I've died once, wasn't a fan.

209
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,325
We need Gideon's medical capabilities

210
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,702
to extract the bullet
and repair any internal damage.

211
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,739
If we merge,
we can use Firestorm's nuclear energy

212
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,703
to repair the time drive
and get Gideon back online.

213
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,867
Brilliant.

214
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,627
What's happening?

215
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,755
Whatever fried the ship must've done
the same thing to our Quantum Splicer.

216
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,918
Like an EMP.

217
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,929
Which explains why Raymond is stuck
in a miniaturized state.

218
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,556
- Jax...
- I'll find another way

219
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,059
to get Gideon online.
You just hang in there.

220
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,302
SARA: <i>Jax.</i>

221
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,433
It was Rip.

222
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,019
What?

223
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,980
No, no, that's not possible.

224
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,395
The Legion must've found
some way to turn him.

225
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,062
No, they could never...

226
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,947
Well, apparently they have.

227
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,030
But our mission remains clear,
we must save Washington.

228
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,911
- And Rory.
- That was implied.

229
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,032
Whatever the Legion's done to Rip,
we gotta get him back.

230
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,741
Jax,

231
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,830
I'm putting you in charge.

232
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,463
- Me? But I...
- You got this.

233
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,260
Sara? Sara!

234
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,087
Grey, do something!

235
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,300
She's still alive.

236
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,340
I'll try to stabilize her,
but we need Gideon.

237
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,388
I don't know how to be a captain, man.

238
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,553
Yes, you do, Jefferson.

239
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,390
Okay.

240
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,194
Sara's still hanging on.
Grey's taking care of her.

241
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,075
And she's put me in charge.

242
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,578
Me and mini-Ray will work on restoring
the ship's power.

243
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,489
You and Amaya need to rescue Washington
so he can cross the Delaware.

244
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,375
Saving a president, a nation
and Christmas.

245
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,535
- And Rory.
- That was implied.

246
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,955
Listen, Rip's out there, too.

247
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,665
But his brain's been scrambled
by the Legion,

248
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,424
so we need to bring him back.

249
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,709
I mean, if he's been brainwashed, then...

250
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,096
No, we gotta save him.
No matter what it takes.

251
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,632
Okay.

252
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,226
I'm gonna find
that skinny little Englishman

253
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,645
and strangle him to death.

254
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,820
You take the front, I'll take the rear.

255
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,029
If we face them now,
they will surely kill us, Private.

256
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,613
They're gonna kill us anyway.

257
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,074
If the British wanted us dead,
they'd have done it already.

258
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,496
When we reach camp,

259
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,704
I will talk to their commanding officer
and arrange a prisoner exchange.

260
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,288
There are rules to war.

261
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,419
Yeah, kill or be killed.

262
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,376
The British high command
will treat us honorably,

263
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,008
just as I treat prisoners with honor.

264
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,339
Now I know why
Franklin's on the $100 bill.

265
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,379
I'll bet you a hundred yous you're wrong.

266
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,389
- Excuse me?
- Oh, forget it.

267
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,516
I hate Christmas.

268
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,518
Wait, so, Rip became Phil,
and now he's Rip again but evil?

269
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,557
They went this way.

270
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,692
How do you know that?
Are you using your magical animal powers?

271
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,274
No, I figured that out
by following Rory's trail of trash.

272
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,484
Huh.

273
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,736
Smell that fresh air?

274
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,573
We're outside. Back on the ship,
you said you wanted to be outside.

275
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,362
It's kind of hard
to appreciate the scenery

276
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,407
when you're tracking George Washington
at the eve of the American Revolution.

277
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,741
Good point.

278
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,580
We are not in Kansas anymore.

279
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,336
Wait. I know that one.

280
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,462
That's from a movie called
The Wizard of Oz.

281
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,836
Right. When I was a kid,
I would run out of the room

282
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,626
any time the flying monkeys come on.

283
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,886
I do not care for flying monkeys.

284
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,047
I saw that with Bobby Padusky.

285
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,142
Wait a minute,
so there was life before Rex?

286
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,554
What was dating like in 1939?

287
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,814
"Dating"? You mean courting?

288
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,440
Okay, courting, yeah.

289
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,977
Well, Bobby was always
the perfect gentleman.

290
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,270
I never got to see the end
of The Wizard of Oz, though.

291
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,189
He got freaked out
by the flying monkeys, too, huh?

292
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,656
No. Hitler invaded Poland
and the JSA had to ship out to Europe.

293
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,576
Hitler ruins everything.

294
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,206
Okay, the time core's
inside the engine room,

295
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,959
but with the power off,
I can't get past the door's security.

296
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,118
This is where I come in.

297
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,754
I'll go through the main duct,
take a left at this L-bracket.

298
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,587
This vent opens into the engine room,
where I can flip the breaker.

299
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:35,841
<i>I get that Rip is now somehow evil,</i>

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,344
but does he really have to try
to kill Washington on Christmas?

301
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,675
Any progress?

302
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,051
We're working on it.

303
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,261
How's Sara?

304
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,848
I'm afraid she can't wait any longer.
We need to remove the bullet now.

305
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,011
Okay.

306
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,189
Uh, guys, what was that?

307
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,439
Someone's at the door.

308
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,694
Heave!

309
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,112
Put your backs into it, heave!

310
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,910
It's Rip. He's trying to get in.

311
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,116
And thanks to his EMP,

312
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,622
every weapon on this ship
has been rendered useless.

313
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,952
No doubt the Legion has tasked him
with recovering our fragment of the Spear.

314
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,169
I'll handle Rip. You operate on Sara.

315
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,172
Damn it, Jefferson.
I'm a physicist, not a doctor!

316
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,083
And I'm a mechanic, not a captain.

317
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,298
So I guess
we're both trying out new things today.

318
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,133
AMAYA: So, what's dating like in 2017?

319
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,551
You still go to the movies?

320
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,890
Uh, sure. But, you know,
you gotta work up to it.

321
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,600
Two hours is a big time commitment.

322
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,810
It is?

323
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,771
Yeah, nowadays
we got dating down to a science.

324
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,276
There's an app on your phone.

325
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,688
If you like someone, you swipe right.
If you don't, you swipe left.

326
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,073
And if you both swipe right,
you send each other a message.

327
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,154
So, you use a telephone to find a wife?

328
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,863
"Wife"? No. No wife.

329
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,451
People don't date for marriage,
they just date for, you know, fun.

330
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,540
"Fun"?

331
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,121
Okay, future history lesson.

332
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,244
Uh, back in the 1960s,

333
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,455
there was a social movement
called the Sexual Revolution

334
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,214
where women could have sex for pleasure.

335
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,798
Nowadays, relationships are just chill.

336
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,046
- "Chill"?
- Yeah.

337
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,933
We're being watched.

338
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,018
- You sure you heard someone?
- Shh.

339
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,268
I mean, I hear the sound of rushing water,

340
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,942
but I don't think anyone else is out here.

341
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,115
Hessians. That's cool.

342
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,917
Nate!

343
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,264
AMAYA: The Hessians must have planned
to camp here for the night.

344
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,774
I'm so cold. I've never been so cold.

345
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,276
Why aren't you cold?

346
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,936
'Cause I'm stronger than you?

347
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,609
And I summoned the ashe
of a seal as I dove in.

348
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,695
You cheater, seals are cute.

349
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,368
You're suffering from hypothermia.

350
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,653
You're not thinking clearly.

351
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,036
You're not thinking clearly.

352
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,540
You're the one
who doesn't think seals are cute.

353
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,707
Whatever. I'm tired of arguing with you.

354
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,045
I'm just gonna take a nap.

355
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,797
No, Nathaniel! Stay awake.

356
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,709
I'm awake. I'm up.

357
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,302
You need skin-on-skin contact.

358
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,551
My body heat will keep you warm.

359
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,017
This isn't how I pictured
getting you naked.

360
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,849
You pictured getting me naked?

361
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,479
Hmm-mmm.

362
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,349
Nate? Nate?

363
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,475
Nate.

364
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,280
You're pretty. Hmm.

365
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,317
And... And you're so warm.

366
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,027
You're so warm.

367
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,582
RIP: For England!

368
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,834
Come on, you bastards, heave!

369
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,169
And this is why I avoided medical school.

370
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,344
All right, Martin, hold it together.

371
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,089
You can do this.

372
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,932
You have to do this.

373
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,306
Whoa, the ship looks a lot different
when you're the size of an action figure.

374
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,084
Mmm! It's good to be home.

375
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,620
Fan out.

376
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,622
Kill anyone you find.

377
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,386
Oh, very clever.

378
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:44,310
Now, which one of my former teammates
could possibly be fighting back, hmm?

379
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,188
Well, I believe Ms. Lance is dead,

380
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,654
Professor Stein is a little over-the-hill
for these sort of shenanigans,

381
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,662
and Dr. Palmer is a trifle too small.

382
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,452
Give it up, Jax!

383
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,127
<i>I taught you everything you know
about the</i> Waverider.

384
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,717
There's nowhere to hide, Jax.

385
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,809
I know every nook and cranny on this ship.

386
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,307
MAN: <i>Traitor!</i>

387
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,524
General Washington, as I live and breathe.

388
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,654
Lieutenant General Cornwallis.

389
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,319
I would have preferred to meet you
on the field of battle.

390
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,572
I must give credit where credit is due.

391
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,033
I have a new colonel
who is most impressive.

392
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,072
One might say he's ahead of his time.

393
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,992
If you two are done yapping,
I'd like my last meal.

394
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,712
Take these men to my tent
and have them well fed.

395
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,168
They'll both be hung in the morning.

396
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,091
Ha, sounds exciting.
What did I tell ya, Georgie boy?

397
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,507
I am an officer
in the Continental Army, sir!

398
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,892
You must treat me as a prisoner of war
in a manner which is befitting of my rank.

399
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,348
This is not a war. This is a rebellion.

400
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,394
And you will be hanged for treason
against King George Ill.

401
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,772
Wait.

402
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,026
<i>You mustn't punish him.</i>

403
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,359
This man is only guilty
of following orders.

404
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,198
I'm guilty of a lot more than that.

405
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,738
He will be returned
to his regiment tomorrow.

406
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,861
With news of your death.

407
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,394
ls my underwear out there?

408
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,597
You weren't wearing any.

409
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,065
That's embarrassing.

410
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,476
Just so you know,
that water was very cold,

411
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,395
so if you happened to have
sneaked a peek,

412
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,655
- it's not a fair representation of...
- Nate.

413
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,316
I wasn't looking down there.

414
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,238
Because that would be unprofessional.

415
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,453
AMAYA: <i>We'll wait for our clothes to dry</i>

416
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,740
and then continue tracking
Rory and Washington.

417
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:04,907
Wait.

418
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,414
You're gonna wait out there?

419
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,087
It's warm by the fire.

420
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,166
It's warmer in the tent.

421
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,927
If you're implying
what I think you're implying,

422
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:21,091
you don't think that's a little fast
even by your modern standards?

423
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,349
No.

424
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,939
I suppose after all we've been through,

425
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,646
a kiss would seem quaint.

426
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:32,935
Would seem old-fashioned.

427
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,368
RIP: <i>Mr. Jackson.</i>

428
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,829
Man, this guy is really starting
to piss me off.

429
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,790
RIP: <i>You can't run forever, Mr. Jackson.</i>

430
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,641
Hmm.
Something tells me I'm getting warmer.

431
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,483
JAX: Nope. Colder.

432
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,526
Man, the Legion really must've
fried your brain.

433
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,696
I bet you couldn't even find your own ass

434
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,739
with both hands and a flashlight.

435
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't want to hurt you, Jax.

436
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,369
Yeah. Says the guy who shot Sara.

437
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,756
RIP: <i>A small price to pay for
the Spear of Destiny, don't you think?</i>

438
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,216
<i>Imagine the power we would wield
if we reunited the fragments.</i>

439
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,427
You mean Eobard Thawne.
You're just his errand boy.

440
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,012
It's a job that the Legion
will reward me handsomely for,

441
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,347
as they would you.

442
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,595
You think you can bribe me?

443
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,436
I'm not a traitor like you.
There's nothing you could offer me.

444
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,521
RIP: <i>Not even your father's life?</i>

445
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,899
Think about it, Jax.

446
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,407
The Spear allows us to rewrite reality.

447
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,780
<i>Now if you were to help me,</i>

448
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,407
your father no longer
has to ship off to battle.

449
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,540
<i>He would no longer have to die
in that ambush.</i>

450
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,247
Your mother would no longer
be a widow, and you...

451
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,754
The only way you're getting that Spear is
by prying it from my cold, dead hands.

452
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,544
Well, that works, too.

453
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,388
RORY: When they change shifts,
I'm gonna bust us outta here.

454
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,563
Are you really so anxious to die?
I argued for your life, Mr. Rory.

455
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,727
That's why I'm taking you with me.

456
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,319
I'd rather die a gentleman
than return to Mount Vernon a scoundrel.

457
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,407
I trust that I may depend on you
to deliver this to my wife, Martha.

458
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,910
Consider it a last request.

459
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,742
Listen, you fop.

460
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,330
You can give it to her yourself.

461
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,254
Or are you too much of a pansy?

462
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,586
I've been a soldier
since I was 20 years old.

463
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,961
But our cause is the cause of all men,

464
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:08,094
to be treated equally,
regardless of hereditary privilege.

465
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,436
We must prove to the world
you don't need a title to be a gentleman.

466
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,811
The British may be dishonorable,
but I am not.

467
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:21,521
By my death, I will prove to the Crown
what it means to be an American.

468
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,440
You don't know the first thing
about being an American.

469
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:30,029
We're misfits, outcasts,
and we're proud of it.

470
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,832
If they attack in formation,
we pop 'em off from the trees.

471
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,336
<i>If they challenge you to a duel,
you raid their camp at night.</i>

472
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,622
And if they're gonna hang you,
you fight dirty,

473
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,883
and you never, ever give up.

474
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,794
That's the American way.

475
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,463
<i>What's it gonna be, George?</i>

476
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,018
Hmm.

477
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,153
- Hi.
- Hi.

478
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,861
How long were we asleep?

479
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,489
Maybe an hour?

480
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,823
- An hour?
- Yeah.

481
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,863
What about General Washington and Rory?

482
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,829
All right, slow down.

483
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,001
- We have to go.
- I'm up.

484
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,882
Just gonna get dressed unless you think
we have time for, you know...

485
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,592
We have a job to do.

486
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,925
Okay. Please don't let this kill me.

487
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,185
Oh, you managed to turn on
the auxiliary power, Mr. Jackson.

488
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,440
Well done.

489
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,935
JAX: Hey, come on, man.

490
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,570
You're Captain Rip Hunter.

491
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,232
The man who recruited a bunch of
reject superheroes to not save his family?

492
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,117
Don't tell me
you miss that self-righteous idiot.

493
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,571
This isn't you.

494
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,411
Whatever the Legion's done to turn you
into their puppet...

495
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,621
Captain Rip Hunter was the puppet!

496
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:03,582
First of the Time Masters, and then
to some misguided duty to protect history.

497
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,299
Can't you see, Jax?

498
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,212
My new allies, they freed me.

499
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,049
Looks like
this will be your last Christmas.

500
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,388
Wait.

501
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,224
I know where the piece of the Spear is.

502
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,847
Hmm.

503
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,431
Smart play.

504
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,984
Show me.

505
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,411
Oh, rats.

506
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,593
JAX: <i>You're a good man, Rip.</i>

507
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,504
Even when you disappeared, we carried on
because that's what you wanted.

508
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,925
No, because the old Rip was a fool
for believing that time was worth saving.

509
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,685
And you were even bigger fools
for believing him.

510
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,267
Now, my patience is wearing thin.

511
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,314
Where's the Spear fragment?

512
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,275
In the same place you left it.

513
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,114
I think I'll let you do the honors.

514
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,823
Oh, you...

515
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,130
I underestimated you, Jax!

516
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,127
I won't make that mistake again.

517
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,656
Aw.

518
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:01,286
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt
this tender moment.

519
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,673
Get away from her!

520
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,182
Not another step.

521
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,843
RIP: <i>Now...</i>

522
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,261
One last time.

523
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,392
Where's the piece of the Spear?

524
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,808
Don't make me ask you again.

525
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,652
I'm not telling you nothing.

526
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,522
Very well.

527
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,943
There's no reason
both of you have to die tonight.

528
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,866
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

529
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,207
The piece of the Spear's
inside your telescope.

530
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,117
Now, just let her go.

531
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,874
<i>Rip.</i>

532
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,998
Rip, it's Sara.

533
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,922
<i>Come on, it's Sara.</i>

534
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,682
You say her name as if
she's supposed to matter to me.

535
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:07,894
She doesn't.

536
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,449
No. No, no, no, no, Sara.

537
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,318
Sara.

538
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,975
Honest to a fault, Jax.

539
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,477
Jefferson?

540
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,107
I told him.

541
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,821
I told him where to find
the piece of the Spear.

542
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,326
He just killed her anyway.

543
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,945
Where's Raymond?

544
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,948
It's too late.

545
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,617
Where are you going?

546
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,332
I'm gonna find Rip,
and I'm gonna kill him.

547
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,543
No, Jefferson, wait. Raymond!

548
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,504
If you can hear me,
you must get the main power online!

549
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,677
Without Gideon, I can't save her!

550
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,799
ATOM: This is why we have a chore wheel!

551
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,065
Whoa, this is a long way down.

552
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,989
But you weren't captain
of the varsity diving team for nothing.

553
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,153
Oh, man.

554
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,324
Three, two, one!

555
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,411
One! Come on!

556
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,004
Whoa!

557
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,873
Yes!

558
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,213
GIDEON: <i>Hello, Professor.
How can I be of assistance?</i>

559
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,673
Gideon, thank God.

560
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,180
Ms. Lance is, uh... How shall I put this?

561
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,386
- GIDEON: <i>Dead?</i>
- Delicate as always.

562
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,426
GIDEON: <i>Luckily her brain cells
are still functioning.</i>

563
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,553
- Ah...
<i>- Let's see what I can do, shall we?</i>

564
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,479
Uh, guys, a little help here?

565
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,185
Guys? Hello!

566
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,775
Any last words?

567
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,444
In fact, I've learned a new word
from my private.

568
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,530
Kaboom.

569
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,294
All right.

570
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,395
Come on, Georgie boy.

571
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,764
Whoa!

572
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,027
If you're expecting me to blink,
it's gonna be a long day.

573
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,034
A gentleman would stay and fight,

574
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,538
but as an American I suggest we run.

575
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,540
JAX: <i>Don't move!</i>

576
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,593
You haven't got it in you.

577
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,378
You didn't have to kill her.

578
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,593
Sara wasn't supposed to die,
not like that.

579
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,757
Not by you.

580
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,928
There's no rhyme nor reason
to any of this, Jax.

581
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,481
History is war and slavery
and holding your dead son in your arms.

582
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,567
There's no point in protecting history,
so we might as well just burn it all down.

583
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,818
I haven't got all day for this.

584
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,109
If you're gonna shoot me,
then please get on with it.

585
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,904
I will make it easier for you.

586
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,411
No?

587
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,585
That's just as I thought.

588
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,500
You're weak.

589
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,257
Just like your old captain.

590
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,426
Don't.

591
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,759
JAX: <i>Sara?</i>

592
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,016
Gideon and Stein saved me.

593
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,650
Looks like Rip put together
a pretty good team.

594
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,776
- Will you put the gun down, Jax?
- No.

595
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,781
I think you should listen to your friend.

596
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,442
Shut up!

597
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,825
He's with the Legion now.

598
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,195
The Rip we knew is gone.

599
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,289
Do you know what day it is, Jax?

600
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,328
It's December 25th.

601
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,247
It's Christmas.

602
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,755
It's when we remember
to be our best selves.

603
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,963
Why are you protecting him?

604
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,096
I'm not protecting him.

605
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,976
I'm protecting you.

606
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,360
Speaking of Christmas miracles,

607
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,313
the British are coming.

608
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,340
To fighting like an American.

609
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,212
I always do.

610
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,885
Ah, it's not bad.

611
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,720
Listen, Georgie, I've got some thoughts
on the criminal justice system...

612
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,639
This is the last of them.
You should be back to a fair fight now.

613
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,024
Your troops are waiting for you outside,
General Washington.

614
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,311
I don't understand much of what I've seen.

615
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,487
But the world is changing.

616
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,194
And you are no small part of that.

617
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,734
Sir.

618
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,991
Well, Georgie, it's, uh, been a pleasure.

619
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,949
Uh...

620
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,165
Oh, uh...

621
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,789
You can deliver this love letter yourself.

622
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,875
This is no love letter.

623
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,009
It's a battle strategy.

624
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,304
I wanted to ensure my men would receive it

625
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,056
in the event of my death.

626
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,764
The Hessians will be receiving
a Christmas surprise this evening.

627
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,179
Ah, you sneaky bastard.

628
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,597
Not such a gentleman after all.

629
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,313
Your rebel spirit,
your steadfastness,

630
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,567
your crass yet effective use of language.

631
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:34,485
You, Mr. Rory, represent
the best of what our new nation can be.

632
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,071
Yes. Yes, I do.

633
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,532
Right.

634
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,546
Gideon, is the American Revolution
back on track?

635
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,507
GIDEON: <i>Yes, history has been restored.</i>

636
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,801
<i>Though there is now a statue
in the nation's capital</i>

637
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,884
<i>that bears a striking resemblance
to Mr. Rory.</i>

638
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,180
So, how you feeling, Captain?

639
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,395
Good, considering.

640
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,939
Well, it's good to have you back.

641
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,028
And I think I'm just about done
being in charge for a while.

642
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,444
Oh, I don't know.
I think you did a pretty good job.

643
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,618
I told Rip where to find
a piece of the Spear.

644
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,409
How do you do it?

645
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,917
How do you make the right choice
even when there isn't one?

646
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,965
You remember the mission.

647
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,055
And what you're fighting for.

648
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,719
And you try to hold on to your humanity.

649
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,645
And surround yourself with people
who remind you of that.

650
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,351
Even in your darkest hour.

651
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,205
PROFESSOR STEIN:
Well, would you care to do the honors?

652
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,916
You certainly know your way
around a knife.

653
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,378
Oh, the League never covered poultry,
but I'll give it a shot.

654
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,924
JAX: Ouch.

655
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,717
I'm certainly glad
to be human-sized again.

656
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,173
Man, it's good to have you back.

657
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,467
This Christmas dinner idea,
it might be your best one yet.

658
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,052
It makes it feel kind of like home.

659
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,766
Yeah, right down to the drunk uncle.

660
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,271
Careful, Haircut.

661
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,606
I'm your forefather now.

662
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,808
It's true.

663
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,935
Hey, I got you a gift.

664
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,027
Dude. What the hell?

665
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,737
A rat.

666
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,406
RAY: <i>We made friends.</i>

667
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,694
I got you something, too.

668
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,239
No, no, no, no, no. If that's a mouse,
then I'm good, homie.

669
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,539
Hey, I had the, um,
fabrication room working overtime on this.

670
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,706
Nathaniel.

671
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,877
What? Can't one teammate get another
a perfectly meaningless gift?

672
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,594
Is this meaningless?

673
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,300
I don't know, maybe, maybe not.

674
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,267
Look, I'm glad last night happened.
It was fun.

675
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,517
- It was a lot of fun.
- But I still think

676
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,929
teammates shouldn't fraternize.

677
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,056
I totally agree.

678
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,276
This is what you wanted, right?

679
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,478
I mean, you said the future was chill.

680
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,486
Me? I am the ambassador of chill.

681
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,319
Merry Christmas, Amaya.

682
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,712
All right.

683
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,628
Merry Christmas, happy holidays,

684
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,673
and whatever people say
who exist outside the timeline.

685
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:49,680
Now, I know that it may seem like
we don't have anything to celebrate.

686
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,146
Rip's been brainwashed and
took our piece of the Spear of Destiny.

687
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,357
There's a monument in Washington, D.C.,
to Rory.

688
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,484
But we saved America.

689
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,115
And we're gonna save Rip.

690
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,997
<i>And get back the rest of the Spear.</i>

691
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,373
Because as powerful as the Legion may be,

692
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,127
they don't have this.

693
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,542
Family.

694
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,963
And we all know,
nobody fights like family.

695
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,890
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

696
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,349
ALL: To family.
