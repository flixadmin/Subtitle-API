1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,675
I used to live my life a
quarter mile at a time…

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,554
but things changed.

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,015
I'm a father now.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,435
I will always be
in your heart.

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,314
Little Brian, I have
a gift for you.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,982
Your daddy gave me this.

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:28,320
Now I'm going to give it to
you. It's very special.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,155
It's for protection…

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,991
from what's coming.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,541
Alright Dom, what's next?

11
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,503
No matter how fast you are...

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,550
no one out runs their past.

13
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,891
And mine...

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,892
just caught up to me.

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,186
Been a long time Dom.

16
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,651
So we're up against
a master thief.

17
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,987
Assassin.

18
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:14,533
High performance driver.

19
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,617
Who is he?

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,999
Dom!

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,376
Jakob is...

22
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,502
Dom's brother.

23
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,381
Your whole life you
pushed yourself

24
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,966
to be faster than Dom...

25
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,802
smarter than Dom...

26
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,431
stronger than Dom...

27
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,099
but could you kill him?

28
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,439
Because I'm ready if you are.

29
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,068
There is nothing more powerful
than the love of family.

30
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:55,782
You turn that into anger and
there's nothing more dangerous.

31
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,660
Maybe this is the end, but we’re
gonna go out together.

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,705
You know I'd ride to
the death with you.

33
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,506
Let's get to work.

34
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,218
Please tell that's not
a Pontiac Fiero,

35
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,678
strapped to a rocket engine.

36
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,722
Impressive, I know.

37
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:22,392
No, no that’s - 
that's not impressive.

38
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,480
My ass is en fuego.

39
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,912
Ahhhh!

40
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,246
I came here to
take you down,

41
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,790
little brother.

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,167
That's your mistake.

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,960
This is my world.

44
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,435
Damn, they got
a magnet plane?

45
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,812
Hold on.

46
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,356
Tell me you’re not thinking what
I think you’re thinking.

47
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,149
There's no bridge!

48
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,443
Oh hell nah.

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,341
Hey guys.

50
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,467
Surprise.

51
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,636
Nice club house.
