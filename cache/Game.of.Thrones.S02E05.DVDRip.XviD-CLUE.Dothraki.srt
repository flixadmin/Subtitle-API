1
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,671
l rewove this part of the top.

2
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,758
And l fixed the heel on this one.

3
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,532
May he ride forever through the night lands.

4
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,707
Or melt it. Very simple.

5
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,208
We are his guests!

6
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,128
You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

7
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,796
Of course not, Khaleesi!

8
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,090
We will wait until we leave.

9
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,758
Not even when we leave.

10
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,677
Why not?

11
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,555
Our host saved us from the
Red Waste and you want to steal from him?

12
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,307
l will hear no more.
