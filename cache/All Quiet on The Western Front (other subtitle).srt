1
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,167
Attack!

2
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,083
Attack!

3
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:10,750
Go! Come on! Faster!

4
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:16,000
Heinrich, come on! Forwards! Come now!

5
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,792
To the ladders!

6
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,292
On my command!

7
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,583
Fonnards!

8
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,250
Heinrich! Get out there!

9
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,458
All of you, go!

10
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,542
Come on! Get out of there!

11
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,667
Go, Heinrich! Get out there now!

12
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:35,542
Attack!

13
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,125
Attack!

14
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,083
Go! Forwards!

15
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,458
Heinrich!

16
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,833
Heinrich!

17
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:21,000
Attack! Attack! —attack!

18
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:09,167
All quiet on the western front

19
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,917
Come on!

20
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,667
Northern Germany spring 1917

21
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,500
third year of war

22
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,917
Paul! Paul!

23
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,333
- —Paul! Well?
- So?

24
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Mhm.

25
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,375
Well then? —I don't know.

26
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,378
- Does he know we're all going?
- Yes, of course.

27
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,458
Staying at home?

28
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,982
My god, you're tied
to your mother's apron strings, my friend.

29
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,292
Give me it, I'll scribble something.

30
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,351
- It has to be signed by his parents.
- Well, someone. Come on, pass it here.

31
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,583
That won't work, they'll find out.
—how will they?

32
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,083
Well?

33
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,875
Is his mother a pen pal of theirs?

34
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,542
- Give me your pen.
- Ah, I'm sorry.

35
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,458
Oh!

36
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:15,542
Ludwig.

37
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,125
You mustn't. Your father will hit you.

38
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,125
Have you got a better idea?
I'm not being left behind here.

39
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,583
Jawohl!

40
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,833
Congratulations, private baumer.
We're going to the front.

41
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,083
A dead man walking.

42
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,458
You stand here
on the threshold of existence.

43
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,375
Remember this moment.

44
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,792
It is a great moment.

45
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:58,000
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

46
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,875
The iron youth of Germany.

47
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,875
My friends,

48
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:06,167
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

49
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,708
Your deeds will be the water

50
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,792
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

51
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,000
Stand still and listen up, leinemann!

52
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,958
The kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

53
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,458
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

54
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,750
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with honour and respect.

55
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,542
A cross crafted from iron
proudly displayed upon your chest.

56
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,792
However, take heed of this.

57
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,458
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

58
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,208
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

59
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,667
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

60
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,875
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

61
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,833
For modern war is like a game of chess.

62
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,417
It is never about an individual soldier.

63
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,833
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

64
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,620
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

65
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,625
And by going to the front line
in flanders, we'll Pierce the enemy.

66
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,417
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

67
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,125
finally march on Paris!

68
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,667
Yeah!

69
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,042
Our future,

70
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,333
the future of deutschland,

71
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,125
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

72
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,833
My friends, that is you, you see!

73
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:28,917
Yeah!

74
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,917
Therefore, off to the camps

75
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,667
for the kaiser, god, and the fatherland!

76
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,250
Yeah!

77
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,333
Next.

78
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,417
Next.

79
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,833
Next.

80
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,268
- Next.
- Next.

81
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,042
Baumer, Paul. 53 wiesengrund.

82
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,708
Born November 18th, 1899. Correct?

83
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:03,792
Jawohl, sir.

84
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,375
Next.

85
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,125
Paul.

86
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,292
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

87
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,375
Yes.

88
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,125
Is everything alright?

89
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,708
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

90
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,625
Move along.

91
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,583
Here he comes.

92
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,434
- —Emil hermann.
- Name and address.

93
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,858
- And the next.
- —Excuse me.

94
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,542
It already belongs to someone.

95
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:39,083
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

96
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,792
Here. It's yours.

97
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,583
Thank you.

98
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,417
I remember it, you were.

99
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:05,833
Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching away
all the ladies from us now?

100
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

101
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,000
My concern is that you don't shoot us.

102
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:14,042
J“ girl, [love you, I do j”

103
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,250
I but I can't yet marry you I

104
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,875
I wait another year
then it will come... j“

105
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,375
She won't wait, Franz.

106
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,958
She won't do it.

107
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,292
You lady killer, you.

108
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,917
J” have a cup of tea
sugar and coffee j”

109
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,708

and a glass of wine j'

110
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,292
j' girl, I do love you, I do I

111
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,083
I but I can't yet marry you I

112
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:04,625
I wait another year
then it will come true I

113
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,500
La malmaison, northern France
25 km to the western front

114
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:32,333
Your name?
—kropp. Albert kropp, sir.

115
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,417
Do you like dirty girls, kropp?

116
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,583
Do you like dirty girls?

117
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,042
Uh, no. I don't, sir.

118
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,125
So why
do you sleep with one then?

119
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,958
Report for guard duty at three o'clock.

120
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,833
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in a godforsaken shithole.

121
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:54,833
And you'll kindly do so with a clean g98.

122
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,458
You will pamper it.

123
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,000
You will love it.

124
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,208
And damn it,
you will keep it as immaculate

125
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,167
as the thighs of the holy virgin.

126
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,167
Do we understand each other?

127
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,917
- Jawohl, sir!
- Jawohl, sir!

128
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,875
Welcome
to the 78th reserve infantry regiment.

129
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,083
We are now on the western front.

130
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,667
- Welcome to Paris!
- —yeah! Welcome to Paris!

131
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,208
Ah!

132
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,958
Down there! Down there!

133
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,625
Down there! This way!

134
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,985
This way!

135
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,072
- Go on! Over there on the right!
- —Damn it, what happened?

136
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,292
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 pm.

137
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,875
That you may, but on foot.

138
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,975
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

139
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,518
With all due respect, I have orders-...

140
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,500
Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

141
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,583
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

142
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,875
Get out right now, will you?

143
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,000
Everyone, get up.

144
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,292
Come on, get on with it.

145
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,125
You heard the staff surgeon.

146
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,167
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

147
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,708
Keep moving.

148
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,542
Franz muller, correct? —yes.

149
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,125
The supreme army command

150
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,917
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

151
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,059
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

152
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,375
-Jawohl, sir. —then walk quicker

153
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,578
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

154
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,958
-Do you understand? —yes.

155
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,125
Hurry up.

156
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,708
We're not at a tea party here.

157
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,125
Gas!

158
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,958
- Gas!
- Gas!

159
00:16:58,042 --> 00:16:59,667
Gas!

160
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,958
Gas!

161
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,833
Gas masks on!

162
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,458
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

163
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,875
If the French could aim better,

164
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,292
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and Bury us in a saucepan.

165
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,250
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

166
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,083
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

167
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,125
Eyes straight ahead.

168
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,667
Are you deaf? — No, sir.

169
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,458
I was just trying to put my mask on.

170
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:54,500
Paul baumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

171
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,042
You should eat something, man.

172
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,375
Attention! Gas masks off!

173
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,333
Gas masks off!

174
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,500
Not you.

175
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,042
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

176
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,708
Both you and that useless pig.

177
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
Fall in line. March.

178
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,875
Fall in line!

179
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,375
Stay together and keep moving!

180
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,167
Come on, hurry up!

181
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,250
Go!

182
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:40,167
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

183
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,000
Next time, you carry mine.

184
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,250
Congratulations, soldiers.

185
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,167
This is your home now.

186
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,250
Helmets off.

187
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,542
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, steinberger.

188
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,417
We were under barrage all night.

189
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,583
The men are a mess.

190
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,667
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

191
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,792
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

192
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,833
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

193
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,375
Get in line to bail the water!

194
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,208
What are you waiting for, baumer?

195
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:26,083
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

196
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,667
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

197
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,292
Come on, all of you!

198
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,958
It will always snap it up.

199
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,875
Give a man power...

200
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,333
Man is a beast.

201
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,583
Drink.

202
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,375
Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

203
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,125
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

204
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,125
Sorry.

205
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,042
Forget it.

206
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,458
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

207
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,542
Just shut up, Ludwig.

208
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

209
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,750
Stick them down your underwear.

210
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,458
It always works for me.

211
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,545
That will make it shoot better,
will it?

212
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,757
- Did you hear that?
- —Hear what?

213
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,708
That sound. Listen.

214
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,042
There's nothing there.

215
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,292
Our first French to shoot.

216
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,292
Calm down, paulchen.

217
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:10,707
There's someone out there.

218
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:22,792
Who's there?

219
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,375
Hey.

220
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,915
Show yourself!

221
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,417
Oh, no, no, no!

222
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,333
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

223
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,375
- —No, Paul. No.
- What's going on?

224
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,542
You're fine.

225
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:03,917
What is it?

226
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,333
The others, over there. They shot at me.

227
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,875
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

228
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Huh?

229
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,792
From now on, keep your heads down.

230
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,184
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

231
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,328
move ten meters to the left.

232
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,125
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

233
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,875
Yeah.

234
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,292
Come on. Paul.

235
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:36,083
Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

236
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,083
Here!

237
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,333
Baumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

238
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Into the bunker!

239
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,875
Inside! Inside! Inside!

240
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,458
"Be careful what you eat."

241
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,000
That's what my mother said.

242
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,184
- —We'll always be together, won't we?
- Yeah.

243
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,792
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

244
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:25,167
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

245
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,490
I need to go home.

246
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,208
Creeping barrage.

247
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,208
What?

248
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,458
Every couple of minutes,

249
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,417
the artillery barrage
makes an advance toward.

250
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,917
And directly after that,

251
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,583
the infantry moves toward.

252
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,458
What are you saying, exactly?

253
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,250
That's how they come.

254
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:29,292
Where are you going?

255
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,375
I'll come back.

256
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,125
It's nearly over.

257
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,042
- —No! Let me go.
- Stay where you are.

258
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,625
- —Let me out of here. I want to get out.
- Calm down.

259
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,083
Calm yourself.

260
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,208
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

261
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Out!

262
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,792
Hey, that's Paul!

263
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:58,750
Albert!

264
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,667
Come here, we found Paul!

265
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,417
Paul!

266
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:13,708
Are you alright?

267
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,333
Is everything alright, Paul?

268
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,583
Come on. Paul, come on.

269
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:19,833
I'll help you.

270
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:22,458
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

271
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:23,625
Are you injured?

272
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:25,542
Paul, are you injured?

273
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,583
- Can you hear me?
- We need help over here!

274
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,667
- See you later, Paul.
- We'll see you later, Paul.

275
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,250
Go on! Go on!

276
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,208
Here's another one.

277
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,125
We need help!

278
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:54,708
Steady.

279
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:56,542
Steady.

280
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,708
That's it.

281
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,667
I've got you.

282
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,042
Careful, careful.

283
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,375
Now we're in camp. Sit down.

284
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,458
You're alright.

285
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,167
Nice one. Let's have a look at you.

286
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,500
Hold still, hold still.

287
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:29,987
Yeah, you're going to be alright.

288
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,005
Right, put pressure on it.
Don't let him get up.

289
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,667
Katczinsky, back to work.

290
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,292
And you? Are you injured?

291
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,667
Then start gathering.

292
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,417
Man, man, man!

293
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,417
No rest for the wicked.

294
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,417
It's the same every day.

295
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:04,792
Come on! Keep working!

296
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,792
We don't have all day.

297
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,792
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

298
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,708
18 months later

299
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:27,875
September 14th, 1898.

300
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,375
Blumenthal, Samuel.

301
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:40,625
Dresden. November 6th, 1900.

302
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,417
Yesterday was his birthday.

303
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,417
Von gallwitz, Gustav.

304
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,833
Osnabrlick, June 20th, '99.

305
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:57,667
Gotz luttwitz—...

306
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,750
That's enough.

307
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,667
Supreme army command
7 November, 1918

308
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,583
- She's a looker.
- —Let's see.

309
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:13,667
She's alright.

310
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:37,583
Herr erzberger.

311
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,333
God be with us.

312
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,667
Once more, over 40,000 killed
in the last few weeks alone.

313
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,250
That should convince the general staff.

314
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,917
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

315
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,583
We all know that.

316
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,250
The general field marshal.

317
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,042
Champagne, France
occupied territory

318
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,125
Thank you. — Jawohl.

319
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,232
Paul, if we keep up this pace,

320
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,708
we won't have conquered France
for 180 years.

321
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,500
I worked it out.

322
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,167
Don't let them catch you, Kat.

323
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:22,875
Never.

324
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,083
Come on.

325
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,250
Explain to me
how this is worth dying for in your mind.

326
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,057
When you're starving, you'll do anything.

327
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,250
Qui va la?

328
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:29,958
Ho!

329
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,542
Oh, putain!

330
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:40,417
Attends je vais flinguer ce fumier!

331
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:41,917
Kat?

332
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:45,542
Kat?

333
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:47,708
Run!

334
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,272
Hey! Dirty kraut!

335
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,798
- Rends-moi I'oie, ordure!
- —Run!

336
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,167
Fumier!

337
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,726
- Just right.
- —I told you.

338
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,958
Men, you are heroes.

339
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:15,722
Shut the door or the others will smell it.

340
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,083
Nice work.

341
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,247
I don't know. How am I
supposed to remember anything?

342
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,625
Come on, use your prussian brain.

343
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,375
Here. Open-eyed and long—fingered.

344
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,833
Help me with the goose.

345
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,875
A piece of goose from the goose.
From France to Franz.

346
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:30,958
I want a wing.

347
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:33,042
Do I have to share?
Then I'll take the rest.

348
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,125
Fill up my bowl.

349
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,417
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide—mouth frog...

350
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,792
- —Rest in peace in the drumfire.
- Ooh.

351
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,917
Oh, god.

352
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,625
You know I'll owe you forever for this.

353
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,583
It's not bad, is it?

354
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,583
Yes. Mm.

355
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,375
-And you? —yes. Yes, good.

356
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,542
It's good, Paul.

357
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:22,667
Good, Kat.

358
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,833
Life is short.

359
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:28,042
Where's Emil when you need him?
—emil, bring in coffee and caviar!

360
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,083
Yes, and draw my foot bath as well.
I need a foot bath.

361
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,750
Kat? —what is it?

362
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,583
J' the goose has been stolen
give it back I

363
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,250
I give it, give it, give it back I

364
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,500
j' the goose has been stolen
give it back I

365
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,750
- the farmer! The farmer!
- The farmer! Yes!

366
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,958
J' otherwise the farmer
will shoot you with his rifle I

367
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:51,750
j' otherwise the farmer
will shoot you with his rifle I

368
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,667
j' shoot you with his rifle j”

369
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:18,472
Tjaden sits very quietly and says...

370
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,208
"Where is he?"
"Cross." I keep hearing, "cross."

371
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,333
"My father was leader of nazareth."

372
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,417
"Leader of nazareth?"
Enquires the teacher.

373
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,042
"What?" "never heard of it."

374
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,083
"Tjaden, go back home
and ask again, will you?"

375
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,875
Next morning, tjaden Springs into school
and says to everybody,

376
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,167
"please forgive me."
"My father wasn't the leader of nazareth."

377
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,388
"My father was last seen with nadja roth."

378
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,375
Brilliant.

379
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,708
Look.

380
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,083
Mhm?

381
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,875
Regarder!

382
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:16,833
Hey! Hello!

383
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,167
Come here!

384
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,333
Fresh baguette!

385
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,250
For you!

386
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,208
Livennurst, love!

387
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,875
Lots of love!

388
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,875
Franz. What are you doing?

389
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,333
- Take me with you.
- _ Come on!

390
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:53,833
I'd go over.

391
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,542
But he's making a fool of himself.

392
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,542
Oh, my.
You are very beautiful, my love.

393
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,208
Franz!

394
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,167
The dark—haired beauty
is for me!

395
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:16,375
What is he doing?

396
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,167
Franz!

397
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,042
Goodbye!

398
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,708
Goodbye, my friends!

399
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:40,375
Damn it.

400
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:45,500
If it was all over,
you know what I'd be doing?

401
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,292
There's no peace,
so it doesn't matter.

402
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,655
No, but if there was...

403
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,208
- We'd be surrounded by women again.
- Yeah, that's true.

404
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,542
I wouldn't put trousers on
for eight days.

405
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,833
I should really be spanking your backside
for talking about something like that.

406
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,000
What about you, Paul?

407
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,667
- No idea. Can't think.
- —I'd stay with the prussians.

408
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:06,528
You're an idiot, tjaden.

409
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,968
Have you ever done
any peat digging?

410
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,125
Try it sometime.

411
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,528
Can't be worse
than digging trenches in champagne.

412
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,583
It takes longer
than digging trenches in champagne.

413
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,265
And you can't get away with not doing it.

414
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,500
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

415
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,542
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

416
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:25,000
And then you have the softest bed.

417
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,875
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

418
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:27,958
And then...

419
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,083
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

420
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:35,167
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

421
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,083
A cognac here, a pint there.

422
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:40,250
A military policeman
is everyone's good friend. Everyone.

423
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,917
There's just one catch, tjaden.

424
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,417
What's that?

425
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,667
You'll never be a corporal though,
will you?

426
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,417
You always make such useless comments.

427
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,180
What does it matter what you think anyway?

428
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,000
Kat! Kat! —here!

429
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,125
Kat! — Here!

430
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,208
Kat!

431
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:17,458
"Darling one."

432
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:20,292
"You asked us
for a package of food to be sent."

433
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,458
"Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard."

434
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,125
"A couple of pieces of cake."

435
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,000
"Sauerkraut and smoked wurst."

436
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:32,958
"Some more..."

437
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,792
Hing? Hingfong? —hingfong.

438
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,417
"And a cup of sugar."

439
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,083
"Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there."

440
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:44,757
"Don't eat too quickly as I don't want
to have to send more right away."

441
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,873
"I'd keep it away
from your comrades if I were you."

442
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,417
"My dear one."

443
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,875
"I must also ask a question of you."

444
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,375
"Have you started to save up any money?"

445
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,375
"Could you send some home
would you think?"

446
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,875
"People are saying the war
will be over soon." "Some people."

447
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,833
"And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up."

448
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:07,797
"You're probably thinking,
'what is she after?'"

449
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,542
"'how cheeky of her to ask."'

450
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:12,333
"but I mean not to offend you."

451
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:14,708
"You know me, I can never get enough."

452
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:17,958
"But more, more." "I can't help it,
I always want some more."

453
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,875
"So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home."

454
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:26,000
"Karl lemmer is in a hospital bed
somewhere in the east."

455
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,660
"Something with his stomach."

456
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,458
"And he was out there
for barely three weeks in total."

457
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:34,500
"Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?"

458
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,750
"You've already played your role."

459
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:42,292
If only she could see
how you're sitting there, with your cigar.

460
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,083
"This Sunday, I'll visit the gra..."

461
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,292
"This Sunday,
I'll visit the grave of our boy."

462
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,792
"I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that."

463
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,375
"By next year, we'll be able to celebrate
his tenth birthday together."

464
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,888
"That's all I have to tell you this time."

465
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,833
"Sending kisses from your wife, for you."

466
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:18,542
"Auf wiedersehen."

467
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I had no idea.

468
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,667
Oh, Paul.

469
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,375
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

470
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,667
Returning to a home,

471
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,917
having to go back to our normal being.

472
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:54,125
Where all everyone wants to know about
are the battles we've been in.

473
00:48:56,958 --> 00:49:00,292
We'll be like travellers
who belong in another country elsewhere.

474
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:04,667
Sometimes I wonder...

475
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:06,708
Would...

476
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:10,167
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

477
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,000
Tjaden and kropp.

478
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,083
And with miiller. He'd be sat with us.

479
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:18,333
And be eating fried potatoes.

480
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,125
Unpeeled.

481
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,125
Well...

482
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,042
That's enough of that.

483
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:46,208
How long until we finally get going again?

484
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,833
How long
until we finally get going again?

485
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:09,375
Franz?

486
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes?

487
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,250
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

488
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,875
To look for some children.

489
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,708
What happened?

490
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:20,833
They should have arrived today.

491
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,375
A whole company.

492
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,250
How was it?

493
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,667
Good. — Yeah?

494
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:35,417
Yes.

495
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:38,708
Here.

496
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:44,958
Have a smell.

497
00:50:57,417 --> 00:50:58,750
What's her name?

498
00:50:58,833 --> 00:50:59,833
Eloise.

499
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:03,583
Eloise.

500
00:51:04,542 --> 00:51:07,708
She had skin as white as milk.

501
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,667
Breasts...

502
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,500
Hey. —huh?

503
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,363
I want to smell it too.

504
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,208
Kropp, let me have it.

505
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,792
- —Here.
- Oh, my.

506
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:24,750
Give it to me.

507
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,708
A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

508
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:30,083
No.
—at worst, some sand from the seashore.

509
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,958
Tjaden.

510
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:34,602
- Come on, pass it here.
- I bet she bathes twice a day.

511
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,167
Tjaden, give it back to me.

512
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:57,417
Sir.

513
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,875
Call the others.

514
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,333
There must have been a huge explosion.

515
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,875
Mine thrower cannons.

516
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,667
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

517
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:59,683
Was he one of those we've come here for?

518
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,583
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

519
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,423
He's been hanging there
for some time.

520
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,208
Not pleasant.

521
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,375
Don't get soft now, men.

522
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,442
How many are we looking for?

523
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,042
Sixty young recruits.

524
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,958
Breakfast is turnip bread.

525
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,938
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

526
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,583
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

527
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,958
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

528
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:31,875
Gas.

529
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:36,083
There was gas here.

530
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,000
Shit!

531
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,667
Hello, madam.

532
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:01,292
I'm kropp.

533
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:06,792
And you?

534
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,083
Do you want to...

535
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,917
Do you want to come with me?

536
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,083
Not a problem.

537
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:24,333
Kat?

538
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,083
Kat.

539
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,750
Kat!

540
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,583
Shit.

541
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,667
- —Flipping idiots.
- Uh huh.

542
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:53,208
Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

543
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,167
Germany will soon be empty.

544
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:19,792
Compiegne, France
8 November, 1918

545
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,375
General.

546
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,333
Well, brixdorf, what's the latest?

547
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:28,042
The French are increasing the pressure.

548
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,833
Early this morning,
our reconnaissance intercepted orders

549
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:33,250
summoning entire divisions to latierre.

550
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:36,083
A tank fleet is still reportedly
still stuck at fernancourt.

551
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,875
Must mean an attack is likely.

552
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,417
The social democrats
will be the end of mankind, brixdorf.

553
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:45,958
General?

554
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:53,333
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

555
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:54,917
on the train to compiegne.

556
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:05,500
These people, brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

557
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:08,583
My orders are war.

558
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:13,333
And all the while that is the case,
I shall fight for every meter.

559
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:18,083
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

560
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:20,917
In a few months, the incoming class
of recruits will be here.

561
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,958
The French are trying everything they can

562
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:26,583
to force
their completely unacceptable terms on us.

563
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,875
I will not capitulate.

564
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,667
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

565
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
General.

566
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,500
From our position,

567
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,792
I have to be clear...

568
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,333
We all have to be clear...

569
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:14,875
For god's sake.

570
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,458
Shit.

571
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:49,875
Sir!

572
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,125
Soldiers, pack your bags,

573
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:04,958
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

574
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:08,333
The whole regiment will advance
to the front firing position.

575
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:11,583
And I mean everyone
who's able to stand on two legs is going.

576
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,792
Line up, for god's sake.

577
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:18,583
You think the frenchies will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

578
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,393
- Here we go again.
- —Get moving!

579
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:23,042
Where to? —where to? Where to?

580
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,542
Into battle.

581
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:01,667
Monsieur ie maréchal is awaiting you.

582
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,542
I'll come back for you.

583
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,167
Envious, huh?

584
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:46,542
I stand before you

585
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:51,000
in the hope that you will take
our presence here today as an opportunity

586
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,750
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

587
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,750
In the name of humanity,

588
01:04:57,542 --> 01:05:00,542
I'm here asking you for an agreement
to an immediate cease—fire

589
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,708
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

590
01:05:03,792 --> 01:05:07,167
in order to spare
our nation's unnecessary depletion.

591
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:12,417
Matthias erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

592
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,293
Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

593
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,667
I don't know.

594
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,625
Marshal foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

595
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,667
We are here looking foward to hearing

596
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,250
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

597
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:42,458
that will include all those on the water,
on land, as well as in the sky.

598
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,667
I have no proposal
of this kind to make.

599
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:52,792
What does he mean by that?

600
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,792
I think he disliked the phrasing
of what you said.

601
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,333
Yes.

602
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:00,958
Good, then...

603
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,625
Monsieur le maréchal,

604
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:09,375
If you please,
we would like to know the conditions—...

605
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:20,500
He wants you
to ask for it, formally.

606
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,375
Monsieur ie maréchal,

607
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,708
I am asking you for an armistice.

608
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,042
We are asking for an armistice.

609
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,792
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

610
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:48,059
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

611
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:50,000
They are non—negotiable.

612
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,458
Seventy—two hours?

613
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,222
The war will continue until you sign them.

614
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,333
Monsieur ie maréchal,

615
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,125
in god's name,
don't let 72 hours pass us by here.

616
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,145
Thousands of lives depend on it.

617
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:08,958
Sign then.

618
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:25,917
Understood.

619
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:46,583
-Soldiers, we'll march. —sir.

620
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:51,042
Soldiers, march.

621
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,333
March, soldiers.

622
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,417
Soldiers, march.

623
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,167
Off you go, get out of here.

624
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:02,292
March, soldiers.

625
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:04,917
March.

626
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:06,833
Soldiers, march.

627
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,958
March, soldiers. Off you go.

628
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:01,250
Go, go, go!

629
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,667
Atencion aux arbaletes...

630
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:57,750
Allezl allez ies gars!

631
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,250
Allez! Allez!

632
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:33,208
Keep going, Paul. Come on. Paul!

633
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:41,667
Allezl

634
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:51,792
Au renfortl

635
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,500
Putain, putain, non, non!

636
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:57,417
Get out!

637
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,250
What is that?

638
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:06,417
Get out!

639
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,250
Here!
—ouick, quick, quick! Move it!

640
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:11,542
Get out!

641
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,458
There, there, look!

642
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:13,601
- —What is it?
- Down there.

643
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:14,625
What is it?

644
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,292
Open fire!

645
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,917
Open fire!

646
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,167
All down!

647
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,375
Get down!

648
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:04,833
Boys, think fast! Be smart!

649
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,708
Get the hand grenades out!

650
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:31,917
Throw them in the vehicle
when they're on top of us.

651
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:00,333
Get out!

652
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:02,125
Get up!

653
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:11,500
Franz!

654
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,083
Follow me. Come on, follow me!

655
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:16,208
Franz!

656
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:18,292
Paul!

657
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:03,625
Paul.

658
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:04,708
Paul!

659
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,750
Open fi re!

660
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:36,583
Retreat!

661
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,917
Retreat!

662
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:57,250
No, no, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No!

663
01:17:57,333 --> 01:18:00,125
Please, please, no! No, no, no!

664
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:03,250
No, wait, wait, don't shoot.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. No.

665
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,333
No, no! —albert.

666
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,708
Come on, come on.

667
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:16,167
Come on!

668
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:22,875
Keep going!

669
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,333
Where is Franz?

670
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:51,667
I've left Franz alone!

671
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,292
Katczinsky!

672
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,750
Take the machine gun and retreat.

673
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:05,583
We'll regroup in eguisac,
two kilometres northeast.

674
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,667
I miss my comrades, sir. I miss them all!

675
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,042
I miss my mother, for god's sake.

676
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:15,667
Grenades, ammunition! Come on!

677
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:18,667
Paul, come on!

678
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:28,875
Get out of here! Let's go!

679
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,250
These aren't negotiations,
this is a dictate.

680
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:52,667
Maybe we should return to spa
to consult with the general staff.

681
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,708
And what expectations
do you have for that?

682
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:57,167
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

683
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,583
we won't be worse off
than we are with this surrender.

684
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:01,667
Except for
a few hundred thousand extra deaths.

685
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,583
Alsace—lorraine,
occupation of the rhineland,

686
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:05,833
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

687
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,042
You are aware,
this is a total capitulation.

688
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:12,458
250,000 Americans
are landing each month in Europe.

689
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:16,083
Marne, cantigny, cambrai.
All of those lost.

690
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,125
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

691
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,792
is false pride, as I see it.

692
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,235
Thanks to you and your commanders,

693
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:24,458
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

694
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:27,000
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

695
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,208
We are remaining here.

696
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:35,750
It is winter.

697
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,042
Without trains and provisions,
bolshevism will take over.

698
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,875
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

699
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:45,375
instead of dying
with honour on the battlefield.

700
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,625
Honour?

701
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:52,292
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honour.

702
01:20:58,583 --> 01:20:59,708
Von helldorf.

703
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:03,125
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

704
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,375
and telegraph them to headquarters.

705
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,792
You inform the government.

706
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,333
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

707
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:14,750
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

708
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,292
there dies another soldier.

709
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,667
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for god's sake,

710
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,583
let's make peace.

711
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:10,250
Retreat! Retreat!

712
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,333
Run! Run!

713
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,083
Keep firing!

714
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:20,125
Shut up!

715
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,458
Shut up!

716
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:09,792
That's enough!

717
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,542
Iqaspingl

718
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:06,708
No, no, no.

719
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,333
Comrade.

720
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,208
Comrade, comrade.

721
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,625
So sorry.

722
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,042
So sorry.

723
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

724
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,292
Duval, Gerard typographer

725
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:15,917
Your wife...

726
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,000
Your wife...

727
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,292
I promise... I promise...

728
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,708
I promise...

729
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,125
When were you born, brixdorf?

730
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:18,292
1877, in June.

731
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,708
A summer child.

732
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:23,792
Yes.

733
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,083
What about your father?

734
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,625
My family live in holstein
and he has a factory there.

735
01:30:33,167 --> 01:30:35,542
Producing what?

736
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:38,708
Riding saddles, general.

737
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,375
Riding saddles.

738
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:45,458
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

739
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,458
I am indeed fortunate.

740
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:51,833
And?

741
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,250
Are you looking foward to going home?

742
01:30:55,542 --> 01:30:57,917
When we are no longer needed here?
—yes.

743
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:02,750
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

744
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,667
I will take over the business.
—mhm.

745
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:07,958
Congratulations.

746
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:09,583
And you?

747
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:13,000
I'm a soldier.

748
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,083
My father was an officer in this regiment.

749
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,542
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

750
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,708
He won all three of them.

751
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,583
In 1871, he marched on Paris

752
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,083
and when he returned, he was a hero.

753
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:34,125
I was too late in being born, brixdorf.

754
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:37,750
It's been 50 years of no war.

755
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:40,708
What is a soldier without war?

756
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,500
Were you and your father close?

757
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,458
As a child, maybe.

758
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,875
A man is alone when born.

759
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,583
He lives alone

760
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:01,208
and on his deathbed is alone.

761
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,292
The kaiser has abdicated

762
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:34,000
Come in.

763
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:38,500
- Von helldorf. How can I help you?
- —Hindenburg.

764
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:39,875
Open it immediately.

765
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,817
He urges us to sign.

766
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:53,542
- It's over!
- We're going home!

767
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:55,833
We're going home!

768
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:58,083
Back to our families.

769
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:10,958
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

770
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:14,667
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

771
01:33:16,917 --> 01:33:18,250
Knock on the monastery's door

772
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:21,500
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

773
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:24,375
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

774
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:28,625
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

775
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:34,917
Are there any sergeants left?

776
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:46,250
Chloroform the man,
for god's sake.

777
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:01,542
Baumer.

778
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,625
Baumer.

779
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:09,833
Baumer.

780
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:11,542
Tjaden? Tjaden.

781
01:34:13,792 --> 01:34:14,792
What happened?

782
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,458
Where have you been hit?

783
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:17,625
Above the knee.

784
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,333
Or somewhere down there.

785
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:21,792
I can't feel anything.

786
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,292
How far up is the shot?

787
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,667
I can't raise my head.

788
01:34:28,667 --> 01:34:30,125
Ten centimetres, it seems.

789
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,115
You're going home soon, tjaden.

790
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:38,125
- You think so?
- Yes, you are.

791
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:45,167
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

792
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,292
God damn shit.

793
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,875
You can still do it.

794
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:54,167
Just wait and see.

795
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,875
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

796
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:00,250
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

797
01:35:00,792 --> 01:35:02,042
You won't have to.

798
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:04,445
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

799
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,250
Oh, dear Paul.

800
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:12,417
I have something to give you.

801
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,333
Is he dead?

802
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,708
You must show braveness.

803
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,625
You're alive, remember?

804
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,542
For that, you have to be grateful.

805
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,375
For us.

806
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,750
For those who didn't make it.
—that's enough.

807
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:04,333
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

808
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:21,083
Good feeling, right?

809
01:36:22,292 --> 01:36:23,375
Have a bit of that, then.

810
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:25,667
Yeah, dry your socks out there.

811
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:27,847
The way the last summer was...

812
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,583
Right, none...

813
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:36,875
You see?

814
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,375
Not like the last one.

815
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,500
That was too...

816
01:36:44,792 --> 01:36:46,583
You always blame me.

817
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:49,500
- We saw you!
- —What did you see me doing?

818
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:51,667
Come on!

819
01:36:52,792 --> 01:36:54,167
Nah, we know it was you.

820
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,875
Why is it always on me?

821
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,917
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

822
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:15,583
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

823
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,792
We are that second company!

824
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,958
So dish it out! Give it to us!

825
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:22,042
Kat?

826
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,917
Kat! — Paul?

827
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Kat!

828
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:26,708
Paul!

829
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,833
Pauh Kat, you were alive.

830
01:37:28,917 --> 01:37:30,542
- Paul!
- You're alive!

831
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:31,625
Paul.

832
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:41,125
Tjaden was hit.

833
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:42,500
He's lying inside the church.

834
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,667
He'll get a double portion from us.

835
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:46,750
Yes.

836
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,792
Another one. In here.

837
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,583
- I thought you were dead.
- —Ha!

838
01:37:59,542 --> 01:38:00,917
At some point, we'll all die.

839
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:03,358
But not on the home stretch.

840
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,333
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

841
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,583
Ha!

842
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:14,833
Tjaden.

843
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:17,792
Tjaden.

844
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:22,917
Yes.

845
01:38:23,542 --> 01:38:24,750
Kat? — Yes.

846
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,833
Kat.

847
01:38:30,917 --> 01:38:32,417
I've soup here for you.

848
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:33,917
Have you brought cutlery?

849
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,125
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

850
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,917
There you go. Eat up.

851
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:09,833
Stop, stop, tjaden, tjaden!

852
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:11,333
Stop!

853
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:16,625
We need help over here!

854
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,292
What made you do that?

855
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:20,375
Why would you?

856
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,958
It's over for me.

857
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:24,417
He's bleeding out!

858
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,375
Tjaden.

859
01:39:35,417 --> 01:39:36,417
Tjaden.

860
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:11,875
What is it?

861
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:15,125
I've lost something.

862
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,375
Kat, do you speak French?

863
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,292
Mm.
S'il vous plait. Si! Vous plait.

864
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,667
My mother always said
it was French I should learn.

865
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,750
Aha.

866
01:41:35,042 --> 01:41:36,042
And the piano.

867
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:40,083
She also warned me of war.

868
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:41,708
She didn't want me to go.

869
01:41:41,792 --> 01:41:44,667
"That's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

870
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,708
I wanted to show that I could do it.

871
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:51,125
What use is that now?

872
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,583
"A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris."

873
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:02,375
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

874
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:05,125
- —Paul.
- The stench will remain on us forever.

875
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,184
- —Enough.
- Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert—...

876
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,542
Is that to do with us?

877
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,333
They don't suffer any more.

878
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:12,833
Peace for them.

879
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,458
We're still alive.

880
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,542
Everything here is like a fever.

881
01:42:23,292 --> 01:42:25,417
Not one person wants it
but suddenly it's there.

882
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,792
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

883
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:30,083
But nonetheless it happened

884
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:32,226
and nonetheless half the world
is involved, mind you.

885
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,375
God looks down

886
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:36,083
at us murderers.

887
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Yeah, well.

888
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,375
But what do I know?

889
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:47,958
Nothing.

890
01:42:48,667 --> 01:42:50,208
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

891
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,417
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

892
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:55,917
Yes.

893
01:43:13,792 --> 01:43:14,792
Kat?

894
01:43:15,625 --> 01:43:16,708
Mm.

895
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,167
What did your son die of?

896
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:26,583
The pox.

897
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,708
I'm afraid of what's to come.

898
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,083
Don't be.

899
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,208
Henri.

900
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,833
Taste it.

901
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:27,917
Were they made today?

902
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:32,875
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

903
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:34,875
Hmm.

904
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:58,458
Monsieur ie maréchal.

905
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:07,000
I'm listening.

906
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:09,042
The kaiser has abdicated.

907
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:13,667
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

908
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:16,250
The new government
will do everything it can

909
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:18,875
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

910
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:22,708
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

911
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:25,750
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

912
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:29,042
This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

913
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:30,500
I don't fear it.

914
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:32,208
I reject any compromise.

915
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:33,875
I reject any compromise.

916
01:45:33,958 --> 01:45:36,042
Monsieur ie maréchal, please.

917
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:40,500
Be fair to your opponent
or else this peace will be hated.

918
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:41,583
Fair?

919
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,458
You speak of fairness?

920
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:01,750
Sign it.

921
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,690
Let the minutes record.

922
01:47:09,292 --> 01:47:13,083
The armistice here signed
shall take effect in six hours from now

923
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:16,917
at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day
of the eleventh month.

924
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:20,667
Very good.

925
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:22,417
The war is over.

926
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:38,623
What are you going to do now?

927
01:47:40,417 --> 01:47:42,000
What do you see here, brixdorf?

928
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,042
The plains of latierre, general.

929
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:47,125
Eguisac.

930
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,250
I see them too.

931
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:53,167
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

932
01:47:55,042 --> 01:47:57,333
The French troops are farting
on our position in latierre

933
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:59,958
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

934
01:48:00,042 --> 01:48:01,362
who are selling the homeland off.

935
01:48:05,542 --> 01:48:07,458
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

936
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,083
Have them all report here.

937
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,292
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

938
01:48:24,083 --> 01:48:28,417
Any communication
with the enemy remains prohibited.

939
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:33,417
Firstly, hostilities on the entire front
will be ceased this morning,

940
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,667
November 11 th at eleven o'clock.

941
01:48:36,417 --> 01:48:39,083
Secondly, the troops
will not cross the line reached

942
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:41,292
on this day at this hour.

943
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:45,500
The front line
shall remain unchanged past this hour.

944
01:48:45,583 --> 01:48:48,625
All troops are to return to their station.

945
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,542
What time is it?

946
01:48:56,417 --> 01:48:58,417
Why aren't you asleep?
—listen a minute.

947
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,125
It's so still.

948
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:07,042
I must be going deaf.

949
01:49:13,417 --> 01:49:14,792
They've signed, Paul.

950
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:20,583
The war's over.

951
01:49:22,542 --> 01:49:23,542
It's over.

952
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:30,250
Are you hungry?

953
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,375
I'm hungry.

954
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:38,792
Where are you going?

955
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:41,000
Come on,
before the bastard wakes up.

956
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:46,208
- What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
- —I don't know.

957
01:49:46,292 --> 01:49:48,042
I'm gonna roast a goose.

958
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:50,333
Red cabbage, potatoes...

959
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:53,042
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

960
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:55,750
My god, Paul, she is beautiful.

961
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:56,875
Yeah?

962
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:59,250
- What does she look like?
- Well...

963
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:02,167
Long curly hair, dark.

964
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:05,083
And she's buxom and strong.

965
01:50:05,167 --> 01:50:06,167
Yeah?

966
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:09,500
Christmas.

967
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,625
It's all so far away still.

968
01:50:12,167 --> 01:50:13,917
No, it's not. It's really close.

969
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,583
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

970
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:24,125
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

971
01:50:24,208 --> 01:50:25,208
Ah?

972
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:27,875
You know when...

973
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:30,417
Once we're back home, then we will...

974
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:33,000
- —Yeah?
- We must do something together.

975
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,792
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

976
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:36,875
Yeah, yeah.

977
01:50:38,792 --> 01:50:39,792
What is it?

978
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,000
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

979
01:50:43,542 --> 01:50:47,083
Ah? You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

980
01:50:48,083 --> 01:50:49,363
Hasn't done me any good, though.

981
01:50:50,542 --> 01:50:51,625
What are we gonna do?

982
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,750
Sole shoes together?

983
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,792
Are you trying to insult me?

984
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:58,833
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

985
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:01,528
You're going to university, Paul.

986
01:51:02,542 --> 01:51:03,875
Or I'll shoot you right here.

987
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:07,458
My trousers are loose.

988
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,542
My trousers are loose.

989
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,875
You'll just have to eat something.

990
01:51:16,792 --> 01:51:19,073
Soon we'll be home
then we can eat whatever we want.

991
01:51:20,292 --> 01:51:21,292
Whatever we want.

992
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:47,417
It's your go.

993
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:50,083
If the farmer catches me again,

994
01:51:50,167 --> 01:51:52,042
then he's bound
to shoot me down where I stand.

995
01:51:56,458 --> 01:51:58,292
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

996
01:51:58,375 --> 01:51:59,375
Yeah.

997
01:52:31,292 --> 01:52:32,292
Ah?

998
01:52:50,708 --> 01:52:52,792
Shh, shh... hey, hey, hey.

999
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:14,208
Look.

1000
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:18,542
It's really good.

1001
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:22,917
Want some?

1002
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,250
Shit.

1003
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Piece of garbage...

1004
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:18,208
Stop!

1005
01:54:19,167 --> 01:54:20,292
Thief!

1006
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:30,500
Kat! Run!

1007
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:32,375
Run!

1008
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,250
Asshole!

1009
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:41,958
God damn!

1010
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:45,042
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1011
01:55:02,292 --> 01:55:03,667
Oh, crap.

1012
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:05,167
Look at this. —what is it?

1013
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:08,083
- —A lucky shot.
- He hit the eggs!

1014
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:11,042
Stop the flow.

1015
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,792
Come on, get it in there.

1016
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:19,917
There you go.

1017
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:24,208
We can have an omelette.

1018
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:26,417
No, we'll eat them now.

1019
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,500
They're just as good.

1020
01:55:46,333 --> 01:55:47,417
Better than ever.

1021
01:55:49,208 --> 01:55:50,208
I won't be long.

1022
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:28,500
Kat?

1023
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:34,500
Kat?

1024
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:39,875
Kat!

1025
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:43,000
What happened?

1026
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:44,917
We should leave.

1027
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:47,667
Who fired the shot?

1028
01:57:48,167 --> 01:57:49,542
That little shit from the farm.

1029
01:57:50,667 --> 01:57:51,833
The farmer's son.

1030
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:55,292
Kat, Kat.

1031
01:57:56,167 --> 01:57:57,208
What a mess.

1032
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:06,333
How big is it?

1033
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:09,000
Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1034
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:11,333
No. Give me a cigarette.

1035
01:58:12,542 --> 01:58:13,708
Let the medic do that.

1036
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:34,208
They stuck me in a class
with seven—year-olds.

1037
01:58:36,125 --> 01:58:37,750
I'd begun shaving already.

1038
01:58:39,458 --> 01:58:40,542
Find me a word.

1039
01:58:42,667 --> 01:58:44,208
That trifle can rhyme with.

1040
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:46,375
Mhm.

1041
01:58:48,292 --> 01:58:50,583
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1042
01:58:57,167 --> 01:58:58,542
Fucking shit.

1043
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:02,083
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1044
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:07,542
- Come on, we need to move.
- Yeah.

1045
01:59:14,708 --> 01:59:15,708
Alright?

1046
01:59:16,667 --> 01:59:17,875
Kat?

1047
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:19,083
Rifle.

1048
01:59:19,167 --> 01:59:20,333
Mhm?

1049
01:59:20,417 --> 01:59:22,125
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1050
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:35,792
When we get home, you're going
to make a new pair of boots for me.

1051
01:59:35,875 --> 01:59:37,708
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1052
01:59:52,292 --> 01:59:53,292
Hey!

1053
01:59:56,625 --> 01:59:57,750
Wait!

1054
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:00,333
Pull over!

1055
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:01,875
Let us on!

1056
02:00:02,917 --> 02:00:04,542
Hey! Let us on!

1057
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:16,750
Come on, will you?

1058
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:53,375
This man needs care.

1059
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,917
Where is the medic?

1060
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,760
Could've spared yourself
the trouble.

1061
02:01:28,875 --> 02:01:29,875
Huh?

1062
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:31,750
He's dead.

1063
02:01:37,167 --> 02:01:39,542
But it's... it's just a small bullet wound.

1064
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:42,833
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1065
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:44,458
The organs are poisoned.

1066
02:01:51,417 --> 02:01:52,417
Unconscious.

1067
02:01:53,542 --> 02:01:54,542
No.

1068
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
He's dead.

1069
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:57,625
I know what I'm doing.

1070
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,792
Impossible. I was...
I was just talking to him.

1071
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:04,500
He's unconscious.

1072
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:07,458
He's unconscious.

1073
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:15,875
See?

1074
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:20,417
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

1075
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:10,750
Go on, keep going!

1076
02:04:10,833 --> 02:04:12,208
Keep going!

1077
02:04:12,708 --> 02:04:14,333
Keep going, come on!

1078
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,083
This is it.

1079
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:27,750
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

1080
02:04:29,708 --> 02:04:30,708
It's over.

1081
02:04:32,542 --> 02:04:34,208
Attention!

1082
02:04:40,417 --> 02:04:41,417
Soldiers.

1083
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,167
We stand here as brothers

1084
02:04:45,125 --> 02:04:46,833
in a world of enemies

1085
02:04:46,917 --> 02:04:49,833
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

1086
02:04:49,917 --> 02:04:52,875
render our beloved people defenseless

1087
02:04:54,167 --> 02:04:57,083
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1088
02:04:59,125 --> 02:05:00,125
Comrades.

1089
02:05:01,083 --> 02:05:02,917
Soon you will be going home

1090
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,417
to your parents, wives and children.

1091
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:07,542
The war is over.

1092
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:13,083
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look toward to your reward.

1093
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:17,917
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

1094
02:05:19,417 --> 02:05:21,000
Ah, but comrades,

1095
02:05:22,417 --> 02:05:25,250
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes on your return

1096
02:05:27,292 --> 02:05:28,167
or as weaklings

1097
02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:31,417
and cowards who tucked their tails in
when it really counted?

1098
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:32,580
We're going home.

1099
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:33,625
Soldiers.

1100
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:38,250
We are about to attack them
with the utmost force and vehemence.

1101
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:42,500
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1102
02:05:42,583 --> 02:05:47,542
We will seize the plains before 11:00 am.
And end this war with a merciless strike.

1103
02:05:47,625 --> 02:05:48,958
And make them see...

1104
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,500
We were victorious.

1105
02:05:51,583 --> 02:05:56,583
Onwards, with god on our side
as he was with our fathers before us.

1106
02:05:56,667 --> 02:05:59,333
I'm not going back
into battle. Not me!

1107
02:05:59,417 --> 02:06:00,583
Shut up!

1108
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:04,333
- Let me go!
- Follow your orders!

1109
02:06:04,417 --> 02:06:06,268
Do as your told!

1110
02:06:06,292 --> 02:06:07,375
All of you, get back.

1111
02:06:08,083 --> 02:06:10,518
- Please, I didn't do anything!
- —Aim!

1112
02:06:10,542 --> 02:06:13,292
No! No! — Fire!

1113
02:06:37,583 --> 02:06:38,792
Keep moving!

1114
02:06:41,667 --> 02:06:42,667
Come on!

1115
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:52,667
Company, halt!

1116
02:06:56,958 --> 02:06:59,125
Rifle off!

1117
02:06:59,208 --> 02:07:02,375
- —Fix bayonets!
- Fix bayonets and load!

1118
02:07:17,417 --> 02:07:18,875
What time is it?

1119
02:07:18,958 --> 02:07:20,292
Fifteen minutes to go.

1120
02:07:57,625 --> 02:07:59,025
It belonged to Lefevre.

1121
02:08:00,292 --> 02:08:02,083
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

1122
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:05,083
- He won't need it anymore.
- Thank you, sir.

1123
02:08:09,375 --> 02:08:11,208
Here's to you and to lef'evre.

1124
02:08:17,542 --> 02:08:18,583
Well, it's good.

1125
02:08:22,208 --> 02:08:23,208
The nightmare is over.

1126
02:09:23,375 --> 02:09:26,333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

1127
02:09:26,417 --> 02:09:28,083
- —In position!
- In position!

1128
02:09:30,667 --> 02:09:32,083
Fire!

1129
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:34,167
Fire!

1130
02:10:09,375 --> 02:10:11,083
Throw the grenades!

1131
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:22,958
Charge!

1132
02:11:19,208 --> 02:11:21,125
Please, no! No, no!

1133
02:13:11,625 --> 02:13:13,333
Cease fire!

1134
02:13:13,417 --> 02:13:14,958
It is 11:00 am!

1135
02:13:15,625 --> 02:13:17,065
Cease fire!

1136
02:13:17,542 --> 02:13:19,542
Cease fi re!

1137
02:13:20,542 --> 02:13:22,625
It is eleven o'clock.

1138
02:15:57,708 --> 02:16:00,583
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

1139
02:16:19,875 --> 02:16:21,515
Are you alright?

1140
02:16:22,875 --> 02:16:23,875
Yeah.

1141
02:16:24,667 --> 02:16:27,125
Well, then.
Start gathering, please.

1142
02:19:48,458 --> 02:19:52,042
Shortly after the start of hostilities
in October 1914,

1143
02:19:52,125 --> 02:19:54,958
the western front
froze into positional warfare.

1144
02:19:56,458 --> 02:20:02,750
By the end of the war in November 1918,
the front line had barely moved.

1145
02:20:04,417 --> 02:20:07,125
More than three million soldiers
died here,

1146
02:20:07,208 --> 02:20:10,792
often while fighting to gain
only a few hundred meters of ground.

1147
02:20:12,375 --> 02:20:18,708
Almost 17 million people
lost their lives in the first world war.

1148
02:20:20,875 --> 02:20:27,417
All quiet on the western front
