IS IT REALLY SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

YOUR CLOTHES ARE DIFFERENT,

00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,337
WE GOT A LOT TO DO. WE GOTTA GET TO IT.

676
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,240
NOW...

677
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,043
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO START WITH THESE OPERATION PROGRAMS FIRST.

678
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,446
THAT'S MAJOR BORING SHIT.

679
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,615
LET'S DO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE FUN.

680
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,416
HOW ABOUT...

681
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,953
COMBAT TRAINING?

682
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,427
JUJITSU?

683
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,930
I'M GOING TO LEARN JUJITSU?

684
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,209
HOLY SHIT!

685
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,845
HEY, MIKEY, I THINK HE LIKES IT.

686
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,446
HOW ABOUT SOME MORE?

687
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,714
HELL, YES.

688
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,385
HELL, YEAH.

689
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,064
HOW IS HE?

690
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,100
10 HOURS STRAIGHT. HE'S A MACHINE.

691
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,613
I KNOW KUNG FU.

692
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,282
SHOW ME.

693
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,485
THIS IS A SPARRING PROGRAM,

694
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,488
SIMILAR TO THE PROGRAMMED REALITY OF THE MATRIX.

695
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,091
IT HAS THE SAME BASIC RULES, RULES LIKE GRAVITY.

696
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,225
WHAT YOU MUST LEARN

697
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,493
IS THAT THESE RULES ARE NO DIFFERENT

698
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,062
THAN THE RULES OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM.

699
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,697
SOME OF THEM CAN BE BENT,

700
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,700
OTHERS CAN BE BROKEN.

701
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,535
UNDERSTAND?

702
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:33,070
THEN HIT ME...

703
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,072
IF YOU CAN.

704
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:14,911
GOOD!

705
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,847
ADAPTATION,

706
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,115
IMPROVISATION.

707
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:21,685
BUT YOUR WEAKNESS IS NOT YOUR TECHNIQUE.

708
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,726
MORPHEUS IS FIGHTING NEO.

709
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,334
HOW DID I BEAT YOU?

710
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,339
YOU'RE--

711
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,641
YOU'RE TOO FAST.

712
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:55,645
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MY BEING STRONGER OR FASTER

713
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,348
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY MUSCLES

714
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,684
IN THIS PLACE?

715
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,523
YOU THINK THAT'S AIR YOU'RE BREATHING NOW?

716
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,330
HMM.

717
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,338
AGAIN.

718
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,018
Mouse: JESUS CHRIST, HE'S FAST.

719
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,386
TAKE A LOOK AT HIS NEURO-KINETICS.

720
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,621
THEY'RE WAY ABOVE NORMAL.

721
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,793
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

722
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,196
YOU'RE FASTER THAN THIS.

723
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,067
DON'T THINK YOU ARE,

724
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,203
KNOW YOU ARE.

725
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,349
COME ON, STOP TRYING TO HIT ME AND HIT ME.

726
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,260
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

727
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,964
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

728
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,302
I'M TRYING TO FREE YOUR MIND, NEO,

729
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,704
BUT I CAN ONLY SHOW YOU THE DOOR.

730
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,473
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HAS TO WALK THROUGH IT.

731
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,310
TANK,

732
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,811
LOAD THE JUMP PROGRAM.

733
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,791
YOU HAVE TO LET IT ALL GO, NEO,

734
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,059
FEAR,

735
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,828
DOUBT, AND DISBELIEF.

736
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,663

737
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,398

741
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,388
SO WHAT IF HE MAKES IT?

742
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,990
NO ONE'S EVER MADE THEIR FIRST JUMP.

743
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,324
I KNOW, I KNOW.

744
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,927
BUT WHAT IF HE DOES?

745
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,161
HE WON'T.

746
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,896

747
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,099

749
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,004
FREE MY MIND. NO PROBLEM, RIGHT.

AAAAAHHHH!

751
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,715

OHH!

755
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:55,191
WH-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT--

756
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,694
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

757
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,730
EVERYBODY FALLS THE FIRST TIME,

758
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,332
RIGHT, TRIN?

759
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:16,946
OHH!

760
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,354
I THOUGHT IT WASN'T REAL.

761
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,022
YOUR MIND MAKES IT REAL.

762
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,161
IF YOU'RE KILLED IN THE MATRIX,

763
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,562
YOU DIE HERE?

764
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,998
THE BODY CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THE MIND.

765
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,932
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU EVER BRINGING ME DINNER.

DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE A BELIEVER NOW.

768
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:21,010
I JUST KEEP WONDERING, IF MORPHEUS IS SO SURE...

769
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,880
WHY DOESN'T HE TAKE HIM TO SEE THE ORACLE?

770
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,950
MORPHEUS WILL TAKE HIM WHEN HE'S READY.

771
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,195
THE MATRIX IS A SYSTEM, NEO.

772
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,232
THAT SYSTEM IS OUR ENEMY.

773
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,733
BUT WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE,

774
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,368

775
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:46,770
BUSINESSMEN, TEACHERS,

776
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,038
LAWYERS, CARPENTERS--

THE VERY MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WE ARE TRYING TO SAVE.

778

BUT UNTIL WE DO,

779
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,512
THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL A PART OF THAT SYSTEM,

780
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,247
AND THAT MAKES THEM OUR ENEMY.

781
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,915
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND--

782
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,652
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT READY TO BE UNPLUGGED.

783
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,521
AND MANY OF THEM ARE SO INURED,

784
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,056
SO HOPELESSLY DEPENDENT ON THE SYSTEM,

785
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,592
THAT THEY WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT IT.

786
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,329
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME, NEO?

787

THIS ISN'T THE MATRIX?

792

NO.

793
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,947
IT'S ANOTHER TRAINING PROGRAM

794
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,283
DESIGNED TO TEACH YOU ONE THING--

795
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,553
IF YOU ARE NOT ONE OF US, YOU ARE ONE OF THEM.

796
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,087
WHAT ARE THEY?

797
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,089
SENTIENT PROGRAMS.

798
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:42,959
THEY CAN MOVE IN AND OUT OF ANY SOFTWARE

799
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,227
STILL HARDWIRED TO THEIR SYSTEM.

800
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:47,697
THAT MEANS THAT ANYONE WE HAVEN'T UNPLUGGED

801
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,766
IS POTENTIALLY AN AGENT.

THEY ARE EVERYONE...

804
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,906
AND THEY ARE NO ONE.

805
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,908
WE HAVE SURVIVED BY HIDING FROM THEM

806
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,276
AND BY RUNNING FROM THEM.

807
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,778
BUT THEY ARE THE GATEKEEPERS.

808
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,613
THEY ARE GUARDING ALL THE DOORS.

809
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,848
THEY ARE HOLDING ALL THE KEYS,

810
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,583
WHICH MEANS THAT SOONER OR LATER,

811
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,585
SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT THEM.

I WON'T LIE TO YOU, NEO.

EVERY SINGLE MAN OR WOMAN WHO HAS STOOD THEIR GROUND,

815
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,860
EVERYONE WHO HAS FOUGHT AN AGENT, HAS DIED.

I'VE SEEN AN AGENT PUNCH THROUGH A CONCRETE WALL.

819
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,502
