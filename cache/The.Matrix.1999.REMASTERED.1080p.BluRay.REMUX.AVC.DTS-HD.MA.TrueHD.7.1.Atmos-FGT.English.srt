00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,989
<i>Go. Now.</i>

163
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,924
<i>Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.</i>

164
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,971
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time.</i>

165
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,057
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

166
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,853
<i>Open it.</i>

167
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,480
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

168
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,316
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

169
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,944
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

170
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,990
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

171
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,452
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

172
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,790
This is insane!

173
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,835
Why is this happening to me?

174
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,753
What'd I do?

175
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,882
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

176
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,925
I'm gonna die.

177
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,769
Shit!

178
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,166
Oh, shit!

179
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,923
I can't do this.

180
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,603
Shit.

181
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,699
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

182
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,661
It seems that you've been living...

183
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,038
...two lives.

184
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,959
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

185
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,546
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

186
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,883
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

187
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,594
And you...

188
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,807
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

189
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,438
The other life is lived in computers...

190
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,691
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

191
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,738
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

192
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,991
One of these lives...

193
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,076
...has a future.

194
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,412
And one of them does not.

195
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,961
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

196
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,297
You're here...

197
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,883
...because we need your help.

198
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,514
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

199
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,558
...individual.

200
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,521
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

201
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,526
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

202
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,196
He is considered by many authorities...

203
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,491
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

204
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,411
My colleagues...

205
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,790
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

206
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,502
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

207
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,297
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

208
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,800
...give you a fresh start.

209
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,220
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

210
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,973
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

211
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,601
Yeah.

212
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,979
That sounds like a really good deal.

213
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,358
But I got a better one.

214
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,110
How about...

215
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,529
...I give you the finger...

216
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,117
...and you give me my phone call.

217
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,162
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,376
...you disappoint me.

219
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,254
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

220
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,880
I know my rights.

221
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,632
I want my phone call.

222
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,385
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

223
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,679
...what good is a phone call...

224
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,516
...if you're unable to speak?

225
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,510
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

226
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,180
...whether you want to or not.

227
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,894
[PHONE RINGS]

228
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,866
MORPHEUS: <i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

229
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:10,412
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

230
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,498
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

231
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

232
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,463
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

233
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:24,552
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

234
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,763
<i>...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

235
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,515
<i>...looking for you.</i>

236
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,227
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

237
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,064
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

238
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,492
Get in.

239
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,589
What's this?

240
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,383
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

241
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,802
- From what?
- From you.

242
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,805
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

243
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,140
Stop the car.

244
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,896
Listen, coppertop.

245
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,148
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

246
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,026
Right now, there's only one rule:

247
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,652
Our way...

248
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,070
...or the highway.

249
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,703
Fine.

250
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,041
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

251
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,252
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

252
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,212
You know that road.

253
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,840
You know exactly where it ends.

254
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,303
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

255
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,027
Apoc, lights.

256
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,698
TRINITY: Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

257
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,869
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

258
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,087
Try and relax.

259
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,552
Come on.

260
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,638
Come on.

261
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,391
It's on the move.

262
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,394
Come on, you shit.

263
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,481
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

264
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,732
Clear!

265
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,451
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

266
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,528
This is it.

267
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,325
Let me give you one piece of advice.

268
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,953
Be honest.

269
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,749
He knows more than you can imagine.

270
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,800
At last.

271
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,428
Welcome, Neo.

272
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,556
As you no doubt have guessed...

273
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,058
...I am Morpheus.

274
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,685
It's an honor to meet you.

275
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,187
No...

276
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,064
...the honor is mine.

277
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,484
Please, come. Sit.

278
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,209
I imagine...

279
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,378
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

280
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,508
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

281
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,426
You could say that.

282
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,971
I can see it in your eyes.

283
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,850
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

284
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,353
...because he's expecting to wake up.

285
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,357
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

286
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,443
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

287
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,694
No.

288
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,154
Why not?

289
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,199
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

290
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,620
I know exactly what you mean.

291
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,293
Let me tell you why you're here.

292
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,879
You know something.

293
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,048
What you know,
you can't explain.

294
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,134
But you feel it.

295
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,636
You felt it your entire life:

296
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,391
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

297
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,102
Like a splinter in your mind...

298
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,229
...driving you mad.

299
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,899
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

300
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,279
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

301
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,448
The Matrix?

302
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,619
Do you want to know...

303
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,080
...what it is?

304
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,334
The Matrix is everywhere.

305
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,295
It is all around us.

306
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,505
Even now, in this very room.

307
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,550
You can see it when you
look out your window...

308
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,136
...or when you turn on your television.

309
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,097
You can feel it when you go to work...

310
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,309
...when you go to church...

311
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,811
...when you pay your taxes.

312
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,857
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

313
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,692
...to blind you from the truth.

314
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,154
What truth?

315
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,951
That you are a slave.

316
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,747
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

317
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:31,668
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

318
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,253
A prison...

319
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,630
...for your mind.

320
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,972
Unfortunately, no one can be...

321
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,683
...told what the Matrix is.

322
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,022
You have to see it for yourself.

323
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,825
This is your last chance.

324
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,411
After this, there is no turning back.

325
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,330
You take the blue pill...

326
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,708
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

327
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,752
...whatever you want to believe.

328
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,337
You take the red pill...

329
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,547
...you stay in Wonderland...

330
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,759
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

331
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,853
Remember...

332
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,732
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

333
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,373
Follow me.

334
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,585
Apoc, are we on-line?

335
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,212
APOC:
Almost.

336
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,592
MORPHEUS:
Time is always against us.

337
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,469
Please take a seat there.

338
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,364
-You did all this?
TRINITY: Mm-hm.

339
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,495
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

340
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,876
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

341
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,461
What does that mean?

342
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,213
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

343
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,882
...because Kansas...

344
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,175
...is going bye-bye.

345
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,464
Did you...?

346
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:37,562
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

347
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,608
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

348
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,361
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

349
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,405
...and the real world?

350
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,199
NEO:
This can't be.

351
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,409
MORPHEUS:
Be what?

352
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,619
Be real?

353
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,999
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

354
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,209
Still nothing.

355
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,002
NEO:
It's cold.

356
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,629
It's cold!

357
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,176
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

358
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,347
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

359
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,057
APOC:
Targeting almost there.

360
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,770
He's going into arrest.

361
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,523
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

362
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,868
Welcome...

363
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,120
...to the real world.

364
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,373
MORPHEUS:
We've done it, Trinity.

365
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,167
We found him.

366
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,211
-I hope you're right.
MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.

367
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,380
I know it.

368
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,595
Am I dead?

369
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,264
Far from it.

370
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,655
He still needs a lot of work.

371
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,282
What are you doing?

372
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,743
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

373
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,870
Why do my eyes hurt?

374
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,456
You've never used them before.

375
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,252
Rest, Neo.

376
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,171
The answers are coming.

377
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,410
[DOOR OPENS]

378
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,330
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

379
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,040
What is this place?

380
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,960
More important than "what" is "when."

381
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,503
"When"?

382
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,756
You believe it's the year 1999...

383
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,258
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

384
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,137
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

385
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,014
...because we honestly don't know.

386
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,350
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

387
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,353
Come with me.
See for yourself.

388
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,647
MORPHEUS:
This is my ship.

389
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,859
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

390
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,447
This is the main deck.

391
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,454
This is the core...

392
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,710
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

393
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,258
Most of my crew you already know.

394
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,681
This is Apoc...

395
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,809
...Switch...

396
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,561
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

397
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,524
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

398
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,819
The little one behind you is Mouse.

399
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,409
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

400
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,662
Trinity.

401
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,268
Try to relax.

402
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,983
This will feel a little weird.

403
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,329
This...

404
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,206
...is the Construct.

405
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,750
It's our loading program.

406
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,461
We can load anything, from clothing...

407
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,088
...to equipment...

408
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,715
...weapons...

409
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,175
...training simulations...

410
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,095
...anything we need.

411
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,309
NEO: Right now we're inside
a computer program?

412
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,519
Is it really so hard to believe?

413
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,647
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

414
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,942
Your hair has changed.

415
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,654
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

416
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,991
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

417
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,998
This isn't real?

418
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,791
What is "real"?

419
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,419
How do you define "real"?

420
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,630
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

421
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,299
...what you can smell, taste and see...

422
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,428
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

423
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,018
This is the world that you know.

424
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,481
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

425
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,196
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

426
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,697
...that we call the Matrix.

427
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,038
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

428
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,165
This is the world...

429
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,209
...as it exists today.

430
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,225
Welcome to "the desert...

431
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,686
...of the real."

432
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,441
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

433
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,487
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

434
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,991
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

435
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:37,996
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

436
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,914
AI.

437
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,333
You mean artificial intelligence.

438
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,005
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

439
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,300
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

440
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,929
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

441
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,766
They were dependent on solar power...

442
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,353
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

443
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,190
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

444
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:11,320
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

445
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,993
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

446
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,625
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

447
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:29,005
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

448
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,092
Combined with a form of fusion...

449
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:38,264
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

450
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,064
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

451
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,567
...where human beings
are no longer born.

452
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,111
We are grown.

453
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,745
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

454
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,664
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

455
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,626
...watched them liquefy the dead...

456
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:10,213
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

457
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:15,009
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

458
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,179
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

459
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,600
What is the Matrix?

460
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,852
Control.

461
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,607
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

462
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,486
...built to keep us under control...

463
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,824
...in order to change a human being...

464
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,617
...into this.

465
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,120
No.

466
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,331
I don't believe it.

467
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,916
It's not possible.

468
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,088
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

469
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,631
Stop!

470
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,383
Let me out!

471
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,010
Let me out! I want out!

472
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,640
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

473
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,559
Get this thing out of me!

474
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,854
Don't touch me!

475
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,730
Stay away from me!

476
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,649
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,568
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,319
I don't believe it.

479
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,613
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

480
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,073
Just breathe.

481
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,260
I can't go back, can I?

482
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,512
No.

483
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,556
But if you could...

484
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,892
...would you really want to?

485
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,770
I owe you an apology.

486
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,731
We have a rule.

487
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,443
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

488
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,694
It's dangerous.

489
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,113
The mind has trouble letting go.

490
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,657
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

491
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,785
I did what I did because...

492
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,954
...I had to.

493
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,467
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

494
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,763
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

495
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,058
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

496
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,271
It was he who freed the first of us...

497
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,774
...taught us the truth.

498
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,320
As long as the Matrix exists...

499
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,739
...the human race will never be free.

500
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,495
After he died...

501
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,957
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

502
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,710
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

503
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,629
...end the war...

504
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,214
...bring freedom to our people.

505
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:04,178
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

506
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,097
...looking for him.

507
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,601
I did what I did because...

508
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,355
...I believe that search is over.

509
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,861
Get some rest.

510
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,281
You're going to need it.

511
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,034
For what?

512
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,289
Your training.

513
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,309
Morning. Did you sleep?

514
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,394
You will tonight.

515
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,313
I guarantee it.

516
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,733
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

517
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,610
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

518
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:07,241
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

519
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,701
Born free right here...

520
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,578
...in the real world.

521
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,496
Genuine child of Zion.

522
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,791
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

523
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,543
...Zion's where the party would be.

524
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,253
It's a city?

525
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,673
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

526
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,509
Where is it?

527
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,681
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

528
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,185
You live long enough,
you might see it.

529
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:41,275
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

530
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,277
...if Morpheus is right and all.

531
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,530
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

532
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,199
...if you are...

533
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,285
...it's a very exciting time.

534
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,039
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

535
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,879
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

536
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,342
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

537
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,135
How about...

538
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,472
...combat training?

539
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,979
"Jujitsu"?

540
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,524
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

541
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,078
Holy shit!

542
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,664
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

543
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,290
How about some more?

544
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,834
Hell, yes.

545
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,962
Hell, yeah.

546
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,225
How is he?

547
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,644
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

548
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,240
I know kung fu.

549
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,909
Show me.

550
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,455
This is a sparring program...

551
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,499
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

552
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,085
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

553
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,797
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

554
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,841
Some of them can be bent.

555
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,510
Others can be broken.

556
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,137
Understand?

557
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,264
Then hit me...

558
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:36,974
...if you can.

559
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,014
Good!

560
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,933
Adaptation.

561
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,434
Improvisation.

562
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,061
But your weakness...

563
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,687
...is not your technique.

564
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,738
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

565
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,186
How did I beat you?

566
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,861
You're too fast.

567
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,738
Do you believe that...

568
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,616
...my being stronger or faster...

569
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:02,536
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

570
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,375
You think you're breathing air?

571
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,098
Again!

572
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,987
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

573
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,448
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

574
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,372
What are you waiting for?

575
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,582
You're faster than this.

576
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:53,003
Don't think you are.

577
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,922
Know you are.

578
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,102
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

579
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,780
I don't believe it.

580
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,450
I know what you're trying to do.

581
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,287
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

582
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,707
But I can only show you the door.

583
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,126
You have to walk through it.

584
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,630
Tank, load the jump program.

585
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,936
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

586
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,647
...doubt and disbelief.

587
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,526
Free your mind.

588
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,910
Whoa.

589
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,419
Okey-dokey.

590
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,672
Free my mind.

591
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,257
What if he makes it?

592
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,218
-No one's ever made their first jump.
MOUSE: I know.

593
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,014
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

594
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:28,682
Come on.

595
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,100
All right.

596
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,603
No problem. Free my mind.

597
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,190
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

598
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,252
What does that mean?

599
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,463
It doesn't mean anything.

600
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,633
Everybody falls the first time.

601
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,384
Right, Trin?

602
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,699
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

603
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,205
If you're killed in the Matrix...

604
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,414
...you die here?

605
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,501
The body cannot live without the mind.

606
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,368
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

607
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,291
There is something about him,
isn't there?

608
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,543
You're a believer now?

609
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,753
I keep wondering...

610
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:25,674
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

611
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,511
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

612
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,856
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

613
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:43,901
That system is our enemy.

614
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,862
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

615
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,908
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

616
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,952
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

617
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,164
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

618
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,333
...and that makes them our enemy.

619
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,709
You have to understand...

620
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,296
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

621
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,131
And many of them are so inert...

622
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,800
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

623
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,762
...that they will fight to protect it.

624
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:17,017
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

625
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,936
- I was...
- Look again.

626
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,271
Freeze it.

627
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,529
NEO: This isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS: No.

628
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:35,160
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

629
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,205
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

630
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,541
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

631
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,588
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

632
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,342
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

633
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,010
...is potentially an agent.

634
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,805
Inside the Matrix...

635
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,099
...they are everyone...

636
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,142
...and they are no one.

637
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,521
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

638
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,398
...but they are the gatekeepers.

639
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,609
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

640
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,696
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

641
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,072
Someone?

642
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,824
MORPHEUS:
I won't lie to you, Neo.

643
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:19,121
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

644
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,748
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

645
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,000
Why?

646
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,544
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

647
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:29,381
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

648
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:34,261
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

649
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,637

I told you I can only
show you the door.

816

You have to walk through it.

817
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,198
Hello, Neo.

818
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,117
You're right on time.

819
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,837
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

820
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,094
These are the other Potentials.

821
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,888
You can wait here.

822
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,264
BOY:
Do not try and bend the spoon.

823
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,767
That's impossible.

824
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:57,605
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

825
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,524
What truth?

826
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,442
There is no spoon.

827
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,363
There is no spoon?

828
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:10,076
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

your noodle later on is...

brought you to see me.

It's Latin.

Means, "Know thyself."

I'll let you in on a little secret.

860

Being the One is just
like being in love.

861

No one can tell you you're in love.

Well...

...I'd better have a look at you.

866
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,311
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

867
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,369
Okay...

868
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:03,958
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

869
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,584
Then you say:

But what?

01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,674

And no one, not you, not even me...

...can convince him otherwise.

888

He believes it so blindly...

his life to save yours.

01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:27,972
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1138
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,641
What choice?

1139
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,146
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1140
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,815
TRINITY: No, you're not.
- I have to.

1141
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:41,653
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1142
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,821
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1143
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:47,659
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1144
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,203
What?

1145
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,538
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1146
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,875
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1147
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,795
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1148
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,713
No, Neo, that's not true.

1149
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:03,925
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1150
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:11,683
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1151
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:16,312
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1152
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:21,526
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1153
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,361
That's what it looks like...

1154
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:24,570
...but it's not.

1155
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,198
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1156
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:31,995
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1157
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:35,248
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1158
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,042
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1159
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:39,836
What?

1160
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,255
I believe I can bring him back.

1161
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,149
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1162
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,443
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1163
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,738
Let me tell you what I believe.

1164
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,615
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1165
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:14,245
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1166
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,539
And since I am the ranking officer...

1167
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:19,667
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1168
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,837
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1169
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:24,797
Tank...

1170
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,090
...load us up.

1171
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:39,020
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1172
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:40,980
...during my time here.

1173
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:45,234
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1174
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:47,737
...and I realized...

1175
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:50,281
...that you're not actually mammals.

1176
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:54,952
Every mammal on this planet...

1177
01:37:55,286 --> 01:38:00,208
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1178
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,293
But you humans do not.

1179
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:06,381
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1180
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:11,135
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1181
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,554
The only way you can survive...

1182
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:16,808
...is to spread to another area.

1183
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:25,108
There is another organism
on this planet...

1184
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:27,318
...that follows the same pattern.

1185
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:29,612
Do you know what it is?

1186
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,823
A virus.

1187
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:36,202
Human beings are a disease.

1188
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,121
A cancer of this planet.

1189
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,498
You are a plague.

1190
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,458
And we...

1191
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,001
...are the cure.

1192
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,421
Okay, so what do you need?

1193
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:48,172
Besides a miracle.

1194
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:49,966
Guns.

1195
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,009
Lots of guns.

1196
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,104
Neo...

1197
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:07,400
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1198
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,528
That's why it's going to work.

1199
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:16,534
Why isn't the serum working?

1200
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,454
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1201
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:22,790
Leave me with him.

1202
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:26,502
Now.

1203
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,307
TANK:
Hold on, Morpheus.

1204
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:42,268
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1205
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,772
SMITH:
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1206
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,692
I'm going to be honest...

1207
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:51,277
...with you.

1208
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,074
I...

1209
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,076
...hate...

1210
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,287
...this place...

1211
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:03,915
...this zoo...

1212
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:05,291
...this prison...

1213
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:08,711
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1214
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:11,255
I can't stand it any longer.

1215
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,883
It's the smell.

1216
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:17,136
If there is such a thing.

1217
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:20,765
I feel saturated by it.

1218
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,559
I can...

1219
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:25,353
...taste...

1220
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,563
...your stink.

1221
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:31,442
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1222
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:32,610
It's repulsive.

1223
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:34,987
Isn't it?

1224
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,450
I must get out of here.

1225
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:42,078
I must get free.

1226
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:45,206
And in this mind is the key.

1227
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:47,124
My key.

1228
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:50,253
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1229
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:52,129
Do you understand?

1230
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:53,798
I need the codes.

1231
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,384
I have to get inside Zion...

1232
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,220
...and you have to tell me how.

1233
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:01,514
You're going to tell me...

1234
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:03,933
...or you're going to die.

1235
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,248
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1236
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:32,211
Holy shit!

1237
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:47,018
Backup. Send backup.

1238
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:11,959
Freeze!

1239
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:28,012
What were you doing?

1240
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:31,140
He doesn't know.

1241
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,892
Know what?

1242
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,464
I think they're trying to save him.

1243
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,064
There is no spoon.

1244
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:51,846
Find them and destroy them!

1245
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:55,307
We're under attack!

1246
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:28,591
Trinity!

1247
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,175
Help!

1248
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:53,407
Only human.

1249
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:55,451
Dodge this.

1250
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,174
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1251
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:14,511
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1252
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:17,014
It wasn't fast enough.

1253
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:21,060
Can you fly that thing?

1254
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:23,187
Not yet.

1255
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:27,524
Operator.

01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:42,206
Let's go.

01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:58,389
No.

1260
01:48:49,982 --> 01:48:52,609
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1261
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:31,690
He's not going to make it.

1262
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:42,534
Got you.

1263
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:49,768
Trinity!

1264
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:32,853
I knew it.

1265
01:51:33,478 --> 01:51:34,688
He's the One.

1266
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:52,873
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1267
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:56,919
Morpheus...

1268
01:51:58,587 --> 01:51:59,671
The Oracle.

1269
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:03,300
- She told me...
- She told you...

1270
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:05,260
...what you needed to hear.

1271
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:06,887
That's all.

1272
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,891
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1273
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:13,518
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1274
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:15,562
...and walking the path.

- The trace was completed.

- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1280
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:48,845
Order the strike.

1281
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:57,396
They're not out yet.

Neo, I want to tell you something...

1285
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:40,105

what it could mean if I do.

Neo!

-What happened?
