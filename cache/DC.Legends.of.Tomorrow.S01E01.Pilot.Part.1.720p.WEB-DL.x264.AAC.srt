Aah!

4
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,325
<i>Vandal Savage.</i>

5
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:29,294
<i>An evil dictator
blessed with immortality.</i>

6
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,529
<i>He has achieved what no one</i>

7
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,632
<i>in human history ever has.</i>

8
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,635
<i>He has conquered
the entire planet.</i>

9
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,908
Aah!

10
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,018
What's your name, son?

11
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,557
Jonas.

12
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,293
Your mother was brave,

13
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:05,163
just as your father was foolish.

14
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,399
Which are you?

15
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,073
So you take after
your mother, huh?

16
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,313
Or not.

17
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,818
Caesar.
Hitler.

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,153
Per Degaton.

19
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,922
Rank amateurs
compared to Savage.

20
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,024
{\an8}His forces have already
claimed the lives of billions.

21
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,827
{\an8}And if we possess
the means to stop him,

22
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,398
and again do nothing,

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,033
then their blood
is on our hands.

24
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,069
As a Time Master
of long standing,

25
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,238
you seem to forget
our responsibility

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,341
is to protect the timeline,
not humanity.

27
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,110
You wish to engage in the very
sort of manipulation of time

28
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,578
that we are sworn to prevent.

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,514
And yet, if we allow
humanity to perish

30
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,016
at the hands of evil,
then what universe

31
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,517
are we custodians of?

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,886
What if, in trying
to save the world from Savage,

33
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:03,789
you make it vulnerable to
another, more terrible despot?

34
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,391
We are not warriors,
Captain Hunter.

35
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,592
We possess no army.

36
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,095
And I'm not asking for one.

37
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:14,366
Just a single timeship

38
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,867
and your permission
to change history

39
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,770
before Vandal Savage
puts an end to it.

40
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,572
I'm not appealing to you

41
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,608
as Time Masters,

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,778
but as humans, please.

43
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,282
Grant me the authority
to change the timeline

44
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,485
just this once.

45
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,287
<i>How did the council meeting
go, Captain Hunter?</i>

46
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,055
Exactly as expected, Gideon.

47
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,391
<i>- So we are proceeding?</i>
- Indeed.

48
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,460
Prepare the Waverider
for takeoff.

49
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,295
Set a course.
United States.

50
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,331
Star City.
January, 2016.

51
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,667
<i>Ah, the early
second millennium A.D.</i>

52
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,801
<i>The golden age of
gasoline engines,</i>

53
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,236
<i>online pornography,</i>

54
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,671
<i>and those silly little
smartphones.</i>

55
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,839
<i>What are we going to retrieve,
Captain?</i>

56
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,906
Oh, not what.

57
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,341
Who.

58
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,477
I need you to pull up
some files, Gideon.

59
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,779
The eight men and women
who'll be joining us

60
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,115
on our little crusade.

61
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,451
<i>You usually prefer to
work alone, Captain.</i>

62
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,687
This time, I'll need a team.

63
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,166
<i>Dr. Raymond Palmer.</i>

64
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,802
<i>Also known as the Atom.</i>

65
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,972
This feels good,
being back in the field.

66
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,039
Not that this is
a field, but...

67
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,374
Ray, are you up for this?

68
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,376
<i>Uh, too late
to turn back now.</i>

69
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,678
Huh, someone removed
the central processing unit.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,813
<i>Are you sure?</i>

71
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,181
I designed the computer's CPU,

72
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,682
so, yeah, pretty sure.

73
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,618
Well, H.I.V.E. would only
remove it if they knew...

74
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,787
You had me shrink down and fly
into their secret computer lab?

75
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,090
My night's about to get
a whole lot worse, isn't it?

76
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,360
Oh, you can take them.

77
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,561
They have guns.

78
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,729
You have a super-suit.

79
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,997
<i>It's time to start growing.</i>

80
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,266
This is gonna get
a little rough.

81
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,802
Aah!

82
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,212
Oh, I am not
one of your adversaries.

83
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,685
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,990

86
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,939
Aah!

87
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,914
Miss Lance?

88
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,382
Join me for a drink?

89
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,086
I have come quite a long way
to meet you.

90
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,522
<i>Firestorm,

<i>Caution, Jefferson,
83% of the chemicals</i>

93

94
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,703
Yeah, tell that to Rambo.

95
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,305
<i>Thought I told you
to be careful.</i>

96
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,974
Aah!

97
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,812
What's the use of
sharing my intelligence

98
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,913
if you won't listen?

99
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,414
Stop bossing me around

100
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,649
like I'm one of your
snot-nosed undergrads.

101
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,783
Excuse me.

102
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,685
Who are you?

103
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,923
<i>Kendra Saunders
and Carter Hall.</i>

104

<i>The latest reincarnations

105
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,295
Kendra.

106
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,430
You, my love, almost
got us killed.

107
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,598
Thank you.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,833
Your flying is still clumsy,

109
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,834
like a bird just
out of the nest...

110
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,135
Well maybe that's because

111
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,903
up until two months ago,
I was a barista,

112
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,639
not some damn winged
demi-goddess.

113
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,475
Have you two considered
couples counseling?

114
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,144
I hear it's quite popular
in this century.

115
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,447
<i>There seems to be
an error, Captain.</i>

116
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,483
<i>These candidates,
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory,</i>

117
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,651

<i>There's no error, Gideon.</i>

119
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,686
Drop your weapons!

120
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,456
Ah, fry, you little piggies!

121
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,193
A minivan?
Really, Snart?

122
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,928
Cops'll never hassle a dad

123
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,165
buying diapers
in the middle of the night.

124
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,439
- What the...
- Watch it!

125
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,315
Aah.
What a headache!

126
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,884
Stein?

127
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,385
What the hell
are you doing here?

128
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,487
I'm as ignorant as you,
for once.

129
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,356
- Where are we?
- Ah.

130
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,225
Why don't you ask the dude who
knocked us out and kidnapped us?

131
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,827
British dude
with a flashy thing?

132
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,697
Ring any bells?
The name's Rip Hunter.

133
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,398
I'm from East London.

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,401
Oh, and the future.

135
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,803
Nice to meet you, Rip.

136
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,738
Uh, while you were
incapacitated,

137
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,873
I may have tampered
with your weapons.

138
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,543
I've assembled you all
because I need your help.

139
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,078
The future of the world
is in peril

140
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,380
because of a man by the name

141
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,149
of Vandal Savage.

142
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,718
That can't be.

143
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,386
We destroyed him.

144
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,321
Yeah, the Green Arrow and
Flash helped us do it.

145
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,856
And therein lay the problem.

146
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,058
Unless you or Mr. Hall
deliver the death blow,

147
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,527
Savage can be restored
from but a single cell.

148
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,362
What the hell
are you talking about?

149
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,265
Vandal is immortal.
Kendra and I reincarnate.

150
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,734
Yeah, I've done that.

151
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,735
And what the hell
does this Randall guy

152
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,736
got to do with us?

153
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,770
Vandal.

154
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,371
In the future, he will employ

155
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,173
the evil he's perfected
over his long life,

156
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,075
and the power he has amassed
throughout history,

157
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,213
to finally conquer the world.

158
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,949
I've been tasked with assembling
an elite team to stop him.

159
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,383
How?

160
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,785
To travel through time.

161
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,587
To capture Savage
before he grows into

162
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,355
the monster he becomes.

163
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,257
You got the wrong guy.

164
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,026
- "Hero" ain't on my resume.
- Or mine.

165
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,528
I know it's difficult
for you to fathom,

166
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,864
but where... when I'm from,

167
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,565
the year 2166,

168
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,901
you and everyone on this roof

169
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,604
aren't just considered heroes...

170
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,874
You're legends.

171
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,244
Legends?

172
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,979
I, um, I hate to nitpick,

173
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,815
but doesn't a legend
have to be dead?

174
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,784
Yeah, see, uh, that's
a deal breaker for me,

175
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:06,885
so I'm gonna pass.

176
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,286
It's dangerous for any of you

177
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,587
to know too much about
your own futures,

178
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,990
but I am here because
each of you,

179
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:16,628
as individuals,
is destined for greatness.

180
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,931
I could get behind that.

181
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,066
And, because if you don't
follow me,

182
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,135
this is what is in store
for your world

183
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,971
150 years from now.

184
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,024
I could have chosen
any time and any place.

185
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,492
Of all the people
who ever lived,

186
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,427
I chose you eight.

187
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,030
I certainly hope
that you won't let me,

188
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,166
and the world, down.

189
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,474
If your answer is yes,

190
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,477
meet me at this address
in 36 hours.

191
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,499
I had that.

192
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,901
I know.

193
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,169
It's fun to watch you
kick and punch

194
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,871
and skewer bad guys, but

195
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,539
I need a minute of your time.

196
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,874
I'm sure Captain Hunter
will return me

197
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,675
to the moment I left,
but I thought,

198
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,878
you know, just in case, someone
should I know I was gone.

199
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,079
We went up against Savage.

200
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,714
He does not go down easy.

201
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,182
That's why Hunter's
recruited a team.

202
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,384
A team that includes
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory.

203
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,487
So what do you know
about Captain Hunter?

204
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,589
He's a Time Master
from the 22nd century.

205
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,757
It's a little hard to Google.

206
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,026
So you know nothing,

207
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,762
and yet you trust him?

208
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,863
I'm as trusting
as you are cynical.

209
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,265
Well, I'm cynical,

210
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,532
and it's difficult for me
to trust anyone,

211
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,269
but that has kept me alive.

212
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,039
I died once.

213
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,508
At least,
the world thought I did.

214
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,610
You know what happened?

215
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,379
Nothing.

216
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,281
All the money,
all the buildings,

217
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,683
all the inventions,

218
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,752
the world didn't care.

219
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:24,022
My life, ultimately,
didn't matter.

220
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:28,526
Rip is giving me the chance
to help save the world.

221
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,929
I have to take it.

222
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,039
Keep your head on a swivel
while you're at it.

223
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,874
206 times.

224
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,310
Savage has killed both of us
206 times.

225
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,713
Yeah, and I'm not too eager
about making it 207.

226
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,081
So what?

227
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,116
You just going to run away?

228
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,819
We've tried that before.

229
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,555
Look, I know you don't remember
your past lives yet,

230
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,891
but I remember so much of it.

231
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,392
God, if you only knew
how I loved you,

232
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,027
and how much...

233
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:07,799
How much it hurt every time
he took you away from me.

234
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,400
Have you ever stopped to think

235
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,403
that maybe, just maybe,
we can't actually beat him?

236
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,305
But this time we wouldn't be
facing him alone,

237
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,074
and we almost defeated him
with help before.

238
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,342
Yeah, almost.

239
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,777
Kendra, this is
our best chance

240
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,513
to stop him forever.

241
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,250
The woman I've loved
for millennia

242
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,319
wouldn't be scared of it.

243
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,991
Look.

244
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,959
Past lives we'd fight, argue.

245
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,327
A lot.

246
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:41,099
But we'd settle matters
as warriors.

247
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,800
What?

248
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,702
Like I beat you,

249
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,804
and you give up this plan
to follow Hunter?

250
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,807
Yeah, except you won't be able
to beat me.

251
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,644
But you can absolutely try.

252
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,214
Winner gets to decide,
little lady.

253
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,290
I remember when you told
Mom and Dad

254
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,493
that you wanted to go to
sleepaway camp.

255
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,962
This'll be a little different.

256
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,698
Time travel.

257
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,999
I can't believe we're
talking about it

258
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,334
like it's something real.

259
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,902
I know.

260
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,942
I think you should go.

261
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,479
Laurel,

262
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,882
I died.

263
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:34,719
I'm still picking up
those pieces.

264
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,754
The Lazarus Pit brought me back,

265
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,190
but it left me with this

266
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,826
need to take.

267
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,562
To kill.

268
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,931
I'm dangerous.

269
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,266
After you died,

270
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,836
I needed a channel for my grief.

271
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,338
I found it in becoming
the Black Canary.

272
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,608
I found it in you.

273
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,312
For me, being the Canary
was never that positive.

274
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,882
Then don't be the Canary.

275
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,117
Do what Oliver's been doing.

276
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,953
Do what this Rip Hunter
is offering you

277
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,155
the chance to do and...

278
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,528
Be a hero in the light.

279
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,332
Be the White Canary.

280
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,271
Where did you get this?

281
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,141
I have a resourceful friend
named Cisco.

282
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,745
Where's the mask?

283
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,581
You don't need it anymore.

284
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,151
You've lived in the shadows
long enough.

285
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,422
I can't believe you're
thinking of

286
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,324
hooking up with the Englishman.

287
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,826
We're thieves. Crooks.
Criminals.

288
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,795
I have no desire
to save the world.

289
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,998
Especially 100 years
after I'm dead.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,635
He said across time, Mick.
What about the years before?

291
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,138
Before fingerprints and
surveillance cameras

292
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,340
and DNA analysis.

293
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,809
Why did we become criminals?

294
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,079
Because we hate working
and we love money.

295
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,748
We could steal the Mona Lisa
straight off Da Vinci's easel,

296
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,751
snatch the Hope Diamond
before it was discovered.

297
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,987
This is everything
we got into thieving for

298
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,356
in the first place.

299
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,758
More than everything.

300
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,263
You want me in, I'm in.

301
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,332
But I'm not gonna be
anyone's hero.

302
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,938
Jefferson, it's imperative
we remain together

303
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,106
for our powers to work.

304
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,807
In case you haven't noticed,

305
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,609
I'm still getting used to
the whole powers thing,

306
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,378
and now that's you're adding
time travel to the mix...

307
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,480
Do you have any idea
what an extraordinary

308
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,115
opportunity we've been given?

309
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,784
A chance to get murdered
by an immortal psychopath.

310
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,453
No thanks.

311
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,889
Look, I'm a 20-year-old
auto mechanic.

312
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,393
The world is better off without
me trying to save it.

313
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,963
I don't understand
your decision.

314
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,634
But I respect it.

315
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,003
Perhaps I can persuade
Mr. Hunter

316
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,673
that he needs my knowledge
as a physicist

317
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:12,310
and not my abilities
as Firestorm,

318
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:16,380
so I propose we have a toast

319
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,750
to my grand and solo adventure.

320
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,019
To saving the world.

321
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,255
Knock yourself out.

322
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,161
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

323
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,887
Professor!

324
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,049
This is the place.

325
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,891
I think we're being punked.

326
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,361
- Do people still say "punked"?
- No.

327
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,364
I see your buddy threw himself
a going-away party.

328
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,865
Yes, I believe
he drank something

329
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:11,369
that didn't quite
agree with him.

330
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,137
You don't look too happy
to be here.

331
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,538
Perceptive.

332
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,075
Well, I see you've all
decided to come.

333
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,878
Well then, we can be on our way.

334
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,213
I ain't footing it anywhere.

335
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,981
A Time Master's sacred charge

336
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,150
is to do no harm
to the timeline.

337
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,918
Can you imagine what a timeship
would look like

338
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,954
in, say, Victorian England?

339
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,891
Holographic indigenous
camouflage projection.

340
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,494
Indeed.

341
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,007
It's called the Waverider.

342
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,077
It's been my ship
for over a decade.

343
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,580
Shall we?

344
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,421
Excuse me, would you mind,
um...

345
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,123
Thank you.

346
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,339
Whoa.

347
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,773
I bet it uses ionic propulsion.

348
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,041
I doubt that very much,

349
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,976
given that
even advanced technology

350
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,679
wouldn't be able to sustain
an ionic reaction.

351
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,715
It's possible if you stabilize
the quantum flux.

352
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,883
You know, we actually covered
this before, Professor Stein,

353
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,286
when I was your student,
many moons ago?

354
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,689
Perhaps you remember my paper on
subspace field mechanics?

355
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,692
I don't remember you,
Mr. Palmer.

356
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,094
Oh.

357
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,364
Whatever you roofied him with,
I'd like some.

358
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,732
I did not roofie him.

359
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,234
Oh, I ain't judging.

360
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,870
I have never seen anything
like this before.

361
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,372
Neither have I,
and considering

362
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,406
I have 4,000 years
worth of memories,

363
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,041
that's saying something.

364
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,910
How does a vessel of this size
function without a crew?

365
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,911
I don't need one.

366
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,912
I have Gideon.

367
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,481
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

368
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,982
<i>I am Gideon,</i>

369
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,817
<i>an interactive
artificial consciousness</i>

370
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,487
<i>programmed to operate
this vessel's critical systems</i>

371
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,055
<i>and aid Captain Hunter
in his mission.</i>

372
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,923
Captain?

373
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,526
Gideon's been working on
helping me locate Vandal Savage.

374
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,695
I thought you said he's pretty
active in the 22nd century.

375
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,196
Perhaps engaging Savage
at the height of his powers

376
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,664
isn't the best strategy.

377
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,199
Indeed.

378
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,101
Unfortunately, Savage has
kept his movements

379
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,269
hidden throughout history.

380
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,570
Not even Gideon can determine

381
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,905
where or when we can find him.

382
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,008
But I have the next best thing:

383
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,843
the man who can.

384
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,212
Professor Aldus Boardman.

385
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,581
Professor Boardman is the
world's leading... well, only...

386
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,917
expert on Vandal Savage.

387
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,552
We're gonna
pay him a little visit.

388
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,422
<i>Course plotted for
St. Roch, New Orleans.</i>

389
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:48,292
- St. Roch?
<i>- October 17, 1975.</i>

390
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,194
I suggest you all
strap yourselves in.

391
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,730
Temporal navigation isn't
something one wants to be

392
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,732
standing up for.

393
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,274
Time travel.
Cool.

394
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,075
Some of you may experience
some slight discomfort.

395
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,478
In very rare instances,
there will be some, uh,

396
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,879
bleeding from the eyeballs.

397
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,981
I'm sorry, what?

398
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,754
The human body is used to time
unfolding linearly.

399
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,396
Oh.

400
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,797
Jackson, I'm so glad
you're awake.

401
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,132
I didn't want you to miss this.

402
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,800
Miss what?

403
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,604
What the...

404
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,306
Oh, no, I wouldn't unfasten
those if I were you.

405
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,309
Get me off this... whatever
this thing is!

406
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,010
Good luck explaining this.

407
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,512
I did him a favor.

408
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,481
He doesn't look
all that grateful.

409
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,350
Just hang on and remain calm.

410
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,189
All your worlds are
about to change.

411
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,766
- Whoa.
- Seriously.

412
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,169
- That was insanity!
- God!

413
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,311
Whoa, that is some serious
Darth Vader going on there.

414
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,980
Chronos to Command.

415
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,349
I am closing in
on Captain Hunter's position.

416
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,518
Hey, what you doing there,
bro?

417
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,053
I am determining whether you
are integral to the timeline.

418
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,321
Okay.

419
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,824
You are not.

420
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,479
Oh, I should have
mentioned it before.

421
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,648
Nausea is one of the
side effects of time travel,

422
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,682
along with...

423
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,183
- Aah!
- Vertigo.

424
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,185
- I can't see.
- And temporary blindness.

425
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,520
Oh, it should only last
a minute.

426
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,255
After all, that was
a mere jaunt.

427
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,657
The further back in time you go,
the worse the side effects.

428
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,992
- Better?
- It's all relative.

429
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,494
Good.

430
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,830
I can't believe
you kidnapped me.

431
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,066
- Hey, I want to go home.
- Good news, then.

432
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,602
2016 will be around in,
uh, 41 years.

433
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,404
Now, you three, feel free
to make yourselves comfortable

434
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,239
back here on the ship,
while the rest of you

435
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,771
are coming with me to find
Professor Boardman.

436
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,576
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

437
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,011
- You're benching us?
- I thought we were a team.

438
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,179
This mission doesn't require
your particular skill set.

439
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,948
Yet.

440
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,383
Meaning you don't need anyone
killed, maimed, or robbed.

441
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,851
Precisely.

442
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,919
Sure it's a good idea
to leave these two

443
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,454
unsupervised on a time machine?

444
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,922
Hey, haircut!

445
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,857
Deafness wasn't
one of the side effects.

446
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,892
We better hurry up.
Professor Boardman will die

447
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,427
in less than 24 hours.

448
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,728
What's the point in
cutting it so close?

449
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,430
Because if he's
destined to die,

450
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,365
then he doesn't have a timeline
for us to disrupt,

451
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,867
and his impact on the future
will be minimal.

452
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,069
How brilliant.

453
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,236
And depressing.

454
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,605
How does he die?

455
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,607
Uh, he's found dead
in his university

456
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,875
from unknown causes.
Come on.

457
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,745
- Are you coming?
- I'll stay put.

458
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,580
You'd rather stay with them?

459
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,881
They didn't drug me.

460
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,483
Point taken.

461
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,121
This is unbelievable.
1975.

462
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:07,091
Imagine all the wondrous
applications of this technology.

463
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,793
A chance to witness the
construction of the pyramids,

464
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,662
the end of the dinosaurs.

465
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,464
I've never been to 1975.

466
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,099
It's rather colorful.

467
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,301
So, where can we find
Professor Boardman?

468
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,670
In his lecture hall.

469
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,006
<i>♪ No matter who you are ♪</i>

470
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,308
<i>♪ Shining bright to see ♪</i>

471
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,677
<i>♪ What you can truly be ♪</i>

472
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,145
<i>♪ You're a shining star ♪</i>

473
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,282
Oh, man.
We're too late.

474
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,085
This is... I'm, I'm sorry.

475
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,190
You.

476
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,525
Both of you.

477
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,327
You know who we are?

478
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,964
I've been studying you
my whole life.

479
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,298
Ever since, as a child,

480
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,434
I first heard the story
of Chay-Ara,

481
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,836
High Priestess of Horus,
the Hawk God,

482
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,705
and her lover, Prince Khufu.

483
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,876
I hoped and prayed
this day might come.

484
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,478
Well, then, looks like
we've come to the right place.

485
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,180
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

486
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,848
A fellow historian,

487
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,551
here to discuss
another passion of yours:

488
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,954
Vandal Savage.

489
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,456
There's no way
of telling your story

490
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,793
without telling his also.

491
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,631
<i>Okay...</i>

492
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:23,967
Why does this stupid station
play nothing but reruns?

493
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,003
Don't even bother
trying to explain.

494
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,906
Am I the only one on this ship
who could really use a drink?

495
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,875
I say we go get weird
in the '70s.

496
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,410
Excellent idea.

497
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,546
I got the perfect outfit.

498
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,481
<i>Perhaps Captain Hunter
was unclear</i>

499
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,249
<i>with his instructions
to remain onboard.</i>

500
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,984
Shut it, metal mouth.

501
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,587
Oh, you're not quite ready
to run with this crew.

502
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,222
Sorry, kid.

503
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,757
Wait, you're just gonna
leave me here?

504
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,059
I said I'd take care of you.

505
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,262
4,000 years ago,

506
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,932
Vandal Savage was
an Egyptian priest,

507
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,868
secretly in love
with a priestess.

508
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,503
You.

509
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,071
Or, rather,

510
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,073
you in your first life.

511
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,878
<i>But you were
in love with another.</i>

512
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,347
<i>Prince Khufu.</i>

513
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,584
<i>Savage, or Hath-Set
as he was then known,</i>

514
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,452
<i>learned of the affair
and was consumed</i>

515
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,588
<i>with jealous rage.</i>

516
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,356
You believe me yet?

517
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,493
Which drove him
to murder you both.

518
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,365
<i>And prayed for the hawk god,
Horus,</i>

519
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,603
<i>to damn the objects of his hate
for all eternity.</i>

520
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,939
But Chay-Ara had
a prayer of her own,

521
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,242
that Horus would
protect them forever.

522
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:41,044
But another life was
bound to theirs by accident.

523
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,446
Savage's.

524
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,481
That's why
he wants us both dead.

525
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,983
My theory is that
the three of you

526
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,318
were exposed to the same
radiation by the meteorites.

527
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,987
We all share the same power.

528
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,055
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

529
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,991
That's what maintains
his immortality.

530
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,592
That's impossible.

531
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,895
Unless the meteorites
contained a mutative element,

532
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,063
like the particle accelerator
that caused your powers.

533
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,598
But without evidence,
you're asking us

534
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,666
to take you at your word?

535
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,901
It's not my word.

536
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,269
It's theirs.

537
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:09,673
But you still don't remember me,
do you?

538
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,709
We knew you in our past lives.

539
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,647
You've told me
your entire story,

540
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,782
stretching back
through the ages,

541
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,017
but when I first knew you,

542
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,353
it was after World War I,

543
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,190
and your names were
Joe and Edith.

544
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,325
Edith Boardman.

545
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,929
Wait, I... we were related?

546
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,967
I don't remember you.
I'm so sorry.

547
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,368
Don't be.

548
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,537
You always warned me
that if I ran into you

549
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,005
in your next life,

550
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,675
you might have forgotten me.

551
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,010
That's us

552
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,380
at the World's Fair.

553
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:58,255
You're just as beautiful
as I remember you.

554
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,260
Mother.

555
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,202
How old were you when...

556
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,038
You two were murdered?

557
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,974
Ten.

558
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,542
My whole life, you taught me
to be careful,

559
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,910
to keep moving,

560
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,845
always one step ahead of Savage,

561
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:24,248
but after tracking you
for 4,000 years,

562
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,983
he'd gotten good.

563
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,851
He found us
in the middle of the night

564
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:31,188
at a fleabag motel
in North Carolina.

565
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,056
You hid me in the closet,

566
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,359
made me promise that
no matter what I heard,

567
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,929
I'd stay put.

568
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,565
And I did.

569
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,067
Sorry to interrupt
your family time,

570
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,702
but we were hoping you could
tell us a bit more

571
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,906
where to locate
Savage's present whereabouts.

572
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,710
He hides in the shadows,

573
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,080
never drawing
too much attention,

574
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,515
but every lifetime,

575
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,051
placing himself near
the seat of power,

576
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,421
sowing seeds of destruction.

577
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,023
Who remembers
the name of the man

578
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:09,059
who whispered in the ear
of Gavrilo Princip,

579
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,896
and convinced him to start
World War I?

580
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,598
Why?
What does he get out of that?

581
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,700
The more the world is focused
on destroying itself,

582
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,370
the less it notices an immortal
psychopath in its midst.

583
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:25,208
With the ultimate goal of
subjugating the entire planet.

584
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,979
He killed your parents,
Professor Boardman.

585
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:33,083
Something tells me you know
where to locate Vandal Savage.

586
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,551
I have

587
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:38,121
an educated guess.

588
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:44,394
Ah. Dollar beers.

589
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,496
You got to love the '70s.

590
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,766
Who wants to listen to some
Captain and Tennille?

591
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,501
My mother played it.

592
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,570
A lot.

593
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,277
Wow, you guys are
really far out.

594
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,348
- You want to dance, Leonard?
- You go right ahead.

595
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,949
I'll watch.

00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,965
How about you join me
in the parking lot?

602
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,300
Hmm, tempting,

603
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,635
but you're not my type.

604
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:29,206
But your lady,
on the other hand,

605
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,476
well, she looks just my speed.

606
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,211
Maybe you didn't understand
my request,

607
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,813
bitch.

608
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,616
Aah!
Son of a...

609
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,018

That is your name, right?

<i>How may I help you?</i>

624
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,197
I assume this ship has
a, uh,

625
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,598
autopilot or something?

626
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,500
<i>- You assume correctly.</i>
- Great.

627
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,104
In that case, I'ma need you
to take me back to 2016.

628
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,506
See, me being here,
it's all a big mistake.

629
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,775
<i>Captain Hunter told me
you'd try to do this,</i>

630
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,011
<i>and he also told me not to
listen to anything you say.</i>

631
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,412
Well, you are a computer.

632
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,847
You have to listen to me!

633
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,282
<i>You seem overwrought,
Mr. Jackson.</i>

634

<i>If you'd like to go
to the MedBay,</i>

635
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,251
<i>I'd be happy
to prescribe you a sedative.</i>

636
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,188
I do not need another roofie!

637
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,189
Whoa!

638
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,190
What was that?

639
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,891
<i>A thermite grenade.</i>

640
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,327
<i>It seems someone is trying
to breach the hull.</i>

641
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,730
<i>His name is Chronos.</i>

642
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,966
<i>He's a temporal bounty hunter.</i>

643
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:05,769
<i>The ship is taking heavy fire.</i>

644
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,437
I know!

645
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,140
Aren't we supposed to be
invisible or something?

646
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,209
You need to get us
out of here now!

647
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,211
A lifetime of research
on Vandal Savage

648
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,779
that all points
in this direction.

649
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,447
This should help you find him,

650
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,417
and the vengeance that has
eluded me all these years.

651
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,385
Jefferson... something's
happening to Jefferson!

652
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,454
We seem to have a little
problem back a the, uh,

653
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,956
vessel.

654
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,624
There's an intruder.
We really must be going now.

655
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,292
Thank you for everything.

656
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,494
Wait.

657
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,761
We can't just leave him here.

658
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,430
We have to get back now.

659
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,398
You said he's going to die
in 24 hours.

660
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,800
And we can stop it.

661
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,502
Are either of you
a Time Master?

662
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,970
I didn't think so.

663
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,606
I've spent years studying
the implications

664
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:43,673
of chronological alteration.

665
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,976
Good for you,

666
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,110
but we're not going anywhere

667
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:49,679
unless our son's coming with us.

668
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,252
Why is Chronos attacking us?

669
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,586
<i>Perhaps Captain Hunter
is best suited</i>

670
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,921
<i>to answer that query.</i>

671
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,523
Fire photon torpedoes
or something!

672
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,358
<i>Only Captain Hunter
is authorized.</i>

673
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,626
Where is Captain Hunter?

674
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,127
Dr. Palmer, please tell me...

675
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,096
I didn't leave my exo-suit
on the ship?

676
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,465
Okay, but I'd be lying.

677
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,707
Unh!

678
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,483
Who the hell is this guy?

679
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,685
Aah!

680
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,029
Is that a laser gun?

681
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,405
Gotta get back to the ship
and bond with Jefferson.

682
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,406
Cover me!

683
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,474
Cover me too.

684
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:00,417
Oh, you crazy old man.

685
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,219
Aah!

686
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,556
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

687
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,525
Seriously?
It's Dr. Palmer.

688
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,860
Get down!

689
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,529
Aah!

690
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,231
We need to merge!

691
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,873
We go out for one lousy drink,

692
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,275
and you guys somehow manage

693
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,244
to pick a fight with Boba Fett.

694
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,412
Aah.

695
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,891
Aah!

696
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,293
Aah!

697
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,029
Ah...

698
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,131
- Aldus!
- We'll get you out of here!

699
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,269
You're doing good.

700
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,374
<i>Professor Boardman
has sustained</i>

701
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,908
<i>severe internal injuries.</i>

702
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,410
Prepare the MedBay to receive
Professor Boardman

703
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,411
and get us out of here!

704
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,479
<i>Course heading?</i>

705
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,481
Anywhere but here!

706
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,593
<i>Our cloaking shield
and aft entrance</i>

707
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,562
<i>have been significantly
compromised, Captain.</i>

708
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,264
Yes, I can see that, Gideon.

709
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,596
Station us in the temporal zone
while I work on repairs.

710
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,501
Temporal zone?

711
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,633
Yeah, it's essentially
a time limbo.

712
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,088
We can hide out there for a bit.

713
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,106
Another temporal jump would risk
revealing our position.

714
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,108
A time limbo?
Astonishing.

715
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,135
Oh, there's something you people
don't know about time travel?

716
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,345
That's surprising, isn't it?

717
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,681
Considering none of you have
ever time traveled before.

718
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,083
Bringing a family member
from the past

719
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,744
onto a timeship?

720
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,986
Breaking out and carousing
around the 1970s?

721
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,954
We've barely begun,
and already this is the worst,

722
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,191
unmitigated disaster
of my career.

723
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,995
I see why you got the hots
for that one.

724
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,264
My son is hurt because of you.

725
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,965
Who attacked us?

726
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,768
Something of a long story.

727
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,037
Better tell it fast, Rip,
'cause it doesn't look like

728
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,473
the lady's in a patient mood.

729
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:06,343
Neither am I.

730
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:07,610
His name is Chronos.

731
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:11,214
He works for
the Council of Time Masters.

732
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,719
My former employers.

733
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,987
I thought you were
a Time Master.

734
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,690
As I've expressed,
time's not a linear thing.

735
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,793
At some point I was, in fact,
a Time Master.

736
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,895
Will you people please
stop hitting me?

737
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,232
Start telling the truth!

738
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,867
I relinquished my position
as a Time Master

739
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,403
when I commandeered
the Waverider.

740
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,839
Chronos was clearly sent
to bring me in.

741
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,807
- You lied to us.
- Of course I lied to you.

742
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,477
I needed your help... you all
barely said yes as it was.

743
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,912
What about the legends part?

744
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,116
Ooh, you lied about that too,
didn't you?

745
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,487
I chose you all because,
a hundred years from now,

746
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:55,058
your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

747
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,696
I needed your help without
disturbing the history of 2166.

748
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:04,501
So, we're like
the opposite of legends.

749
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:07,771
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't kill you.

750
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,773
Ditto the arsonist.

751
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,074
Because Gideon wouldn't
listen to your commands

752
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,776
and you'd be stuck here forever.

753
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,711
Great, so we're not
an elite team of heroes

754
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,346
on a sanctioned mission,
sent to rid the future

755
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,847
of its most horrific bad guy.

756
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,716
Just a collection of nobodies

757
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,885
who time really doesn't
give a damn about.

758
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,954
I didn't lie
about the mission itself.

759
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,857
Or the brutality and
ruthlessness of Savage.

760
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,426
Or my need for your help.

761
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,060
I don't imagine
you're the kind of guy

762
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,396
who quits his job and
takes on this kind of threat

763
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,198
for altruistic reasons,

764
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,767
so Rip, why don't you tell us:

765
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:41,871
what did Vandal Savage
do to you?

766
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,975
The Time Masters
discourage marriage.

767
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,411
They urge against procreation
even more.

768
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,580
A Time Master should be free of
any personal entanglements

769
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:54,384
that might compromise him.

770
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,052
But...

771
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,988
I fell in love,

772
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,226
and we had a child.

773
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,462
A boy.

774
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,298
Jonas.

775
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,829
Savage killed your family.

776
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,966
He slaughtered my family.

777
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,834
And thousands of other families.

778
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,970
And that body that I swore
an oath to serve

779
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:50,006
turned a blind eye.

780
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:53,209
They continue
to turn a blind eye.

781
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,044
I won't.

782
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,013
The last thing that my child
saw in this world

783
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,282
was that monster's face.

784
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,351
You can be damn well sure
that when Savage dies,

785
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:04,387
the last face he sees
will be mine.

786
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,555
I understand,
given the circumstances,

787
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,156
if you wish to return home.

788
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,958
We can make the jump
once the repairs are done,

789
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,862
if and when
Professor Boardman stabilizes.

790
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,836
I think we all need
a little time

791
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,273
to consider our options.

792
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:37,420
Just get some rest.

793
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:42,992
There's something
I've wanted you to have.

794
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,429
It's around my neck.

795
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,074
It was my mother's.

796
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:01,010
Yours.

797
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,980
It's beautiful.

798
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,750
I remember it.

799
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:30,440
Thank you.

800
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,375
Rip wouldn't have allowed me
to bring Aldus onboard

801
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,443
if you hadn't said so...

802
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,311
Of course.

803
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,483
Chay-Ara...

804
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,285
sorry.

805
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,153
Kendra.

806
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,123
No, it's okay.

807
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,560
Chay-Ara is fine.

808
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,571
Seems an apology is in order.

809
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,106
What I did was wrong.

810
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,475
I should never have forced you
to come along.

811
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,777
But, for me, the opportunity

812
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,813
to travel through time,

813
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,116
see the mysteries
of the universe revealed,

814
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:16,352
notions I've spent
my whole life studying...

815
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,022
Please do not geek out on
quantum physics right now.

816
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:23,092
Mr. Hunter was offering
grand adventure.

817
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,460
And at my age, you never know

818
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,863
how many adventures
you have left.

819
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,431
Hey,

820
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,633
I saw your 40-yard dash
onto the ship

821
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,835
with that Chronos guy
shooting at you.

822
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,606
I think you got plenty of
adventures left.

823
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,008
Yes, perhaps you're right.

824
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,378
Back home.
As Firestorm.

825
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,013
What if
I don't want to go home?

826
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,115
Yet, I mean.

827
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,152
Why the change of heart?

828
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,454
You ever play football?

829
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:54,357
Yeah, I didn't think so.

830
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,460
Anyway... the best feeling

831
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,128
I ever got
from being on the field

832
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,863
wasn't when I made a great play,

833
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,799
or we won some game.

834
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,334
It was when one of my teammates
took a tackle for me,

835
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,504
and I knew they were gonna
make sure I was safe,

836
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,407
that nobody got to me.

837
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,409
Watching all of you
rush back to the ship,

838
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,411
even those two knuckleheads,

839
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,880
to take on Chronos?

840
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,817
Made me feel the same way.

841
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,720
I like being
part of a team, man.

842
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,424
Me too.

843
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,763
Watch it!

844
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,732
Sorry.

845
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,567
Sorry.

846
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,439
What's the point of us even
giving this a second thought?

847
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,007
Rip has already seen the future.

848
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,578
He knows exactly what's in store
for each of us.

849
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,080
Might as well have stayed dead,

850
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,082
'cause the world doesn't need
any of us.

851
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,917
You're just a lost assassin.

852
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,553
You're just a pair of
good-for-nothing criminals.

853
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,355
I can live with that.

854
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,691
Well, I can't.

855
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:05,194
Can't live with somebody
putting a cap on my destiny.

856
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:09,198
Spent my whole life
working to be something greater

857
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,968
by becoming something smaller.

858
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,402
Then some guy
comes along and tells me

859
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,372
that being the Atom
is as insignificant

860
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,441
as an actual Atom.

861
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,944
That's not what he said.

862
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,047
Rip said that in<i> his</i> future

863
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,949
we're nobodies,

864
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,720
but this mission is about
changing the future.

865
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:33,923
I mean, if we have the power
to change the world,

866
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,393
don't you think we have the
power to change our own fate?

867
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:41,764
For better or for worse.

868
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,833
That's a very good point.

869
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:49,739
What do you think, Gideon?

870
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,074
<i>I calculate
a less than 6% likelihood</i>

871
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,276
<i>that they decide
to go on with the mission.</i>

872
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,008
I meant about the repairs.

873
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,913
<i>And there has been another
unfortunate consequence</i>

874
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:58,347
<i>of Chronos's attack.</i>

875
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,917
- <i>Care to hear about it?</i>
- Not really.

876
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:03,085
He's gone.

877
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:10,092
Our son... or, our son
from our previous life.

878
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:13,095
It's all too confusing.

879
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,597
I'm very sorry.

880
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,433
Actually, you don't
get the blame for this.

881
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,101
This was my fault.

882
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,870
If I hadn't insisted
on bringing him back here,

883
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,432
he might have died peacefully,
in his sleep maybe.

884
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,541
Don't torture yourself
with incriminations.

885
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,976
One of the great lessons
of time travel

886
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,644
is that many things
cannot be changed.

887
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,279
Time wants to happen.

888
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,816
Chronos, even Vandal, won't be
the only enemy we face.

889
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:37,286
Very often, it will be
time itself.

890
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,721
Whether it wants to happen
or not,

891
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,822
we're gonna change time,

892
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,224
erase Savage's future,

893
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,059
and earn our rightful place
in history.

894
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,627
Dr. Palmer is correct.

895
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,495
We may not be legends
in your time, Captain,

896
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:50,466
but we are going to decide
our own fates.

897
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:52,735
I don't give a damn about
being a legend,

898
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,571
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

899
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,707
I can get down with that.

900
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,709
And our malcontents?

901
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,310
I like killing people.

902
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,879
We're in.

903
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,647
For now.

904
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,917
So how do we find this guy?

905
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,553
Professor Boardman had
a theory about that.

906
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,755
I've already had Gideon
plot a course.

907
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,036
You know what this is?

908
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:30,940
An instrument to make this world
a better place.

909
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,743
History teaches us
that the cause of humanity

910
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:37,113
is only advanced through strife.

911
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:40,950
There's no Renaissance without
the Dark Ages.

912
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,853
Man had no interest
in splitting the atom

913
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:46,756
until World War II.

914
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,360
I'm just trying

915
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:55,298
to make this world
a better place,

916
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,800
one war at a time.

917
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,024
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
