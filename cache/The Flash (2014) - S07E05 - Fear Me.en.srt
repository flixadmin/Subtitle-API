to attack right now,

834
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,583
we're totally on our own.

835
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:07,254
Because I wasn't fast enough.

836
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,215
- Nora.
- [groans]

837
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,176
This physical form is new for me.

838
00:41:13,178 --> 00:41:16,012
I didn't know its limitations.

839
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:19,224
I can feel how weak he still is.

840
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,770
How weak we both still are.

841
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,105
What happened to Barry?

842
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,316
He was attacked by a
powerful meta-psychic.

843
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,405
Who showed him his greatest fear?

844
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:36,366
That same psychic was the
second of my attackers.

845
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:40,287
Fuerza and Psych? They both hurt you?

846
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,247
Who are they?

847
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,708
I think...

848
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,668
they're just like me.
