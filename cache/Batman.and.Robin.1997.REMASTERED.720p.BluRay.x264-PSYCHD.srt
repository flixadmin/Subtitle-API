1
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,432
I want a car.

2
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,436
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,397
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:38,368
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,607
Don't wait up, Al.

6
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,818
I'll cancel the pizzas.

7
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:31,629
<i>Batman, a new villain has
commandeered the Gotham Museum.</i>

8
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:33,715
<i>He's frozen the antiquities wing.</i>

9
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,342
<i>He's turned
the security guards into ice.</i>

10
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:38,845
<i>He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze."</i>

11
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,847
Mr. Freeze.

12
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,748
- Stop!
- Drop your weapon!

13
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,249
Stop or we'll shoot!

14
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,681
The Iceman cometh.

15
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:27,518
Please, show some mercy.

16
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,020
Mercy?!

17
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:36,027
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

18
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,880
In this universe...

19
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,549
...there's only one absolute.

20
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,178
Everything...

21
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,055
...freezes.

22
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,688
Hi, Freeze. I'm Batman.

23
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,001
You're not sending me to the cooler.

24
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:53,563
- Nice catch.
- You break it, you buy it.

25
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,107
Grab the gem! Kill the heroes!

26
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:12,331
Yes, kill them! Kill them! Yes!

27
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,626
Destroy everything!

28
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,972
It's the hockey team from hell.

29
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,384
You get the ice, I'll get the Iceman.

30
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:25,947
Ah.

31
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,995
Thanks.

32
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,221
Sweet.

33
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,562
I got mine. Where's yours?

34
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,857
What killed the dinosaurs?

35
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,442
The Ice Age!

36
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:56,787
Hit me, boys.

37
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,542
Thanks for playing.

38
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,321
I was hoping you'd drop in.

39
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,481
Oh, yes.

40
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,547
Watch the numbers...

41
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:32,216
...for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

42
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:33,551
Can you feel it coming?

43
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:36,804
The icy cold of space.

44
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:42,018
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...

45
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,395
...and beat no more.

46
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:57,742
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

47
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,327
Freeze, you're mad.

48
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,330
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

49
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,622
Freeze well.

50
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,690
- Who invited you?
- I was hanging around.

51
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,693
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

52
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,529
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life."

53
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,961
- A batbomb?
- We must blow this up...

54
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,422
...before it turns Gotham into a crater.

55
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,550
Now what, call a taxi?!

56
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,052
Watch the first step!

57
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,388
Surf's up!

58
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,674
Gotcha!

59
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,223
Cowabunga!

60
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,202
He's freezing the furnace!

61
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,078
- I got him.
- Robin, no!

62
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,837
Stay cool, Birdboy.

63
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:10,100
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

64
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,604
Will you chase the villain
or save the boy?

65
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:18,776
Your emotions make you weak.
That's why this day is mine.

66
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,279
I'll kill you next time!

67
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,492
Did we get him?

68
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,340
Drats!

69
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:28,470
My experiment to mate the orchid
and the rattlesnake has failed again...

70
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,684
...but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

71
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,646
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

72
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:41,400
...these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

73
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,986
I will have given flora...

74
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,699
...a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

75
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,370
Personal note:

76
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,873
My work would proceed faster...

77
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,335
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

78
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,713
...back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

79
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,549
Why won't he let me in the lab?

80
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,845
What is he doing in there?

81
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:31,450
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations...

82
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,246
...and our mystery bidder...

83
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,499
...may I present...

84
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,043
...Antonio Diego...

85
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,589
...serial murderer,
serving life in prison...

86
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,758
...and sole surviving...

87
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,009
...volunteer.

88
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,097
And what a charmer he is.

89
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,894
By merely drilling three
concentric holes...

90
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:02,940
...directly into Antonio's
cranial cavity...

91
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:07,111
...I have created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...

92
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,947
...the limbic system.

93
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,284
And now I add...

94
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,079
...my Super-Soldier Serum...

95
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,790
...code-named "Venom"...

96
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,210
...to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids...

97
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,129
...and toxins.

98
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,549
Plug him in.

99
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,092
Time to scream.

100
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,335
Genius!

101
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,754
Behold...

102
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,631
...the ideal killing machine!

103
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,967
I call this little number...

104
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,635
..."Bane."

105
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,054
Bane of Humanity!

106
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,599
Imagine it.

107
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,561
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

108
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,940
Bidding begins at a mere
10 million!

109
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,525
Turbo!

110
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,194
Show off for Daddy.

111
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,487
Dr. Isley.

112
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,116
Welcome to my parlor.

113
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,702
What?

114
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,204
You monster!

115
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,831
How could you?!

116
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,251
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

117
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,003
- He cut the funding for our work.
- Our work?

118
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,755
Without your research...

119
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,591
...I couldn't have come this far.
Join me.

120
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:39,012
- The two of us, entwined, side by side.
- Join you?

121
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:44,268
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

122
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:48,355
...and now you corrupt my research...

123
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:52,234
...into some maniacal scheme
for world domination?

124
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,029
When I get through...

125
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,784
...you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

126
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,452
Do you hear me?!

127
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,163
You psycho!

128
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,460
Well, I can respect your opinion.

129
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,297
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

130
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,549
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

131
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,158
Yes. Yes.

132
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:45,329
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

133
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,998
...deep into the earth
you love so much!

134
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,917
Bye-bye, dear!

135
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,835
Fellow maniacs...

136
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,505
...bidding begins!

137
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:06,350
Gotham University Labs
security video, two years ago.

138
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,186
Dr. Victor Fries...

139
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:13,690
...two-time Olympic decathlete and
Nobel Prize winner for molecular biology.

140
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:17,319
After his wife contracted a rare disease,
Macgregor's Syndrome...

141
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:21,281
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

142
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:24,117
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

143
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,334
That's got to hurt.

144
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,170
That liquid is 50 below.

145
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,130
But he survived somehow.

146
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,467
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

147
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,808
- What happened to his wife?
- Nobody knows for sure.

148
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,476
She's presumed dead.

149
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,561
Fries needs
extreme cold to survive.

150
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:56,733
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at 0 degrees.

151
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,071
If it's ice the Iceman wants...

152
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,075
Alfred.

153
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,828
Alfred.

154
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,916
Coming, sir.

155
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,919
Yes, sir?

156
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,754
We need the Wayne diamonds.

157
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,715
We going to trap a snowman?

158
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,511
Absolutely, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

159
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:28,181
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

160
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,392
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

161
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,894
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

162
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,106
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

163
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,111
How indeed?

164
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:44,114
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

165
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,324
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

166
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,454
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

167
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,957
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

168
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,044
Despite all your talents...

169
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,380
...you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

170
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:04,134
Master Dick follows
the same star as you...

171
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,262
...but gets there by his own course.

172
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:11,600
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

173
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,436
I trust you, Alfred.

174
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,106
But I shan't be here forever.

175
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,153
Good night, Master Bruce.

176
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,990
Good night, Alfred.

177
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,429
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

178
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,015
Good gracious, what a tumble.

179
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,392
There's a brave boy.

180
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:08,532
Yes, sir. I am so pleased you won
the bidding, Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

181
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,868
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now.

182
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:16,915
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

183
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,855
Dr. Isley?

184
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,567
- Pamela?
- Mm-hm.

185
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,193
You look great.

186
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,946
Especially for a dead woman.

187
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,074
Hello, Jason.

188
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,911
I think I've had a change of heart.

189
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,831
- Or quite literally...
- Me?

190
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:03,003
...the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

191
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,839
They replaced my blood with aloe...

192
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:09,092
...my skin with chlorophyll...

193
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,886
...and filled...

194
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,096
...my lips...

195
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,483
...with venom.

196
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,778
Oh...

197
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,989
...and, Jason, one other thing.

198
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:35,493
I probably should have
mentioned this earlier...

199
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,913
...I'm...

200
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:39,789
...poison.

201
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,295
Whoo.

202
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,298
It's a jungle in here.

203
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,509
I am Nature's arm...

204
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,054
...her spirit...

205
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,556
...her will!

206
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,476
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

207
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,645
And the time has come...

208
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,647
...for plants to take back...

209
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,650
...the world so rightfully ours...

210
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,401
...because it's not nice...

211
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,781
...to fool with Mother Nature.

212
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,580
Hmm. "Wayne Enterprises."

213
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,045
Coming, Bane, darling.

214
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,297
We've got a plane to catch.

215
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,686
<i>I'm Mr. White Christmas</i>

216
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,771
<i>I'm Mr. Snow</i>

217
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,691
<i>I'm Mr. Icicle</i>

218
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,859
<i>I'm Mr. Ten Below</i>

219
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,444
Sing! Sing!

220
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,077
Come on, sing!

221
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,663
Louder! Come on!

222
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,707
Sing, sing, sing! Come on!

223
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,625
<i>He's Mr. White Christmas</i>

224
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,377
Come on, louder!

225
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,714
<i>He's Mr. Icicle</i>

226
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,216
Freezy...

227
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,385
...I'm feeling hot.

228
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,595
- I find that unlikely.
- Okay.

229
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,725
So my hair is brittle
and my skin is dry...

230
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,185
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.

231
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,063
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

232
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,357
What do you say we heat things up?

233
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,068
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

234
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,239
Talk about your cold shoulder.

235
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,704
Frosty!

236
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah, boss?

237
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,499
Ah. Energy.

238
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,253
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

239
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,426
But...

240
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,679
...I was successful nevertheless.

241
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,223
Absolutely, boss.

242
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,934
One more giant diamond of this size...

243
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,188
...and my freezing engine
will be complete.

244
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:12,692
I will freeze the city.

245
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,071
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

246
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,656
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

247
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,617
...it's winter forever
in Gotham.

248
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,661
The city fathers
will have no choice...

249
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,791
...but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

250
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,128
...so I can find a cure.

251
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,798
Leave us.

252
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,174
Sure, boss.

253
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,470
We need quality time.

254
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,906
Soon we will be together
once more.

255
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,492
Soon.

256
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,846
Alfred.

257
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,850
I'll get it.

258
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,696
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

259
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,531
No apology necessary.

260
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,492
It's the first time it's happened
in 30 years.

261
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,048
Please be looking for me.

262
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,385
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

263
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,846
Uncle Alfred.

264
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,516
Uncle Alfred!

265
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,059
Oh, my dear.

266
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,020
Oh, my dear...

267
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,689
...what a most wonderful surprise.

268
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,859
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

269
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:21,237
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

270
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,822
Uncle?

271
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:29,245
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

272
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:33,208
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident five years ago.

273
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,752
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

274
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,712
- You have?
- Secrets, Al?

275
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:42,050
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

276
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:43,927
Don't you think, sir?

277
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,428
I'm on break from...

278
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:48,598
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.

279
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,768
The new computer sciences division.

280
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,938
- How'd you know?
- Says so on the patch on your sweater.

281
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,943
Oh.

282
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,613
- What is it? It's beautiful.
- You can say that again.

283
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,448
It's a competition racer.

284
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,075
- I've been fixing it up.
- Really?

285
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:10,453
- I'll show you how to ride it.
- You certainly will not!

286
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,249
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

287
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,626
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

288
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,795
Oh, I don't know.

289
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:22,131
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

290
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,133
...yeah, I'd love to.

291
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,135
Then it's settled.

292
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,805
Oh, but, sir, we...

293
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,307
We do get so busy here.

294
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:32,642
Don't be silly.

295
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,644
After all, she's family.

296
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:52,870
Uncle Alfred?

297
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,833
I came to tuck you in.

298
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,335
You came to tuck me in?

299
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,337
That's quite a switch.

300
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:04,132
Yes. What're you working on?

301
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,844
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

302
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:11,973
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

303
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,143
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

304
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,145
It travels through India.

305
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,188
Oh, I remember Mom getting postcards.

306
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:22,525
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

307
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,030
Well, I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

308
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,326
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

309
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,121
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

310
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,418
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

311
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,711
Peg?

312
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,422
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

313
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,385
It's good to see you again.

314
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,304
I've missed you.

315
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,390
As I have you.

316
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,185
Sleep well, child.

317
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,063
You sleep.

318
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,900
Go to bed.

319
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,299
<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

320
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:15,263
<i>It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory...</i>

321
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:19,976
<i>...where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises...</i>

322
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:25,148
<i>...is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.</i>

323
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,985
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

324
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,236
And step on it.

325
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,322
Step.

326
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:46,836
<i>My father told me, "To succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it."</i>

327
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:51,841
So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...

328
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:55,178
...to Gotham's
Observatory Restoration Project.

329
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,679
With any luck...

330
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,515
...this telescope will give
future generations...

331
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:02,018
...a chance to follow their own stars.

332
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,354
Brucy...

333
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:09,650
...is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

334
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,570
Yes. If you'll watch these monitors
right here. Doctor Lee?

335
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:18,201
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

336
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:22,038
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth...

337
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:24,999
...and through this
intricate network of satellites...

338
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:29,545
...reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

339
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,506
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

340
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,014
Brucy, you
and the exquisite Julie Madison...

341
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,849
...have been going out forever.

342
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,227
Are you going to tie the knot?

343
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,978
Uh, marriage?

344
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,396
Uh, uh, marriage?

345
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,899
You want to give me a hand here?

346
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,568
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

347
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:56,405
And that's most certainly
enough for us. For now.

348
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,910
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

349
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:02,912
You're a lot of help.

350
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:05,998
Miss, you need to stop.

351
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,542
Move, fascist bulldog!

352
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,919
- You need an appointment...
- No, I don't!

353
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:13,047
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

354
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,423
She has no pass, sir.

355
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:17,385
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss...?

356
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,136
Dr. Pamela Isley.

357
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,721
Doctor...

358
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,265
...what can I do for you?

359
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,934
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

360
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,728
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America.

361
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:31,607
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

362
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,401
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

363
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:34,777
I see you knew him.

364
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,115
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

365
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:43,452
I have here a proposal showing how
Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

366
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:46,622
...cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

367
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,125
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth...

368
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,918
...our mother, our womb.

369
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:54,130
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

370
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:56,924
And yet, you spoil her lands...

371
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,136
...poison her oceans,
blacken her skies!

372
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,554
You're killing her!

373
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:06,267
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat...

374
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,477
...no coolants to preserve food...

375
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,272
...millions of people would die
of cold and hunger.

376
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,191
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

377
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,403
People come first, Dr. Isley.

378
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,573
Mammals!

379
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,492
A day of reckoning is coming.

380
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:24,827
That's right.

381
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,623
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

382
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,791
...crawl from the primordial soup...

383
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,254
...will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

384
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,175
You...

385
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,469
You must be new in town.

386
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:45,139
In Gotham City,
Batman and Robin protect us...

387
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:48,017
...even from plants and flowers.

388
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:53,189
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

389
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,233
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

390
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:59,028
...a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

391
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:03,866
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

392
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,660
Thank you all for coming.

393
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:07,161
Good day, doctor.

394
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,714
Batman and Robin...

395
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:22,677
...militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

396
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:27,139
...animal protectors of the status quo.

397
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,684
First...

398
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:33,562
...I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

399
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,857
And then Gotham...

400
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,526
...will be mine...

401
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,486
...for the greening.

402
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,092
Uh, excuse me, chief.

403
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,845
I got something here
you might want to see.

404
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,521
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

405
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:37,126
One more diamond, my love.

406
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,795
One more.

407
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,388
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds."
Hmm.

408
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,392
Very nice.

409
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,773
Ladies and gentlemen...

410
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,693
...Gossip Gerty
of <i>Good Morning Gotham</i> and I...

411
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:49,115
...welcome you to
the gem of the evening.

412
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,409
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

413
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:57,915
...displaying the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan...

414
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:02,545
...from the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

415
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,717
- Think Freeze will take the bait?
- He'll be here.

416
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:12,721
...to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...

417
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:16,559
...the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

418
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,897
Let's start the bidding!

419
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,900
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

420
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,321
20,000 for the tiger lily!

421
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,533
And I bid...

422
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:36,495
...30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

423
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,586
Boys, please...

424
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,671
...let's show some gusto!

425
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,133
Hi there.

426
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,052
And you are?

427
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,179
Poison...

428
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:00,806
...Poison Ivy.

429
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,024
Mmm.

430
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:14,236
Why not send junior home early?

431
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,865
I've got some wild oats to sow.

432
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:21,410
On the other hand...

433
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:25,414
...youth does have its advantages.

434
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,751
Endurance, stamina.

435
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,754
Forget the geriatric bat.

436
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,672
Come, join me.

437
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,133
My garden needs tending.

438
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,093
I'll take it from here, pal.

439
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,429
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

440
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:45,434
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

441
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:49,855
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

442
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,941
I'll bring everything you see here...

443
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:56,528
...plus everything you don't.

444
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:01,283
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

445
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:06,288
100,000!

446
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:08,791
And I'll bid...

447
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:12,294
...500,000 dollars!

448
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,297
One million dollars.

449
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,134
- Two million.
- You don't have it. Three million.

450
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,803
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

451
00:45:22,096 --> 00:45:24,765
- Five million.
- That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

452
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:27,059
- Six million.
- Seven million.

453
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:31,939
Never leave the cave without it.

454
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:35,818
You boys aren't going to start
fighting over little me, now, are you?

455
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,792
All right, everyone! Chill.

456
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,629
Chill. Chill.

457
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:05,013
Get the gun!

458
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:32,791
Yeah.

459
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:42,551
Boo.

460
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:49,892
Look at you!

461
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:52,019
Let me guess.

462
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:53,896
Plant Girl?

463
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:56,064
Vine Lady?

464
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,067
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...

465
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:01,069
...or I'll turn you into mulch.

466
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,534
Pheromone dust...

467
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,413
...designed to heat a man's blood.

468
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,208
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

469
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,336
If you insist.

470
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:23,342
Clever little clover.

471
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,927
Whoa!

472
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,598
That's my exit cue.

473
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,391
Thanks.

474
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,071
Good night.

475
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,616
Cool party!

476
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:18,272
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

477
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,740
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

478
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,159
That's not a man...

479
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:33,370
...that is a god.

480
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:41,420
Enough monkey business.

481
00:48:42,254 --> 00:48:44,506
We've got work to do.

482
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,925
Monkey work.

483
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:40,354
- Pull back. You can't make the jump.
- I can make it!

484
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:45,442
- Pull back!
- I can make it!

485
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,152
Redbird control codes.

486
00:49:50,197 --> 00:49:51,448
Disable engine.

487
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:54,576
No! Don't do this to me!

488
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:56,370
No!

489
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,086
We won't make it!

490
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:29,277
It's a cold town.

491
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,543
Uh-oh.

492
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,310
I could've made that jump.

493
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:05,397
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

494
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:07,232
The Flying Graysons were a team.

495
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,484
We had to trust each person
to do his job.

496
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:11,653
That's what being partners is about.

497
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,281
Counting on someone
is the way to win.

498
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:16,742
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.

499
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,578
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

500
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,455
That's your idea of friendship?

501
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:24,291
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

502
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,127
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

503
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:30,505
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

504
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:34,050
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

505
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,803
This is no partnership.

506
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:38,847
You're never going to trust me!

507
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,189
Dear brother Wilfred...

508
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:51,693
...I have tried
every address I know for you.

509
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,196
I'm just praying this reaches you.

510
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,615
We have very little time.

511
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,634
Batman monopolized the evening news.

512
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:17,719
Huh. Yes.

513
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:20,472
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

514
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,224
Thanks. Thank you.

515
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,354
Is there something wrong, sir?

516
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:29,856
Alfred...

517
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:32,192
...am I pig-headed?

518
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:34,069
Is it...?

519
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:36,404
Is it always...

520
00:52:36,613 --> 00:52:38,615
...my way or the highway?

521
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:40,742
Why, yes. Actually.

522
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,664
Death and chance stole your parents...

523
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:47,916
...but rather than become a victim...

524
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:52,087
...you have done everything
in your power to control the fates.

525
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:54,756
For what is Batman...

526
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:59,678
...if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

527
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:02,430
An attempt to control...

528
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:04,266
...death itself?

529
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,954
But I can't, can I?

530
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:29,207
None of us can.

531
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,937
Hey!

532
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,981
Hyah!

533
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,402
Sorry. Um, so sorry!

534
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:59,195
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

535
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:03,700
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

536
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,453
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

537
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:10,498
Couldn't resist.

538
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:12,000
It's just so beautiful.

539
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:15,837
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.

540
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:18,590
All right? Sorry.

541
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,134
Um, sorry. Good night.

542
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:08,765
Drag him into the cold beam.

543
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:12,519
Welcome home, Frost Face.

544
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:15,772
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

545
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,568
Allow me to break the ice.

546
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:23,071
My name is Freeze.

547
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,073
Learn it well...

548
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:28,159
...for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

549
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:44,217
All right, Freezie, you
can't live outside the cold zone.

550
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:57,856
Look at him stew.

551
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:01,609
Get used to it.

552
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:06,364
You're going to be here a very long,
long time.

553
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,325
Sadly...

554
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,953
...you will not live to see it.

555
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:21,087
Oh, yes.

556
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:27,385
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more...

557
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:29,971
...resistant to my love dust
than expected.

558
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:34,142
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

559
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:37,437
They'll literally be dying for me.

560
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:40,607
Hmm. "Turkish baths."

561
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,734
This looks promising.

562
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:09,928
Hmm.

563
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:11,930
A fixer-upper.

564
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:14,599
But with a certain homey charm.

565
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,519
Ah. A minus!

566
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,687
Current tenants.

567
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:22,816
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

568
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:24,692
Hello yourself.

569
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:26,945
You look good enough to eat.

570
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:29,489
That I am.

571
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,909
Come and get me, if you can.

572
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:37,330
With pleasure.

573
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,227
Let's redecorate.

574
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:11,698
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

575
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:22,250
What is this floor?

576
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,676
It took God seven days...

577
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:33,970
...to create Paradise.

578
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,182
Let's see if I can do better.

579
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,106
Good babies.

580
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:47,192
Grow for mommy.

581
00:58:53,198 --> 00:58:54,616
Bane, darling...

582
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:58,286
...I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

583
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,622
A cool customer, yes.

584
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:03,625
Icy demeanor...

585
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:05,710
...no question.

586
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:10,298
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...

587
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:12,383
...to my advantage.

588
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:15,803
Honey, clean up this mess.

589
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:18,139
We've got company coming.

590
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:20,141
Honey.

591
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:21,601
Company.

592
00:59:31,236 --> 00:59:32,654
- Bruce...
- Hmm?

593
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:38,534
We've been going out
for over a year now, and...

594
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,162
Okay, here it goes.

595
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:43,581
I want to spend my life with you.

596
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,670
I'm not the marrying kind.

597
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,673
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

598
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,093
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

599
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,678
You've had your wild nights.

600
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,930
"Wild" doesn't...

601
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:01,266
Doesn't quite cover it.

602
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,353
You'll make someone
a good husband one day...

603
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:08,189
...but I can't wait forever.

604
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:15,029
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do...

605
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:17,282
...you'll just shut down.

606
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:19,284
I know the way you are.

607
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,620
Think about it.

608
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,081
Just promise me you'll think about it.

609
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:27,375
Okay?

610
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,128
You don't have to answer now.

611
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:33,089
Just think it over.

612
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:35,133
Here's some food for thought.

613
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:55,236
Who's Ivy?

614
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:59,365
- What?
- You just called me "Ivy."

615
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:00,867
Who's Ivy?

616
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,494
I wish I knew.

617
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:08,124
Enhance detail, 14 to 19.

618
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:15,006
Who are you?

619
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,355
Gotcha!

620
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:19,821
Banker, how much coin to play?

621
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:21,114
Two and a half.

622
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:24,242
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run two nights ago!

623
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:25,493
That'd be me.

624
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:28,121
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

625
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:31,124
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

626
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,793
- Want a side bet?
- How much?

627
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,837
- How much you got?
- How much you got?

628
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:39,298
All right, let's race! Come on!

629
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:50,518
Just make sure the guys
are ready at the end of the bridge.

630
01:02:51,686 --> 01:02:53,020
You got it, Spike!

631
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,818
Go, go, go!

632
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:43,070
Watch your left!

633
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:04,300
Out of my way, losers!

634
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:08,304
Nice try, girlie! You're next!

635
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:11,766
Excuse me!

636
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,938
Look out, baby!

637
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:37,959
Not bad for a chick!

638
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:12,994
Now!

639
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:28,426
End of the line, sweetheart!

640
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:56,454
So this is where you hang out.

641
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,293
How long you been racing?

642
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,545
Since my parents died.

643
01:06:04,712 --> 01:06:08,716
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

644
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,676
Made the pain go away.

645
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:12,845
You wouldn't understand.

646
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:14,555
You'd be surprised.

647
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:19,560
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge...

648
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,187
...so they kicked me out.

649
01:06:21,479 --> 01:06:25,066
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

650
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:27,318
Don't say you want to join the circus.

651
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:32,531
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

652
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:36,035
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.

653
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,371
What are you talking about?

654
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:41,332
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing...

655
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,917
...it's really ridiculous.

656
01:06:43,084 --> 01:06:45,419
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...

657
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:49,090
...and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

658
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:51,258
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

659
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:54,595
Paying someone
to prepare your meals...

660
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:57,682
...do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

661
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,266
Alfred's happy.

662
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,976
Happy?

663
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:04,021
You honestly don't know, do you?

664
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,732
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

665
01:07:07,483 --> 01:07:08,776
Alfred's sick.

666
01:07:12,363 --> 01:07:14,281
Alfred's not sick.

667
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:15,991
He's dying.

668
01:07:18,703 --> 01:07:20,121
Dying?

669
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:24,792
Why didn't he tell us?

670
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:27,962
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

671
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,636
But I can tell.

672
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,309
I can't believe it.

673
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,104
I know.

674
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:32,610
Cellblock.

675
01:08:33,486 --> 01:08:35,196
Icehead, you got a visitor.

676
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:38,199
Your sister is here to see you.

677
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:39,658
Sister?

678
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:45,706
Brother, dear...

679
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:48,459
...I heard you were blue.

680
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:53,214
Don't mind us, ma'am.

681
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,382
You can speak freely.

682
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:00,596
I don't mind you at all.

683
01:09:04,517 --> 01:09:05,851
Men...

684
01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:08,646
...the most absurd of God's creatures.

685
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:10,397
We give you life...

686
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:14,485
...and we can take it away
just as easily.

687
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:16,904
- Right!
- Whatever.

688
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:20,866
I really am to die for.

689
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:50,271
Impressive!

690
01:09:51,397 --> 01:09:54,733
Well, I, my most
unabominable snowman...

691
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:57,695
...have been impressed by you.

692
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,280
In fact...

693
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:01,907
...I propose a pairing.

694
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:03,409
Hmm.

695
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,044
I've come to set you free.

696
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,964
An enticing offer...

697
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:20,926
...but what does the lady
want in return?

698
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:27,182
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

699
01:10:34,607 --> 01:10:36,942
His name is Bane.

700
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:40,946
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

701
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:48,787
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

702
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:52,458
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

703
01:10:58,339 --> 01:10:59,924
I'm running on empty.

704
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:01,675
I need the diamonds.

705
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:03,969
I'll help you grab your rocks.

706
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:09,850
Bane, dear...

707
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:11,727
...an exit, please.

708
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,109
Reinforced steel.

709
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:20,611
Not good.

710
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:34,792
Always winterize your pipes.

711
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:53,978
While I get my diamonds,
you and meatloaf retrieve my wife.

712
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:57,314
- You never mentioned a wife!
- Come on.

713
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:59,400
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

714
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,920
Alfred, are you well?

715
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:22,756
As well as can be expected, sir.

716
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:26,427
My friend, I know you're sick.

717
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:28,429
I can get you the best doctors.

718
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:31,306
I have seen the best doctors.

719
01:12:31,807 --> 01:12:36,437
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized.

720
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:41,108
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce.

721
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:43,068
Alfred...

722
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:45,946
...have you ever...

723
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:48,615
...regretted your life working here?

724
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,909
Looking after heroes?

725
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:52,369
No, sir.

726
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:57,624
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

727
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,338
Not all the heroes wear masks.

728
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:08,886
Freeze has escaped!

729
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:25,152
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera.

730
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:29,782
Poison Ivy.

731
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:32,493
Two nights ago...

732
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:36,747
...Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America.

733
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:40,125
They put 10 security guards
in the hospital...

734
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:44,838
...left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

735
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:48,342
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze.

736
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:51,011
- Commissioner Gordon.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

737
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:54,348
Poison Ivy, why would
she help Freeze escape?

738
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:56,141
She's definitely evil.

739
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:59,144
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love, but...

740
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:01,480
I know, then the feeling vanished.

741
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:04,024
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.

742
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:06,527
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

743
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:08,487
Well, I'm totally over her.

744
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,405
Me too. Definitely.

745
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:13,367
- Great stems, though.
- Buds too.

746
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:16,036
Yeah, those are nice. Here we go.

747
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:23,377
It's Nora Fries.

748
01:14:23,544 --> 01:14:24,920
She's still alive.

749
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:43,730
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

750
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:46,483
He even found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

751
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:48,569
There she is.

752
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:52,239
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue your bride.

753
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:54,241
We'll meet back at my place.

754
01:14:54,408 --> 01:14:58,745
No. In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the bat and bird.

755
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:01,456
You leave those boys to me.

756
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:03,333
Go!

757
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,213
- Can he save her?
- Her case is too advanced.

758
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:09,756
But maybe someday...

759
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:11,592
...with more research...

760
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:19,433
Poison Ivy.

761
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:31,695
I hate uninvited guests.

762
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,868
My lungs!

763
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:40,495
My lungs are freezing!

764
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,719
Chilled to perfection.

765
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:04,061
No beauty.

766
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,523
Just the beast.

767
01:16:28,502 --> 01:16:30,545
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

768
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,673
Give yourself up. If you surrender...

769
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:34,258
To you?

770
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:38,011
Polly want a kiss?

771
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:54,695
There's something about
an anatomically correct...

772
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:59,032
...rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips.

773
01:17:02,369 --> 01:17:05,831
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

774
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:08,792
Enough sweet talk.

775
01:17:09,001 --> 01:17:10,377
Oh, no.

776
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:15,048
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jail.

777
01:17:19,386 --> 01:17:20,846
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

778
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:24,391
That's why every Poison Ivy
Action Figure comes with him!

779
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:30,731
Try not to make a mess when you die.

780
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:01,094
Yes, yes.

781
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:02,929
Hold it right there!

782
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:25,952
Stop!

783
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:31,917
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad bat.

784
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:33,960
You don't need him.

785
01:18:34,795 --> 01:18:36,922
You're the star.

786
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,924
I can see it now:

787
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:43,303
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

788
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,139
Let me guide you.

789
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:56,650
Let me kiss you.

790
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:58,318
Stop! Don't kiss her.

791
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:01,822
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

792
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:04,658
- What are you saying?
- Why does she want to kiss us?

793
01:19:04,825 --> 01:19:07,285
- I bet her lips are poisoned.
- Poisoned kiss?

794
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:08,829
You have issues with women!

795
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:11,498
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

796
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:13,792
Something would be mine, not yours.

797
01:19:24,344 --> 01:19:25,429
Exit, Bane.

798
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:27,347
Exit!

799
01:19:38,442 --> 01:19:40,861
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

800
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,865
I'm going solo!

801
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:50,454
What happened?
How'd they get away?

802
01:20:07,888 --> 01:20:10,891
I've never been good with competition.

803
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:16,062
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

804
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:42,923
Make yourself right at home.

805
01:20:45,217 --> 01:20:46,593
Where's my wife?

806
01:20:47,052 --> 01:20:50,096
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.

807
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:52,724
- She's dead.
- You lie!

808
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,231
Oh, no.

809
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:19,125
I'm sorry.

810
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:24,381
Their bones will turn to ice!

811
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:29,135
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

812
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:31,429
Kill them, of course.

813
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:33,473
But why stop there?

814
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,935
Why should only
Batman and Robin die...

815
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:40,564
...while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

816
01:21:40,772 --> 01:21:42,482
Yes!

817
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:44,818
If I must suffer...

818
01:21:44,985 --> 01:21:47,946
...humanity will suffer with me!

819
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:52,993
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

820
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,997
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

821
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:58,498
First...

822
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,167
...Gotham.

823
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:03,878
And then...

824
01:22:04,129 --> 01:22:05,463
...the world!

825
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,675
Just what I had in mind.

826
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:13,138
Everything dead on Earth except us.

827
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:14,848
A chance for...

828
01:22:15,015 --> 01:22:17,892
...Mother Nature to start again.

829
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:22,022
Behold, the dawn of a new age.

830
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:28,695
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

831
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:33,908
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

832
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,703
And we shall rule them.

833
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:39,873
For we will be...

834
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,709
...the only two people
left in the world.

835
01:22:43,543 --> 01:22:45,211
Yes.

836
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:47,213
Adam...

837
01:22:48,048 --> 01:22:49,549
...and Evil.

838
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:51,217
Yes.

839
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,345
You distract the bat and bird...

840
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:55,055
...while I prepare...

841
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:56,640
...to freeze...

842
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,266
...Gotham!

843
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:15,909
It's stage one
of Macgregor's Syndrome.

844
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:17,911
I'm sorry.

845
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:21,581
All we can do is
make him comfortable.

846
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:25,418
Thank you, doctor.

847
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:45,605
Macgregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had.

848
01:23:45,772 --> 01:23:48,650
Alfred's condition is
less severe. Fries' research said...

849
01:23:48,817 --> 01:23:51,152
...he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

850
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:53,238
No one else is even close.

851
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:57,075
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone.

852
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:59,577
- Like hell you do.
- Don't push me right now.

853
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:02,997
Or what? No one can
capture Ivy but the big, bad bat?

854
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:05,959
Yeah, right.
You want her for yourself, don't you?

855
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:09,838
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

856
01:24:10,672 --> 01:24:15,135
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

857
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:18,680
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

858
01:24:18,847 --> 01:24:21,307
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

859
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:25,019
- You're not thinking straight.
- But I am.

860
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:27,147
For the first time in a long time.

861
01:24:27,355 --> 01:24:29,858
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

862
01:24:30,066 --> 01:24:32,026
I'm tired of living in your shadow.

863
01:24:32,193 --> 01:24:33,486
All that ends now.

864
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:40,326
I'm sorry, Uncle.

865
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:43,329
I was too late.

866
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:50,378
You must...

867
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:56,843
You must do something for me.

868
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:00,972
Find my brother, Wilfred...

869
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:04,976
...your uncle, wherever he is
and give him this.

870
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:08,897
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

871
01:25:10,356 --> 01:25:12,859
Only family can be trusted.

872
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:15,236
What is it?

873
01:25:15,403 --> 01:25:18,865
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

874
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:22,202
...whom I have the honor
of calling "sir."

875
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:28,208
Take it to Wilfred,
and I implore you...

876
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,668
...never open it.

877
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,342

881
01:25:47,644 --> 01:25:51,773
...and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

882
01:25:56,653 --> 01:26:00,073
And here's the man
of the hour himself...

883
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:02,283
...Bruce Wayne.

884
01:26:02,909 --> 01:26:05,119
Mr. Wayne, how about a statement?

885
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:06,538
Excuse me.

886
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:08,873
- Over here, Mr. Wayne.
- Bruce! Bruce!

887
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:10,542
Commissioner.

888
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:12,252
- How are you?
- Good.

889
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:15,171
- How are you?
- How are you? Good to see you, Bruce.

890
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:18,883
Young man.

891
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:22,178
Hello, Gerty. Lovely to see you again.

892
01:26:27,559 --> 01:26:28,935
Thank you.

893
01:26:29,269 --> 01:26:32,105
- Commissioner Gordon.
- Yes?

894
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:35,108
I've always wondered...

895
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:39,112
...where does
that big old batlight come from?

896
01:26:44,993 --> 01:26:47,412
Why, it's...

897
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,789
...on top of Police Headquarters.

898
01:26:50,707 --> 01:26:53,751
I'd just love to see it.

899
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,421
But you probably don't have access.

900
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:57,839
Why, dear lady...

901
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:01,301
...I am the police commissioner.

902
01:27:01,509 --> 01:27:04,470
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

903
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:06,222
Would you like to see it?

904
01:27:24,824 --> 01:27:27,827
Who are you, dear lady?

905
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,499
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

906
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,376
No, I'm not.

907
01:27:36,544 --> 01:27:38,004
Please...

908
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:39,881
...come back.

909
01:27:46,554 --> 01:27:48,681
What are you doing? Come on.

910
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,851
- Show me how the satellites work.
- Okay.

911
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:09,661
First, I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard...

912
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:13,873
...then I will pull Batman's heart
from his body...

913
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:17,085
...and feel it freeze in my hands.

914
01:28:21,172 --> 01:28:22,215

915

916

Quickly, now.

- She changed the signal.
- She did it for me, for love.

953
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:50,983
She infected us with pheromones.

You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

957

To keep her for yourself.

958

You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

959
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:07,375
Sometimes counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:02,675
<i>...and created a virtual simulation.</i>

988
01:36:02,967 --> 01:36:05,052
I'd like to help Batman and Robin.

989
01:36:05,302 --> 01:36:06,887
<i>I anticipated you would...</i>

990
01:36:07,054 --> 01:36:10,516
<i>...and took the liberty
to create something in your size.</i>

991
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,853
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

992
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:36,060
Hi there.

993
01:37:40,272 --> 01:37:42,942
Is your thumb
the only part of you that's green?

994
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,237
You will just have to find out.

995
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:48,614
I want us to be together...

996
01:37:48,781 --> 01:37:51,575
...but you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

997
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:54,370
I need a sign...

998
01:37:55,246 --> 01:37:57,373
How about "Slippery when wet."

999
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:58,916
...of trust.

1000
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,626
Tell me your plan.

1001
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,461
Kiss me and I'll tell you.

1002
01:38:03,379 --> 01:38:05,297
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

1003
01:38:06,674 --> 01:38:11,470
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

1004
01:38:11,804 --> 01:38:14,431
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

1005
01:38:15,683 --> 01:38:17,268
I've got to stop him.

1006
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:19,770
One kiss, my love.

1007
01:38:20,938 --> 01:38:22,398
For luck.

1008
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:37,162
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

1009
01:38:37,997 --> 01:38:39,999
Time to die, little Robin.

1010
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:45,546
I hate to disappoint you...

1011
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:52,303
...but rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

1012
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:00,853
See you!

1013
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,524
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

1014
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:09,695
Sorry, my vines have a crush on you.

1015
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:18,871
Got to go.

1016
01:39:19,038 --> 01:39:22,499
So many people to kill,
so little time.

1017
01:39:31,967 --> 01:39:33,677
You're about to become compost.

1018
01:39:41,352 --> 01:39:45,230
Using feminine wiles to get what
you want? Trading on your looks?

1019
01:39:45,397 --> 01:39:48,901
Read a book. That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

1020
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:51,195
Chicks like you
give women a bad name.

1021
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:15,302
As I told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...

1022
01:40:15,886 --> 01:40:17,596
...this is a one-woman show.

1023
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:19,390
I don't think so.

1024
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,454
Curses!

1025
01:40:42,663 --> 01:40:43,956
No!

1026
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:00,097
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1027
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:01,598
I know.

1028
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:03,976
- And you are?
- Batgirl.

1029
01:41:04,143 --> 01:41:07,688
That's not P.C.
What about Batperson or Batwoman?

1030
01:41:08,063 --> 01:41:11,316
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the batcave.

1031
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:13,026
We must change the locks.

1032
01:41:13,193 --> 01:41:15,362
- She knows who we are.
- We must kill her.

1033
01:41:15,612 --> 01:41:17,865
Yep. We'll kill her later.
We have work to do.

1034
01:41:37,217 --> 01:41:40,137
Let's kick some ice.

1035
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:42,014
Yes.

1036
01:41:50,189 --> 01:41:51,398
Yes.

1037
01:42:05,037 --> 01:42:08,207
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1038
01:43:08,183 --> 01:43:10,435
We have less than 11 minutes
to thaw the city.

1039
01:43:37,963 --> 01:43:39,089
Gotcha!

1040
01:43:40,132 --> 01:43:41,633
Now!

1041
01:43:50,934 --> 01:43:52,102
Shield.

1042
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,334
I'll finish off the city.

1043
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,753
You kill the kids...

1044
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:20,505
- ...but leave me the bat.
- Bat!

1045
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,361
No sign of the snowman.

1046
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:44,321
Maybe he melted.

1047
01:44:44,529 --> 01:44:46,573
No, he's just hibernating.

1048
01:45:04,591 --> 01:45:05,926
These heaters will thaw them.

1049
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:15,769
I hope you've got
10 million more of those.

1050
01:45:15,936 --> 01:45:18,397
Eight minutes
and they're ice cubes forever.

1051
01:45:18,563 --> 01:45:20,524
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.

1052
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:22,567
- Sunrise isn't for five hours.
- Here.

1053
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:24,111
It's morning in the Congo.

1054
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:27,072
- We'll relay sunlight...
- From below the equator...

1055
01:45:27,239 --> 01:45:29,700
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but...

1056
01:45:30,325 --> 01:45:32,703
- Damn.
- Damn? Damn's not good.

1057
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:35,580
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.
The beam won't work.

1058
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:37,249
You thaw the mirrors.

1059
01:46:03,442 --> 01:46:04,943
Tonight's forecast:

1060
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:06,903
A freeze is coming.

1061
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:22,878
Bye-bye.

1062
01:46:35,932 --> 01:46:37,142
I got you!

1063
01:46:47,652 --> 01:46:49,696
No. I got you.

1064
01:46:57,037 --> 01:46:58,330
Yes.

1065
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:04,836
It's one of those days!

1066
01:47:11,051 --> 01:47:12,677
Yes!

1067
01:47:52,384 --> 01:47:53,718
- Yeah!
- Yes.

1068
01:47:58,849 --> 01:48:00,350
Dirty fighter, dirty fighter!

1069
01:48:15,115 --> 01:48:16,700
The tube.

1070
01:48:31,548 --> 01:48:32,799
Yay, Batman!

1071
01:48:36,678 --> 01:48:37,678
Oh, no.

1072
01:48:46,229 --> 01:48:48,815
Hey, Freeze. The heat is on.

1073
01:49:02,287 --> 01:49:05,332
- You all right down there?
- Yeah.

1074
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:06,625
Here goes.

1075
01:49:35,695 --> 01:49:36,780
Hang on.

1076
01:49:51,836 --> 01:49:53,588
Batman, you're doing it!

1077
01:49:55,006 --> 01:49:56,633
You've lost, Freeze.

1078
01:49:57,175 --> 01:49:58,301
I think not.

1079
01:49:59,678 --> 01:50:01,179
Bombs away, Batman.

1080
01:50:25,537 --> 01:50:29,124
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1081
01:50:55,942 --> 01:50:58,653
- What should we do now?
- Pray.

1082
01:51:04,534 --> 01:51:06,036
Hang on!

1083
01:51:08,955 --> 01:51:10,749
Grab onto my belt!

1084
01:51:30,435 --> 01:51:32,979
- Thank you, Batman!
- Thank you!

1085
01:51:36,483 --> 01:51:37,984
Need a ride?

1086
01:51:48,495 --> 01:51:50,997
- Most of Gotham's still frozen.
- It's midnight.

1087
01:51:51,414 --> 01:51:53,958
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

1088
01:51:54,209 --> 01:51:57,253
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

1089
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:58,463
I'm on it.

1090
01:51:59,089 --> 01:52:00,340
No, I'm on it.

1091
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:07,806
Have to do it upside down.

1092
01:52:07,972 --> 01:52:10,475
Men! Everything the hard way.

1093
01:52:13,103 --> 01:52:15,146
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

1094
01:52:15,647 --> 01:52:19,234
Well, watch and learn, little boy.

1095
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:29,053
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day.

1096
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:39,814
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum.

1097
01:53:40,732 --> 01:53:42,233
Go on.

1098
01:53:43,067 --> 01:53:44,402
Kill me too.

1099
01:53:44,611 --> 01:53:46,362
Just as you killed my wife.

1100
01:53:46,529 --> 01:53:48,072
I didn't kill your wife.

1101
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:57,123
<i>As I told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...</i>

1102
01:53:57,457 --> 01:53:59,834
<i>...this is a one-woman show.</i>

1103
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:07,467
But she's not dead.

1104
01:54:08,259 --> 01:54:10,136
We found her, restored her.

1105
01:54:10,637 --> 01:54:12,931
She's still frozen alive...

1106
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:14,974
...waiting for you to find a cure.

1107
01:54:16,267 --> 01:54:17,936
She lives?

1108
01:54:18,144 --> 01:54:20,104
- Yes.
- She lives.

1109
01:54:20,271 --> 01:54:23,608
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

1110
01:54:24,108 --> 01:54:25,652
But to give life...

1111
01:54:26,152 --> 01:54:28,988
...that's true power.
A power you once had.

1112
01:54:30,281 --> 01:54:32,116
She's alive.

1113
01:54:37,789 --> 01:54:39,457
So I'm asking you.

1114
01:54:40,458 --> 01:54:42,001
Victor Fries...

1115
01:54:42,877 --> 01:54:44,796
...help me save another life.

1116
01:54:45,171 --> 01:54:48,299
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome, stage one.

1117
01:54:48,675 --> 01:54:52,512
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

1118
01:54:53,471 --> 01:54:55,598
He's still inside you, Victor.

1119
01:54:56,516 --> 01:54:57,809
Buried...

1120
01:54:57,976 --> 01:55:00,186
...deep beneath the snow.

1121
01:55:02,689 --> 01:55:04,315
Will you help me...

1122
01:55:05,817 --> 01:55:07,318
...doctor?

1123
01:55:31,676 --> 01:55:33,678
Take two of these...

1124
01:55:34,929 --> 01:55:36,848
...and call me in the morning.

1125
01:55:47,442 --> 01:55:50,403
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham.

1126
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:53,031
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

1127
01:56:16,262 --> 01:56:18,514
All we can do now is wait...

1128
01:56:19,265 --> 01:56:21,100
...and hope.

1129
01:56:34,739 --> 01:56:36,115
He loves me.

1130
01:56:36,741 --> 01:56:38,493
He loves me not.

1131
01:56:40,036 --> 01:56:41,621
He loves me.

1132
01:56:42,914 --> 01:56:44,916
He loves me not.

1133
01:56:47,293 --> 01:56:49,128
He loves me.

1134
01:56:50,755 --> 01:56:52,590
He loves me not.

1135
01:56:55,093 --> 01:56:56,511
He loves me.

1136
01:56:58,429 --> 01:56:59,639
Not!

1137
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,101
Surprise.

1138
01:57:03,267 --> 01:57:05,269
I'm your new cellmate.

1139
01:57:07,522 --> 01:57:11,150
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

1140
01:57:11,651 --> 01:57:14,654
Prepare for a bitter harvest.

1141
01:57:18,616 --> 01:57:21,953
Winter has come at last.

1142
01:58:03,077 --> 01:58:04,620
Alfred.

1143
01:58:07,498 --> 01:58:08,541
Are you...?

1144
01:58:08,708 --> 01:58:13,337
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1145
01:58:13,838 --> 01:58:15,882
And quite well, it seems!

1146
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:17,467
Thanks to you, son.

1147
01:58:17,675 --> 01:58:19,844
Thanks to you all.

1148
01:58:20,094 --> 01:58:21,679
Well done, Bruce.

1149
01:58:22,013 --> 01:58:24,098
You too. Well done.

1150
01:58:25,516 --> 01:58:27,018
I got one question.

1151
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:31,022
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1152
01:58:31,189 --> 01:58:33,524
It's the first time I fell
and you weren't there.

1153
01:58:34,025 --> 01:58:35,526
I figured you could handle it.

1154
01:58:35,693 --> 01:58:40,406
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1155
01:58:43,117 --> 01:58:46,537
Excuse me. I'm the one
who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1156
01:58:46,704 --> 01:58:48,039
Yeah, that was me.

1157
01:58:48,206 --> 01:58:50,708
I did it all by myself. That was me.

1158
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:53,211
You are going back to school.

1159
01:58:53,377 --> 01:58:55,046
You'll never win this argument.

1160
01:59:00,051 --> 01:59:01,385
Partners?

1161
01:59:06,349 --> 01:59:07,934
Partners.

1162
01:59:16,734 --> 01:59:18,444
Partners.

1163
01:59:21,906 --> 01:59:24,075
We're going to need a bigger cave.
