but he didn't tell me who they were.

This is the one riddle that got away.

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,250
I will get you the answer you seek.

166
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,962
But I will do it in my own way.

167
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,966
You're going to make
a big production of this, aren't you?

168
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,207
Only someone with power and connections
would have information on this group.

169
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,280
I need to speak with Gotham's elite.

170
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,283
And nothing brings out the bourgeoisie
quite like opening night at the theater.

171
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,369
Where wilt thou lead me?

172
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,162
Speak, for I will go no further.

But tonight,

183
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,481
I will kidnap and torture one of you
to expose the truth.

184

You let me win, didn't you, Master Bruce?

- No way, Alfred.
- No way, my foot.

That's very unlike you, isn't it?

194
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,963
And to be honest, I mean, you haven't been
yourself these past few days, have you?

195
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

196
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,011
I think you do know
what I'm talking about. So, come on.

Out with it.

198

The other day when I came home,

199
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,760
you asked how things were with Selina.

200
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,440
I made it sound like things were hopeful.

201

I lied.

202
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,928
She said she never wanted to see me again.

203
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,841
I was embarrassed.

204
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,241
I was afraid you'd ask me
about seeing Selina, and I'd lie...

205
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,446
I just didn't want to talk about it.

for being so candid.

worry about Ms. Kyle.

I guess he wasn't meant to be.

You crossed paths with Nygma recently.

225

Any idea what this secret is
he's talking about?

No, I have no clue.

227
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,805
My guess is he just made it up.

- Fraud. Criminal.

but that doesn't make any sense.

and he's been mayor before.

Why tell us in advance?

245
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,480
Because Nygma wants to make a show of it,
and make us look bad in the process.

Call the Mayor's Office.

Once he does, we'll get rid of him.

the GCPD what I was going to do.

you're going after him?

there are in this city?

Oh, my gosh, this is delicious.

All the same, Mr. Mayor, we'd like
to move you to a safe house, immediately.

want with me, anyway?

He convinced me
I was some sort of goddess.

And it took me a long time to get over it.

but Gotham is worse.

with being a freak.

Though, to be honest, I'm not complaining.

Ivy.

You did the right thing coming here.

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,962
- What did you tell Alfred?
- Nothing.

326
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,320
I said I was tired,
then snuck out of my room.

327
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,371
I'm dying, aren't I?

328

Yes.

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,647
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,850
The process that brought you
into this world was flawed.

331
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,089
Will I die before Bruce returns?

332
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,369
No. Bruce Wayne will be back
in Gotham well before then.

333

I know we've asked a lot of you.

334

After Indian Hill, I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

335
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,210
You gave me a purpose.

336
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,724
That's more than most people can say.

337
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,207
I'm glad you see it that way.

338

A lot of people.

341
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,809
You haven't gotten attached
to anyone, have you?

342
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,129
Alfred, perhaps?

343
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,648

What matters is that Gotham must fall.

347
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,650
And because of your sacrifice, it will.

One that you put into motion
when you sent Barbara down to Dock 9C.

you came over to Lee's for dinner?

It feels like a lifetime ago.

The wine was a Bordeaux.

Well aged. Smooth tannins.

The truth is, I had a good time.

649
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,691
I considered you a friend.

650
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,765
I can sneak up on you

651
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,201
or be right in front of you
without you even knowing.

652
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,129
But when I reveal myself,

653
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,080
you will never be the same.

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,730

- I don't care, Ed.

655
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,041
Betrayal.

That's how every friendship ends.

657
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,969
So, what good are friends anyway?

Who are they?

Hello, Mr. Nygma.

00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,124
I hear you've been asking about us.

662
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,810
How do I know you're real?

663
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,891
Isn't that the point of a good mystery?

664
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,683
You're never quite sure
what to believe until the end.

Gordon could've put you up to this.

666
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,082
I assure you' Detective Gordon
had to be convinced to bring you here.

What are you going to do with him?

681
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,127
A man with Nygma's intellect
could be quite useful lo us.

682
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,608
I'm sure we'll find something
for him to do.

Gordon took down Nygma

689

before he could find out
the truth about The Court.

690
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,120
Probably 'cause I told Gordon
how to disarm the bomb.

handed over the underworld,
I would get to kill him.
