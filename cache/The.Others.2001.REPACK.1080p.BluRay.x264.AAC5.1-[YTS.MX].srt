1
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:38,900
<i>Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably?

2
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:41,442
<i>Then I'll begin.

3
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,608
<i>"This story started many
thousands of years ago...

4
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:48,900
<i>but it was all over in just 7 days.

5
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:53,067
<i>All that long, long time ago,
none of the things we can see now...

6
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:58,025
<i>the sun, the moon, the stars,
the earth, the animals and plants...

7
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:02,067
<i>none existed. Only God existed...

8
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,775
<i>and so only He could
have created them.

9
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,692
<i>And He did."

10
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:20,900
Mr. Simpson, what a character he was!
I wonder whatever became of him?

11
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:24,108
I imagine he's dead,
Like all the rest.

12
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:26,692
Those were the days...

13
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:38,358
Mr. Tuttle, your hair!

14
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:50,233
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the...

15
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:52,358
Oh yes, of course.

16
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,650
Come in.

17
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:59,733
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

18
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,192
- You are...?
- I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am...

19
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,858
...and this is Edmund Tuttle.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

20
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,983
- You must be the gardener.
- Ay, that's right, the gardener...

21
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:21,983
and this young lady's called Lydia.

22
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:27,567
- Have you had experience in service?
- Don't let that angel face fool you.

23
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:31,817
- She's older than she looks.
- Can you iron?

24
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,942
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

25
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:42,192
Ah, she can't talk, ma'am.
The poor little mite's a mute.

26
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:46,567
But she's a good little worker,
I can promise you that.

27
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,442
All right.

28
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,067
All right. The other girl I had
spoke too much anyway. Follow me.

29
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:56,942
Mrs. Mills, you and the Girl will
sleep in the attic room upstairs...

30
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:00,817
- And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma'am.

31
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:05,400
Tuttle. You can sleep in the shed,
around the back.

32
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,692
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

33
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,192
since the servants disappeared,
almost a week ago.

34
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:13,692
You mean they just vanished?

35
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:18,192
Into thin air. No notice, nothing.
They didn't even collect their wages.

36
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,275
- They... they just left us.
- What a strange thing to do!

37
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:28,358
You'll find out sometimes this house
is not exactly an ideal home.

38
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:34,358
Hence my advertisement in the paper
for honest, hardworking people.

39
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,067
Nobody's more honest
and hardworking than us.

40
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:40,817
- Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?
- Ay, we're very honest.

41
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:44,358
And... very hardworking.

42
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:48,817
The kitchen.

43
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:53,233
I have breakfast at eight,
the children at nine.

44
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,650
Lunch will be served at one
and dinner at half past seven.

45
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,858
And the master, ma'am?

46
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:05,942
The master went off to war,
a year and a half ago.

47
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:09,150
I had no news since the war ended.

48
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:13,317
- Which of you does the cooking?
- I'm so sorry, ma'am.

49
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:15,942
Which of you does the cooking?

50
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,317
Have you all noticed
what I am doing?

51
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:23,775
No door must be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

52
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,317
It's vital that you remember this.

53
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,275
It's not as easy as it may seem.

54
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:31,400
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 5O doors...

55
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,358
depending on which area of the house
you're in at the time.

56
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,775
Mrs. Mills, tomorrow I'll leave
a set of keys in your charge.

57
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,275
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:45,775
The music room. That old piano
was already here when we moved in.

59
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:49,233
Please do not let the Children
thump away on it.

60
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,858
It sets off my migraine.

61
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:55,942
Silence is something that we prize
very highly in this house.

62
00:06:56,692 --> 00:07:01,358
So we have no telephone, radio
or anything that makes a racket.

63
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,858
We don't have electricity either.

64
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:07,900
The Germans kept cutting it off,
so we learned to live without it.

65
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,150
- Let's continue.
- Ma'am, there's really no need...

66
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,817
...to show us around the whole house.
- Yes!

67
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,442
Yes, there is.

68
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,483
Because here, most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

69
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:22,858
It's hard to see if there is a table,
a chair, a door, a sideboard...

70
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:27,775
or one of my children
playing hide-and-seek.

71
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,275
What do you mean, ma'am?

72
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,025
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

73
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,400
Mr. Tuttle, see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.

74
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,067
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:49,275
You two can start closing
the curtains. All of them.

76
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,108
Come.

77
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,608
I'll wake them. You wait here.

78
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:38,233
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

79
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,233
Wakey-wakey!

80
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:50,192
Now, come on.
Eyes closed, hands together.

81
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:55,608
Blessed be, at light of day,
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

82
00:08:55,817 --> 00:09:00,150
Blessed be the Virgin pure
Whom I greet with faith so sure.

83
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,983
Jesus, Mary, Spotless Rose,
Keep us till this day doth close.

84
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,525
They're still half-asleep.

85
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,400
What sweet little children!

86
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:20,233
Well? What do you say?

87
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,733
How do you do?

88
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,067
How do you do?

89
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,733
How do you do, children?

90
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:32,775
My name's Mrs. Mills, but you
can call me Bertha if you like.

91
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,983
What are your names?

92
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,983
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

93
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:41,733
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names!

94
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,733
Are you going to be our new nanny?

95
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,900
- Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny.
- It's time for their breakfast.

96
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:56,150
Lydia, you go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

97
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:06,442
- The doctors couldn't find a cure.
- For what?

98
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,525
Their condition.

99
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:13,442
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

100
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:18,567
They're photosensitive and mustn't
be exposed to more light than this.

101
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,442
Or, in a matter of minutes, they'd
break out in sores and blisters...

102
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,858
and begin to suffocate.
It would eventually be fatal.

103
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:29,608
Good Heavens!

104
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,567
- I don't like this toast.
- Why not?

105
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:38,567
It tastes funny.
I liked it better before.

106
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:42,900
Well, that was because
before, somebody else made it.

107
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,900
When are they coming back?

108
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:49,733
They won't be coming back, child.

109
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,983
Just like daddy.

110
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,567
Daddy is coming back, though.

111
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,817
Mrs. Mills, our father is fighting
in a war in France, you know.

112
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,942
- It's the World War.
- I know, but he's in France.

113
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:05,567
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

114
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:09,442
Are you going to leave us, too?

115
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:15,233
Of course not.
Why should I leave you?

116
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,858
The others said they wouldn't.
But they did. And then it happened.

117
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,358
Be quiet!

118
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:27,067
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

119
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,233
Mummy went mad.

120
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,900
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

121
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,900
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

122
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,067
Be quiet!

123
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,775
What's going on?

124
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:46,442
I want to see those plates empty in
less than a minute. Is that clear?

125
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:54,067
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside
a moment, I'd like a word with you.

126
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,692
Yes, ma'am.

127
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,150
The postman usually comes
every Wednesday...

128
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,358
but I've just checked the letter box
and this week he hasn't.

129
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,983
- I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.
- This letter should've been collected...

130
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,317
and delivered to the
newspaper five days ago.

131
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:18,025
It's the advertisement.
Since it wasn't published...

132
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:22,650
...how are you here?
- Now I understand.

133
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:28,650
That's exactly what I was going to
say when you opened the door to us.

134
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:33,650
The truth is that we just
come by on the off-chance.

135
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:37,817
A big house like this always needs
someone who knows the ropes.

136
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,608
You mean you've served
in a house like this one before?

137
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,400
This may come as a
surprise to you, but...

138
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,233
we, in fact, used to work here.

139
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:52,692
- Here?
- It was a few years ago.

140
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:59,900
And if you don't mind my saying so,
they were the best years of my life.

141
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:06,358
That's why we come by, because
this house means a lot to us.

142
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,483
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

143
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:14,525
Don't bother, there's no need.
So you know the house well?

144
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,858
Like the back of my hand.

145
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:22,192
If the walls haven't sprouted legs
and moved in the meantime.

146
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,275
The only thing that moves here
is the light.

147
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,525
But it changes everything.

148
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:37,233
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

149
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,983
One might almost say...

150
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:42,900
unbearable.

151
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:48,400
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

152
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,858
- Yes, ma'am.
- I don't like fantasies.

153
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:56,608
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?

154
00:13:56,817 --> 00:14:01,483
- I think so, ma'am.
- My children have strange ideas.

155
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,317
But you mustn't pay any attention
to them. Children will be children.

156
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,233
Yes, of course, ma'am.

157
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,858
All right...

158
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,650
you can stay.

159
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,567
Thank you very much, ma'am.

160
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,025
It did happened.

161
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,692
"The Roman governor tried to make
them change their minds afterwards...

162
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:50,817
"To make them change
their minds", full stop.

163
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,067
- "Afterwards..."
- "Afterwards...

164
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:58,358
he ordered them to be beaten.
But Justus and Pastor, not afraid...

165
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,775
rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

166
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:04,858
When he saw this, the Roman
governor was filled with rage...

167
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,650
and ordered their heads
to be cut off."

168
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,733
What do you find so amusing?

169
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,317
Well...

170
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:21,858
- well, what?
- Those children were really stupid.

171
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:25,025
- Why?
- They said they believed...

172
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,983
in Jesus and then
they got killed for it.

173
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:32,275
- And would you deny Christ?
- Well, yes.

174
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:37,150
Inside I would have believed in him.
But I wouldn't have told the Romans.

175
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,525
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas?

176
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,483
I see.

177
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:51,733
So you both Would have lied,
to the point of denying Christ.

178
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:55,400
You'd have saved your heads from
being chopped off, that's true...

179
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:59,025
...but what would've happened after?
- When?

180
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:04,900
In the next life, after we die.
Where would you have gone?

181
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:10,108
- Where, Nicholas?
- To the children's limbo.

182
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:11,983
What is the children's limbo?

183
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,942
- One of the four Hells.
- Which are...?

184
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:23,275
- Me! Me!
- No, let him answer. Which are?

185
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:28,817
There's the hell where the damned
go, then there's Purgatory...

186
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,108
and the Bosom of Abraham,
where the Just go...

187
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:34,400
...and limbo where children go.
- At the centre of the Earth.

188
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,775
Where it's very, very hot.

189
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:41,775
That's where children go who tell
lies. But not for a few days, oh no.

190
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,025
No, they're damned, forever.

191
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:48,983
Think about it.

192
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:54,650
Try to imagine the end of Eternity.

193
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:59,817
Close your eyes, close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

194
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,650
Forever...

195
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:07,317
Pain. Forever.

196
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,942
I'm getting dizzy.

197
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:16,358
Now do you understand why
Justus and Pastor told the truth?

198
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,567
Right.

199
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,400
- Open your readers at lesson 6.
- Can't we go and play?

200
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,817
You most certainly cannot. First
you're going to read the lesson...

201
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:33,400
...and then learn it, by heart.
- All of it?

202
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:36,983
Anne, any more protests and
there'll be no playing at all today.

203
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:40,983
In fact, I think you can study
in separate rooms...

204
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:46,358
- But we get scared if we're separated!
- You get scared?

205
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,567
As if you weren't used
to this house by now.

206
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,483
What if we see a ghost?

207
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:55,275
- Has your sister been telling stories?
- I haven't told him anything.

208
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:58,192
If you see a ghost, you say hello
and you continue on studying.

209
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,733
- Come with me to the music room.
- Why me?

210
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:04,275
Because I say so!
Now come on, take your book.

211
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,900
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson
learned in less than an hour.

212
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:10,358
- Mummy?
- What?

213
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:15,358
- Give me a kiss.
- "Give me a kiss, give me a kiss..."

214
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:19,983
- Anne, wait for me outside.
- You know I can't.

215
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:23,025
Over there.

216
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:28,608
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

217
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,025
My daughter is going to cross
the living room.

218
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,858
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,067
All right, Anne.

220
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:50,650
Darling, mummy can't be with you
all the time.

221
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:56,275
You must learn to be on your own.

222
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:00,692
Where's your rosary?

223
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,025
Whenever you feel afraid...

224
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:10,525
I want you to squeeze it with all
your might and say an Our Father.

225
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,025
And then your fear will go away.

226
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:16,317
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.

227
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:21,150
Don't you see that when you do that,
the Lord is with you?

228
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,108
There's no reason to be afraid.

229
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,150
"The house and the family.

230
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:09,817
We all live in a house
with our family.

231
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:15,483
It is usually made up of parents,
children, and their grandparents.

232
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,567
We must be obedient and kind...

233
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,192
towards the other members
of our family.

234
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,483
And we must never argue or fight
with our brothers and sisters."

235
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:29,358
- Do you have any children?
- No.

236
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:33,858
Mr. Tuttle and the girl, Lydia,
are all I've got.

237
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:37,358
- And I'm all they've got.
- Was she born like that?

238
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:39,983
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

239
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:43,275
The girl, was she born a mute?

240
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,650
No.

241
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,150
I think I've finished here, ma'am.

242
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:53,442
If you'll excuse me, I'll go and see
if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

243
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:26,025
Nicholas!

244
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:32,733
Nicholas, I'm coming!

245
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:41,400
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

246
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:44,942
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying. I was reading.

247
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:49,233
But I just heard you...
Anne! Anne!

248
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,608
Anne!

249
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,400
Anne!

250
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,692
I haven't learned it yet, mummy.

251
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,525
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

252
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,983
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying.

253
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:12,983
But I just heard you a moment ago.

254
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,025
There's no need to feel
ashamed, darling.

255
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:19,567
I don't. If I'd been crying,
I'd tell you.

256
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:24,067
- Really? So I imagined it, did I?
- No. It was that boy.

257
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:27,817
- What boy?
- Victor.

258
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,275
Who's Victor?

259
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,608
The boy who was here a moment ago.

260
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:36,983
I told him to let me study,
but he wouldn't stop crying.

261
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:39,692
I think he's a spoilt brat.

262
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,442
He said we had to leave the house.

263
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,733
Did he now? Why was he crying?

264
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:49,233
Because he doesn't like this house
but he has to live here.

265
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:52,108
- His father's a pianist and...
- His father's a pianist, is he?

266
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:56,358
Yes. And I've already told him
he's not allowed to touch the piano.

267
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,150
He isn't, is he, mummy?

268
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,692
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

269
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,025
No, only with Victor. His father
is with the others in the hall.

270
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:07,483
But I've just come from the hall,
there's no one there.

271
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:11,650
They must have gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

272
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,650
That'll do, Anne. That's enough.

273
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,442
- Now, why were you crying?
- It was Victor.

274
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,775
- So where is he now?
- He went out through there.

275
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:26,067
Can you tell me how a boy can get
in and out of this room if it's locked?

276
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,775
I thought I made myself
quite clear:

277
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:36,567
No door is to be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

278
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:39,358
Is that so hard to understand?

279
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:42,983
This house is like a ship. The light
must be hold as if it were water...

280
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:45,858
by opening and closing the doors.

281
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,025
- My children's lives are at stake!
- But, ma'am, I...

282
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,483
Do not argue with me! Be quiet!

283
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:56,483
Now which was the last of you
to enter that room? Lydia?

284
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:01,733
She hasn't got a key,
I already told you that.

285
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:05,358
- Well, that leaves you, then.
- But I was in the hall all the time.

286
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:07,817
And then I went out into the garden.
You saw me with your own eyes.

287
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:10,733
I hope you are not suggesting
that was me!

288
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:15,692
Do you think that I would endanger
the life of my own daughter?

289
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:25,817
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

290
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:30,317
Oh really? And who is going
to tell mummy? You?

291
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,900
Or perhaps you?

292
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,858
Did you really see a boy?

293
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,692
Yes, he's called Victor.

294
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,900
- Is he a ghost?
- Don't be stupid.

295
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:55,025
- Ghosts aren't like that.
- What are they like?

296
00:24:55,233 --> 00:25:00,150
I've told you, they go about
in white sheets and carry chains.

297
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:02,942
- How do you know?
- I've seen them.

298
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,483
They come out at night.

299
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,567
Fibber! Where?

300
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,983
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

301
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,567
- I don't believe you saw that boy.
- Believe what you like.

302
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:23,567
You'll soon beg us to Play with you.

303
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:38,692
Nicholas. Nicholas.

304
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,567
What?

305
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,192
Look.

306
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,983
Why have you opened the curtains?

307
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:48,067
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it then?

308
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,942
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.

309
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:56,733
- Liar. I'm going to Tell mummy.
- So I'm a liar, am I?

310
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:02,983
Victor, come out from behind that
curtain so my brother can see you.

311
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,983
- Leave me alone.
- You don't want to see him now?

312
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,400
You're a cowardly custard!
Cowardly, Cowardly custard!

313
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:21,650
Cowardly, Cowardly custard!

314
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:26,067
I'll just have to do it Myself,
then.

315
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:44,942
That's enough, Victor!

316
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:52,525
Nicholas. Tell him to leave the
curtains alone. He won't listen.

317
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,733
Stop it! Get off my bed,
both of you!

318
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:58,400
- This is our bed.
- No, it's mine.

319
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:01,567
Anne, please stop putting on
that voice.

320
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:04,150
You be quiet, cowardly custard.

321
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:09,150
If you don't stop, I'll call my
mother and she'll kick you out.

322
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:13,025
- You don't know my mother!
- And you don't know my parents.

323
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,942
Anne, I'm going to tell mummy
about you.

324
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,775
Don't be stupid!
Can't you see it's not me?

325
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,733
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

326
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:36,192
Help! Mummy!

327
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:40,608
- Help! Mummy!
- What is it? What is it?

328
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:45,233
- What is it?
- She was frightening me...

329
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:49,942
...and I told her to be quiet and...
- I'm fed up! Do you hear me?

330
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,317
- I am fed up with you!
- I didn't do anything!

331
00:27:56,858 --> 00:28:01,775
"Therefore the Lord God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden...

332
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:04,442
to till the ground from whence
he was taken.

333
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,317
So he drove out the man:

334
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:09,775
And placed at the east of the
garden of Eden Cherubim's...

335
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:14,650
and a flaming sword to keep
the way of the tree of life."

336
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:17,483
There! I've finished.

337
00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:20,067
Very good.

338
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:25,108
Now you can ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

339
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:28,525
What? That's not what we agreed.

340
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,525
We didn't agree anything,
young lady.

341
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,150
Today you'll being punished.
You'll do as I say.

342
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:35,608
You can't make me ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

343
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:38,275
- How dare you?
- Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness...

344
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,942
for something I didn't do.

345
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,483
You told your brother that
there was someone else in the room!

346
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:43,942
- There was!
- You're lying!

347
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,900
I am not.

348
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:52,192
Anne, do you remember
the story about Justus and Pastor?

349
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:55,608
Children who don't tell the truth
end up in limbo.

350
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:58,567
That's what you say.
But I read the other day...

351
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:01,733
that limbo is only for children
who haven't been baptized.

352
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,817
And I have.

353
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:09,108
"And Abraham took the wood
of the burnt offering...

354
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:11,942
and laid it upon Isaac, his son.

355
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,192
And he took the fire in his hand...

356
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:18,317
and a knife; and they went
both of them together.

357
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:21,942
And Isaac speak unto Abraham
his father, and said...

358
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,317
My father: And he said,
Here am I, my son. And he..."

359
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:45,275
- Did you look in on Nicholas?
- Yes ma'am.

360
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,858
The little angel is fast asleep.

361
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:53,650
- And Anne? Still on the stairs?
- Oh yes, ma'am.

362
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:59,733
I'd prefer to see her, but I can't
embroider in such poor light.

363
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:06,733
How long is this punishment going
to go on? It's been three days now.

364
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:08,942
It's up to her.

365
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:14,317
She's got to learn to swallow
her pride and ask for forgiveness.

366
00:30:15,067 --> 00:30:17,650
Anyway, it's about time
she started to read the Bible.

367
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:24,025
- The priest will be very pleased.
- Lf he ever pay us another visit.

368
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:26,442
He knows perfectly well
the children can't go out.

369
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,233
He told me yesterday he'd be by,
as soon as possible.

370
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:34,275
I'm beginning to feel totally
cut off from the world.

371
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:39,192
And this fog doesn't exactly help.
It's never lasted this long before.

372
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,275
That's true, ma'am.

373
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:44,108
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

374
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,358
Anne! Anne, I can't hear you!

375
00:30:55,858 --> 00:30:59,317
Incidentally, I've had to put up with
the noise of Lydia running around...

376
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,942
above my head.
Hurtling backwards and forwards...

377
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,025
as if there were three people!

378
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:08,567
Tell her no to kick up quite such a
rumpus just to do a little cleaning.

379
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:13,358
- I couldn't bare a migraine attack.
- I'll tell her, ma'am.

380
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:15,858
Thank you.

381
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,317
Now she's really gone too far.

382
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:07,358
Lydia! Lydia!

383
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:30,400
"...in the mount of the Lord
it shall be seen.

384
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:33,192
- And the Angel of the Lord..."
- What's going on up there?

385
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,317
Nothing, mummy.
I'm just reading, Like you told me.

386
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:39,275
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

387
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:49,817
"And the Angel called unto Abraham
the second time, and said:

388
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:52,858
'By myself have I sworn,
saith the Lord'..."

389
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,358
- What was that?
- I don't know.

390
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:09,817
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise?

391
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:13,400
- I can't tell you, mummy.
- You tell me!

392
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:17,442
I told you there was someone
in the room and you punished me!

393
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,983
- Now I don't know what to say!
- Anne, I want the truth!

394
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:25,525
Tell me if there is someone
upstairs.

395
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:29,442
There. In that junk room.

396
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,108
Mummy, you're letting the light in!

397
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:18,150
She's here, she's here.

398
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,192
Mummy, she says she's here.

399
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,608
She's watching us.
She's watching us!

400
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:51,067
- Where did they go?
- They passed here. Didn't you see?

401
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,733
Which way did they go?

402
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:56,025
Over there, over there.
And down there, as well.

403
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:05,608
They're everywhere.
They say the house is theirs.

404
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:09,483
And they say they're going
to take the curtains down as well.

405
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:14,108
- Ma'am, stay calm please.
- I will not stay calm!

406
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,525
For five years I managed to avoid
a single Nazi entering this house!

407
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:22,275
And now there is someone here,
opening and closing the doors!

408
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,858
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

409
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,400
The floorboards squeak,
and the plumbing clanks and...

410
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:29,358
There were voices, I'm telling you.

411
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:30,650
- Mummy, look.
- A boy and two women...

412
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,108
...they were talking together.
- Mummy, look.

413
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:37,608
I did it yesterday.

414
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:42,942
This is the father, the mother,
Victor and this is the old woman.

415
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,317
- What do these numbers stand for?
- The number of times I've seen them.

416
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,817
I see the old woman the most.

417
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:56,067
God in Heaven!

418
00:36:56,275 --> 00:37:00,858
Call Mr. Tuttle. We have to search
the whole house before it gets dark.

419
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,442
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,817
- Mummy!
- Yes, darling. It's all right.

421
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:07,317
Nothing's going to happen to you
while mummy's here.

422
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,025
Look mummy, she really scares me.

423
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:13,900
It's as if she's not looking at you,
but she can see you.

424
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,108
And she's always around,
saying: "Come with me".

425
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:19,733
- Anne, don't lie to me!
- Honestly, mummy.

426
00:37:19,942 --> 00:37:23,650
And she asks me things.
Victor told me she's a witch.

427
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,817
- What does she ask you?
- Things.

428
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:31,608
Her breath smells.

429
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,942
We have to open all the curtains.

430
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,067
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

431
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:42,733
You both search the right side
and I'll take the left.

432
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,775
Then we'll search upstairs.

433
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:59,692
Perhaps they are ghosts who lived
in this house before and who...

434
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:02,192
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.

435
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,858
Ghosts go about in white sheets
and carry chains and go...

436
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:10,442
Anne, why do you make up
such stories?

437
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,692
I don't. I read them in books.

438
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:15,900
Well, you shouldn't believe
everything that you read in books.

439
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,733
That's what our mother says.

440
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:20,858
She says that all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish.

441
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,983
And then she expects us to believe
everything written in the Bible.

442
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:28,067
- And don't you believe it?
- I believe some things.

443
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,942
But, for example, I don't believe
God made the world in seven days.

444
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,317
And I don't believe that Noah
got all those animals into one boat.

445
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:39,650
Or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

446
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:43,442
- No, I don't believe that either.
- Doves are anything but holy.

447
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,400
They pooh on our windows.

448
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:55,608
Have you mentioned any
of this to your mother?

449
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:02,567
Ma'am?

450
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:08,025
They've searched everywhere.
There's no one.

451
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:10,108
I see.

452
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,108
Mrs. Mills?

453
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,233
Yes, ma'am?

454
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:19,900
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

455
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,150
- It is a photograph album, ma'am.
- No, they're all asleep.

456
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,817
Look.

457
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:29,858
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.

458
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,067
It's a book of the dead.

459
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:36,692
In the last century, they used
to take photographs of the dead...

460
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,983
in the hopes that their souls would
go on living through the portraits.

461
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,692
There are even group portraits.

462
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:50,358
And children!

463
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,858
It's macabre.

464
00:41:54,317 --> 00:41:56,983
How could these people
be so superstitious?

465
00:41:57,775 --> 00:42:03,525
Grief over the death can lead
people to do the strangest things.

466
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,525
- Get rid of it. I don't want it here.
- Yes, ma'am.

467
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,192
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.
Come and sit by the fire.

468
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,858
Thank you very much, ma'am.

469
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,733
So, tell me about when
you worked here before.

470
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:48,025
Did you have to look after
children then as well?

471
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:53,067
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

472
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:58,358
- Were there many servants?
- About 15.

473
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:03,567
- In the end there were just us 3.
- Why?

474
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:06,733
My employers moved to London.

475
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:12,358
They came here less and less,
it being so out of the way.

476
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:17,067
And so gradually the house
just became empty.

477
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:21,067
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

478
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:27,608
My family left in the summer
of 194O, just before the invasion.

479
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:32,108
That was the last time
I ever heard of them.

480
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,858
I don't blame them.

481
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:41,025
Actually, we left, too.

482
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,067
Although sometimes
when you leave a place...

483
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:50,608
it's like it's there with you,
all the time.

484
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:53,942
I always felt like
I never left this house.

485
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,067
Why did you leave?

486
00:43:56,442 --> 00:44:01,067
Because of the tuberculosis.
The whole area was evacuated.

487
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:09,650
- Was that when Lydia went dumb?
- Yes, I think so.

488
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:13,733
Though, you know, my memory
is a bit rusty these days.

489
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,483
What happened to her?

490
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,817
Well suddenly, one day,
she just stopped talking.

491
00:44:28,067 --> 00:44:30,400
There must have been a reason.

492
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,358
People don't just stop talking.

493
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:37,483
These things are always the result
of some sort of trauma.

494
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,608
Something must have
happened to her.

495
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:46,400
Did your employers treat you well?

496
00:44:46,608 --> 00:44:51,400
They were always very kind to us.
They treated us just like family.

497
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,442
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

498
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,567
I'll never be able to get up
in the morning.

499
00:44:59,817 --> 00:45:01,317
Off you go.

500
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,858
I'm going to stay here
awhile longer.

501
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:05,733
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:45:39,192 --> 00:45:42,692
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

503
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:51,858
Can you forgive me?

504
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,983
Anne.

505
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,983
- Mummy.
- What?

506
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,483
When's daddy coming home?

507
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:27,983
- When the war's over.
- Why did he go to war?

508
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:31,817
I mean, nobody's done
anything bad to us.

509
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:34,817
Daddy went...

510
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:40,692
Daddy went because he's very brave.

511
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:46,900
And because he wasn't prepared
to obey the Germans.

512
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:49,358
Why?

513
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:59,692
Charles...

514
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,900
where are you?

515
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:52,108
Mrs. Mills!

516
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:54,900
Mrs. Mills!

517
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:57,442
What's the matter, ma'am?

518
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,442
The key to the music room!
Give it to me! Quickly!

519
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,983
- What's happening?
- Come on!

520
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,608
My God!

521
00:50:17,525 --> 00:50:20,192
I checked that room myself.

522
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,983
It was empty.

523
00:50:24,192 --> 00:50:26,733
- Now take these tablets.
- And yet...

524
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:30,567
- They'll do you good.
...there was someone else there.

525
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,400
And it wasn't human.

526
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:38,733
There is something in this house.

527
00:50:39,025 --> 00:50:42,108
- Something diabolic.
- Ma'am!

528
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:44,942
Something which is not...

529
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:49,400
not at rest.

530
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:58,025
I know you don't believe it.
You don't believe it, do you?

531
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:03,817
No, I don't blame you.
I used to not believe these things.

532
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:07,650
I do believe it, ma'am.

533
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:15,858
I've always believed in those things.
They're not easy to explain...

534
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:17,650
but they do happen.

535
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:22,275
We've all heard stories
of the beyond...

536
00:51:22,525 --> 00:51:24,900
now and then.

537
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:28,275
And I think that, sometimes...

538
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:30,400
the world...

539
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:34,525
of the dead gets mixed up...

540
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:36,567
with the world of the living.

541
00:51:38,025 --> 00:51:41,775
But it's impossible! The Lord would
never allow such an aberration!

542
00:51:41,983 --> 00:51:45,483
The living and the dead will only
meet at the end of Eternity.

543
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:51,275
- It says so in the Bible.
- Ma'am...

544
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:56,358
there isn't always an answer
for everything.

545
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,525
Where are you off to, ma'am?

546
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:13,358
I'm going to the village
to pay Father legend a visit.

547
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:16,483
If he won't come here, then I Shall
go to him. And I'll bring him back.

548
00:52:16,692 --> 00:52:20,067
- Wait till the weather improves!
- I've waited long enough.

549
00:52:21,317 --> 00:52:25,108
- Ma'am, the priest told me...
- I don't care what he told you!

550
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:29,067
I want him to tell me, personally.
He must come today.

551
00:52:29,275 --> 00:52:33,692
- What are you going to tell him?
- We have searched the whole house...

552
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,817
and now I need it to be blessed.

553
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:42,483
- Please wait, it's still very early!
- Mr. Tuttle?

554
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:43,858
Good morning.

555
00:52:44,108 --> 00:52:47,400
- Search the garden for gravestones.
- Gravestones?

556
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:50,942
Yes, when we bought this house, they
said there was a little cemetery.

557
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,442
I think it was somewhere
over there, amongst the trees.

558
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,192
- I've not seen anything.
- Check carefully.

559
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:58,358
They could be overgrown.

560
00:52:58,567 --> 00:53:01,525
I need to know if there was
a family buried here.

561
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:04,400
And if they had a little boy,
Victor.

562
00:53:19,817 --> 00:53:22,733
Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

563
00:53:23,108 --> 00:53:25,692
Do you think it's safe
to let her go?

564
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,733
Don't worry.
The fog won't let her get very far.

565
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,900
Yes, the fog. The fog, of course.

566
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,983
And when do you think we should
bring all this out into the open?

567
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:42,692
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.
All in good time.

568
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,233
Speaking of which...

569
00:55:39,483 --> 00:55:41,483
Charles?

570
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:44,108
Grace.

571
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:59,983
You're here! You're here!

572
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,608
They said there was no hope.

573
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:05,900
They said I should
give you up for dead!

574
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:08,650
They say a lot of things.

575
00:56:13,692 --> 00:56:15,525
Thank you.

576
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:18,817
Thank you, God. Thank you.

577
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:21,858
Every night I've prayed for this...

578
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:24,817
begging God to bring you back.

579
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:28,650
To bring the children
their father back.

580
00:56:32,775 --> 00:56:35,775
But where have you been
all this time?

581
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:40,192
Out there, looking for my home.

582
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:50,525
You're so different.

583
00:56:50,858 --> 00:56:52,775
So different...

584
00:56:52,983 --> 00:56:55,775
Sometimes I bleed.

585
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:34,525
Ma'am.

586
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,400
Mrs. Mills...

587
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:42,025
this is my husband.

588
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,733
- I'm very Pleased to meet you, Sir.
- He's very weak.

589
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:56,775
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes...

590
00:57:57,817 --> 00:58:01,233
...and something to eat.
- Right away, ma'am.

591
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:23,108
How are my little ones?

592
00:58:25,025 --> 00:58:26,483
Daddy!

593
00:58:29,192 --> 00:58:31,858
Why did you take so long?

594
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:39,650
Hello, Nicholas.

595
00:58:39,858 --> 00:58:42,650
I told you, you see!
I told you he'd come back.

596
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:53,317
- Have you both been well behaved?
- We've been very good.

597
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,858
- Have you been good to your mother?
- Very good.

598
00:58:56,025 --> 00:58:58,650
We study everyday
for our First Communion.

599
00:58:59,692 --> 00:59:02,108
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

600
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,858
Here he comes.

601
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:17,358
Darling, we've prepared
lunch for you.

602
00:59:17,817 --> 00:59:20,942
Are you coming down
or would you prefer that...?

603
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:34,983
- When's daddy coming down?
- Be patient, Anne.

604
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:38,025
Daddy is not well.

605
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:40,692
He said he's seen lots of dead men.

606
00:59:45,275 --> 00:59:48,817
Mummy, when people die in the war,
where do they go?

607
00:59:49,025 --> 00:59:52,650
What a question! It depends.

608
00:59:53,525 --> 00:59:55,567
- On what?
- Well...

609
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,775
on whether they fought on the side
of the "goodies" or the "baddies".

610
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:02,858
Your father, for example,
fought for England, the "goodies".

611
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,733
How do you know who the "goodies"
and the "baddies" are?

612
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:12,067
That's enough questions. Eat your
food. You'll never go to war.

613
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,233
We'll never go anywhere.

614
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:19,692
You're not missing anything.

615
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,192
You're better at home with mummy
and daddy, who I've you very much.

616
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,483
And the intruders.

617
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,733
There are no intruders here.

618
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:33,900
But you said that there were.

619
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:37,275
I said there are no intruders here.
And I don't want to hear about it.

620
01:00:37,483 --> 01:00:40,025
- But you said...
- No, that is enough!

621
01:00:40,733 --> 01:00:42,858
- Can I say something?
- No!

622
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:46,192
- Why not?
- Because... because you can't!

623
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,567
Anne, stop breathing like that.

624
01:00:57,067 --> 01:00:59,025
You heard me. Stop it!

625
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,858
Stop breathing!

626
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,817
Right, you go to your room.

627
01:01:08,025 --> 01:01:10,733
Go to your room.
There's no dessert for you today.

628
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:20,067
No crying now. No crying.

629
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:22,442
Stop that. Here.

630
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:25,192
Look what an awful face
you've got when you cry!

631
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,858
- I don't care!
- There, there.

632
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,067
You listen to me.

633
01:01:32,942 --> 01:01:34,900
I've seen them, too.

634
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,858
You have?

635
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:42,358
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

636
01:01:42,567 --> 01:01:45,900
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

637
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,942
She only believes
in what she was taught.

638
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:52,817
But don't worry.
Sooner or later...

639
01:01:53,817 --> 01:01:55,858
she'll see them.

640
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:59,692
- And everything will be different.
- How?

641
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:07,067
You'll see. There are going
to be some big surprises.

642
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,692
There are going to be... changes.

643
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:14,067
Changes?

644
01:02:25,317 --> 01:02:28,775
Now she is behaving
as if nothing had happened.

645
01:02:29,983 --> 01:02:34,233
- What about her daughter?
- She's not so stubborn.

646
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,025
The children will be easier
to convince.

647
01:02:38,108 --> 01:02:41,442
No, it's the mother who is going
to cause us problems.

648
01:02:42,942 --> 01:02:45,983
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

649
01:02:47,108 --> 01:02:51,650
No, I don't think he even knows
where he is.

650
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:10,233
Look what a pretty daughter
I've got.

651
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:15,608
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

652
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:19,442
I look like a bride.

653
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:24,067
Yes, you do.

654
01:03:28,233 --> 01:03:30,775
Now I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

655
01:03:31,025 --> 01:03:32,192
You can take it off now.

656
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,900
- This dress has to be spotless.
- I promise I won't dirty it.

657
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:41,567
- Let me wear it just a little.
- "Just a little."

658
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,108
All right. I'll be back shortly.

659
01:03:47,442 --> 01:03:49,983
No sitting on the floor.
No leaning against the walls!

660
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:10,233
Monsieur, would you like to dance?

661
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:15,442
I'd I've to.

662
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,775
Charles, you can't go on like this.
You must eat something.

663
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,650
In the sky

664
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:12,233
I don't know if it's cloudy
or bright

665
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,983
because I only have eyes

666
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:22,358
for you, dear

667
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:26,858
The moon maybe high

668
01:05:58,817 --> 01:06:01,483
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now!

669
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:07,483
Anne, are you listening to me?

670
01:06:09,442 --> 01:06:11,108
Anne?

671
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,192
- I told you not to sit on the floor!
- But it's clean.

672
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,817
It makes no difference.
Why can't you do as you're told?

673
01:06:47,025 --> 01:06:50,525
- What's the matter?
- Where is my daughter?

674
01:06:54,192 --> 01:06:56,108
What have you done
with my daughter?

675
01:06:56,317 --> 01:06:59,442
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

676
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,442
You're not my daughter!

677
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,817
You're not my daughter!

678
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:28,150
- Ma'am, I heard shouts...
- She wants to kill me!

679
01:07:28,442 --> 01:07:30,442
She won't stop until she kills us!

680
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,358
She won't stop!
She won't stop until she kills us!

681
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:36,900
- Hush, child. Come with me.
- You're wicked! You're wicked!

682
01:07:37,983 --> 01:07:39,608
Wicked!

683
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,442
How is she?

684
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:55,733
There's no calming her
so I've left her with her father.

685
01:07:56,608 --> 01:07:59,192
She insisted on speaking with him.

686
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:07,442
- What happened? Why did you fight?
- It wasn't her.

687
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:11,608
It was the old woman,
with the strange eyes.

688
01:08:11,817 --> 01:08:13,942
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

689
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:17,400
I'd swear to God that
it wasn't my daughter.

690
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:23,150
God. God Help me.

691
01:08:24,108 --> 01:08:29,525
What's the matter with me? I don't
know what's the matter with me.

692
01:08:30,192 --> 01:08:32,733
You must get more rest.

693
01:08:34,608 --> 01:08:38,858
You can't take on all the
responsibility of this house.

694
01:08:39,358 --> 01:08:43,150
Leave it to us.
We know what has to be done.

695
01:08:46,525 --> 01:08:49,358
What do you mean by that?

696
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:53,692
- How you know what has to be done?
- Nothing, I was just suggesting...

697
01:08:53,858 --> 01:08:55,900
There's nothing to suggest!

698
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,233
Who do you think you are! You have
no idea what has to be done!

699
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:07,317
Or do you?

700
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,817
What are these?

701
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:17,942
The tablets for your migraine.

702
01:09:18,692 --> 01:09:21,275
The ones you always take.

703
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:23,817
Please, I need to be on my own.

704
01:09:25,192 --> 01:09:27,650
Yes, ma'am.

705
01:09:50,025 --> 01:09:52,358
Come, on child.

706
01:10:14,858 --> 01:10:17,192
Anne told me everything.

707
01:10:23,192 --> 01:10:25,983
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven't.

708
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:30,275
At first I thought there was someone
else here, maybe ghosts.

709
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:32,858
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

710
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,275
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

711
01:10:43,608 --> 01:10:47,150
- I don't know what you mean.
- Tell me is not true.

712
01:10:47,483 --> 01:10:49,358
Tell me what happened.

713
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:52,358
Happened?

714
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,733
I don't know what
came over me that day.

715
01:11:02,192 --> 01:11:04,692
The servants had left
during the night.

716
01:11:05,192 --> 01:11:08,233
They hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

717
01:11:10,275 --> 01:11:15,775
And they knew that
I couldn't leave the house.

718
01:11:16,733 --> 01:11:18,817
They knew.

719
01:11:21,442 --> 01:11:23,067
Anne?

720
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:27,358
Anne, what happened?

721
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:34,525
She hit me. She went mad...
like she did that day.

722
01:11:35,108 --> 01:11:37,275
Do you remember?

723
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:40,192
No.

724
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,358
You must forgive me, Charles.

725
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:49,233
Not me. The children.

726
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:52,567
They know that I I've them.

727
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:57,525
They know I'd never hurt them.
I'd die first.

728
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,275
What are you going to do?

729
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,650
Are you angry with me?

730
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,650
I came back to say goodbye to my
wife and children. Now I must go.

731
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:17,692
Go where?

732
01:12:18,983 --> 01:12:22,025
- To the front.
- The war's over.

733
01:12:23,483 --> 01:12:27,150
- The war is not over.
- What are you talking about?

734
01:12:28,608 --> 01:12:32,775
You're not going, do you hear me?
You left us once. You can't go!

735
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:35,608
Why?

736
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:40,608
Why did you go to that stupid war
that had nothing to do with us?

737
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:45,025
- Why didn't you stay like the others?
- The others surrendered.

738
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:50,067
We all surrendered!
The whole island was occupied!

739
01:12:50,858 --> 01:12:53,358
What did you expect?

740
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:00,983
What were you trying to prove
by going to war?

741
01:13:01,192 --> 01:13:03,775
Your place was here, with us.

742
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:07,650
With your family.

743
01:13:13,192 --> 01:13:15,442
I loved you.

744
01:13:16,608 --> 01:13:19,108
And that was enough for me.

745
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:23,067
Living in this darkness...

746
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,025
in this prison.

747
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:35,150
But not for you.
I wasn't enough for you.

748
01:13:35,692 --> 01:13:38,275
That's why you left.

749
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,025
It wasn't just the war.

750
01:13:45,358 --> 01:13:48,483
You want to leave me, don't you?

751
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:41,233
Forgive me, Grace.

752
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,275
Anne!

753
01:15:57,317 --> 01:15:59,233
Nicholas!

754
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:10,775
What?

755
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:18,608
My God!

756
01:16:18,817 --> 01:16:20,942
Wait! My God!

757
01:16:41,317 --> 01:16:42,983
Where are the curtains?

758
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:50,317
Mrs. Mills!

759
01:17:05,025 --> 01:17:07,775
Let me see it, let me see it.

760
01:17:08,192 --> 01:17:11,067
Are you all right?

761
01:17:11,483 --> 01:17:13,567
I want my daddy.

762
01:17:18,733 --> 01:17:20,400
Daddy's gone.

763
01:17:20,608 --> 01:17:22,358
It's not true!

764
01:17:22,567 --> 01:17:24,275
Yes, it is!

765
01:17:25,275 --> 01:17:27,233
It is true.

766
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:31,525
I I've you, mummy.

767
01:17:39,108 --> 01:17:41,483
Find the curtains.

768
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:47,483
Who was it? Who did this?

769
01:17:47,692 --> 01:17:50,733
Tell me! Tell me!

770
01:17:52,608 --> 01:17:54,275
You know what's happening here.

771
01:17:54,483 --> 01:17:58,108
You know because it happened
to you, too! Now tell me!

772
01:17:58,775 --> 01:18:00,358
Write it down.

773
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:02,858
Write it down. Please.

774
01:18:03,067 --> 01:18:05,983
That attitude won't solve
anything, ma'am.

775
01:18:07,525 --> 01:18:09,317
And anyway she can't write.

776
01:18:09,525 --> 01:18:10,983
- Where are they?
- What?

777
01:18:11,192 --> 01:18:12,775
The curtains!

778
01:18:12,983 --> 01:18:16,858
Someone has taken the curtains
my children's lives depend on!

779
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:20,942
I have noticed, there's no need
for you to raise your voice.

780
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,483
Mr. Tuttle, I was just
on the point of calling you.

781
01:18:25,692 --> 01:18:28,817
Did you know someone's
taken all the curtains?

782
01:18:30,108 --> 01:18:34,442
The curtains? Oh, dear.

783
01:18:35,108 --> 01:18:38,275
Why should anyone want
to take all the curtains?

784
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,233
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

785
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,400
Daylight. Of course.

786
01:18:45,858 --> 01:18:50,775
- Someone wants to kill my children!
- And the Daylight would kill them?

787
01:18:52,317 --> 01:18:54,275
Are you mad?

788
01:18:54,858 --> 01:18:56,650
I told you.

789
01:18:57,317 --> 01:19:01,775
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them

790
01:19:01,983 --> 01:19:04,733
Yes, but that was before.

791
01:19:04,942 --> 01:19:07,358
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

792
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:11,900
If you never expose them to light,
how do you know they're not cured?

793
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:16,650
My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheumatism...

794
01:19:16,858 --> 01:19:18,983
in her legs and back.

795
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:21,567
Then one fine day...

796
01:19:23,275 --> 01:19:25,192
they disappeared.

797
01:19:26,858 --> 01:19:28,858
I'm going to find those curtains...

798
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:32,400
and after you Help me hang them,
you will leave this house.

799
01:19:46,358 --> 01:19:51,025
What about the master? What does
he have to say about all this?

800
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:55,692
Give me your keys.
I want your keys, now.

801
01:20:00,025 --> 01:20:02,233
I know what you want.

802
01:20:02,442 --> 01:20:05,192
You want to frighten us,
to get us out, me and my children.

803
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,650
You've wanted to take over this
house ever since you arrived.

804
01:20:09,525 --> 01:20:13,358
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

805
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:17,983
- Try and calm down, ma'am.
- Give me the keys!

806
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,525
Give them to me!

807
01:20:27,275 --> 01:20:29,525
And now, get out of here.

808
01:20:47,067 --> 01:20:49,650
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

809
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:54,358
I think I've reached the end
of my tether. What about you?

810
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:59,358
Oh, yes, definitely.

811
01:21:00,317 --> 01:21:03,317
We'd better go and
uncover the gravestones.

812
01:21:42,317 --> 01:21:46,067
- What's mummy doing?
- I've told you. She's gone mad.

813
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:48,233
- Liar.
- She's gone mad.

814
01:21:48,442 --> 01:21:49,442
Liar!

815
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:52,192
- She's gone mad. She's gone mad!
- Liar! Liar!

816
01:21:58,108 --> 01:21:59,942
Night time.

817
01:22:01,233 --> 01:22:04,192
- Where are you going?
- I've had enough.

818
01:22:06,108 --> 01:22:09,525
- I'm going to look for daddy.
- Are you going to run away?

819
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:15,858
If I hang on to the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

820
01:22:16,067 --> 01:22:17,733
It's very easy.

821
01:22:31,608 --> 01:22:34,275
If mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

822
01:22:45,775 --> 01:22:47,983
Anne, wait!

823
01:22:48,358 --> 01:22:50,275
I want to come and
Look for daddy, too.

824
01:22:50,442 --> 01:22:53,567
Liar, you just don't want
to be left on your own.

825
01:22:53,775 --> 01:22:56,525
- Scaredypants, scaredypants!
- Be quiet!

826
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,692
Anne, I think we've gotten lost.

827
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,317
We still haven't left
the garden yet, silly.

828
01:23:56,108 --> 01:23:59,233
- I'm scared.
- You shouldn't have come, then.

829
01:24:03,025 --> 01:24:06,275
- Say something.
- What Shall I say?

830
01:24:06,483 --> 01:24:08,692
I don't know. Anything.

831
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,358
Let's see. My name's Anne
and I'm walking.

832
01:24:11,567 --> 01:24:13,775
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

833
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,900
What's that over there?

834
01:24:44,483 --> 01:24:46,942
I think they're graves.

835
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:51,025
- Don't go near.
- Why not?

836
01:24:51,608 --> 01:24:53,317
What if a ghost jumps out?

837
01:24:53,483 --> 01:24:56,650
Graves don't have ghosts.
Only skeletons.

838
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,317
- There's something written here.
- Let's go.

839
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:18,067
Wait.

840
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:43,983
Anne, what does it say?

841
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:55,775
- You must be strong now, children.
- Nicholas, come here!

842
01:25:56,817 --> 01:25:59,858
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell mummy
we've run away.

843
01:26:00,067 --> 01:26:01,983
Don't speak to them!

844
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,692
- Why?
- They're dead.

845
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:07,692
- What?
- They're ghosts! Please come here!

846
01:26:08,317 --> 01:26:09,858
Children...

847
01:26:10,233 --> 01:26:11,942
Nicholas!

848
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:16,483
If they're ghosts, why aren't they
wearing sheets and clanking chains?

849
01:26:16,692 --> 01:26:19,942
- You said that...
- I don't care! Get away from them!

850
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:24,192
You're always teasing me and
telling lies, and I'm sick of it.

851
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:28,608
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth! Come here!

852
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,608
Wait!

853
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,733
Children!

854
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:47,317
Run! Run!

855
01:26:48,317 --> 01:26:50,442
Run! Into the house!

856
01:26:52,942 --> 01:26:56,900
Don't come any closer!
Don't move!

857
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:06,775
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.
Tuberculosis finished us off...

858
01:27:07,108 --> 01:27:09,317
more than half a century ago.

859
01:27:29,775 --> 01:27:31,942
Go away!

860
01:27:37,192 --> 01:27:38,817
Open the door, ma'am, please.

861
01:27:39,067 --> 01:27:43,150
- What do you want?
- Mummy, don't open the door!

862
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,067
- We've seen their graves.
- Go upstairs and hide.

863
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,067
- Go on!
- I'm scared.

864
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:57,650
Don't separate.

865
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,983
Anne!

866
01:28:04,817 --> 01:28:07,692
Whatever you do, don't separate.

867
01:28:08,358 --> 01:28:11,733
Go hide. Go!

868
01:28:12,442 --> 01:28:15,483
We've been trying
to make you understand.

869
01:28:17,775 --> 01:28:21,108
- Understand what?
- About the house.

870
01:28:21,317 --> 01:28:23,858
About the new situation.

871
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:25,775
What situation?

872
01:28:26,525 --> 01:28:32,400
We must all learn to live together.
The living and the dead.

873
01:28:33,442 --> 01:28:36,983
If you're dead, leave us in peace!

874
01:28:37,858 --> 01:28:39,567
Leave us in peace!

875
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,733
Leave us in peace!

876
01:28:48,067 --> 01:28:50,025
In here. Get inside.

877
01:28:56,067 --> 01:29:00,525
And suppose we do leave you,
do you think they will?

878
01:29:00,942 --> 01:29:03,733
- Who?
- The intruders.

879
01:29:04,442 --> 01:29:07,150
- There are no intruders.
- They took the curtains down.

880
01:29:07,358 --> 01:29:10,733
- There are no intruders.
- Yes, I assure you it was them.

881
01:29:11,525 --> 01:29:15,858
And now they're in there,
with you and the children.

882
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:17,650
Waiting for you!

883
01:29:19,233 --> 01:29:24,483
And believe me, sooner or later
they'll find you.

884
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:27,317
Listen, wait here and
I'll be back in a minute.

885
01:29:27,692 --> 01:29:29,900
Mummy said we shouldn't separate.

886
01:29:30,192 --> 01:29:32,775
I can't leave her on her own!

887
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:39,025
Stop breathing like that.

888
01:29:46,358 --> 01:29:48,900
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.

889
01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:53,442
Stop breathing!

890
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:59,608
Can't you hear it?
There's someone there.

891
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:05,650
Come with us... children.

892
01:30:06,108 --> 01:30:08,150
Come with us.

893
01:30:15,108 --> 01:30:16,817
Nicholas?

894
01:30:18,942 --> 01:30:20,858
Anne?

895
01:30:23,025 --> 01:30:24,983
Where are you?

896
01:30:27,733 --> 01:30:29,233
Answer me!

897
01:30:29,442 --> 01:30:33,525
- The intruders have found them.
- There's nothing we can do now.

898
01:30:33,983 --> 01:30:38,358
You'll have to go upstairs
and talk to them.

899
01:30:56,108 --> 01:30:59,108
Our Father, who art in heaven...

900
01:30:59,317 --> 01:31:03,192
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come.

901
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:07,483
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

902
01:31:08,358 --> 01:31:12,650
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

903
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,317
Why are you afraid, children?

904
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:21,942
Why don't you want us
to be your friends?

905
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:23,858
Come on.

906
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:26,983
Come on, speak to us.

907
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:30,025
Speak to us.

908
01:31:34,067 --> 01:31:37,775
Tell me what happened.

909
01:31:38,983 --> 01:31:41,608
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

910
01:31:42,067 --> 01:31:45,650
"Don't tell her."

911
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,525
If I tell her,
they'll leave us in peace.

912
01:31:51,025 --> 01:31:53,025
Mummy!

913
01:31:54,192 --> 01:31:56,067
"Mummy."

914
01:31:56,233 --> 01:32:02,900
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?

915
01:32:03,358 --> 01:32:07,067
What did your mother do to you?

916
01:32:18,608 --> 01:32:20,942
Something about a pillow...

917
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:24,067
Is that how she killed you?

918
01:32:25,233 --> 01:32:26,650
With a pillow?

919
01:32:26,858 --> 01:32:29,900
- She didn't kill us.
- Children, if you're dead...

920
01:32:30,233 --> 01:32:32,817
why do you remain in this house?

921
01:32:33,025 --> 01:32:34,567
We're not dead!

922
01:32:35,525 --> 01:32:39,275
- Why do you remain in this house?
- We're not dead!

923
01:32:39,483 --> 01:32:41,400
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

924
01:32:41,608 --> 01:32:44,150
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

925
01:32:44,358 --> 01:32:46,358
Why do you remain in this house?

926
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,150
"We're not dead, we're not dead."

927
01:32:50,358 --> 01:32:52,942
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

928
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,692
We're not dead!

929
01:32:55,775 --> 01:32:58,733
We're not dead!
We're not... dead!

930
01:33:14,192 --> 01:33:15,733
Are you all right?

931
01:33:17,608 --> 01:33:20,483
Yes, just a bit dizzy. That's all.

932
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,400
What happened?

933
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:28,275
- They made contact.
- All three?

934
01:33:28,483 --> 01:33:33,733
Apparently, yes.
The mother and the two children.

935
01:33:35,108 --> 01:33:37,108
Quite interesting, don't you think?

936
01:33:37,317 --> 01:33:40,483
Interesting?
I was scared out of my wits!

937
01:33:40,692 --> 01:33:42,275
Darling, calm down.

938
01:33:42,775 --> 01:33:46,817
So far we have handled this
your way. But now you listen to me.

939
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:49,400
We can't possibly stay
in this house any longer.

940
01:33:49,608 --> 01:33:52,567
It is quite clear that these "beings"
do not want us to live here.

941
01:33:52,775 --> 01:33:55,150
- We don't know about them yet.
- Yes, we do.

942
01:33:56,317 --> 01:34:01,067
The woman went mad, smothered her
two children and then shot herself.

943
01:34:01,275 --> 01:34:05,442
- That's enough. Think of our son.
- There's nothing wrong with Victor.

944
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:10,275
Yes, there is! He has nightmares,
he says he has seen that girl.

945
01:34:10,483 --> 01:34:12,942
And even this lady
has been possessed by her.

946
01:34:13,275 --> 01:34:15,983
Please, let us leave this house.

947
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:20,483
All right.
We will leave tomorrow morning.

948
01:34:21,192 --> 01:34:23,317
Thank God for that.

949
01:34:25,025 --> 01:34:26,942
I'll just go and check on Victor.

950
01:34:30,275 --> 01:34:32,400
Once again,
thank you so much for coming.

951
01:34:32,608 --> 01:34:35,067
A pleasure.
I hope we've been of some Help.

952
01:34:35,275 --> 01:34:39,150
Yes, of course, but I admit that was
not the most pleasant evening...

953
01:34:42,108 --> 01:34:44,858
At first I couldn't understand...

954
01:34:46,442 --> 01:34:49,817
what the pillow was doing
in my hands...

955
01:34:52,108 --> 01:34:54,608
and why you didn't move.

956
01:34:58,858 --> 01:35:01,400
But then I knew.

957
01:35:03,775 --> 01:35:06,192
It had happened.

958
01:35:09,567 --> 01:35:12,400
I had killed my children.

959
01:35:18,442 --> 01:35:20,775
I got the rifle...

960
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:24,942
I put it to my forehead...

961
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,233
and I pulled the trigger.

962
01:35:35,608 --> 01:35:37,442
Nothing.

963
01:35:44,442 --> 01:35:47,900
And then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

964
01:35:51,775 --> 01:35:55,692
You were playing with the pillows,
as if nothing had happened.

965
01:35:58,108 --> 01:35:59,942
And I thought...

966
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:04,483
the Lord, in his great mercy...

967
01:36:04,775 --> 01:36:09,150
was giving me another chance...

968
01:36:10,608 --> 01:36:12,275
telling me...

969
01:36:13,358 --> 01:36:15,400
"Don't give up...

970
01:36:18,108 --> 01:36:20,067
be strong...

971
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:24,275
be a good mother...

972
01:36:25,775 --> 01:36:27,983
for them."

973
01:36:31,317 --> 01:36:33,442
But now...

974
01:36:36,317 --> 01:36:38,150
Now...

975
01:36:41,317 --> 01:36:43,692
what does all this mean?

976
01:36:47,817 --> 01:36:50,025
Where are we?

977
01:36:51,067 --> 01:36:53,483
Young Lydia asked
the very same thing...

978
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:57,358
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

979
01:36:58,483 --> 01:37:01,817
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

980
01:37:04,067 --> 01:37:06,775
But I couldn't tell you that
before now.

981
01:37:11,567 --> 01:37:15,067
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea,
ma'am?

982
01:37:18,775 --> 01:37:22,983
The intruders are leaving,
but others will come.

983
01:37:23,192 --> 01:37:28,358
Now, sometimes we'll sense them
and other times we won't.

984
01:37:29,317 --> 01:37:32,567
But that's the way
it's always been...

985
01:37:34,358 --> 01:37:36,650
ma'am.

986
01:37:40,192 --> 01:37:41,942
Mummy?

987
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:45,108
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?

988
01:37:46,442 --> 01:37:51,275
- Will we ever see him again?
- I don't know.

989
01:37:52,067 --> 01:37:56,442
If we're dead, where's limbo?

990
01:37:59,942 --> 01:38:03,525
I don't know
if there even is a limbo.

991
01:38:05,608 --> 01:38:08,608
I'm no wiser than you are.

992
01:38:10,692 --> 01:38:13,650
But I do know that I I've you.

993
01:38:14,692 --> 01:38:18,025
I've always loved you.

994
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:23,733
And this house is ours.

995
01:38:24,608 --> 01:38:26,608
You say with me:

996
01:38:27,775 --> 01:38:30,275
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

997
01:38:30,483 --> 01:38:32,817
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

998
01:38:32,983 --> 01:38:36,067
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

999
01:38:53,608 --> 01:38:57,025
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1000
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:11,067
No one can make us
leave this house.

1001
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,567
Come a long, Victor.
