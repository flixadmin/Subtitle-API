1
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,825
A house of ghosts, Khaleesi. lt is known.

2
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,718
Where are the guards?

3
00:34:55,802 --> 00:35:01,348
No guards.
The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.

4
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,560
Let them try.

5
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,823
Moon of my life.

6
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:21,588
This is dark magic, like the magic
that took you from me.

7
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,467
Took you from me before l could even...

8
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:31,389
Maybe l am dead and l just don't know it yet.

9
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,768
Maybe l am with you in the Night Lands.

10
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:39,564
Or maybe l refused to enter the Night Lands
without you.

11
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:45,946
Maybe l told the Great Stallion to go fuck
himself and came back here to wait for you.

12
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,533
That sounds like something you would do.

13
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:04,589
Or maybe it is a dream.
Your dream, my dream...

14
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,466
...l do not know.

15
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,596
These are questions
for wise men with skinny arms.

16
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,018
You are the moon of my life.

17
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,896
That is all l know...

18
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,983
...and all l need to know.

19
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,654
And if this is a dream...

20
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:32,784
...l will kill the man who tries to wake me.

21
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:53,136
Take all the gold and jewels.
