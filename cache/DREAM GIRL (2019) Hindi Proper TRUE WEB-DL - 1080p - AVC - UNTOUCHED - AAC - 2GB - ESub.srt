1
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,776
- Please.. Please..for my sake..
- No, I won't do it.

2
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,200
Please..Karam..
Listen.. Just listen to me once..

3
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
Bro, I have failed again.

4
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,696
And the teacher has asked to speak with
my mother. Please help me out here.

5
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,416
- I won't.
- You can take my chocolates too.

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,040
Please..

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,240
- Seriously?
- Yes..

8
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Okay, fine.

9
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Hello Sir..
Smiley speaking, sir.

10
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,320
The one
who failed the tests miserably.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Sir please talk to my mother.

12
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Yes..

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Hello, sir.

14
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
What? He failed again.

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,080
Nothing to worry.
He will do better next year.

16
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,480
He's a Punjabi boy after all.

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
Even if he fails again,
there is nothing to worry about..

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,960
We will sell a plot
and release his music album.

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,840
Fine. I'll hang up the phone now.

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
You're not dressed up yet!

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,040
All the other characters
are completely ready!

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
I am not going to play Sita.

23
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
I've told you before..

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
I can play Hanuman or Ram..

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,600
But you are stuck only at Sita.

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,800
Make him Sita instead.

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,560
Huh.. Punjabi Sita.

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
Never.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
You know how to mimic
a girls voice not me.

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,040
- Please..
- Stop. Stop..

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,720
Please don't say like this.

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,600
One last time.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
Promise?

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Swear on God.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,176
I am not going to play Sita.
I've been saying it for years now.

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,280
Don't say that.
Just one last time play Sita.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
Next time we'll manage
Ram Leela without Sita.

38
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,520
- Take it.
- Never.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,560
Jambwant, Neel, Jatayu, I am
willing to do anything. But not Sita.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,120
Brother. Mother Sita
is nowhere to be seen.

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Ohh..

42
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,920
People don't come to see you,
but to hear your voice.

43
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,920
And all these rewards that you get..

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
You will get them
as long as you play Sita.

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,560
And not otherwise. Understood?

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,840
- Sita.
- Mother..

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,720
- Sita!
- Mother..

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,520
- Mom, when will mother Sita show up?
- Soon, son.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,360
Here. Ask Jatayu to put
this on and get ready as Sita.

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
Wait. Bring it here.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Will you do it.

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
- Only till I get a job.
- Take this.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,920
- Sita!
- Mother..

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Lord..

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
Mother Sita has arrived.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Lord!

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,280
Lord, you are back!

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,240
- Glory to..
- Mother Sita!

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Once more! Once more!

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
Mr. Jagjeet..

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
Mr. Jagjeet!

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
Yes tell me, What all do you want?

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
Incense sticks? Urn? Sandalwood?

64
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,880
Instalments!

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Instalments?

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,360
How useless can you be?

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,560
This is no place
to ask for instalments.

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
- Instalment of bank loan.
- Which bank loan?

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,896
The loan that you
borrowed from the bank.

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,560
I've borrowed money from six banks.

71
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,776
The bank where you haven't
paid the last three instalments.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,280
But I haven't paid back three banks.

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,560
The bank where you mortgaged
your home as collateral.

74
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,800
So be more specific, Mr. Mithilesh.

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,336
How else do you expect me to say it?

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
Every time when I come here,
you refuse to recognize me.

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,640
Why don't you pay
your instalments on time?

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,240
You know what, Mithilesh,
come back day-after-tomorrow.

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
- Day-after-tomorrow?
- Yes.

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
Fine.

81
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,816
But the day after tomorrow is a Sunday.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,920
What?
Day-after-tomorrow is Sunday?

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
How can this happen?

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,120
Then come back on Monday.

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,240
- Sure?
- Sure.

86
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,480
Can I pack something
for your family?

87
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
You are offering as if
you own a sweet shop.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,080
- Brother, Radhe-Shyam.
- Radhe-Radhe..

89
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey Karam..how about a selfie?

90
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
Thank you bro!

91
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Radhe-Radhe, Karam brother.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
Take mother Sita's blessings.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,640
- It's his first day at the school.
- God Bless you.

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
Greetings, mother Sita.

95
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,680
What an amazing son,
and look at the father.

96
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,720
Mithilesh. Ride your scooter carefully.

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,080
Or it may happen that I'll wait
your money and you may never show up.

98
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,440
Finally, you are awake, Mother Sita.

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,920
Here are 11,500 rupees.
Go buy yourself a new mobile phone.

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Your mother has put in so many
prayers to have you.

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,280
But you keep on playing female
characters in your plays.

102
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,640
Portraying the character of Sita
in Ramleela or Radha in Krishnaleela.

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,320
I don't care if you dress up as
one of the supporting male characters..

104
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,440
But at least it
will make me very happy.

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,616
I wonder what your mother would
have said if she was still alive.

106
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,720
Even she was a female.

107
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,440
But you are a male.

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Do you have any idea
how much debt I am under?

109
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,696
This home's mortgaged, the shop's
mortgaged, in fact, even I am mortgaged.

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,736
Except the blood bank you've
borrowed money from every bank.

111
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,880
Well, son,
borrowing money is not my hobby.

112
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,136
I don't like to go around
borrowing money for a pastime.

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,696
If you find a job, then only
will we be able to clear all the debts.

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
Yes. I am trying.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,776
In fact,
I've given so many interviews..

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,536
That if now anyone asks for
directions, I narrate my entire resume.

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,920
The results will be declared today.
I know I'll get the job.

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,640
I sure wish you do, son.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
And listen..

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
Don't forget to wash your face first.

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Doesn't look nice if mother
Sita keeps failing all the time.

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
Get off at the next stop.

123
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,240
Hey Karam?
Did you go to check your result?

124
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
Did you get the job?

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,696
Yeah..they want me to replace
Trump in the White House.

126
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,496
- Now take this bus tot he White House.
- Meaning no luck this time either.

127
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,840
Just give me the ticket.

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,400
Gokul-Mathura. Gokul-Mathura.

129
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
Anybody want ticket.

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,840
Give change.

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,680
- Please sit.
- No, I am absolutely fine.

132
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
All I do is sit at home all day.

133
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
- Sit.
- Yes.

134
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,520
Thank you, brother.

135
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
How many ticket you want?

136
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
'Salary 70,000 per month!'

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,120
These people always
litter government buses.

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
- Driver, stop the bus!
- What happened?

139
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,840
700...?

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
Demoted even before
I started the job.

141
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,880
Brother, where is 39-40?

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,240
Hey, ..this way.

143
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,120
Down here. Come down.

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
Hello. Coming.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
Come.

146
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,560
Here you go. Now fix it.

147
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,200
- 70,000 rupees for fixing this.
- 70,000?

148
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,520
Fine. Come down and collect the cash.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,800
And listen..

150
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,680
Don't feel embarassed if you
need anything else, Gunjan.

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600
Okay. Okay..

152
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes.. Is the inverter fixed?

153
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,840
He wants 70,000 rupees
for fixing the inverter.

154
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,456
I just went to the
washroom for two minutes..

155
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,056
And inflation broke all the barriers.

156
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Sir.. not that.
This..

157
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,720
So you are not the service person?

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
- I came for the interview.
- Interview?

159
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,840
- Yes sir.
- But we don't have any job for you.

160
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,536
Sir, I have a first class degree
even when I am a middle-class person

161
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,520
I've done my Bachelors
as well as Masters in Arts,

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Even Masters in Philosophy.
Take a look.

163
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,520
Please..
I even know Croatia work.

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,136
I can make a dancing
peacock on a sweater.

165
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,720
Anything except for getting pregnant.

166
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
Please give me one chance.

167
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,680
- To get pregnant?
- To work.

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,200
Listen brother..we don't
want any peacocks to dance here.

169
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,320
- Please leave. Here you go..
- Please, sir..

170
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,280
- He's so importunate.
- I'll do it, sir.

171
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,816
- I said we don't have a job for you.
- I'll do it, sir.

172
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,096
- I said we don't have a job for you.
- I'll do anything..

173
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,960
- We don't have a job for you.
- I will do anything sir.

174
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,680
I will do it, sir.

175
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,016
Please sir..
I will do it, sir.

176
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Come on.

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,120
It's bathroom. What kind of job, sir?

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Come, let me show you.

179
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,240
See..See..take a good look.

180
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,400
I don't want a girl, I want a job.

181
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
I am not showing you the girl.

182
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
- Then?
- Come here.

183
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
Come.

184
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,520
Listen..Listen very carefully.

185
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
Hi, baby..

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,440
How are you?
You miss me after a long time.

187
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Sweet talks..friendship..

188
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,840
Love calls.

189
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,680
This is a friendship call centre.

190
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Of course, I love you a lot.

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
Will you call me back tomorrow?

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200
Of course, sweetheart.
We will meet someday.

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,760
Kissing and all is fine,
But don't misbehave with me.

194
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
Understand..

195
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,040
What are you saying sir!

196
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,376
You mean the electric
store is just a front face..

197
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,320
But the real shocker
is the inner side.

198
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
- Understood right?
- Yes..

199
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,680
Now get out. Get out.

200
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,080
- Sir..
- What now?

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Pooja has not turned up again.

202
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,120
And her phone's been
ringing continuously.

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,256
Do you expect me to answer?

204
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,680
Transfer the call to someone else.

205
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,360
But he's her regular customer.

206
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,640
He doesn't talk to me, there's no
chance that he will talk to anyone else.

207
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,240
Spare me please.

208
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,560
We will meet later.

209
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,776
I must find a permanent solution
for Pooja.

210
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
- Lately she has been skipping work a lot.
- Hello.

211
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,560
I am Pooja.

212
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
What happened?

213
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
Did't you like my voice?

214
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,080
You did, right?

215
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,160
Then.. Let's continue talking.

216
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,240
You will like the conversations
even better, lover boy.

217
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
Bye, love you.

218
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Tired?

219
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Yes.. He was!

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,320
Bravo, my boy.

221
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,000
You raised the customer's
bill to 3000 rupees.

222
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,320
You are a very talented man.

223
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,240
But have no pride about it.

224
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,480
You sound so convincing as a female.

225
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,840
- How do you do it?
- It comes naturally.

226
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,920
What is this?

227
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,520
Advance.

228
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,120
You got the job, Pooja baby.

229
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
I get the job.. Me? Pooja baby?

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,320
Sir..Thank you, sir.

231
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,640
Sir..this will payfor all of my debts.

232
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,480
Read it first.

233
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,816
All I am doing for last 15-17
years is reading but to no avail.

234
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,520
Now I am just going to
write here, sir.

235
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,840
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

236
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,360
- Go easy on the betel leaf.
- Yes.

237
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,360
- Join the job from tomorrow.
- Of course, sir.

238
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,600
What a nice piece of advice for you?

239
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,200
Shut your mouth.

240
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
What do you want..

241
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
You?

242
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,640
Come inside.

243
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
Hurry up.

244
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,776
Why didn't you come
to the Ramleela yesterday?

245
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,080
Today is a dry day.

246
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,760
I sold so many bottles yesterday..

247
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,096
That I had to give
my personal bottles in the end.

248
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,376
Before going to bed
I had to take milk instead.

249
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,480
"Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health."

250
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,160
Delivery's closed. You'll
have to collect it yourself today.

251
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,360
Already here?

252
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
That's pretty fast.

253
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,960
What do you..

254
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
- What's wrong, uncle?
- Come on, out with it.

255
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,640
No alcohol on a dry day, sir.

256
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,760
I've warned you not to
open your shop on dry days.

257
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,056
- But..
- But you never understand.

258
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,000
- Now pay the fine.
- The shop's closed.

259
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
I am with my girlfriend.

260
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Girlfriend?
What's your girlfriend doing here?

261
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,360
Unfortunately,
uncle, we can't go to her place..

262
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,616
And I don't have
a mattress at my place.

263
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,736
Now you tell me what should I do.

264
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
- Try to understand.
- Who is it, darling?

265
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
Police, baby..

266
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,696
First, they used to raid the hotels,
now they are raiding wine shops too.

267
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,560
And I can't even reach
the hook of my blouse.

268
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, I'll help you.

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
See sir..

270
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,560
I can't see a thing.

271
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,000
Why don't you buy a mattress at home.

272
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,400
I will, at Diwali.

273
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Don't forget. Let's go.

274
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,040
Don't you dare open the shop.

275
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,080
Bro..your voice saved us again.

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,480
Stop talking..

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Open a beer.

278
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,040
You seem to be in a very good mood.

279
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,480
I got a job in Faridabad.

280
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,400
You shouldn't be lying on a dry day.

281
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,520
Drunkards will curse you.
Don't do it.

282
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,920
Look..25,000 advance.

283
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
Awsome!!

284
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,200
We're going to drink until we drop.
The party's on me.

285
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Uncle, you're back?

286
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
I go out for one day..

287
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,080
And you turn my place into hell.

288
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,680
We were just enjoying, uncle.

289
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,920
This isn't enjoyment... it's debauchery.

290
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,760
Uncle..debauchery would be if you had
found us in the arms of some Russian gals.

291
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,560
We were enjoying because
my friend here, got a job.

292
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,320
If you are still high from last night,
then spray some acid on your face.

293
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,320
He is right, Dad. I got a job.

294
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,160
- Heard that..
- Look..

295
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
25,000 advance.

296
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,880
Bless me.

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Radhe-Radhe.
God Bless you, son.

298
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
- 25,000 advance.
- Yes.

299
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,240
Which company gives so much advance?

300
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,080
That is the issue,
when people earning 2500..

301
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,296
Get 25000 in their hands,
they tend to loose their mind.

302
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
Shut up.

303
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
Go away..

304
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,040
Which company?

305
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
Call Cent..

306
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
Colgate. Colgate Colgate company.

307
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,240
Radhe-Radhe. It's a very good news..

308
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Now I can repay my debts
and also get free toothpaste.

309
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,680
- There are only two problems in your life, dad.
- What?

310
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,520
Loan and Alone!

311
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,576
And we need to decrease your interest
in one and increase in the other.

312
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,336
Let's find you a beautiful
bride and get you married.

313
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,520
Don't be crazy.

314
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
You are old enough to get married now.

315
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,960
You are not that old yet.

316
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,216
If we don't count the public
holidays then you'll still be 26.

317
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,400
Bro, you should love
your dad and not mislead him.

318
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,560
Am I right, uncle.

319
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
Be quiet.

320
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,440
- Uncle, love you too.
- Mr. Jagjeet.

321
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,040
- Yes.
- There is someone at the shop.

322
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,480
Go take a look.
Must be from the Thakur family.

323
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,416
What will it take to
get a cup of tea around here?

324
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Shut up, you stupid.

325
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,920
You made me forget the count..

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
500..1000..

327
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,280
Here is all your stuff.

328
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,400
2250 rupees.

329
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,160
I forgot my wallet at home.

330
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,480
We take PayTm as well.

331
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,000
What is PayTm?

332
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,640
So naive.

333
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,336
Do you know that there's a new 2000
currency note in the market?

334
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,880
I am not that naive.

335
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
Hello. I am on my way back.

336
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,256
Did you pack camphor (KAPOOR)?

337
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,320
Here.

338
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,880
20 rupees.

339
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,120
So cheap.

340
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,480
Not every Kapoor is Ranbir Kapoor.

341
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,920
Total 2270 rupees.

342
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Take it.

343
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,896
It's too much for one man to carry.

344
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,560
Help me deliver this stuff
and collect your money as well.

345
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,880
Grandpa...

346
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,560
- Slowdown!
- Mourning again

347
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,040
I am just the delivery guy.

348
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,480
- I see..
- Hello.

349
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,640
Hello.

350
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Come.

351
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,440
(SANKRIT CHANTS)

352
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
Hello.

353
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,200
Deepak.

354
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,040
Pay his bill.

355
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,560
Hari. This isn't spicy enough.

356
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,000
Bring some more chilly.

357
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,360
Who is the old lady?

358
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,440
She is the Thakur's wife, do you know?

359
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
No..

360
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,520
Does she know her
husband has passed away?

361
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,840
Yes, she does.

362
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
But grandpa had turned 95.

363
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,880
Which is why she
isn't wailing or crying?

364
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
No! I will go..

365
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,680
I don't believe in such nonsense.

366
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,400
Grandma..what is she talking about?

367
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
I am going to the crematorium,
and that's it.

368
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,576
I don't want to listen.
I am coming downstairs.

369
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,920
Mahi.. Stop!

370
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,560
What's the name?

371
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,800
Mahinder.

372
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,400
Doesn't that sound too
manly to be a girl's name?

373
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,160
No. My name is Mahinder.

374
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,800
Her name is Mahi.

375
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,920
Mahi.

376
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,760
Married?

377
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,400
No. Celibate..

378
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,360
A female who is a celibate.

379
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,080
Not the girl, I am a celibate.

380
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,600
She is still in college.

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
You don't know what's PayTm
but you keep a tab on every women.

382
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,520
That's because she is my granny
and that's my younger sister Mahi.

383
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Mo..Money..

384
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,760
Yes..where did Deepak get stuck?

385
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
- Give me a minute, let me check.
- Okay.

386
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,080
This isn't right.

387
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
Grandpa has always been with me.

388
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
From school to college,
he accompanied me everywhere.

389
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,200
Why can't I accompany
him on his final journey?

390
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
This isn't right, dear.

391
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Women have always followed men.

392
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,760
It's for their own good.

393
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,280
That's absurd, Poonam aunty.

394
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,160
Don't forget this is Gokul.

395
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,176
The place where Radha's
name is taken before Krishna's.

396
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,520
And Sita's before Ram's.

397
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,040
Women have always been ahead of men,
history is a proof.

398
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,056
- Who are you?
- Don't bother about me.

399
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,816
Please continue.
You are speaking really well.

400
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,600
In fact..take grandma with you as well.

401
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,920
Even she is a woman.

402
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
God forbid if anything happens to her..

403
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,480
Which will...

404
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,120
Will you bury her in your backyard?

405
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,536
And never take her to the crematorium.

406
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,160
- Right, grandma.
- Who the heck are you?

407
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,120
Wanting me to die so early.

408
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,520
Karamveer,
I live in front of the Gokul Temple.

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
House no. 865/1.

410
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,600
Aunty..you must also
go to the crematorium.

411
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Not every woman looks
good on their deathbed.

412
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
Where is my money?

413
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,000
Here you are.
Is it all here?

414
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,280
Radhe-Radhe.

415
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,160
Your mother would
have been so happy today.

416
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,040
That her son is climbing
the ladder of success.

417
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,400
Look.

418
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
But this is Hema Malini.

419
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,680
That's my dream girl.
This is your mother.

420
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,120
Take her blessings.

421
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,920
She would have been extremely happy.

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
You are a wonderful boy.

423
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,000
Because boys these days
claim one thing and do another.

424
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,480
- Rascals.
- Dad..I am getting late.

425
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,000
Listen, I have a question.

426
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,120
Why the night shift?

427
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,760
When we make toothpaste all night..

428
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,080
Then only can people brush
their teeth in the morning.

429
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,080
I never thought of that.

430
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,120
Here is 101 rupees as good luck.

431
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,520
Tonight is your first night,
Pooja baby.

432
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
All the best, dear.

433
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,760
She will transfer the calls to you.

434
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,400
Radhe-Radhe.

435
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,240
Hello.

436
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,400
The call's connected.

437
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
I am Pooja.

438
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,800
- Who is this?
- Dev speaking.

439
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,240
Pooja baby..come over.
There's three of us.

440
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,656
Do you want the 4th one to accompany
you for your father's final rights?

441
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,960
Hang up!

442
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,080
What are you doing?

443
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,960
Why are you yelling at the customers?

444
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,920
Customers are God.

445
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Which God calls up a girl at 2 am?

446
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
We've to raise their bill,
and not our blood pressure.

447
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,160
Understand.

448
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,760
Understood?

449
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,880
Hello. Is this Pooja?

450
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Yes, this is your Pooja.
Who is this?

451
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,600
Gurbachan Singh speaking.

452
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Gurpu.

453
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,040
Are you fine?

454
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,320
What?

455
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,320
I said are you fine?

456
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,920
Yes, I am fine.

457
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,160
- Is this Pooja?
- You are right.

458
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,480
And you win a dozen smooches
from me for the right guess.

459
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,320
My girlfriend dumped me.

460
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,560
I am with you. Don't worry.

461
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,440
I have enough money.

462
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
But I can't find
a bride to marry.

463
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
How old are you?

464
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,200
Sweet-70.

465
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,280
Stop looking for a bride..

466
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,256
And start looking for
a bus for your final destination.

467
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,440
Who is speaking?

468
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,080
This is your Pooja speaking.

469
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,840
Wow..you have a very sweet voice.

470
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,120
Thank you.

471
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
You know, whenever I talk to you,
I want to do things to you.

472
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,640
What things?

473
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
You know..

474
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,280
What you're mistaking for Taj Mahal
is actually Qutub Minar.

475
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,200
- Now hang up.
- Oh really?

476
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
Hi, I am Pooja.

477
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,600
Hello. Pooja speaking.

478
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,680
I am Pooja speaking.

479
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Hi, Pooja speaking.

480
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,640
Hello. I am Pooja.

481
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,680
You are not Pooja.
Give the phone to Pooja.

482
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Are you drunk?

483
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,600
How do you know?

484
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
I can smell it all the way.

485
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,640
I see..you are a smart one.

486
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Anyway..

487
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,160
From today you will be my regular.

488
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,360
Wait..hold on.

489
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,040
Stop calling me over
and over again, mom.

490
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
I am busy..

491
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,560
If you call again,
then I'll turn my phone off.

492
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,280
Hello.

493
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,120
Is there someone
more important than me?

494
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,760
No one. It's just my mom.

495
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,520
She keeps disturbing me all the time.

496
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,200
Maybe it's important.

497
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,040
It's nothing important.
All mothers are like this.

498
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,680
I am sure your mother's like this too.

499
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,920
See, I have lost my mother.

500
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,160
So talk politely to your
mother just like you talk to me.

501
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,720
But my mother doesn't
sound sweet like you.

502
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,960
What to do?

503
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,120
You are crazy.

504
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,520
That I am.

505
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Can I hang up now?

506
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Okay.

507
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
But I will wait for your call.

508
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,600
I see..naughty girl.

509
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,120
You must have enjoyed today, right?

510
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,600
How was your first night?

511
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,240
It wasn't my wedding night.
I was working.

512
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,280
The kind of job you are doing
I don't think there is much difference.

513
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,200
Didn't you get any lewd calls?

514
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,320
A couple of rascals did call.

515
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,600
But the call after
that..really shocked me.

516
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,560
People are very lonely.

517
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,480
They don't have a friend.

518
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,960
And some are so lonely..

519
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,280
That their loneliness
is all they have to cling on to.

520
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
It's quiet true.

521
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,080
These cops just
don't leave anyone alone.

522
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,080
Another Police barricade.
Do you have some money?

523
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Let me check.

524
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,760
Out for a midnight drive?

525
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,400
Where are you coming
from Fred and Barney?

526
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Office.

527
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,480
Drunk.

528
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,400
No..

529
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,280
We are drunk.

530
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
We need a ride.

531
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
But three men are
not allowed on a bike.

532
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,920
I see..

533
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,200
Gurpreet..are you comfortable?

534
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,040
Not every Sardar is
a Gurpreet or a Harpreet.

535
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,640
My name's Smiley.

536
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,016
But in case you are not comfortable..

537
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,056
I'll sit on the handlebar instead.

538
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,880
No..why would you sit on the handlebar?

539
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,720
Just a little longer.

540
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,880
We'll get off at the next block.
Right.

541
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,080
How about a few lines..

542
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,440
Bravo. Bravo.

543
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
Death is inevitable.

544
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,360
And love is filled
with suffering and pain.

545
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Life is filled with hardships
and this is where we get off.

546
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,680
Stop the bike.

547
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll get down here.

548
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,680
But your destination
hasn't arrived yet.

549
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,080
I am so high that I just remembered..

550
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,840
My home's on the route to Noida.

551
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,240
No wonder..
Stop here! Stop!

552
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,160
Shift back.

553
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,480
- Jawahar.
- Yes.

554
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,360
Don't show up on time tomorrow.

555
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Only if I get home safe and sound.

556
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,240
Stop. Stop.

557
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
You're a natural poet.

558
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,520
Your poems are filled with pain.

559
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,640
Once you are married son..

560
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,520
The pain and suffering
come out through your words.

561
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,200
And on that note..here's another.

562
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,960
No, we're in a hurry.

563
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,400
Fine Then just say bravo.

564
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,160
Because you know I am good at it.

565
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Bravo. Bravo.

566
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,840
See you then.

567
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,160
'I am searching you everywhere.'

568
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,360
Not at this hour.

569
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,080
Not that. Extra income

570
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,440
Silly girl, I am a poet
and poets only write poems..

571
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,080
And not take bribe.

572
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
- Here's a fresh one.
- Shut up.

573
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
Mr. Poet..

574
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,960
Your poetry isn't going
to improve our condition.

575
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,776
The constable next door
just bought a used car.

576
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,000
And look at you who has to take
a lift every day to get home.

577
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,800
And you are drunk again.

578
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,640
Have you ever seen me drinking?

579
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,840
Seriously?

580
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,080
Are the children asleep?

581
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Children? We have only one kid.

582
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,840
Then I must be drunk.

583
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,960
Make it hot.

584
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
What?

585
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,040
Dinner, what else.

586
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Why do you get romantic all the time?

587
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
Of course, because that's
all I am good for anyway.

588
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,200
You come home drunk,
and I serve you your dinner.

589
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,800
What else do you want?

590
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,360
You want to drink instead.

591
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Shut up.

592
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Marrying you was the
biggest mistake of my life.

593
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Here take it.

594
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Tell him.

595
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,480
White hair in the food.

596
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,880
When the cook's got white hair,
then what else do you expect?

597
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,600
I wonder when we'll find
some black hair in the food.

598
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,560
That reminds me..I
have searched for a bride.

599
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,280
Really?

600
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
But no..

601
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,000
As I said before,
I don't want to get married.

602
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,880
Uncle, he meant for himself.

603
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
I see.

604
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,320
But son. Who is she?
Where is she from?

605
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,520
What about her family?

606
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,440
There are only 3 members in the family.

607
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,016
The oldest one is the Grandmother, who
is older than the French Revolution.

608
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,120
- Seriously.
- The other one is Mahinder.

609
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,080
A staunch celibate. Bachelor.

610
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,200
And the only females in his
life is Gita, Sunita, Babita, Lalita..

611
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
So many.

612
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Cows and Buffaloes.

613
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
And the third one is your
daughter-in-law Mahi.

614
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,480
Beautiful, Talented.

615
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,680
5'4 inches.

616
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,336
She is completing her Home
Science from the University.

617
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,920
And she is such a good cook..
She will cook for you.

618
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Finally, we'll get
some good food around here.

619
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,720
Is this bad?
Keep it down.

620
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,720
No, it's nice. I am eating.

621
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,720
Tell me something more.

622
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,880
It's the Thakur family
that live in the manor.

623
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,360
But they are nobles.

624
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,536
We aren't exactly paupers either.

625
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,280
Get me more stuffed bread, uncle.

626
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,440
We're out of flour, son.

627
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,480
Baby..your birthday's
on the 23rd, right.

628
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,760
Yes.

629
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll gift you a diamond ring.

630
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

631
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,720
- I'll miss you.
- Bye. See you.

632
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,360
Thank you.

633
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,160
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

634
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,720
- Hello, ma'am.
- What hello?

635
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,720
What is this?

636
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
- When will you finish this work?
- That..

637
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,280
Baby.

638
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,560
- You?
- Can I have some cash?

639
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,720
- Yeah, sure.
- Cash.

640
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,360
You were just talking about
gifting her a diamond ring.

641
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,520
Are you going to buy
that ring with her money?

642
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Poor guy.

643
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Why?

644
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
You are new around here.

645
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
She's had three breakups.

646
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,720
And she doesn't trust men anymore.

647
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Men are just leeches.

648
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,480
- No, ma'am..
- Am I right?

649
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,520
You guys can only break hearts right.

650
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,520
What breaking hearts?

651
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
Then why did she hire us?

652
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,120
So she can humiliate us every day.

653
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,120
I don't carry cash, only cards.

654
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
I see..

655
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,520
Cards.

656
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,120
Like these four visiting
cards and loose change.

657
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,680
She has reached the
pinnacle of success..

658
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,000
She even learnt English..

659
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,920
But still has no class.

660
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,200
Show me your phone.

661
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,400
I said show me your phone.

662
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
Ma'am, it's personal.

663
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,000
What are you doing, sister?

664
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,240
What sister?

665
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,720
Do I look like your sister?

666
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,520
- No, you are not..
- Then?

667
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
And who are they?

668
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,040
They must be your sisters as well,
aren't they?

669
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,480
Or were you planning to buy
diamond rings for them as well?

670
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,280
Baby, I can explain.

671
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,280
What..are you going to explain, Jatin.

672
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Who are they?

673
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,680
Baby, I love you.

674
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,240
Just shut up. I don't want
to see your face. Get out from here.

675
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,080
- I love you.
- I said get out.

676
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,120
You heard her. Get out!

677
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,600
Don't try to threaten me.
Get lost.

678
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,480
And what are you all watching?

679
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,960
What is so funny?

680
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
Rajpal.

681
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,920
- Rajpal.
- Yes, sir.

682
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,480
Rajpal..what is this?

683
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,040
Register, sir.

684
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,800
I know that, uncle.

685
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,920
But read this out for me.
Please..

686
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,000
Sunil Bhardwaj, son of Om Bharadwaj,
Resident of Faridabad's..

687
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,280
Motorcycle went missing from..

688
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,800
Chetterbata Chowk
on the 25th of the month..

689
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,600
O my crazy heart, what have you done
I feel like I'm neither alive nor dead.

690
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,160
What is wrong with me?

691
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,840
I think someone wrote
an FIR in the poem.

692
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,400
Not someone.

693
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,520
You again wrote a poem
in the FIR register!

694
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,480
Me?

695
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,760
How many times have I told you..

696
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Keep your poet in your..

697
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,880
Outside this Police Station.

698
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,120
Otherwise,
I'll lock you up without an FIR.

699
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,320
I just thought of two more lines..

700
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,400
Bravo.

701
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,080
Fix this first.

702
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,960
How dare you tease a police officer?

703
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,400
I'll throw you out where
you'll starve to death.

704
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,400
I am not teasing you, uncle.

705
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,360
Since morning I've been observing
that no one's listening to your poems.

706
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,920
Will you?

707
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,480
I won't either. But I can help you.

708
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Give me your phone.

709
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Why do you want my phone?

710
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,640
Give it to me once.

711
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,440
What is this?

712
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,680
This is a special number.

713
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
She will listen to everything you say,
and even repond to it.

714
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,880
I see..

715
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,520
- Would you like some tea?
- Liquor would be better.

716
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,360
Don't try to take
advantage of the situation.

717
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,960
No tea for you.

718
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,480
Uncle..listen..

719
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,320
Let's try this number..

720
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Hello.

721
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,400
Hello, who is this?

722
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,640
This is Pooja.

723
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,120
Pooja.

724
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,440
What a sweet name.

725
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
And even a sweeter voice.

726
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,256
Enough about me,
tell me something about yourself.

727
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,400
And a Haryanvi too.

728
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,640
- Are you from Rohtak too?
- No, Panipat.

729
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,600
Panipat. Great!

730
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
What do you do?

731
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Well..I.

732
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,080
I am a poetic.

733
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,400
You mean you're a poet.

734
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,920
- Are they different?
- Yes.

735
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,680
Then whatever you said.

736
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,560
Why don't you recite
a few lines for me.

737
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,840
Will you listen to it?

738
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,920
- Really?
- Of course..

739
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,520
I just came up with
this a few hours ago.

740
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,680
My heart says I should meet her.

741
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,960
My heart says I should meet her.

742
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,480
But my mind says that you are on duty.

743
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,920
Bravo... Bravo...

744
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,760
Really?

745
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,520
Too good. Superb.

746
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Thank you.

747
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If you don't mind,
can I say something too?

748
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
Are you a poet too?

749
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,000
Occasionally.

750
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,640
Encore. Encore.

751
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,520
You mean go for it.

752
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,280
- Are they different too?
- Obviously.

753
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,000
Then whatever you said.

754
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,200
- Hear this.
- Yes.. Yes..

755
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,400
- My heart says I should meet her.
- Yeah...

756
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,840
- My heart says I should meet her.
- Yeah...

757
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
My mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

758
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,680
My, my, my..

759
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Stop wailing.
We haven't found your bike yet.

760
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,760
Sir, its the guy who lost his bike.
He's been bothering me.

761
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,280
And my mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

762
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,880
There's no sign of electricity,
but the bill is always on time.

763
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,480
Hurry up.

764
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,600
- Here you go.
- The website is pretty slow.

765
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,200
And the office is close to my college.
I'll pay the bill here.

766
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,760
Yes.
Yes, okay. Bye.

767
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,336
- Pay your bill.
- What are you doing?

768
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,120
Today is the last date?

769
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,760
But I think it's my first date.

770
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,480
I see..

771
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
House no. 865/1.

772
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,600
Close to Gokul Temple.

773
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,960
I've been observing for some time now..

774
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,896
That you and your friend
have been following me everywhere.

775
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,976
Be it my home or restaurant.

776
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hello.

777
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,000
Don't be under any delusion.

778
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,320
Only I am following you.

779
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,920
When a boy shifts his entire focus
on a girl, do you know what it means?

780
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Yes..

781
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,560
That he is extremely free.

782
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,480
Maybe he's a busy guy..

783
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,560
And freed up his schedule
for someone special.

784
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,840
Cardamom tea, strong coffee..

785
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,760
- One tea for me.
- It's over already.

786
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
Strong coffee, cardamom tea..

787
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,960
Would you prefer tea or coffee?

788
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
None.

789
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,480
Waste of money.

790
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,136
- Uncle, you wanted tea.
- Don't want it now.

791
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,376
- Come on.
- I said I don't want it.

792
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,896
- You can pay me half the price.
- I don't want it.

793
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,840
Honestly, first time in my
life I am enjoying a queue this long.

794
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,080
Can I be honest too?

795
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,800
You talk too much.

796
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,400
But you speak well.

797
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,400
Every day's a Rose Day.
Every day's a Rose Day.

798
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,120
- Every day's a Rose Day.
- Give me a Rose.

799
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,480
Come on.

800
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,160
What? Do you want one?

801
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,680
Come, I'll get you one.

802
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,880
Come on.

803
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,160
Give me your..bill.

804
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Bill.

805
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,360
Actually, you got the hint right.

806
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,520
I want our electricity
bill to be on the same address.

807
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,200
865/1

808
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,440
Let's get to know each other first.

809
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,120
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> I am here so are you.. ♪</i>

810
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,680
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> ...gazing in each other's eyes. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

841
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,960
Hello. Pooja speaking.

842
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Give the phone to Pooja
and tell her its Roma.

843
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,720
I promise you will
like talking to this Pooja better.

844
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,080
Don't play smart with me, okay.

845
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,520
This is not my first call.

846
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,000
What are you looking at? Get lost?

847
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,680
You don't know who I am.

848
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,760
Edgy on the outside,
still on the inside.

849
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,160
- That's who you are.
- Wow.

850
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,280
You nailed that.

851
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,240
Although it was a fluke,
you have hit the right spot.

852
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,880
I guess your heart and trust
have been shattered more than once.

853
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Yeah.

854
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,560
Long story.

855
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,640
Three boys broke my heart.

856
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,200
Why do you do it with
three boys at a time?

857
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,160
Hey..not like that.

858
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,800
At different times.

859
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,440
Trust me,
I am speaking out of experience.

860
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,960
All men are dogs.

861
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,560
In fact...
If I could have my wish

862
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,040
I would strip them naked
and crush them under a bulldozer.

863
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,136
Cool crush them under a bulldozer..

864
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,736
But what is the
need to strip them naked?

865
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,440
All men are..

866
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,360
Not every guy is same.

867
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,680
Hey, don't address me as sister.

868
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,560
I don't look like a sister.

869
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,400
Trust has no gender.

870
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,080
Women can be just as deceptive.

871
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,240
Not Really.

872
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Girls are..sensitive,
sensible, understanding.

873
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,080
Like you and me.

874
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,120
Finally, I feel better
after talking to you.

875
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,280
Me too.

876
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,520
In fact, you sound a lot
better than the previous Pooja.

877
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,600
Today onwards you are Pooja for me.

878
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,720
It's ringing. It's ringing.

879
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

880
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,080
How are you doing, Pooja?

881
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
I am doing great.
Did you write anything new?

882
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,560
Of course, I did..just yesterday.

883
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,200
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

884
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,280
To destroy itself..in love.

885
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,440
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

886
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,400
Be the sweet nectar of my love.

887
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,600
Oh, God.

888
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,040
You've fallen too low.

889
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,280
You write so well, why don't
you work on your pronunciation.

890
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,016
There are also other things
in world other than love.

891
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,336
Why don't you try writing about them?

892
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,480
Yes, of course.

893
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,800
How can I say no to my Pooja?

894
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,000
Look..you're my Pooja.

895
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,520
Only my Pooja.

896
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,360
My Pooja. My foot... My Pooja.
My Pooja.

897
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,880
Just doesn't leave me alone...

898
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,520
No need to come to the
call centre from tomorrow.

899
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,080
My thoughts exactly, sir.

900
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,680
And anyway,
the loans have been almost repaid.

901
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
Here are the car keys.

902
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,880
It's right outside. Park it.

903
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
And do it properly.

904
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,000
Pooja Darling,
congratulations on the new office.

905
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,520
What is this, sir?

906
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,600
I was not asking you
to quit the call centre.

907
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,520
Then.

908
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,720
Starting from today
this car is your new office.

909
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,720
Now Pooja is available
24/7 for her fans.

910
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,160
How?

911
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,280
Open that box.

912
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,160
Smartwatch.

913
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,120
And I can keep the car too.

914
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,640
Thank you, sir.

915
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
By the way, I didn't deserve this car..

916
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,056
Get going or should I take the keys.

917
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,080
Going.

918
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,160
Who parked this car
in front of my house?

919
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,560
Is this yours?

920
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,040
No, it's not mine.

921
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,440
It cannot be yours.

922
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,200
Whose car is this?

923
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,760
Papa, this is our car.

924
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,040
- Our car?
- Yes.

925
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,200
Did you take a loan as well?

926
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,800
The company gifted me.

927
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,200
Radhe-Radhe.

928
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,240
Radhe-Radhe.

929
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,400
Pooja..

930
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,200
Don't scare me like that.
Why can't you say it directly?

931
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,840
But it's necessary.

932
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,080
Work is worship.

933
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,640
Come here. Sit.

934
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,200
- Come on.
- I see...

935
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,800
Sideways..

936
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,160
Tuck your shirt in.

937
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,960
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

938
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,240
To destroy itself..in love.

939
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,000
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

940
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,520
Be the sweet nectar of my love.

941
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,560
Nice. Who wrote it?

942
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,720
I... did not.

943
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,680
A friend of mine, who is a poet.

944
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,600
- Nice, isn't it?
- It is.

945
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,960
Take it.

946
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,160
Leave it.

947
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,720
Enjoying the drive.

948
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,680
Pick it up. It can be important.

949
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,960
Okay..

950
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,760
- Hello Pooja.
- Wrong number.

951
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,240
Hello Pooja, this is Rahul.

952
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,160
There is no Pooja here.
I told you its a wrong number.

953
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,560
But I regularly speak
with Pooja on this number.

954
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,920
I said hang up.

955
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,080
People call all the
time asking for some Pooja.

956
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

957
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,040
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

958
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,920
Hello.

959
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,640
- New car?
- Yes...

960
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,560
Hello.

961
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,840
Is this Pooja speaking?

962
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,536
If you called on Pooja's number, then
you can't expect Diana Penty to pick up.

963
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,200
Panty?

964
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,840
You didn't notice I said Diana,
you dog.

965
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,800
Don't call me a dog.

966
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,080
- Hello...
- Deepak, move.

967
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,920
There's enough space.

968
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,400
Your sound like you
are a very handsome guy.

969
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,040
Do you want to meet me?

970
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,960
It's my mother from Benares.

971
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,840
Your mother from Benaras, huh..

972
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,400
Do you have a mother in every city?

973
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,400
Let me hear her voice.

974
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,520
What happened, Kishore?
Who is disturbing us?

975
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,400
Your mother has such a sweet voice.

976
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,200
Whose mother is this?

977
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,160
Mother?

978
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Pooja.

979
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,040
People call me Pooja with love.

980
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,560
What can I call you?

981
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,880
Well, call me anything you like..

982
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,320
Well, call me anything you like..

983
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,576
Don't tell her your real name.

984
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,360
Rafi. His name is Rafi.

985
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,160
Wow..what a match. Kishore and Rafi.

986
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,080
Then sing something for me, Rafi.

987
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,640
Sorry, but I don't sing.

988
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,400
How is it possible? How can
you not sing if your name is Rafi?

989
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,640
Impossible.

990
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,360
Brother has a velvety voice.

991
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,440
Sing..

992
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,440
Sing something for me please.

993
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,800
What should I sing?

994
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,480
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Madhuban Mein Radhika Nache Re.. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

995
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,760
What song is that?

996
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,400
You were asking like
you remember all the songs.

997
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,880
Sing anything..

998
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,440
Wow..what a unique voice.

999
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,760
Amazing reverb.

1000
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,360
- No, that wasn't..
- Come on, sing for me sweetheart.

1001
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
This is me singing..

1002
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,200

So happy birthday in advance.

You are coming over this time.

- Yes.

1039

Not good.

1066
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,600
I haven't cut the cake yet.

1067
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,920
I kept insisting.. Let's meet,
let's met.

1068
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,680
Fine, don't come.

1069
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,360
Are you taking me for a ride?

1070
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,440
Don't be stubborn, Toto.

1071
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,000
I've told you before.
We can't meet.

1072
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Will you like it if
I get fired from the job.

1073
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,440
Yes, I will.
Then you can stay with me.

1074
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,000
I will marry you.

1075
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,400
You are too young.

1076
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,560
Marry me and I will grow up.

1077
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,680
So..when are we meeting?

1078
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,960
Like I said we can't meet.

1079
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,280
You will have to meet me, Pooja.

1080
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,640
Or else you will regret it.

1081

You can do whatever you want.

Long time ago

I will be leaving soon.
Just waiting for a ride.

Wait for me.

It's you.

1091
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,040
He is our guy.

1092
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,000
You got so tired
of giving us a lift..

1093
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,080
That you bought a car instead.

1094
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1095
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,320
Let's go.

1096
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,560
Feels nice whenever I see you.

1097
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,040
You remind me of someone.

1098
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,400
Are you married?

1099
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,000
No, sir. Just got engaged.

1100
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,760
What about you?

1101
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,880
Look at the forehead.

1102
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,960
Married women have a tint of
vermillion and men have lines of worry.

1103
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,640
That's frown.

1104
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,800
Are they different?

1105
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Yes.

1106
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,120
So..whatever you say.

1107
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,880
Sir, you should only
marry the one you love.

1108
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,360
That's so true.

1109
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,360
On that note,
you must hear this poem.

1110
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,440
My heart says I should meet her.

1111
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,640
What does it say?

1112
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,800
My heart says I should meet her.

1113
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,520
And my mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

1114
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,960
How was it?

1115
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,360
Look..trouble calling.

1116
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
Where are you?

1117
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,200
I'll be late.
Stop calling me repetitively.

1118
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,080
If you can't stand me,
then why don't you divorce me.

1119
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,240
Fine, I will divorce you soon.

1120
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,600
I have also found someone else.

1121
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,760
The one who has improved my
poetry will reform my life as well.

1122
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,840
I know one thing..

1123
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,120
One should marry the one you love.
Right?

1124
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,160
Even I will marry my Pooja.

1125
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,920
Will you hang up or should I?

1126
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,440
Go to hell!

1127
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,080
See..

1128
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,680
Turn here.

1129
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,816
I am heading to the hospital.

1130
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,040
Hospital?

1131
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,440
Boys these days don't
know anything about love.

1132
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,320
The girl refused to meet
and the guy slit his wrist.

1133
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,560
Imagine..

1134
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,680
So..here we are.

1135
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,640
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

1136
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,296
What did you
say the guy's name was?

1137
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,960
- Toto.
- Toto..

1138
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,040
Yes.

1139
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
Toto!

1140
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,680
Wedding's around the corner..

1141
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,080
And one guy slit his wrist.

1142
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,880
Another one is dumping his wife..

1143
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,000
And the other one
is a female herself.

1144
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,080
Everyone's after me.

1145
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,320
I don't know whether I should
dress like a groom or a bride.

1146
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,880
You know what..you'll
look amazing in a wedding gown too.

1147
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,800
Rascal..I am in no mood for jokes.

1148
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,840
I am quitting my job.

1149
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,040
So who is stopping you?

1150
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,440
But why tell Mahi about it?

1151
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,680
Mahi is a nice girl.

1152
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,880
The foundation of any
relationship is trust.

1153
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,360
I can break her heart
but not her trust.

1154
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,400
Great!

1155
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,440
Great.

1156
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Till date,
my hero was Kookie Dhillon.

1157
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,520
Who is that idiot?

1158
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,880
My father.

1159
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,320
And now you are too..

1160
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,600
What? Your father?

1161
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,880
My hero bro.

1162
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,960
Go and tell whomever you like.
Smiley is with you always.

1163
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,040
Quit your job.

1164
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,960
And inform your boss.

1165
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,040
Hello, W sir.

1166
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,080
"My heart's on a high."

1167
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,080
"Hold me..guys.."

1168
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,720
Mahinder..

1169
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,200
- Mahinder!
- Yes.

1170
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,920
"The weather's
very untrusting, today."

1171
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,040
Forget it. Where is Mahi?

1172
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,200
Maybe upstairs.

1173
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,400
Brother-in-law. I have a question.

1174
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,320
Go on.

1175
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,320
You know that Mahi and Granny
are the only females in my life.

1176
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,000
I already know that.

1177
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,800
Fine, I am going to ask.

1178
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,640
If I want to tell a female
friend..about my feelings.

1179
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,880
Then how do I do it?

1180
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,560
Which buffalo are you in love with now?

1181
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,080
Don't get me wrong.

1182
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,760
Tell me.

1183
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,000
Ask her..

1184
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,920
Can I get rid of my single
bed and get a double bed instead?

1185
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,840
And if she says yes, then it's a yes.

1186
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,800
What if she says no.

1187
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,320
Then pull her on the single bed.

1188
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,720
Then pull her on the single bed.

1189
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,240
These customers
don't stop calling..

1190
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,880
Hello. Who is this?

1191
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,080
It's me.

1192
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,760
Rafi.

1193
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,176
I don't want to hear
any song at this time.

1194
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,280
I don't want to sing,
I want to tell you my feelings.

1195
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,760
Feelings? Go ahead.

1196
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,720
We've been talking for so long.

1197
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,680
I am in love with me.

1198
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,480
I was wondering..

1199
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,896
Can I get rid of my single
bed and buy a double bed instead?

1200
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,600
- Huh?
- Yes?

1201
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,120
Karam.

1202
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,760
What's wrong with him?

1203
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,040
Why is he dancing?
Did he win a lottery?

1204
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,440
He did..

1205
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,600
He really did.

1206
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,760
Brother, what's wrong?

1207
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,240
You have a very talented son.

1208
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,200
He can mimic so many voices.

1209
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,720
And especially he is very
convincing as a female.

1210
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,720
Are females not
convincing enough as themselves?

1211
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,920
A guy mimicking a female's
voice is not a good thing.

1212
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,680
But..I am really
happy that he joined your company.

1213
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,520
Greetings, Sita Maiya.

1214
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,240
Come. Come.

1215
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,240
Karam.

1216
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,056
When you didn't answer my calls..

1217
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,640
I thought I'll personally
pay my respects to Sita Maiya.

1218
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,720
Mr. Jagjit, your son is
a very dedicated worker.

1219
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,200
Your program is telecasted
live all over Gokul.

1220
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,400
I saw it too.

1221
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,000
But I didn't know.

1222
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:05,160
Mr. Jagjeet..I was thinking why don't
I show his work live as well.

1223
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,056
He will become very popular.

1224
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,560
That's a great idea.
Let's not delay.

1225
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,840
Right, son.

1226
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
Shall we?

1227
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,840
- Goodbye.
- Radhe Radhe.

1228
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,736
O Hello. Please stop it for a minute.

1229
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,200
Can we discuss business?

1230
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,480
Hey Karam, Radhe-Radhe.

1231
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,200
Wow..people respect you a lot.

1232
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,600
If you don't show up for work..

1233
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,640
Then I'll put up big posters
of you all over the city.

1234
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,200
When I am good, I am good.

1235
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,880
But when I am bad..

1236
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,320
I am even better.

1237
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,040
Radhe-Shyam.

1238
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,520
Come on, guys.
You guys play really well.

1239
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,440
He's already played me.
So stop playing.

1240
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,600
What did he say?

1241
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,320
You told me to quit my job.

1242
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,440
Pass me the tea..

1243
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,680
Take it.

1244
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,400
Its' a bad day.

1245
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,080
It's an auspicious day.
Come on, guys.

1246
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,520
Start playing.

1247
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,840
Take it.

1248
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Eat.

1249
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,800
Look..

1250
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,560
Forget it. It's your wedding bro..

1251
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,040
And look how happy your father is.

1252
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,560
Forget it and enjoy your life.

1253
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,400
Uncle, come here.

1254
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,040
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1255
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,280
Son, I got two wedding
dresses stitched.

1256
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,480
Now you choose which one should I wear?

1257
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,720
- Why don't you wear both of them.
- Great.

1258
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,096
One for your wedding,
and the other..

1259
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,040
Uncle,
I am in no mood to get married.

1260
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,640
I am not talking about you..

1261
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,600
I was talking about my wedding.

1262
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,640
- Your wedding?
- Yes, son.

1263
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,640
I haven't told you yet..

1264
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,240
I've..

1265
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,880
Heard a mother for you.

1266
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,960
Heard?

1267
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,600
The term is "to see" uncle.

1268
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,240
But I have only heard her.

1269
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,240
And you must have heard the
name she addresses your father with.

1270
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,640
Rahul.

1271
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,800
Hello Pooja. It's me Rahul speaking.

1272
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,720
Wow..your voice is unique.

1273
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,640
Come here.

1274
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,080
Guys, come here.
Start playing.

1275
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,920
'Baby will take you
to Goa for our honeymoon.'

1276
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,840
'Tonight is your first night,
Pooja baby.'

1277
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,320
'From how long we are talking.'

1278
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,200
'Till I only hear your voice.'

1279
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,800
'I just want to meet you.'

1280
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,080
Pooja.

1281
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,960
I love you Pooja.

1282
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,120
I can't live without you.

1283
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,360
Will you..

1284
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,400
Marry me?

1285
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,560
What..

1286
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,120
What?

1287
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,480
This is how I will
propose your future mother, Pooja.

1288
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,920
And I'll adorn this
ring on her finger.

1289
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,080
Don't you dare adorn
or take anything off her.

1290
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:13,920
What's wrong now?

1291
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,400
Because you don't have my approval.

1292
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,456
But son, you always insisted
that I should get married.

1293
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,776
And now I am saying
that you cannot marry her.

1294
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,056
I don't approve of this relationship.

1295
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,920
But son, Pooja is a very nice girl.

1296
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,720
You make it sound like you raised her.

1297
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,120
Maybe she looks at you
like a father figure.

1298
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,040
This is unfair..completely..

1299
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,096
I don't care if you treat
me as your father or not..

1300
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,960
But don't call me her father.

1301
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,800
And you always said that
I don't look a day older than 26.

1302
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,000
Let jokes be jokes.

1303
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,200
She spoke to you nicely on the phone..

1304
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,840
And you think she is your property.

1305
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,960
No means No!

1306
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,160
My jacket.

1307
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,560
That's my jacket you're wearing.
Take it off!

1308
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,480
Enter.

1309
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,400
Mother. Mother.

1310
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,000
Son, where had you been all day?

1311
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,320
Mother. Look what I won.

1312
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,600
Whatever it is son,
share it equally with your brothers.

1313
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,720
- What the..
- Brother.

1314
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,520
Has mother lost her eyesight?

1315
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,800
Mother, you are not blind.

1316
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
How can you give
instructions without looking?

1317
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,160
You are absolutely right.

1318
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,920
Forget him.
You belong to us now.

1319
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,240
Mother's order is inevitable.
Right?

1320
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,080
From today Draupadi is our wife.

1321
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,320
Absolutely right.

1322
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,640
Mother's order must be carried out.

1323
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,640
Carried out.

1324
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,440
- Mother's order must be carried out.
- No..

1325
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,520
Don't you dare lay a finger on me?

1326
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,880
We don't wish to lay our
hands but set our hearts on you.

1327
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,440
- Draupadi shall be mine.
- Get lost.

1328
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,480
She will be mine.

1329
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,840
She will be mine.

1330
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,840
She will be mine.

1331
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,640
I wish you heard what
Draupadi had to say about it.

1332
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,456
Mother warned you against gambling too.

1333
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,960
- Then why the hell..
- What?

1334
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,416
Why didn't you
listen to your mother then?

1335
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,000
Why did you put Draupadi at
stake after losing everything?

1336
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,920
- Draupadi, please.
- Take your hands off.

1337
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,240
Karam, what are you doing?

1338
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
I don't have a single
dialogue and he's hitting me.

1339
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,520
You're confusing the scenes.

1340
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,880
This scene comes much later.

1341
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,016
But it's on the list, isn't it?

1342
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,056
How long will this unfair
treatment of women continue?

1343
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,640
We are not some object.

1344
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,096
If there was MeeToo during Mahabharat..

1345
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,376
You guys would
be sitting behind the bars.

1346
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,840
- Dear Draupadi..
- Get lost.

1347
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,640
Hey Karam, wait.

1348
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,600
Count me out.

1349
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,600
- Karam.. Wait..
- I am fed up.

1350
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,280
Karam..listen..

1351
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,896
This is my first
time with you on stage..

1352
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,840
And you are leaving
the rehearsals midway.

1353
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,520
I am not going to
be a part of this show.

1354
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,520
That's it. Stop here.

1355
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,080
What are you guys doing out here?

1356
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,600
Are rehearsals over?

1357
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,240
What on earth are you doing here?

1358
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,080
I made a new soup and
thought you should taste it.

1359
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,480
I am in no mood to eat.

1360
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,160
It's not all that bad.

1361
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,000
And what's wrong with your mood?

1362
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,920
It's Smiley's fault.

1363
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,280
My fault?

1364
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,920
Yes..how can you forget?

1365
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,720
Please remind me.

1366
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,920
There are a couple
of girls chasing him.

1367
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,160
After him?

1368
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,760
Yes..

1369
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,520
Right?

1370
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,600
Yes, sister-in-law.

1371
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,040
Being handsome is a crime these days.

1372
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,296
And if I say a few polite words,
they think I am available.

1373
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,840
- Where do I take my handsomeness..
- Enough.

1374
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,840
There is a girl who he truly loves.

1375
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,280
But doesn't know how to
get rid of these inbetweeners.

1376
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,680
That's pretty simple.
Stop talking to them.

1377
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,240
You don't think I tried..
I mean don't you think he tried that.

1378
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,456
But now they are
insisting on a meeting.

1379
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,760
Yes, sister-in-law. They are threatening
me to slit their wrist or whatever.

1380
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,200
- Where do I take my..
- Enough!

1381
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,560
What will the poor guy do?

1382
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,440
I don't know.

1383
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,640
Sorry.

1384
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,520
Taste this for me.

1385
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,440
I am having tea.
I don't want any damn soup!

1386
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,416
I put in so much effort
to make this soup for you.

1387
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,800
Don't drink it if you don't want to.
At least talk politely.

1388
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,880
Mahi!

1389
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,856
If you don't talk politely
to the one you love..

1390
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,480
They tend to get angry like this.

1391
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,840
Understood?

1392
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,560
You must talk to them rudely.

1393
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,320
So that the only one left in
your life is the one you love.

1394
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,640
All hail mother Sita.

1395
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,160
I knew you will come back.

1396
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,880
Now go and work properly.

1397
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,000
Go on.

1398
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,120
How are you, Pooja?

1399
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,200
I am young.

1400
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,760
You think about yourself, old freak.

1401
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,000
I am of your daughter's age.

1402
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,320
You need to catch a breath
between two sentences.

1403
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,960
But you dwell in every breath I take.

1404
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,160
As for my age.

1405
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,560
A man can grow old, but not his heart.

1406
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,040
Your heart and mind
is filled with crap.

1407
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,840
When God was gifting brains,
were you cleaning the buffaloes?

1408
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,040
I am done singing for buffaloes.

1409
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,760
Now I want to sing
for my female friend.

1410
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,040
"Since I saw... your rosy eyes..."

1411
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,480
Stop liking me.

1412
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,560
Men and women have the same heart.

1413
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,720
And sometimes even men
have a heart like women.

1414
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,800
That heart is what this Roma has.

1415
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,840
You know, when I was in
trouble you took care of me.

1416
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,520
But seems like you're
in some kind of trouble.

1417
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,856
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

1418
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,160
Even your mother couldn't
take care of you, bloody..

1419
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,880
She's been wandering
from pillar to post.

1420
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,800
I know lovers like you too well.

1421
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,160
Stop this fake pretence.

1422
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,960
Forget about marrying you, I wouldn't
even invite you to my birthday.

1423
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,920
You sound so sweet
even when you're angry.

1424
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,680
What are you worried about?

1425
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,960
I am the one who is
sick and you sound tensed.

1426
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,216
What do you want, just tell me?

1427
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,440
You stop talking.

1428
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,680
Your pathetic poetry..

1429
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,000
A cheap poet who can't
even get his nuances right.

1430
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,560
Utter another word
and I'll sic my dog on you.

1431
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,640
Your love has turned me into a dog.

1432
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,720
And if you don't believe me,
then listen to this..

1433
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,360
Stop barking over the phone.
We couldn't find your motorcycle.

1434
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,920
The guy's been bugging me.
Keeps calling me every day.

1435
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,360
You mean..they loved the
way you were rude with them.

1436
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,440
Yes.

1437
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,040
This was inevitable.

1438
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,080
After all Pooja is the best.

1439
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,400
Honestly, sometimes I think
of drunk dialling you myself.

1440
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,800
Get lost.

1441
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,600
I don't know what to do.

1442
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,080
Who is it now..

1443
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,680
Who is it now..

1444
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,880
Hello, uncle.

1445
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,280
What's wrong?

1446
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,640
Well..is your girlfriend
in there with you again?

1447
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,480
Yes. I haven't bought a mattress yet.

1448
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,520
You don't say.
Open up.

1449
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,600
They are coming in.

1450
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,760
Listen to me once..

1451
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,400
Where do you think you are going?
Listen to me.

1452
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,440
How dare you lie?
Where is your girlfriend?

1453
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,720
Sir, these days boys also..

1454
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,160
Hey, constable..what..

1455
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,120
Get out. How dare you come in?

1456
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,080
When we want to shut
down something permanently..

1457
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,240
We get to the root of it.

1458
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,320
Understand.

1459
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,160
Surgical strike!

1460
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,560
Love you sir.

1461
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,880
- What's wrong?
- I want to kiss you.

1462
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,400
As I said, these days even boys..

1463
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,960
It is true, bro..

1464
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,080
Shut it down! Let's go.

1465
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,920
This guy has given me a great idea?

1466
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,760
When you want to shut
down something permanently..

1467
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,520
Get to the root of it.

1468
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,320
Get wherever you want.

1469
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,520
I am sober again.

1470
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,760
Hang up now.
I don't want any credit card.

1471
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,200
Who are you? What do you want?

1472
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,360
Are you Chandrakanta Chaudhary Kirar?

1473
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,280
Yes. Why?

1474
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,360
All yours?

1475
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,080
No. Chaudhary Kirar's
your mom and I am Chandrakanta.

1476
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,400
How dare you come in without asking?
Who are you?

1477
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,160
- Now, I get it..
- What?

1478
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,440
Who is the inspiration
for Rajpal sir's poetry?

1479
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
Who?

1480
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,680
You are.

1481
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,080
Me..

1482
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,800
You two just got married, didn't you?

1483
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,560
It's been 10 years.

1484
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,880
10 Years!

1485
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,760
And yet you have
that glow on your face.

1486
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,880
But after she has kids, there
will be no glow left.

1487
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,240
- We have a 9-year-old kid!
- Seriously!

1488
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,040
Yes.

1489
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,056
You look like one of those
moms from the TV commercial.

1490
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,440
- Soap Commercial?
- Yes.

1491
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,840
Pray that this glow stays intact.

1492
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,600
We almost forgot..

1493
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,440
Rajpal sir has sent these for you.

1494
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,400
Deodorant. Bouquet.

1495
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,640
Heart-shaped cake.
All these gifts are for you.

1496
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,440
It's an apology.

1497
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,000
Well...

1498
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,600
All this is for me.

1499
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,120
Why would he give these to us?

1500
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,240
He never gave me anything
in all these years.

1501
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,120
He's a cop,
after all, they are never on time.

1502
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,280
He's got an entire city to look after.
Keeps him busy.

1503
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,760
He loves you a lot,
just doesn't show.

1504
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,600
Whenever he comes home..

1505
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,680
Give him a tight hug.
And talk to him with a smile.

1506
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,960
See you.

1507
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,680
Do what it takes..

1508
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,520
But you must take
the law in your hands.

1509
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,680
Okay.

1510
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,280
You're out of your mind.
Pooja. Pooja. Pooja.

1511
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,440
Look at you now.

1512
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,880
Stop being so crazy after her.

1513
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,480
Papa, I am in no mood
for a lecture right now.

1514
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,080
- Please talk softly.
- Okay.

1515
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,120
- Son..
- Leave. I need to rest.

1516
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,160
I'll find out who this Pooja is.

1517
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,280
Once I get my hands on that Pooja..

1518
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,720
Where are you? Walk quickly.

1519
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,080
Wake up..you poor Justin Beiber.

1520
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,160
Talk softly..he's just
got out of an ear surgery.

1521
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,360
Does Uncle have piles?

1522
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,040
She said ears.

1523
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,720
Who are you two?

1524
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,680
How dare you talk
back to Pooja's brother?

1525
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,640
So you're that spoilt brat Toto!

1526
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,480
Bro, Silence.

1527
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,440
- So you're that spoilt brat Toto.
- Yes..

1528
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,640
Slit your wrist for nothing.
Let me show you then..

1529
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,800
No, no, no, no, don't kill him.

1530
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,720
- Silence.
- Don't hit him.

1531
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,160
We'll hack you to pieces.

1532
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,560
What the hell is this?

1533
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,696
- Trying to be Pooja's die-hard fan.
- He is just a kid.

1534
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,080
What kid? He's got more
hairs on his chest than you do.

1535
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,040
Oh that is a lot of hairs.

1536
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,096
Where we come from, Even the
husbands don't tease their wife.

1537
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,040
And you think you can tease her.

1538
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,920
This is not teasing, I love her.

1539
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,256
The entire neighbourhood loves her.
Should I let her marry everyone?

1540
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,920
I know she is shameless, she
talks dirty on the phone.

1541
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,640
- But she is my sister!
- Silence.

1542
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,320
But she is my sister!

1543
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,760
Swear on Sita Maiya..

1544
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,480
I'll first hack my sister,
and then her lover boy.

1545
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,080
- What is this?
- Silence.

1546
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,320
Oh, God.

1547
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,960
Wait, little Singham.

1548
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,040
Where are you going?

1549
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,400
To get chocolates, papa.

1550
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,240
You always want Chocolate.

1551
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,200
- Here you go.
- But I already have one.

1552
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,440
What the..

1553
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,480
Who gave you this much money?

1554
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,640
Mom.

1555
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,720
Two strangers came over and
mom seems very happy since.

1556
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,800
Go..

1557
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,840
Two strangers.

1558
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,920
How am I looking?

1559
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,800
Like a broken beer bottle.

1560
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,920
Really?

1561
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,400
Who brought these gifts?

1562
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,880
Don't try to pretend
like you don't know.

1563
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,440
Someone sent these..

1564
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,080
Who?

1565
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,120
My lover..

1566
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,200
What?

1567
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,960
So this has been
going on behind my back.

1568
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,480
And for how long?

1569
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,560
Gifts and cash.

1570
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,816
- What are you saying?
- Don't try to change the subject.

1571
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,400
What? You sent these for me.

1572
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,760
Cops don't bribe others,
its what makes them cops.

1573
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,520
Wait a minute.
There must be sweets in this.

1574
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,560
- It's a cake..
- Point proved.

1575
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,960
I didn't send these.

1576
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,520
Policeman are getting
robbed in broad daylight.

1577
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,080
Mind your tongue..
Don't make me angry.

1578
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,240
How angry can you get 3-4 feet?

1579
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,400
- And what can you do?
- What can I do?

1580
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,320
- First, you send these gifts, and now..
- What can I do?

1581
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,560
You have lost your mind.
I don't want to stay with you.

1582
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,720
- You can keep these. Get lost.
- Go.

1583
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,000
I am going to marry my Pooja.

1584
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,280
Pooja darling, pick up the phone.

1585
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,160
Hello.

1586
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,840
Hello, Pooja.

1587
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,720
Pooja.

1588
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,200
Hello..

1589
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,320
Hello.. Hello, Pooja.

1590
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,800
No one's speaking here or here.

1591
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,400
None of them are speaking.

1592
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,720
What are you doing here?

1593
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,920
Your new mom isn't answering her phone.

1594
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,056
And someone's been calling
on your number constantly.

1595
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,080
Fine. Now go.

1596
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,560
Pooja. Pooja. Pooja. This is Rahul.

1597
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,280
Why weren't you answering the phone?

1598
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,720
I was bathing.

1599
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,840
Alone?

1600
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,440
No. I bathe with the
entire neighbourhood.

1601
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,680
I wish I lived in your
neighbourhood as well.

1602
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,280
You will, soon.

1603
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,536
You wanted to meet, didn't you?

1604
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,800
Yes. When?

1605
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,200
Today evening at 7.

1606
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,360
6:30..I'll be there at 6:30.

1607
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,080
Trust me. I'll be there at 6:30.

1608
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,080
Love you!

1609
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,480
Love you.

1610
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,640
Love you.

1611
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,800
If you say that,
I'll be there by 5:45..

1612
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,240
- Karam.
- Yes.

1613
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:32,280
Son, Pooja your future mother..
She called me for a meeting.

1614
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,160
Please come with me.

1615
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,680
I am not going anywhere.

1616
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,600
You are still angry with me.

1617
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,160
Wait.

1618
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,040
I gave it a lot of thought.

1619
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,680
I approve of your marriage.

1620
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,680
Son, will you come with me.

1621
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,720
I would, papa.

1622
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,720
But since it's your first meeting..

1623
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:01,000
She might change her mind looking at
an old husband and a contemprary son.

1624
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,680
Go alone.

1625
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,360
Son..you take such good care of me.

1626
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,960
I wish..

1627
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,880
Enough.

1628
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,400
Don't let love drive you crazy,
Jagjeet.

1629
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,880
Congratulations, grandma.

1630
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,600
Congratulations, grandma.

1631
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,200
- Congratulations.
- Bless me grandma.

1632
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,680
Congratulations, son.
Congratulations.

1633
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,816
Congratulations for what, son.

1634
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,000
Smoking is injurious to health.
Leave it.

1635
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,160
Try this.

1636
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,400
I'll make a drink for you, grandma.

1637
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,200
Son, this brings back old memories.

1638
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,520
I used to sneak a few drinks
when Babu was still alive.

1639
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,080
Babu, Shona, huh!

1640
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,200
Still young at heart, huh!

1641
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,760
Your grandpa's name was Babu Lal.

1642
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,440
Oh..that way.

1643
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,456
Congratulations for what?
You were congratulating for something.

1644
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,240
Mahinder's marriage has been fixed.

1645
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,960
Mahinder's getting married?

1646
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,400
Without telling me?

1647
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,920
You don't know?

1648
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,920
You're the oldest living
being in this city..

1649
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,520
You deserve to know.

1650
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,600
But why should he?
The wedding date isn't fixed.

1651
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,560
And who knows if grandma
will still be around.

1652
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,640
Not to mention one
less plate at the banquet.

1653
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,040
How much do you think grandma would eat
with no teeth.

1654
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,280
Correct.

1655
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,896
It's rude to say such
things about any girl..

1656
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,120
But its someone called
Pooja who talks dirty on the phone..

1657
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,760
With every Tom-Dick-and-Harry.

1658
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,320
Name is Pooja..and Dirty Talks..

1659
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,680
Grandma..talking dirty..phone-a-friend!

1660
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,520
Dirty talking.

1661
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,760
Come here, grandma.

1662
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,640
Swear on you..at least
a dozen guys are after her.

1663
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,480
If she comes here, then Mahinder
as well as Deepak will be happy.

1664
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,080
Why Deepak?

1665
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,160
Out of the dozen
guys chasing her..

1666
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,120
Deepak is in the first one.

1667
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,480
He is a total rascal.

1668
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,896
Imagine the type of girl
she is and what her character is.

1669
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,840
Grandma..

1670
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,200
Mahi will settle down with me.

1671
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,760
But when that girl
comes to this house..

1672
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,496
- Will she really look after you?
- No, she won't.

1673
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,760
- Will she respect you?
- Never.

1674
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,360
Not even a minute.

1675
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,200
I am sure you've
read the news recently.

1676
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:14,560
"Daughter-in-law suffocates
her grandma-in-law."

1677
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,560
What do you think will happen?

1678
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,760
Grandma's final..

1679
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,480
- What nonsense.
- I meant your final peg..

1680
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,080
At least add some water.

1681
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,760
I won't die so soon.

1682
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,720
She is right.

1683
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,360
I'll see how he marries that girl.

1684
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,640
That's it, grandma, keep that attitude.

1685
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,560
- See you.
- Our work is done.

1686
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,480
Hey, ..put that back.

1687
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:46,480
"And old beeeze that
has brought memories."

1688
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,560
"And old beeeze that
has brought memories."

1689
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,800
"It's not often when he is alone."

1690
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,680
Good evening, sir.

1691
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,360
Please, sir. Have a seat.

1692
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,560
Please, sit.

1693
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:12,520
Are they.. Accepting requests as well.

1694
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,040
Of course, sir.
100 rupees per song, sir.

1695
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,880
And what if I request three songs?

1696
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,200
Sorry sir, no discounts.

1697
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,960
Fine..

1698
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,280
My name's Jagjeet.

1699
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,360
- Jagjeet sir.
- Play these when I signal to you.

1700
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,840
And don't forget to bring the change.

1701
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,120
Sir..table no. 10.

1702
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,640
Rahul.

1703
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,680
"Fill my life with
the colours of your lips."

1704
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,240
Who are you, madam?

1705
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,560
- Didn't you recognise me, cutu? Pooja.
- No.

1706
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,680
Pooja?

1707
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,000
And that's my sister Afreen.

1708
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,800
Hello.

1709
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,200
Hello.

1710
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,560
We believe in every religion.
We are coming from the church.

1711
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,960
You are Pooja and she is Afreen.

1712
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,200
Unfortunately, the profession we are
in, we cannot disclose our real names.

1713
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:19,440
My real name is Zubeida Misba Shoaib
Aktaram Moin Khanum Inzamam Ul-Haqan.

1714
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,520
You never told me this before.

1715
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,960
How could I?
Does it make sense?

1716
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,240
Don't you look too aged for your name?

1717
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:36,920
"Love cannot be bounded by age."

1718
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,800
By the way, who else is in your family?

1719
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,240
Not much, we are a dozen siblings.

1720
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,240
My sisters Razia,
Sultana, and my brother Akbar, Babur..

1721
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,360
Dilawar, Zorawar, Peshawar and Qutub.

1722
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,920
I think you missed Shahjahan.

1723
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,760
Ohh come one, Father had
other stuff to take care of as well.

1724
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,120
This is the main stuff
that he looks concerned about.

1725
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,800
What does your father do?

1726
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,280
He works at a medical
store near our place.

1727
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,920
Looking at the number of siblings..

1728
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,520
I don't think there are any
medical stores around your place.

1729
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,400
Anyway, I accept..

1730
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,280
Accept what?

1731
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,800
Our marriage.

1732
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,480
Father's on a Hajj trip.

1733
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,280
He'll meet you as
soon as he comes back.

1734
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,480
But don't mind if he touches
your feet out of respect.

1735
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,400
Why would he do that?

1736
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,800
He's 20 years younger to you.

1737
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:24,200
"Lord snatched my love."

1738
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,960
- Waiter.
- Yes sir.

1739
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,520
Ask him to stop.

1740
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,320
It seems he is singing on my situation.

1741
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,480
Okay.

1742
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,960
Sir, please stop.

1743
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,560
Table no. 10 is asking to stop.

1744
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,680
Stop.

1745
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,120
Stop it.

1746
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,760
Zubeida,
I must use the loo urgently.

1747
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,000
At your age bladder
stones are pretty normal.

1748
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,120
Radhe Radhe.

1749
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,560
But listen..don't run.

1750
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,520
Goodbye. Love you.

1751
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:05,200
"Your love made my heart alive again."

1752
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,480
"My ailing heat kept crying woefully."

1753
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,960
"I was punished for falling in love..."

1754
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:19,640
"What was my crime that I was robbed."

1755
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,040
"Robbed in your love."

1756
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,720
How is Pooja Mom?

1757
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,560
How does aunty look?

1758
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,960
- Pooja is not her real name.
- What?

1759
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,720
Pooja is not her real name.

1760
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,600
Yes son.

1761
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,440
Since your mother passed away..

1762
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,360
For the first time I
had feelings for someone else.

1763
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,760
But I wonder who jinxed my love?

1764
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,600
Rahul couldn't get his love.

1765
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,160
Pooja turned out to be a Muslim.

1766
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:59,200
Her real name is Zubieda
Begum etcetera-etcetera.

1767
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,040
What?

1768
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,040
Yes. She has 8 to 10 siblings.

1769
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,880
8 to 10.
She must be telling you the time.

1770
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,080
No, she wasn't, son.
This is my bad luck.

1771
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,520
We can't get married now.

1772
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,920
Don't be absurd, papa.

1773
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,080
Who cares about Hindu and
Muslim in this era?

1774
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,320
- Take Shahrukh and Gauri.
- Yes.

1775
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,880
- Aamir and Kiran.
- Yes.

1776
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,600
- Saif and Kareena.
- Yes.

1777
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:22,760
Suresh and Hameeda.

1778
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,760
Who is Suresh?

1779
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,480
- The guy that sells juice at the corner.
- Oh I see.

1780
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,520
And in fact, take Smiley for instance.

1781
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,640
- Is this Sikhs a Muslim?
- No.

1782
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,160
But his fiancé Sakeena is a Muslim.

1783
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,480
What? My fiancé is a Muslim?

1784
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,440
Did you forget?

1785
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,640
Yes, I did. Remind me.

1786
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,040
Sakeena.

1787
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,640
Go ahead and tell papa..

1788
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,680
That you don't have a problem
with your girlfriend being a Muslim.

1789
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,160
No. I don't have a problem, uncle.

1790
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,040
Muslims are classy people.

1791
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,360
Manners, Love, Care..

1792
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,600
But son, marrying a Muslim..

1793
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,720
What if there is a problem..

1794
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,056
You are right.
There is a small problem.

1795
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,576
What are you saying?
Where is the problem?

1796
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,840
What are you saying?

1797
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,120
Tomorrow when I have kids,
what am I going to call them?

1798
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,560
Razia Chadda, Harpreet Hussain.

1799
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,256
They will run around
greeting Insah Allah...

1800
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,960
How will that look?
You tell me, uncle.

1801
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,040
You are absolutely right,

1802
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,120
What right?

1803
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,680
Children are not born with surnames.

1804
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,040
No one congratulates saying,
it's Sharma.

1805
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,000
Congratulations, it's Shukla.

1806
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,760
Whether it's Agarwal or Ansari.

1807
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,280
Love by any name is still love.

1808
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,280
You are right.

1809
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,960
Let's assume that Baisakhi
and Eid fall on the same day..

1810
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,136
Then what will I eat first?

1811
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,920
- Kidney beans or goat meat.
- True.

1812
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,640
Feed the kidney beans
to the goat and eat the goat.

1813
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,000
Radhe-Radhe. What nonsense.

1814
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,080
Thousands of goats are
sacrificed on Eid, father.

1815
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,440
What difference will it
make if you offer one at home?

1816
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,280
Think about it.
There is no hurry.

1817
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,720
If you believe Hindu, Muslim,

1818
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,040
Christian, Parsi,
Jainism (RELIGION) are above love.

1819
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,360
Then don't marry her.

1820
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:53,960
Let it be.

1821
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,096
- What's going on?
- Where are you going, mom?

1822
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,440
- Where are you going, grandma?
- Stay back.

1823
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,560
Mom, stop.

1824
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,440
- Aunty, stop.
- Be quiet.

1825
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,280
I will talk to Mahinder.

1826
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,200
I won't stay in this house anymore.

1827
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,440
Let's go, Deepak.

1828
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,240
Where are you going?

1829
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,920
Look..here he is..

1830
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,040
He's an embarrassment to this family.

1831
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,320
What is grandma saying?

1832
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,800
We are busy preparing for
my marriage and What are you doing?

1833
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,880
Who is Pooja?
What are these dirty talks?

1834
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,000
What dirty talks?

1835
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,440
If that girl comes here, then I won't.

1836
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,760
- Let's go, Deepak.
- Stop Deepak.

1837
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,040
First, decide what to do.

1838
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,520
It's decided. I love Pooja.

1839
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,280
Not every girl that talks dirty
on the phone are characterless, Mahi.

1840
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,960
She understands my feelings,
and I understand hers.

1841
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,600
Maybe she was forced into this.

1842
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,200
Maybe some sort of helplessness.

1843
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,880
And that's why she
does this kind of job.

1844
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,440
Why don't you explain it to her, Mahi?

1845
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,040
Do you love her?

1846
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,920
Are you sure?

1847
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,200
Grandma..

1848
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,240
Since brother loves her so much,
then let's meet her up once.

1849
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,376
Fine, If you don't want to meet her
why don't you just talk to her?

1850
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,920
There is no need to leave the house.

1851
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,720
Have faith in me, grandma.

1852
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,960
Can I ever do anything wrong?

1853
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,480
Fine.

1854
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,520
If you think I am wrong?

1855
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,440
Then you stay, and I will leave.

1856
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,040
Stop Mahinder!

1857
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,600
That's my luggage.

1858
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,040
Fine. You can keep your luggage.

1859
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,400
This is true love, grandma.
You won't understand.

1860
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,720
Radhe-Radhe.

1861
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,480
Brother, come back.

1862
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,400
What?

1863
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,560
Just say yes, grandma.

1864
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,560
Say yes..

1865
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,960
Do you love her?

1866
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,680
I swear I do.

1867
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,120
By the way,
brother, all that time among cows..

1868
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,920
And buffaloes has made you wise.

1869
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,800
Call sister-in-law.

1870
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,136
No. I am feeling embarrassed.

1871
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,320
Come on.

1872
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,320
Let it be.

1873
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,880
I already dialled her number.

1874
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,120
Look now..

1875
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,120
Rafi's rough copy..

1876
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,600
He'll start singing
even if you don't want him to.

1877
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,720
Hello.

1878
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,960
Hi Pooja. Grandma wants to talk to you.

1879
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,040
Grandma?

1880
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,920
Daughter-in-law.

1881
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,680
Having a peg, grandma.

1882
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,800
I mean hello, grandma.

1883
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,680
God bless you, dear.

1884
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,960
What are you doing?

1885
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,040
Watering the plants.

1886
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,440
- At this hour?
- Yes.

1887
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,600
- Let me also talk to her.
- Yes, dear.

1888
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,120
Hello..sister-in-law.

1889
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,400
This is Mahi.

1890
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,120
Hi.

1891
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,880
Your sister-in-law.

1892
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,400
- Hi!
- Brother told grandma everything.

1893
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,800
And grandma has agreed
for this marriage.

1894
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,640
Since you're watering
your plants, dear, water mine too.

1895
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,920
Does everyone in
your house have separate plants?

1896
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:51,920
Yes.

1897
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,400
I'll talk to you later.

1898
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,600
Papa is calling.

1899
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,960
Okay, bye.

1900
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,160
Go and get more water
for papa's plants.

1901
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,320
Mahinder told everything to her.

1902
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,560
By the way, who told you such
negative things about her?

1903
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,280
Right?

1904
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,880
I just can't remember
who was the one.

1905
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,080
What happened?
Water..

1906
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,160
Water..

1907
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,640
Fathers are so unique.

1908
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,920
Your father is one in a million.

1909
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,080
Sometimes I wonder..

1910
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,640
How he spent a lifetime alone.

1911
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,240
And look at us..

1912
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,440
Whenever we are tensed..

1913
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,960
We start drinking.

1914
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,800
And look at this man.

1915
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,160
No cigarette, or alcohol.

1916
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,920
In fact, even if he's ever
had a problem in life..

1917
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,200
He hasn't even told me about it.

1918
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,360
Not to mention that
I have caused him so much pain.

1919
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,080
You're right.

1920
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,880
He's always scolded me.

1921
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,080
But I never felt bad.

1922
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,960
I swear..

1923
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,720
We will apologise.

1924
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,480
Wake up.

1925
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,960
Move.

1926
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,080
Try harder.

1927
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,040
Listen, Uncle..

1928
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,680
Hello..

1929
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,360
Waah..

1930
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,640
Papa, it's you.

1931
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,440
From Jagjeet Singh to Mehendi Hassan.

1932
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,160
Love is responsible for this makeover.

1933
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,760
You gave a complete makeover
to yourself and our ancestral shop.

1934
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,200
Feels like happiness
has entered my life.

1935
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,920
And no more selling
funeral items and caskets..

1936
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,440
Instead your Abba will
promote beautiful lovely items.

1937
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,320
Who Abba?

1938
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,000
Me of course.

1939
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,600
Your Abba.

1940
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,720
That night I had an epiphany..

1941
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,600
And I changed for good.

1942
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,600
And Ismail has the biggest
contribution in this changeover.

1943
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:49,840
Ismail?

1944
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,520
No, uncle, Smiley.

1945
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,120
Take the 'e' out..so Ismail.

1946
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,840
But why paint the house again.

1947
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:58,976
We just got it painted on Diwali.

1948
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,920
But Eid's coming up, son.

1949
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Our Eid?

1950
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,080
Yes..

1951
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,800
As you said, millions
of goats are sacrificed on Eid.

1952
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,120
One more won't make a difference.

1953
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,040
Look there.
See that..

1954
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:16,400
I've even installed a stanchion
for the goat.

1955
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,320
And son, don't forget
to bring Sakeena over for Eid.

1956
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,520
Of course.

1957
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,040
Who is that?

1958
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,840
You're fiancé.

1959
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,400
Fiancé.. Sakeena?

1960
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,640
- But she can't come over, uncle.
- Why?

1961
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,920
She has gone for Hajj to Patiala.

1962
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,200
To Patiala for Hajj?

1963
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,320
I mean her aunt and
uncle live in Patiala.

1964
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,536
- She will meet them first and then leave for Hajj.
- I see..

1965
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,760
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1966
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,720
Uncle, why are you speaking in Urdu?

1967
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,520
Ignorant.

1968
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,200
Fix your pronunciation.
It's Urdu.

1969
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:55,280
And Urdu is one of the
finest and smooth language.

1970
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,280
And listen.

1971
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,440
And on that note here
a few lines from a poet..

1972
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:01,880
"I can spend from dawn to dusk
under the refuge of your tresses."

1973
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,600
"I'll do my duties in this lifetime."

1974
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,360
"If you lock eyes with me,
I'll ask for the consequences."

1975
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,720
"And if you skirt eyes,
I'll just greet you."

1976
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,200
Nice. Nice.
But I didn't get it, uncle.

1977
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,280
I didn't either.

1978
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,320
What are these bricks for?

1979
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,960
Well, son, I am not a Shahjahan
to build another Taj Mahal.

1980
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:22,480
And your future mother
has a dozen siblings.

1981
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:27,840
So I am making four tombs
up there for her siblings.

1982
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,720
- You mean rooms.
- Exactly.

1983
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,160
Come Ismail, let me show you.

1984
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,960
Take a look. See..

1985
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,440
This is where the rooms
are being constructed.

1986
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,000
- They are making the rooms right now.
- Great.

1987
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,400
My new family will
also stay here with me.

1988
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,000
And my wife.

1989
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,936
What happened, uncle?
Are you all right?

1990
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,680
My heart skips a beat
whenever I think of her.

1991
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,720
She has a mesmerising
and enchanting voice.

1992
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,440
- Really?
- Yes, son.

1993
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,720
Greetings.

1994
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,800
Yes.

1995
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,040
Mind your own business.

1996
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,640
I just wanted to say..

1997
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:12,400
That I am ready
to get married to you.

1998
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:18,840
You know what, send your
father over to fix a wedding date.

1999
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,320
My father's out of his limits?

2000
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,776
Crossing his limits or
crossing borders for Hajj?

2001
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,680
My father is crossing his limits.

2002
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,000
Fine, send him over when he returns.

2003
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:33,760
My son's good friend
Ismail is right here with me.

2004
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,360
He is like a kid.

2005
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,800
I'll give my greetings to her.

2006
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,560
Hello, mammi aunty.

2007
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,960
Hang up.

2008
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,216
This Jagjeet has lost his mind.

2009
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,520
The changes that your
father is going through.

2010
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,080
You will repent one day.

2011
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,320
Be careful.

2012
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,760
Time is so bad, even a dog's
bark sounds like advice to me.

2013
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,840
You know,
people like to take a flying arrow..

2014
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,920
But you've taken a spear.

2015
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,640
Your beloved father is
in full mood to get married.

2016
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:05,960
She was the one missing.

2017
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,040
Roma.

2018
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,440
Hello. How are you doing?

2019
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,520
What's the matter?
You seem to be in a great mood today?

2020
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,800
Yes, there is good news sister.

2021
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,040
Good news?

2022
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:22,240
Yes. I am getting
married to my boyfriend.

2023
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,520
What?

2024
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,760
This might be good news for you,
but not for me.

2025
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:28,840
Listen..

2026
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,720
- Sign.
- Move.

2027
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,360
You know that all men are dogs.

2028
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,760
No, no, my boyfriend is not a dog.

2029
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,880
He is so naive that he
still smooches me on my head.

2030
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,360
All men pretend to
be naive in the beginning.

2031
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,480
I don't want anyone to ruin your life.

2032
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,080
Pooja, I don't care if we meet up or
not, but I want to meet up with Anurag.

2033
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,560
But why meet up.
You can talk to him on the phone.

2034
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,640
Anu baby..

2035
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:54,960
Yes, Pooja.

2036
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,480
No. Not on the phone.

2037
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,120
Everyone sounds sweet
to me over the phone.

2038
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,376
Tell him I want to meet him tomorrow.
I'll text you the time and place.

2039
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,320
And listen.
Try to come over if you can.

2040
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,320
Hear me out first..

2041
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,280
She has called Pooja's
boyfriend for a meeting.

2042
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,160
Happy birthday.

2043
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,400
Firstly a woman, secondly
experienced..

2044
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,880
And thirdly a news reporter
and fourthly she is very clever.

2045
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,640
From where you'll get
Pooja's boyfriend. Online.

2046
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,320
You are dead man.

2047
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,520
Let's go fast.

2048
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,800
Let's go. Have fun.

2049
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,360
Hey stop! Over there,
that is Pooja's brother.

2050
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,280
Hey move!

2051
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,320
So, where did you meet
Pooja for the first time?

2052
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,920
We used to speak on the phone.

2053
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,760
And liked the voice very much...

2054
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,160
Her voice is mesmerising.

2055
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,400
No..she liked my voice very much.

2056
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,720
And who proposed whom?

2057
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,080
As you can guess from the face,
she did.

2058
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,680
But please don't tell her this.

2059
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,320
Ohh..sorry.

2060
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,840
You came to show
off how decent you are.

2061
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,920
Oh no, I don't drink, I never smoked.

2062
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,800
Shall I order juice instead?

2063
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,320
Hmm?

2064
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,360
Bloody uncool sh**

2065
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,400
Will you judge my decency
by whether I drink or not.

2066
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,760
In that case,
you're completely spoiled.

2067
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,400
Smoking and drinking
can be bad habits..

2068
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:01,880
But not signs of
a bad character, ma'am.

2069
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,320
How dare you?

2070
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,320
Is this a way you talk to a woman?

2071
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,040
I am calling Pooja right now.

2072
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,120
Wait!

2073
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,560
Call her.

2074
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,360
Yes, I am calling her..

2075
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,040
I will show you.

2076
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,880
How was Anurag?

2077
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,800
Don't mind if he gets a little angry.

2078
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,640
He looks cute even
when he loses his temper.

2079
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:27,040
I knew it.
You will like her too.

2080
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,160
- I am so lucky.
- Pooja...

2081
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,640
Happy?

2082
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,240
Everyone in this world is wrong.

2083
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,600
The right one is with good intentions.

2084
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,320
And yes..your whiskey
was way more classy than you are.

2085
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,320
And don't forget.

2086
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,360
I love Pooja.

2087
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,200
And I will marry her.
Will give her my everything. Okay.

2088
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,840
Radhe-Radhe!

2089
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:54,960
Who is she?

2090
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,040
- This place isn't for you.
- But why?

2091
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,040
- What are you doing here?
- Shopping.

2092
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,120
Of all the places..

2093
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,200
Karam.

2094
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,360
Mahi. What are you doing here?

2095
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:07,680
Shopping.

2096
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,840
What are you doing here?

2097
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,760
I came here for a meeting.
Let's go.

2098
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,240
Oh my, God.

2099
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,880
So you are Pooja.

2100
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,960
Hi. Roma.

2101
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,040
I am not Pooja. I am Mahi.

2102
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,000
His future wife.

2103
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,120
What?

2104
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,000
Bloody two-timer.

2105
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,600
You're either cheating on Pooja or her?

2106
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,160
- She is drunk.
- What?

2107
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,680
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

2108
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,536
She can't talk nonsense
even if she is drunk.

2109
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,800
What do you mean?

2110
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,440
This man is a fraud and a cheat.

2111
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,880
He came to meet me
as Pooja's boyfriend.

2112
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,120
Which Pooja are you talking about?

2113
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,480
She's my phone-a-friend.

2114
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,640
That Pooja.
But I love her.

2115
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,720
Mahi.

2116
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,920
What?

2117
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,600
But Pooja said she loves Anurag.

2118
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,760
I see..
Now, who is this Anurag?

2119
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,120
This Anurag.

2120
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,880
She is definitely high.

2121
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,480
You are mistaken.
He is not Anurag. He is Karam.

2122
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,360
Yes.

2123
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,760
He is no Karam. This guy's Anurag.

2124
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,600
She is lying. She is lying.

2125
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:06,840
Let's go, Mahi.

2126
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,360
If she's lying, Karam,
then why don't you tell us the truth.

2127
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,920
It's a long story, Mahi.
I'll tell you sometime later.

2128
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Tell me now, Karam.

2129
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,840
- I'll tell you some other day..
- You must clear everything right now!

2130
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,120
You are lying.

2131
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:23,920
Roma.

2132
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,880
Pooja. What's the name.

2133
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,680
- Mahi. Listen to me.
- Brother-in-law.

2134
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,720
This is completely unfair.

2135
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,480
- You screwed both of us.
- Get lost.

2136
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,320
You get lost.

2137
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,240
Move, please.

2138
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,920
Mahi. Mahi, listen to me.

2139
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,960
Wait. Where are you going?

2140
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,040
Give me a chance to explain.
Please..

2141
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,920
- Hello, bro..
- Get lost.

2142
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,360
I am in a bad mood.

2143
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:45,760
Ohh, don't spoil my mood.

2144
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,816
I meant I am already in a bad mood,
you don't have to spoil yours.

2145
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,000
Please tell me honestly.
How do you know Pooja?

2146
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,520
I love Pooja.

2147
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,960
How can you love her?

2148
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,120
I love Pooja..sister.

2149
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,080
What sister?

2150
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,136
The other day you were trying to be so
sturdy. But now you're being so mellow.

2151
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,936
You know what he was saying.
He'll hack me to pieces.

2152
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,320
- Beat him.
- Beat me.

2153
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,160
Come on, beat me. There my
sister Pooja's husband is beating her.

2154
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,440
You beat me.

2155
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,680
- Pooja's husband?
- Yes.

2156
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:09,840
He's a pain in the neck.

2157
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,960
Pooja never told
me that she is married.

2158
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,040
How could she?
His demands never end.

2159
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,400
Save her, brother-in-law.

2160
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,160
- Brother-in-law?
- Yes.

2161
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,240
Now we are family. Don't worry.

2162
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,680
I'll show you how
Gujjar's batter.

2163
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,640
This is your brother-in-law's promise.

2164
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,240
- Come on.
- Yes, come on.

2165
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,360
How dare he touch my Pooja.

2166
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:31,440
Don't come any closer.

2167
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:33,200
Don't..or else I will kill you.

2168
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,440
Kill her.

2169
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,520
Wiseguy..how dare you touch my Pooja.

2170
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,320
Your Pooja.

2171
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,416
What is he saying, sister?

2172
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,120
Beat him.

2173
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,480
What beat him?
Let's talk.

2174
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,920
- Wait. How was the recording?
- Don't ask.

2175
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,240
Rickshaw.

2176
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,816
- But what happened?
- No one's stopping.

2177
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,640
I'll tell you later. Rickshaw.

2178
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,000
Rickshaw.

2179
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,320
- Where are you going?
- Wait a minute.

2180
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,440
- Where is sister-in-law?
- She is at home.

2181
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,720
Order's cancelled.

2182
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,960
Rickshaw.

2183
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,160
Wait. I have my own bike.

2184
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,920
There she is.

2185
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,680
Mahi.

2186
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,920
Stay with her.
This is not a race.

2187
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,320
Wait a minute.

2188
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,640
At least tell me why you're hitting me.

2189
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,296
At least tell me why you're hitting me.

2190
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,776
- What do you want?
- Save me, sister.

2191
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,600
No need to worry. I am here now.

2192
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,120
Mahi. Mahi, wait.

2193
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,800
Listen to me, Mahi.

2194
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,040
Lower that volume.

2195
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:35,080
It's Daler Mehndi,
he sings this loud even in low volumes.

2196
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,240
Then turn it off.

2197
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,400
Mahi, listen.
Listen to me, Mahi.

2198
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,880
Just listen to me.

2199
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,400
Listen to what, Karam.

2200
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,000
And who are you?

2201
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,320
It's me..Toto.

2202
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,760
We used to romance over the phone.

2203
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,640
I even made a tattoo of your name.
Pujja.

2204
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,640
My name is Roma.

2205
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,480
And the spelling is wrong.

2206
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,280
But my love is real.

2207
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,520
If you love someone else
then why are you marrying me?

2208
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,080
Mahi, I only love
you and not some Pooja.

2209
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,480
But you couldn't say
this in front of that girl.

2210
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,560
I had imagined so many
things about you, Karam.

2211
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,160
And you are still lying to me.

2212
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,240
What is the confusion?

2213
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,880
You say that you love Pooja.
So does he.

2214
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,280
Even I love her.

2215
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,640
Who is Pooja?

2216
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,176
And why is everyone taking her name?

2217
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,280
Oh, God. And you think
I have an affair with her.

2218
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,960
Yes. I do.

2219
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:20,640
Mahi.

2220
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,040
Mahi, wait.

2221
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,240
I don't understand one thing.

2222
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,240
You sound so sweet over the phone.

2223
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,280
But in reality, you sound a bit hoarse.

2224
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,040
You think I sound hoarse.

2225
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,640
I said I am not Pooja.

2226
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,800
Save me. Save me.

2227
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,480
Catch him.

2228
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,480
This way..

2229
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Come on.

2230
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,760
Catch him.

2231
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,320
What is this Pooja's matter?

2232
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,200
Step on it, man.

2233
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:52,560
Pooja. That Anurag is a fraud.

2234
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,600
Curse you.
Trying to ruin people's lives.

2235
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,240
Bloody drunk woman. Hang up.

2236
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,400
Who was that?

2237
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,080
- Mahi. Just listen to me.
- No, Karam.

2238
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,800
Fine, Then here is the truth.

2239
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,400
I love Pooja.

2240
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,880
I love her and we're one.
One heart and soul.

2241
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:12,200
- Stop the rickshaw.
- You too.

2242
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,440
- What did you say?
- I love you.

2243
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,440
Pooja and I are one heart and soul.

2244
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Pooja is that lovely.

2245
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,280
Not just me.

2246
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:28,120
Your brother Mahinder as well as
your father-in-law love her a lot.

2247
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:29,280
What?

2248
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,560
I do. I do. I do.

2249
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:35,240
The marriage gets solomonized
if you repeat it three times.

2250
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:36,920
I'll say it again louder.

2251
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,120
Do you want the entire city to hear?

2252
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,976
If you use up all your
strength at the wedding..

2253
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,640
Then what will you
do on your wedding night?

2254
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,520
Payal, Pankhudi, Jyoti, Yasmeen..

2255
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:49,800
Where is Pooja, Karam?

2256
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,240
Pooja.

2257
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,200
Pooja's here too.

2258
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,240
Where, Karam?

2259
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,240
Karam?

2260
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,720
Karam?

2261
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,160
Hello. Pooja speaking.

2262
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,640
How are you?

2263
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:11,720
I am fine.

2264
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,760
I'll call you later. Please.

2265
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,880
Okay, bye. Love you, take care.

2266
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,400
Karam is Pooja.

2267
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,400
Pooja who cannot exist without Karam.

2268
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,760
And Karam not without you.

2269
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:41,640
Why didn't you tell me before?

2270
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,600
No job, and debts to pay.

2271
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,360
Even I am in love with this Pooja.

2272
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,920
Hi, Pooja baby..

2273
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:02,800
'The work that isn't getting
done... something something...'

2274
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,040
This is Mahi. My fiancé.

2275
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,160
Ohh..

2276
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,920
She came to see Pooja.

2277
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,400
You told her everything.

2278
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,760
Isn't that what you wanted?

2279
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,560
This is Mr. W.

2280
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,240
He runs this call centre.

2281
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:25,200
He came into my life as a guide
but soon turned selfish.

2282
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:32,160
He threatened to expose me if I quit.

2283
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,480
No.

2284
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,640
You are a scum.

2285
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:43,280
You should be grateful to everyone
here, who is a breadwinner for you.

2286
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,440
What are you without them?

2287
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,680
You sound better than him.

2288
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:53,720
If you're under some kind of debt,
I'll clear it for you.

2289
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,600
You..

2290
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,640
Don't forget.

2291
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:03,480
Pooja is a man.

2292
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,000
Pooja!

2293
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,760
Karam. Karam.

2294
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,160
Where are you hiding?

2295
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,680
Green house.
I think I am in the wrong house.

2296
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,240
Mahinder. Greetings.

2297
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:45,760
How is everyone?

2298
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,400
Didn't you recognise me?

2299
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,920
It's Jagjeet. Uncle Jagjeet.

2300
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,080
Radhe-Radhe Uncle.

2301
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,200
Hello.

2302
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,080
What happened to you?

2303
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:58,320
Forget about me,
what happened to you?

2304
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,280
Nothing, uncle.
I had a fight.

2305
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,480
Sorry to tell you son,
but you got beaten up.

2306
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,560
Yes, that.

2307
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,640
- What happened?
- I am being wronged.

2308
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,480
What happened?

2309
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,776
You are so decent and your
son Karam's completely opposite.

2310
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,800
What did he do now?

2311
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,400
The girl I love and want to marry..

2312
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,960
- He is chasing after her.
- What?

2313
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:18,920
There's someone else
in his life other than Mahi.

2314
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:19,760
Yes, uncle.

2315
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,520
Who?

2316
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,160
Her name is Pooja.

2317
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,120
Pooja who?

2318
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:28,760
A girl with whom I fell in love
while talking on the phone.

2319
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,240
- Phone-a-friend Pooja?
- Yes.

2320
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:32,760
My Pooja.

2321
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,120
Exclaims.

2322
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:40,640
My son Karam is romancing
his future mother.

2323
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,320
Future mother.
What nonsense.

2324
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,960
It's not nonsense.

2325
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,040
I am in love with her.

2326
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,440
I am madly in love with her.

2327
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:50,240
And her real name isn't Pooja,
her name is Zubeida.

2328
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,600
Radhe-Radhe! What a shameless family.

2329
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,376
- What shameless.
- Father and son after the same girl.

2330
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,120
Mahinder. Mahinder.

2331
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,000
Uncle, they are the
guys that beat me up.

2332
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,320
Who are you?

2333
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,200
Your wedding hasn't been fixed yet..

2334
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,800
And your family members
are already showing up.

2335
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,280
Uncle, I am not his family.

2336
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,640
I am Pooja's future husband.

2337
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,240
- Huh..
- Allah..what kind of a woman is she?

2338
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,920
She has entraped every variety of
man.

2339
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,160
Except for me.

2340
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,240
- Hey, Priest..don't provoke me.
- Get lost.

2341
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:21,000
- Pooja is only mine.
- Hey..

2342
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,560
If anyone comes between
Pooja and me then I will kill him.

2343
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,720
But son, Zubeida is mine.

2344
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,120
- Zubeida who?
- I am leaving.

2345
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,840
- Stay seated.
- But I have to pee.

2346
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,480
Hold it.

2347
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,856
Where on earth did you come from?
Who are you?

2348
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,320
- I am here for the wedding.
- Here..

2349
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,280
Another one..

2350
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,200
I can control my pee..

2351
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,480
But someone control that woman.

2352
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,880
That woman has more lovers..

2353
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,920
Than we have devotees in the mosque.

2354
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,360
By wedding I mean..

2355
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:53,616
Karam called me over to
collect advance for the wedding.

2356
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,520
Are you going to play
that DJ at his funeral?

2357
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:57,080
- What nonsense.
- Advance.

2358
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,320
Get lost. Boys beat him up.

2359
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,480
Uncle, we dealt with him.

2360
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,360
- Now I will deal with your son.
- No?

2361
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,720
You won't lay a finger on my son.

2362
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,560
I will deal with my son.

2363
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:11,280
He betrayed his own father.

2364
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,800
And romancing with his future mother.
Romancing with his future mother.

2365
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,680
I swear I won't spare him.

2366
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,840
He betrayed his father.

2367
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,760
Mahi, this pretending to be Pooja,
the job at the call centre..

2368
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:27,360
Was I wrong?

2369
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,320
I once heard someone say..

2370
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,240
Everyone in this world is wrong.

2371
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,880
The right one is with good intentions.

2372
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,800
Don't think about any of this.

2373
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,440
Krishna Leela is today right?

2374
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:50,920
I want to see how my Krishna
looks when dressed like Radha.

2375
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:58,880
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> There goes Radha. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

2376
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,040
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> There goes Radha. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

2377

2378

her at the banks of Yamuna. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Radhe-Radhe-Radhe. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>
Move

2411
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:56,080
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Without you Krishna's love is incomplete. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>
Move from here

2412
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:58,800
Get lost.

2413
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,200
Out. Out.

2414
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,880
The show's over. The show's over.

2415
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,080
Stop this charade. Stop it!

2416
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:08,040
How dare you touch our Karam?

2417
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,880
Our Radha?

2418
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,040
This Radha is not
worthy of your respect!

2419
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:15,760
If you weren't portraying Radha..

2420
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,736
I would've turned
this place into your grave.

2421
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,800
Hold on.

2422
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,680
Tell me what has he done.

2423
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,920
Murder.

2424
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,800
- Murder?
- Murder?

2425
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,360
Yes... My Pooja's murder.

2426
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,360
Uncle.

2427
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,640
And this man must have told you this.

2428
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,080
Karam can never kill Pooja.

2429
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:34,240
He is lying.

2430
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,240
It's not a lie.
I am sure he killed Pooja.

2431
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,480
He came to the hospital to threaten me.

2432
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:42,160
And he claimed that
he will hack Pooja to pieces.

2433
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,320
Come on.

2434
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,680
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

2435
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,080
To destroy myself..in love.

2436
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:51,600
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

2437
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,760
Be the sweet nectar of my love.

2438
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,360
How do you know this poetry?

2439
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,800
Only Pooja and I know about it.

2440
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,440
Even I knew Pooja.

2441
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,320
She was very nice.

2442
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,240
Where did he go?

2443
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:14,360
Where did he go?

2444
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:16,920
- Catch him.
- Don't let him go.

2445
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,200
Check there.

2446
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:20,600
- Catch him.
- I won't run!

2447
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,360
Even I loved Pooja.

2448
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,200
Then why did you kill her?

2449
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,280
If I can create her,
then I can kill her.

2450
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:43,800
This little bundle of joy and
a great friend had to die one day.

2451
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,040
She could easily win over people.

2452
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,440
When Pooja used to say..

2453
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,600
"Hello.."

2454
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,800
"Pooja speaking."

2455
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:07,720
I am Pooja.

2456
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,840
When I got talking to people,
I realised..

2457
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:18,080
That our population might be
increasing, but so is loneliness.

2458
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:22,160
Today we have thousands of friends
over Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

2459
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:25,560
But do you have one
true friend in real life?

2460
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:32,480
Someone who can listen to you,
understand you?

2461
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,760
And this loneliness
has increased to an extent..

2462
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,560
That no one bothers
to take a family picture.

2463
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,960
Everyone's only worried about selfies.

2464
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,040
And for these lonely people,
along came..

2465
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:48,800
This Pooja.

2466
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,760
While talking to people
I gradually understood..

2467
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:58,280
That every person
in this world needs Pooja.

2468
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,440
And Pooja is not a gender.

2469
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:07,800
Anyone like your friends,
family, relatives, wife, children..

2470
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:10,680
Anyone can be your Pooja.

2471
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,760
Someone you can open your heart to.

2472
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:19,720
Someone who can make you
realise that you are not alone.

2473
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,480
And the day you find your Pooja..

2474
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,280
You won't need some
phone-a-friend Pooja anymore.

2475
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,880
Now, do all of you
know the truth of Pooja?

2476
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,440
Now, what is Mr. W's truth?

2477
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,680
He will only be able
to tell us where Pooja is.

2478
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:48,040
I just did. He must have killed her.

2479
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,040
Leave me. Come on - Leave me.

2480
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:52,400
She is the real Pooja.

2481
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,120
Tell them. Tell them the truth.

2482
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,760
I am Pooja.

2483
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,320
And Mr. W paid me to do this.

2484
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,040
You bloody..

2485
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:08,320
Trying to make a fool out of me,
are you?

2486
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:11,600
Arrest him. Take him away.

2487
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,040
Let's go.

2488
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:25,280
I have a question.

2489
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,480
Are you Pooja?

2490
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,400
Yes.

2491
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,560
Marry me.

2492
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,760
Here.

2493
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,680
Rajpal Kirar.

2494
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:36,040
You think your wife's too short.

2495
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,816
You should be thankful
that you got married.

2496
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,600
- Really?
- No romance at home.

2497
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:40,640
Always arguing.

2498
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:43,600
If you stay out all night working,
then where will the romance come from.

2499
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,880
My sweet naive Mahinder.

2500
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:49,000
- Come here, my super singer.
- Hey Brother-in-law, listen to me.

2501
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,280
- Marry me. Marry me.
- No..No.

2502
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,080
- Trying to woo girls with your voice.
- No.

2503
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,736
If a good voice was
enough to woo girls..

2504
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,200
Then no singer would
ever focus on singing.

2505
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:58,160
- I made a mistake sorry..
- Maary me come on.

2506
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:00,560
Toto..where are you going?

2507
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:05,800
You know those sweet messages
children write on wedding cards.

2508
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,960
You're even younger than those kids.

2509
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,320
Minor.

2510
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:13,440
Ma'am. You've lost faith in men.

2511
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:18,080
Just because you had three bad bananas,
you want to crush the entire bunch.

2512
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:20,360
You should be ashamed.

2513
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:22,880
All of you should be ashamed.

2514
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,720
To become crazy about my innocent son.

2515
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:26,880
Ignorants.

2516
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,600
O Uncle.

2517
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:29,760
Yes.

2518
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,760
Papa aka Rahul aka
Jagjeet aka Mehendi Hassan.

2519
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:35,600
Dreaming of a honeymoon
when you should be praying.

2520
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,840
Son..i made a big mistake.

2521
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,600
Swear on that benevolent Lord.

2522
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:49,480
I had no clue that I was dreaming
about my own son to my bride.

2523
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:53,040
Wow.. So strong Urdu vocabulary

2524
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:56,120
I've been trying to teach this
man computers for past three years.

2525
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,320
But he couldn't learn.

2526
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:59,440
But you learnt Urdu
for a girl in three days.

2527
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,960
And he turned Mathura
into mini Karachi.

2528
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,240
Marry me.

2529
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:04,696
Marry me.
Who is it going to marry me?

2530
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:07,160
Marry me.
Kirar sir. Marry me.

2531
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,960
Marry me.
Madam, you marry me.

2532
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:13,560
- Who wants to marry me?
- I do.

2533
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:28,920
I've been asking you
to marry me for so long.
