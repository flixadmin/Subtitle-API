169
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,731
I pulled this off of some guy

Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

178
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,418
Word's come down from the Commissioner,

179
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,464
you find someone with one of those,
they walk.

180
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,090
And before you get on your high horse,

181
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,547
three months ago,
this city was in a tailspin.

182
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,930
We survived because Penguin
took control of the underworld.

183
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,643
I'm not giving this city over
to Penguin.

184
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,765
I don't care what the Commissioner says.

What about your fellow cops, huh?

186
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,061
The past month, how many have been shot?
None.

187
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,141
I know the stats.

188
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,936
Jim, we will bust Penguin one day,
I promise you.

189
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,439
But this city has to get back
on her feet, please?

190
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,773
Harvey, I get that,

191
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,240
but every day the citizens
of Gotham look to Penguin

192
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,241
and not the GCPD to keep them safe,

193
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,997
the harder it's gonna be
to win them back.

194

You want people to trust cops,

195
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,669
there are better ways of doing it
than spitting in Penguin's eyes.

196
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,667
You see one of these,

197
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,456

ALFRED: Bloody Penguin.

199
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,271
There must be some way
we can turn this against him.

200
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,570
Just stop. Stop, right there.

201

How does this fit into what we're doing?

202
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,198
What was the initial reason
that you popped on that mask,

203
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,278
and you went out there?

204
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,448
We agreed that I have to be ready
for when Ra's al Ghul returns.

You yourself said there's no substitute
for real world encounters.

206

But my point is, if that is our mission,
we must hold to it.

for what happened.

210

And more than that, I can make
a difference in Gotham, Alfred.

Wasn't sure what to do with it.

419
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,874
One of Penguin's licenses.

420
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,421
Apparently, crime is legal now.

421
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,969
And you're going along with that?

422
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,211
Not really.

423
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,508
There's a number on the license.

424
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,761
I was thinking Penguin must have
some sort of master list.

425
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,144
Connecting the crime and the criminal
to the license issue.

426
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,850
List like that would tell you
not only who committed that crime,

427
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,816
but crimes that haven't even
happened yet.

428
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,648
Unfortunately, the judges

429
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,108
are going along with the licenses,

430
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,571
and trying to track down

431
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,494
who in Penguin's organization
keeps the list

432
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,496
would set off too many alarms.

You just said
you were out tracking a gang.

It's different.

437
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,506
This gang isn't licensed.

438
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,219
But Penguin will come after them,
if he hasn't already,

439
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,554
and when he catches them,

440
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,886
it'll be more proof
that Gotham doesn't need the GCPD.

Sorry, it's been a long day.

So, why not use Penguin
to lead you to them?

If I could figure out
how to do that, I would.

464

The rumor is you're issuing them.

465
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,951
Tell me, what is the crime rate
in Gotham?

In his final lucid moments,

You've had a nice run, Oswald,
but it's over.

Oh, Jim, it's so hard to admit
when you've become irrelevant.

Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

497

I'm going to find this gang

hoping to arrest them
before they cause mass panic

650
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,124
In the weeks to come,

651
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,967
you will hear whispers

652
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,090
about what's happening
on the streets of Gotham.

653
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,093
All you need to know is

654
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,933
without me, this is what you get.

655
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,554
Men who want to bring fear
back to our city.

Who promise a return to the old days.

00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,481
So, tell your families,

00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,278
tell your friends,

659
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:25,616
it is Oswald Cobblepot
who keeps them safe.

00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,290
I have my things in the car,
we can stop them in the parking garage.

663
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,919
Absolutely not, Master Bruce.

664
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,510
Alfred, Penguin's gonna take
those men out and kill them.

665
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,586
Undoubtedly so.

666
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,047
But, as you said before,
you can make a difference.

667

There is time for masks,
and there is a time for Bruce Wayne.

what's going to be done to you?

670

you're gonna do with those men.

You need not concern yourself with that.

to the police?

Earlier tonight, you thanked me
for making the city safer.

00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,200
Now, how do you think that happened?

I do the dirty work no one else will.

00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,051

turn those men over to the police.

You're young.
