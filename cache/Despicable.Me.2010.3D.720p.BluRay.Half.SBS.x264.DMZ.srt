1
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,552
Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?

2
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:48,260
Justin!

3
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:50,453
Quick, honey, take my picture.

4
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,339
I got the pyramid in my hand.

5
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:03,469
Justin, you get back here right now!

6
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:05,432
No, stop!
Stop him!

7
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:07,267
No, no, no, no, no!
Go back! Don't climb!

8
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:14,036
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

9
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:15,436
Easy, little boy.

10
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:17,947
Ok, stop, child!

11
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,116
Stop right there. No!

12
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:21,562
No, no, no, no, no, no!

13
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,622
There he goes.

14
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,201
Justin!

15
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,111
I've got him! I've got him!

16
00:02:57,634 --> 00:03:00,091
<i>Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered</i>

17
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:02,764
<i>that the Great Pyramid
of Giza had been stolen</i>

18
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,497
<i>and replaced by a giant

19
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,943
<i>There is panic throughout the

20
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,343

21
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,731
<i>Law enforcement still has no leads,</i>

22
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,264
<i>leaving everyone to wonder,</i>

23
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,646
<i>which of the world's villains</i>

24
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:20,139
<i>is responsible for this heinous crime?</i>

25
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:22,129
<i>And where will he strike next?</i>

26
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:22,357
Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
Freeze ray!

27
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,070
Morning, Gru!

28
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:02,858
How you doing?

29
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,247
Hello, Fred.

30
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:06,206
F.Y.I.

31
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:10,321
Your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,

32
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,730
and I don't appreciate it.

33
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,486
Sorry. You know dogs.

34
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,124
They go wherever they want to go.

35
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:17,712
Unless they're dead.

36
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:21,944
I'm joking!

37
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,254
Although, it is true.

38
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,946
Anyway, have a good one.

39
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:28,046
Ok...

40
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:29,396
Yeah.

41
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:56,061
You've got to be pulling on my leg!

42
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:00,809
Hello!

43
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:03,399
Cookies for sale.

44
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,792
Go away.
I'm not home.

45
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,280
Yes, you are.
I heard you.

46
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:13,433
No, you didn't.
This...

47
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,344
is a recording.

48
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:18,539
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

49
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,117
Watch this.

50
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,012
Leave a message,

51
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,466
beep.

52
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,157
Goodbye, recorded message.

53
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,430
Agnes, come on.

54
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,599
Kyle! Bad dog!

55
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,405
No! No, no. Sit.

56
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,932
My muffin.

57
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:47,673
<i>Gru!</i>

61

62
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:00,787
<i>one of the greats.</i>

63
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,474

<i>It's all over the news!</i>

65
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,269
<i>Some fella just stole a pyramid.</i>

66
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,778
<i>They're saying he makes

67
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:11,106
<i>lame.</i>

68
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,979
Assemble the minions!

69
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,581
Una. Due.

70
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,676
Minions, assemble!

71
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:50,853
Ok. Ok.

72
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:53,956
Tre.

73
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,222
Hey! Hey!

74
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,813
Matalaki mataloko viva!

75
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,650
Matalaki.

76
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,526
Speeda. Speeda.

77
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,781
Matalaki. Le big Boss.

78
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,405
Looking good, Kevin!

79
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,733
How is the family, good?

80
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:50,665
Alright.

81
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,536
That's my Billy boy!

82
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,888
What up, Larry?

83
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,838
Hello, everybody!

84
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,431
Yeah, alright!

85
00:08:58,713 --> 00:08:59,880
Simmer down.

86
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,358
Simmer down!

87
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,794
Thank you, ok.

88
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,592
Now, I realise that you guys
probably heard,

89
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,200
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

90
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,644
Apparently, it's a big deal.

91
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:15,272
People are calling it the crime
of the century and stuff like that.

92
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,228
But!

93
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:17,722
Am I upset?

94
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,445
No, I am not!

95
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,175
A little, but...

96
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:26,117
we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,

97
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:27,688
and you guys...

98
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,519
are alright in my book.

99
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,834
No, no raises!

100
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:34,674
You're not going to get any raises.

101
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:37,016
What did we do?

102
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,454
Well,

103
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:43,244
we stole the Times Square JumboTron!

104
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:44,953
Nice!

105
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,398
That's how I roll.

106
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,320
Yeah, you all like watching,

107
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:52,963
football on that?

108
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:55,060
But that's not all.

109
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:58,651
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

110
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,077
Yeah!

111
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,590
the small one from Las Vegas.

112
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:07,026
And I won't even mention
the Eiffel Tower!

113
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,661
Also Vegas.

114
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,773
Ok, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,

115
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:12,278
but...

116
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:16,629
I have been working
on something very big!

117
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:21,665
Something that will blow this
pyramid thing out of the water!

118
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:26,669
And thanks to the efforts of
my good friend, Dr Nefario...

119
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,083
Thank you!

120
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:29,764
There he is.

121
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,475
He's styling.

122
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:35,380
Now, we have located a shrink ray,

123
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,528
in a secret lab,

124
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,215
and once we take this shrink ray,

125
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:43,926
we will have the capability,

126
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:47,731
to pull off the true crime of the century.

127
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:51,301
We are going to steal...

128
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,700
Wait, wait!

129
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:57,610
I haven't told you what it is yet.

130
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:01,892
Hey.

131
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:04,710
Dave, listen up, please.

132
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:12,349
Next, we are going to steal,

133
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,678
pause for effect,

134
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:18,148
the moon!

135
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,963
And once the moon is mine,

136
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:27,636
the world will give me whatever
I want to get it back!

137
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:33,876
And I will be the greatest villain
of all time!

138
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:40,329
That's what I'm talking about.

139
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:43,162
Yes?

140
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,172
Hello, Gru?

141
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:46,781
I've been crunching some numbers,

142
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,125
and I really don't see
how we can afford this.

143
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,785
It can't be done.

144
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,213
I'm not a miracle worker.

145
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,871
Hey, chillax.

146
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,695
I'll just get another loan from the bank.

147
00:11:57,697 --> 00:11:58,916
They love me!

148
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,079
Edith, stop it!

149
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,882
What?
I'm just walking.

150
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:32,645
Hi, Miss Hattie.

151
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:33,719
We're back.

152
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:37,902
Hello, girls!

153
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:40,646
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

154
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,231
Let me think.

155
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:45,048
No!

156
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,238
Edith!

157
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:51,419
What did you put on my desk?

158
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:52,955
A mud pie.

159
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,457
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.

160
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,238
You know that, don't you?

161
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,612
Yeah, I know.

162
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,637
Good.

163
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,450
So, how did it go, girls?

164
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,411
Did we meet our quotas?

165
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:06,176
Sort of.

166
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,248
We sold 43 mini-mints,

167
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,885
30 choco-swirlies and 18 coco-nutties.

168
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:14,619
Ok.

169
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:18,934
Well, you say that like
it's a great sale day.

170
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:20,859
Look at my face!

171
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:24,659
Do you still think it's a great sale day?

172
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,639
Eighteen coco-nutties.

173
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:32,542
I think we can do a little better
than that, don't you?

174
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:34,342
Yeah.

175
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,230
We would not want to spend
the weekend in the Box of Shame,

176
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,094
would we? No.

177
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:40,697
No, Miss Hattie.

178
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:42,746
Ok, good. Off you go.

179
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:44,193
Go clean something of mine.

180
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:47,546
Hi, Penny.
Hi, Penny.

181
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:48,738
Hi, guys.

182
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,162
Hello, Mom.

183
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:57,020
Sorry, I meant to call, but...

184
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:00,678
I just wanted to congratulate
you on stealing the pyramid.

185
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:03,399
<i>That was you, wasn't it?</i>

186
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:06,680
Or was it a villain
who's actually successful?

187
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,701
Just so you know Mom,

188
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:11,030
I am about to do something

189
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,630
that's very, very big,

190
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:13,970
very important.

191
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,814
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

192
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:19,845
Good luck with that.

193
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,051
Ok, I'm out of here.

194
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:32,120
Gru to see Mr Perkins.

195
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:34,840
Yes, please have a seat.

196
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,831
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

197
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,425
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

198
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:54,284
Ma,

199
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,238
someday I'm going
to go to the moon.

200
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,731
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

201
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,958
NASA isn't sending
the monkeys any more.

202
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:11,464
Hey.

203
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:21,054
I'm applying for a new villain loan.

204
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:23,185
Go by the name of Vector.

205
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,676
It's a mathematical term,

206
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,594
a quantity represented by an arrow,

207
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:34,150
with both direction and magnitude.

208
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,324
Vector!

209
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:40,131
That's me,

210
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,932
because I'm committing crimes,

211
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:45,226
with both direction and magnitude.

212
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:46,871
Oh, yeah!

213
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:50,637
Check out my new weapon.

214
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,101
Piranha gun!

215
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:53,024
Oh, yes!

216
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:54,676
Fires live piranhas.

217
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:56,861
Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.

218
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:58,374
Do you want a demonstration?

219
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,494
So difficult, sometimes,

220
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,327
to get the piranha back inside of my...

221
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:07,396
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.

222
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:09,431
So, all I need...

223
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:12,232
is money from the bank
to build a rocket.

224
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:15,487
And then, the moon is ours.

225
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:17,789
Well, very nice presentation.

226
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,230
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

227
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:23,480
Absolutely! Will do.

228
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:25,170
Soon as I have it.

229
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:27,187
You don't have it?

230
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:31,312
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

231
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:33,939
Apparently.

232
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,130
Do you have any idea

233
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:39,315
of the capital that this bank
has invested in you, Gru?

234
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:42,000
With far too few of your sinister

235
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:44,584
plots actually turning a profit.

236
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:46,088
How can I put it?

237
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:48,943
Let's say this apple is you.

238
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,420
If we don't start getting our money back...

239
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:54,910
Get the picture?

240
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,829
Look, Gru, the point is,

241
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:00,805
there are a lot of
new villains out there,

242
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,043
younger than you,

243
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,449
hungrier than you,

244
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:05,272
younger than you.

245
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,931
Like that young fellow out
there named Vector.

246
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,645
He just stole a pyramid!

247
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:16,172
I've got it. I've got it.

248
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:20,570
So, as far as getting money
for the rocket...

249
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:21,685
Get the shrink ray,

250
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:23,482
then we'll talk.

251
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,119
Suckers!

252
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,483
Suckers!

253
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:09,183
We got it!

254
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,784
What?

255
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:18,495
Hey! Hey!

256
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,710
What! Hey!

257
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:23,195
No, no, no, no, no!

258
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:27,155
You!

259
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:34,244
<i>Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!</i>

260
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,393
<i>So long, Gru!</i>

261
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:39,927
Quick!
We can't let him get away!

262
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,465
Up ahead! Up ahead!

263
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:52,311
Fire! Fire, now!

264
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,147
You missed me!

265
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:04,582
Come to papa!

266
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:18,772
Take that.

267
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,442
How adorable.

268
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:25,662
Got you in our sights!

269
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:29,344
Like taking candy from a... What?

270
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,394
Hey, Gru!

271
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:34,416
Try this on for...

272
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:35,864
size!

273
00:21:37,957 --> 00:21:40,140
That's weird.
What is going...

274
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,186
This is claustrophobic!

275
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:49,683
No, no, no!

276
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:56,318
Too small!

277
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,920
This is too small for me!

278
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,986
I hate that guy!

279
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,788
And please watch over us,

280
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:16,889
and bless that we'll
have a good night's sleep.

281
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,278
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears

282
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:23,295
and lay eggs in our brains.

283
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,730
Great.

284
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:26,028
Thanks for that image, Edith.

285
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,640
And please bless that someone
will adopt us soon,

286
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,214
and that the mommy
and daddy will be nice

287
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:34,567
and have a pet unicorn.

288
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:36,257
Amen.

289
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:37,782
Amen.

Cool.

303
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:03,958
Hi!

304
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:06,946
We're orphans from Miss
Hattie's Home for Girls.

305
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:09,158
<i>I don't care. Beat it!</i>
Come on!

306
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:12,230
<i>We're selling cookies so, you know,
we can have a better future.</i>

307
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,386
<i>Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?</i>

308
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,309
Yeah.

309
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,504
Light bulb.

310
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,226
Dr Nefario!
<i>What?</i>

311
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:47,491
I'm going to need a dozen tiny
robots disguised as cookies!

312
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:48,183
<i>What?</i>

313
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:49,481
Cookie robots!

314
00:25:49,563 --> 00:25:50,324
<i>Who is this?</i>

315
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:51,621
Oh, forget it.

316
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:01,405
Well, it appears you have
cleared our background check,

317
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:03,773
Dr Gru.

318
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,693
And I see you have made a...

319
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:12,649
list of some of your personal
achievements.

320
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,769
Thank you for that.
I love reading.

321
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:26,158
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

322
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,147
and a knighthood.

323
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,439
Me, me, me.
Me, me, me.

324
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:33,085
Kevin?

325
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:37,383
You had your own cooking show

326
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:41,007
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

327
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:43,195
It's not that impressive.

328
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:46,193
Idiot!

329
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:51,425
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

330
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:55,047
What in the name of...

331
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,134
What?

332
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:57,862
Well,

333
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,055
here's the dealio.

334
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:05,279
Things have been
so lonely since my wife,

335
00:27:06,978 --> 00:27:07,813
Debbie,

336
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,307
passed on.

337
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:10,641
It's like...

338
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:12,635
my heart is a tooth,

339
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,040
and it's got a cavity,

340
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:15,812
that...

341
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:18,225
can only be filled with children.

342
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:19,768
I'm sorry.

343
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:27,574
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

344
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:30,266
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

345
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:33,543
You have a face,

346
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:35,614
como un burro.
<font color="#ffff00"><i>like a donkey.</i></font>

347
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:39,944
Well,

348
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:41,386
thank you!

349
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:46,897
Anyway, can we proceed
with this adoption?

350
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:48,709
So, so excited!

351
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:53,705
Please tell Margo,
Edith and Agnes to come to the lobby.

352
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,817
I bet the mom is beautiful!

353
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,649
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

354
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:03,090
I bet their house is made
of Gummi Bears.

355
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,513
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

356
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,048
My caterpillar never turned
into a butterfly.

357
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,555
That's a Cheeto.

358
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:19,502
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

359
00:28:22,194 --> 00:28:22,983
Who's Debbie?

360
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:24,823
Your wife.

361
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:27,088
Hi, girls!

362
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:39,822
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.

363
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,678
He's going to adopt you.

364
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,965
And he's a dentist!

365
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,360
Yeah!

366
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:56,042
Hi. I'm Margo.

367
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:57,754
This is Edith.

368
00:28:58,395 --> 00:28:59,628
And that's Agnes.

369
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:02,414
I got your leg, I got your leg!

370
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:05,493
Ok, that is enough, little girl.

371
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:06,549
Let go of my leg.

372
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:07,788
Come on. You can do it.
Higher!

373
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,032
Just release your grip.
Higher!

374
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,100
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

375
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:15,373
Some nonstick spray?

376
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,063
Crowbar?

377
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:22,438
Ok, girls, let's go.

378
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:47,911
Oh, yeah!

379
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:52,661
Pretty impressive!

380
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,502
What are you looking at?

381
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:57,577
Boo-ya!

382
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:01,632
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

383
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,593
Take that!

384
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:05,891
You done been shrunk!

385
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:08,021
Yello?

386
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:11,031
I got the shrink ray, alright.

387
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:14,699
No, I'm not playing with it.

388
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:15,936
Gru?

389
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:18,262
Don't...

390
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:19,743
Don't make me laugh! No.

391
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:21,410
P.S.,

392
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,168
he is not getting the moon,

393
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:24,682
and P.P.S.,

394
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:26,368
by the time I'm done with him,

395
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,076
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

396
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:30,760
Ok, bye.

397
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:37,156
Look at you, a little tiny
toilet for a little tiny baby...

398
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:40,129
Curse you, tiny toilet!

399
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:47,535
Ok, here we are.

400
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:49,080
Home sweet home.

401
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,055
So, this is, like, your house?

402
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:55,869
Wait a sec...

403
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,182
You're the guy who pretended
he was a recorded message!

404
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:01,686
No, that was someone else.

405
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,389
Can I hold your hand?

406
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:18,345
No.

407
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,355
We got adopted by a bald guy,

408
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,590
I thought this'd be more like Annie.

409
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:42,995
No, hey!

410
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,417
Kyle, these are not treats.

411
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:50,421
These are guests.

412
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:52,615
Girls, this is Kyle, my...

413
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:54,468
dog.

414
00:31:57,558 --> 00:31:58,642
Fluffy doggy!

415
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:05,088
What kind of dog is that?

416
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,345
He is a...

417
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:08,041
I don't know.

418
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,508
Do you really think that this is an
appropriate place for little kids?

419
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:13,677
Because it's not.

420
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:16,119
No! No!

421
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:18,363
Stay away from there!
It's fragile.

422
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:24,955
Well, I suppose the plan
will work with two.

423
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,514
Hey! It's dark in here.

424
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:33,015
It poked a hole in my juice box.

425
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,431
As you can see,

426
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:42,628
I have provided everything
a child might need.

427
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,625
Alright.

428
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:48,787
Ok. As I was saying...

429
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,517
Hey!

430
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,888
Somebody broke that.

431
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:53,552
Ok, ok.

432
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,468
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

433
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,234
Rule number one.

434
00:32:57,616 --> 00:33:00,417
You will not touch anything.

435
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,188
What about the floor?

436
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:04,697
Yes, you may touch the floor.

437
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,913
What about the air?

438
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:08,342
Yes, you may touch the air!

439
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:09,489
What about this?

440
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,475
Where did you get that?
Found it.

441
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:18,300
Ok. Rule number two, you will
not bother me while I'm working.

442
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:20,092
Rule number three.

443
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:25,046
You will not cry or whine
or laugh or giggle,

444
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,385
or sneeze or burp or fart!

445
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:32,026
So, no, no, no annoying sounds.

446
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:32,866
Alright?

447
00:33:32,868 --> 00:33:34,562
Does this count as annoying?

448
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:39,492
Very!

449
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:44,485
I will see you in six hours.

450
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:48,797
Ok, don't worry.

451
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,820
Everything's going to be fine.

452
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,244
We're gonna be really happy here.

453
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:54,743
Right?

454
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:55,673
Agnes?

455
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:25,101
Hey, question.

456
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:27,157
What are these?

457
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:30,168
A dozen boogie robots!

458
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,439
Boogie!

459
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,350
Look at this. Watch me!

460
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:41,202
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.

461
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:42,564
Why are... Why...

462
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:44,531
Why are you so old?

463
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:48,505
Ok. I'm on it.

464
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,707
Hello?

465
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:07,435
TV!

466
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:28,538
What is that?

467
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:31,166
Look at that!
That is cool!

468
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,055
Come on!

469
00:35:34,129 --> 00:35:36,016
I don't think he's a dentist.

470
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:52,147
We've been working
on this for a while.

471
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:55,151
It's a-anti-gravity serum.

472
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:58,083
Piloto!

473
00:36:00,614 --> 00:36:01,848
I meant to close that.

474
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,799
He'll be alright, I'm sure.

475
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,464
Do the effects wear off?

476
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,093
So far no.

477
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:09,288
No, they don't.

478
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,879
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

479
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:18,560
No, no.

480
00:36:18,629 --> 00:36:21,607
I said dart gun, not...

481
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:22,779
Ok.

482
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:25,786
Yes. Because I was wondering

483
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,656
under what circumstances
would we use this?

484
00:36:28,658 --> 00:36:29,455
But, anyway.

485
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:31,667
What I really wanted to show you,

486
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,312
was this.

487
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:41,194
Now those are cookie robots!

488
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,503
♪ <i>La, la, la, la I love unicorns.</i> ♪

489
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:47,471
What are you doing here?

490
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,387
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

491
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:50,859
We got bored.

492
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,139
What is this place?

493
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,801
Can I drink this?

494
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:56,000
Do you want to explode?

495
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:59,413
Gru!

496
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,254
Get back in the kitchen!

497
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:03,673
Will you play with us?
No.

498
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,889
Why?

499
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,224
Because I'm busy.

500
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:07,813
Doing what?

501
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,945
Ok, ok, you got me.

502
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:13,803
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.

503
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:15,602
In real life,

504
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,013
I am a spy.

505
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,596
And it is top secret,

506
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:21,567
and you may not tell anybody,
because if you do...

507
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:22,571
What does this do?

508
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:27,249
Hey!

509
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,823
My unicorn!

510
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:31,827
You have to fix it.

511
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:32,718
Fix it?

512
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,440
Look,

513
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:35,150
it has been disintegrated.

514
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,222
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

515
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:44,846
That's freaking me out.
What is she doing?

516
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,001
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

517
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,717
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

518
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,168
Ok, ok! I'll fix it!

519
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,115
Tim! Mark! Phil!

520
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:03,370
This is very important.

521
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:06,974
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

522
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,506
Papoy?

523
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:09,553
Wakana Papoy?

524
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:10,434
No, no, no, no, no, no.

525
00:38:10,436 --> 00:38:11,174
Papoy.

526
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:12,598
Ah Papoy.

527
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,005
Hey, hey, hey!

528
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:14,692
A toy!

529
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:15,759
Ya, ya, ya, papoy.

530
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:17,702
Go and hurry!

531
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:19,524
What are those?

532
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:20,891
They are my...

533
00:38:21,903 --> 00:38:23,046
cousins.

534
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:24,763
Jerry! Stuart!

535
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,143
Watch them and keep them
away from me, please.

536
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:55,169
It was your cousin's idea.

537
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:56,335
What?

538
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:58,625
Ok, bedtime.

539
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:02,858
Not you two!

540
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:07,474
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.

541
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:09,867
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

542
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:12,691
Just so you know,

543
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:14,865
you're never gonna be my dad.

544
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:17,355
I think I can live with that.

545
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:21,528
Are these beds made out of bombs?

546
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:26,227
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

547
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:28,674
But try not to toss and turn.

548
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:30,210
Cool.

549
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,632
Will you read us a bedtime story?

550
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:34,617
No.

551
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,585
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

552
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:41,423
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

553
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:44,065
So, good night, sleep tight,

554
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,623
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

555
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:49,992
Because there are
literally thousands of them.

556
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:53,533
And there is probably
something in your closet.

557
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,143
He's just kidding, Agnes.

558
00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:21,641
It's beautiful.

559
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,222
Girls,

560
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:52,465
let's go.

561
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:55,778
Time to deliver the cookies!

562
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,923
Ok. But first, we're going
to dance class.

563
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:02,303
Actually, we're going to have
to skip the dance class today.

564
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:06,745
Actually, we can't skip
the dance class today.

565
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,687
We have a big recital coming up.

566
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:10,731
We're doing an excerpt
from Swan Lake.

567
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:12,429
Yeah, Swan Lake!

568
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:13,589
That's fantastic.

569
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:14,819
Wonderful but...

570
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:17,351
We're going to deliver cookies!

571
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:18,655
Come on!

572
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:21,119
No.

573
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:23,303
No?

574
00:42:23,471 --> 00:42:26,302
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.

575
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:27,576
Really?

576
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:31,708
Well, I am not driving you
to dance class.

577
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,586
So if you want to go,

578
00:42:33,588 --> 00:42:37,152
you are going to have
to walk yourselves.

579
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,449
What are you doing?

580
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,037
Walking to dance class.

581
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,436
Ya? Ok, fine.

582
00:42:48,537 --> 00:42:52,290
You just keep walking because
I'm really not driving you!

583
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:53,269
Ok.

584
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,194
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!

585
00:42:57,823 --> 00:43:00,178
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!

586
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,092
And you had better be in this car!

587
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:03,893
Here we go! One!

588
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:05,453
Two!

589
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:06,933
Three,

590
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:08,148
Four,

591
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,476
and five.

592
00:43:09,825 --> 00:43:10,895
And lift,

593
00:43:11,045 --> 00:43:12,405
and stretch.

594
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:13,665
And one.

595
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,147
And two.

596
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:17,282
Here you go.
What is it?

597
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:19,533
Your ticket to the dance recital.

598
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:20,987
You are coming, right?

599
00:43:21,204 --> 00:43:23,019
Of course, of course.

600
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,955
I... I have pins and needles
that I'm sitting on.

601
00:43:26,057 --> 00:43:27,367
Pinkie promise?

602
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:30,842
Oh, yes.

603
00:43:30,844 --> 00:43:32,549
My pinkie promises.

604
00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:46,438
Alright.

605
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:50,280
Our first customer
is a man named Vector.

606
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:51,675
But he's a V.

607
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,280
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

608
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:55,877
Then we go to the B's.

609
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,579
Then we...
Yes, yes!

610
00:43:57,581 --> 00:43:59,002
I went to kindergarten.

611
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:01,330
I know how the alphabet works!

612
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:04,518
I...

613
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:06,434
I was just thinking

614
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,285
that it might be nice,

615
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:10,431
to deliver Mr Vector's first.

616
00:44:10,507 --> 00:44:11,620
That is all.

617
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,479
Almost over.

618
00:44:16,606 --> 00:44:17,777
It's almost over.

619
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:23,525
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!

620
00:44:25,178 --> 00:44:26,638
Do you have my cookies for me?

621
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:37,956
Four boxes of mini-mints,
two toffee totes,

622
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:40,414
two caramel clumpies and

623
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,220
fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

624
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,381
Exactly.

625
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,165
I'd like to see somebody
else order that many cookies.

626
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:47,134
Not likely.

627
00:44:47,136 --> 00:44:49,115
Name one person who ordered
more cookies than me.

628
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:50,806
That'll be $52.

629
00:44:51,517 --> 00:44:52,308
Right.

630
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,577
Seven, eight, nine...

631
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:04,879
Tic Tacs!

632
00:45:04,881 --> 00:45:06,548
Where was I?

633
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,482
Seven, eight,

634
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:09,958
nine...

635
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,753
Why are you wearing pyjamas?

636
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,300
These aren't pyjamas!

637
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:16,134
This is a warm-up suit.

638
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:34,953
What are you warming up for?
Stuff.

639
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:36,323
What sort of stuff?

640
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:38,808
Super-cool stuff
you would not understand.

641
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:40,263
Like sleeping?

642
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:42,350
They are not pyjamas!

643
00:45:55,146 --> 00:45:56,193
Here you go,

644
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:57,674
52 big ones.

645
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,447
Bye!

646
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:12,656
Come on!

647
00:47:36,193 --> 00:47:36,954
What...

648
00:47:39,644 --> 00:47:40,936
Quiet down, fish!

649
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:49,358
Down, boy!

650
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:14,205
We did it!

651
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:15,713
Come on, girls, let's go!

652
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:26,753
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?

653
00:48:26,942 --> 00:48:29,303
Life is full of disappointments

654
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:31,488
for some people.

655
00:48:37,202 --> 00:48:38,934
Don't do that!

656
00:48:39,155 --> 00:48:40,522
Super Silly Fun Land!

657
00:48:40,524 --> 00:48:42,674
Can we go? Please?

658
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:43,602
No.

659
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:46,384
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

660
00:48:46,431 --> 00:48:47,282
Don't care.

661
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:48,256
Please?

662
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:50,023
We'll never ask for anything else,
Please.

663
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:51,167
Ever again!
Pretty please?

664
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:52,004
Please.

665
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:01,184
Come on!
Come on!

666
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:03,924
Light bulb.

667
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:10,104
Come on!

668
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:13,702
Goodbye, have fun.

669
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:18,114
Sorry, dude.

670
00:49:18,116 --> 00:49:19,936
They can't ride
without an adult.

671
00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:21,711
What?

672
00:50:18,868 --> 00:50:20,094
Oh, my gosh!

673
00:50:20,096 --> 00:50:22,516
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

674
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:27,734
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

675
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,365
You've got to let us play for it!

676
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:30,635
No, no, no.

677
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:32,093
No, no, no.
Come on!

678
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:36,363
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

679
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,549
Well, it is not for sale.

680
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:41,826
But all you got to do to win it,

681
00:50:41,828 --> 00:50:44,462
is knock down
that little spaceship there.

682
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,766
It's easy!

683
00:50:55,126 --> 00:50:56,063
Yeah!

684
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,648
Again!

685
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:10,979
Wait!

686
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:12,501
Come on. One more time!

687
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:13,875
Just one more.

688
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,305
I accidentally closed my eyes.

689
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:33,253
Yeah I hit it! I hit it!

690
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:34,600
Cool.
I hit it!

691
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:41,249
What was that?

692
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:42,993
She hit that.

693
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:45,010
I saw that with my own eyes.

694
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,804
Hey buddy, let me explain
something to you.

695
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:50,093
You see that little tin spaceship?

696
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,479
You see how it's not knocked over?

697
00:51:52,924 --> 00:51:55,379
Do you know what that means, professor?

698
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:59,117
It means, you don't get the unicorn!

699
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:02,841
Somebody's got a frowny face.

700
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:05,485
Better luck next time!

701
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:08,862
Ok.

702
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:10,548
My turn.

703
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:34,296
Knocked over!

704
00:52:38,649 --> 00:52:40,475
It's so fluffy!

705
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:41,533
Yeah!

706
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:42,990
That...

707
00:52:43,544 --> 00:52:44,426
was awesome!

708
00:52:44,516 --> 00:52:45,926
You blew up the whole thing!

709
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:48,586
Let's go.
Let's try another game!

710
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:58,216
Gru, do you mind
if I have a quick word?

711
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:00,504
Ok, girls, go play.

712
00:53:08,604 --> 00:53:10,642
I got the shrink ray!

713
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,651
Cotton candy!

714
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,220
We have 12 days,

715
00:53:18,222 --> 00:53:20,588
until the moon is in optimum position.

716
00:53:20,737 --> 00:53:22,702
We can't afford any distractions!

717
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:25,836
Get me Perkins.

718
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:36,078
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins,

719
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,143
but I figured that you would want to see...

720
00:53:39,546 --> 00:53:40,536
this!

721
00:53:41,187 --> 00:53:42,028
What?

722
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:55,512
<i>Well done, Gru.</i>

723
00:53:55,787 --> 00:53:57,032
<i>Rather impressive.</i>

724
00:53:57,311 --> 00:53:59,903
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.

725
00:54:00,836 --> 00:54:02,493
I fly to the moon.

726
00:54:02,957 --> 00:54:04,088
I shrink the moon.

727
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:06,158
I grab the moon.

728
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:08,521
I sit on the toilet.

729
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,619
What?

730
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:11,789
<i>Sorry. Sorry!</i>

731
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:13,177
<i>Could you...</i>

732
00:54:13,634 --> 00:54:15,288
<i>excuse me for just one second?</i>

733
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,990
I told you not to touch my things.

734
00:54:17,064 --> 00:54:18,913
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

735
00:54:20,211 --> 00:54:21,669
Hey, can we order pizza?

736
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:23,515
Pizza? You just had lunch.

737
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,363
Not now, for dinner.

738
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:26,329
Dinner?

739
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:29,446
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

740
00:54:30,236 --> 00:54:31,482
Can we get stuffed crust?

741
00:54:32,923 --> 00:54:34,191
Stuffed crust!
Stuffed crust!

742
00:54:34,342 --> 00:54:36,024
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

743
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:38,872
You're funny!

744
00:54:39,084 --> 00:54:41,415
Just don't come out of that room again!

745
00:54:42,715 --> 00:54:43,429
Alright.

746
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:45,509
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

747
00:54:46,768 --> 00:54:47,632
<i>Where were we?</i>

748
00:54:48,105 --> 00:54:49,646
You were sitting on the toilet.

749
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:50,634
No, no, no, no, no!

750
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:51,889
No, I'm sorry.

751
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,931
It was a little attempt at humour.

752
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,847
I know how much, you like to laugh...

753
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:01,263
inside. Now...

754
00:55:01,577 --> 00:55:02,502
I was...

755
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:03,633
saying...

756
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:08,747
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

757
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,112
<i>Believe me, I am completely focused.</i>

758
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:11,647
<i>I...</i>

759
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:12,656
<i>Hello!</i>
What?

760
00:55:13,586 --> 00:55:14,665
That guy is huge!

761
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:16,265
Are we on TV?
<i>What are those? Children?</i>

762
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:19,024
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

763
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,293
No, no, no, no!

764
00:55:25,715 --> 00:55:26,516
Freeze ray!

765
00:55:26,811 --> 00:55:28,073
<i>Mr Gru?</i>

766
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:33,943
Ok.

767
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,062
As I was saying...

768
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:38,790
<i>No need to continue.</i>

769
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:40,874
<i>I've seen quite enough.</i>

770
00:55:41,148 --> 00:55:43,311
But my plan...
<i>Is a great plan.</i>

771
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,384
<i>I love everything about your plan,</i>

772
00:55:45,386 --> 00:55:46,741
<i>except for one thing.</i>

773
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,373
<i>You.</i>

774
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,869
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!

775
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:02,866
Look, Mom, I made a prototype
of the rocket out of macaroni!

776
00:56:05,555 --> 00:56:07,716
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket

777
00:56:07,718 --> 00:56:09,697
based on the macaroni prototype!

778
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:23,108
I don't understand.

779
00:56:23,315 --> 00:56:25,418
<i>Let's face reality, Gru.</i>

780
00:56:25,734 --> 00:56:27,998
<i>You've been at this for far too long</i>

781
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:30,515
<i>with far too little success.</i>

782
00:56:30,664 --> 00:56:32,388
<i>We're gonna put our faith,</i>

783
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:33,937
<i>our money,</i>

784
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:34,840
<i>into a...</i>

785
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,115
<i>Well, a younger villain.</i>

786
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:39,530
But I...
<i>It's over.</i>

787
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,077
<i>Goodbye, Gru.</i>

788
00:57:02,307 --> 00:57:03,202
Now,

789
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:06,907
I know there have been
some rumours going around

790
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:08,006
that the bank,

791
00:57:08,452 --> 00:57:10,205
is no longer funding us.

792
00:57:11,024 --> 00:57:13,949
Well, I am here to put
those rumours to rest.

793
00:57:16,024 --> 00:57:17,212
They are true.

794
00:57:19,676 --> 00:57:21,450
In terms of money,

795
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:24,505
we have no money.

796
00:57:25,381 --> 00:57:28,333
So how will we get to the moon?

797
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,509
The answer is clear.

798
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:32,052
We won't.

799
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:38,140
We are doomed.

800
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,892
Now would probably be a good time,

801
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:44,257
to look for other employment options.

802
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:46,768
I know.

803
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,093
I have fired up my resume,

804
00:57:49,688 --> 00:57:52,469
as I suggest that all of you do as well.

805
00:57:53,195 --> 00:57:54,249
What is it?

806
00:57:56,687 --> 00:57:59,806
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?

807
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:19,839
Hey! Hey! Boss. Sé la too.

808
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:30,442
Yes!

809
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,181
Yes, we will build our own rocket

810
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:38,243
using this and whatever else
we can find!

811
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,903
Grab everything!

812
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:42,375
Hit the junkyards!
Take apart the cars!

813
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,534
Who needs the bank?

814
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:46,623
Let's go. Let's go!

815
00:59:36,813 --> 00:59:38,630
Mom! What are you doing here?

816
00:59:39,311 --> 00:59:41,491
And here he is in the bathtub.

817
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:44,220
Look at his little buns.

818
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,327
Mom.

819
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,165
Not cool.

820
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:51,460
And here,

821
00:59:51,522 --> 00:59:54,799
he's all dressed up in his Sunday best.

822
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,018
He looks like a girl!

823
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,193
Yes, he does.

824
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:00,990
An ugly girl!

825
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:25,104
You're funny!

826
01:00:38,827 --> 01:00:41,788
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

827
01:01:00,062 --> 01:01:01,125
<i>Mr Perkins,</i>

828
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:02,282
<i>your son is here.</i>

829
01:01:02,665 --> 01:01:03,795
Send him in.

830
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:06,775
Hey, Dad.

831
01:01:07,953 --> 01:01:09,373
You wanted to see me?

832
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:12,516
Yes, I did, Victor.
I am not Victor any more.

833
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,675
Victor was my nerd name.

834
01:01:14,747 --> 01:01:16,114
Now I am Vector!

835
01:01:16,148 --> 01:01:17,482
Sit down!

836
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:21,769
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

837
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,039
Back at my place.

838
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:26,105
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place?

839
01:01:26,107 --> 01:01:27,107
That's cool.

840
01:01:27,177 --> 01:01:31,285
I guess Gru must just have one
that looks exactly like it!

841
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:34,823
What the...

842
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:37,211
Those! Those girls sold me cookies!

843
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:41,086
Do you have any idea how lucrative
this moon heist could be?

844
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:43,282
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime,

845
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:44,620
and you just blow it!

846
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:48,409
No, I didn't.

847
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:49,647
Oh, really?

848
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,347
You just wait until Gru
sees my latest weapon.

849
01:01:52,706 --> 01:01:54,358
Squid-launcher!

850
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,376
Oh, yeah!

851
01:01:58,906 --> 01:02:00,710
There's a squid on my face!

852
01:02:02,377 --> 01:02:03,485
Don't worry.

853
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:06,740
The moon is as good as ours.

854
01:02:09,955 --> 01:02:11,350
Come on now, it's bedtime.

855
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:12,458
Did you brush your teeth?

856
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,270
Let me smell. Let me smell.

857
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:16,101
You did not!

858
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:17,995
Put on your PGs.

859
01:02:17,997 --> 01:02:20,772
Hold still. Ok, seriously! Seriously!

860
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,878
This is beddie-bye time,

861
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,344
right now. I'm not kidding around.
I mean it!

862
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:26,764
But we are not tired!

863
01:02:26,766 --> 01:02:27,925
Well, I am tired.

864
01:02:28,105 --> 01:02:30,316
Will you read us a bedtime story?

865
01:02:34,322 --> 01:02:34,966
No.

866
01:02:35,778 --> 01:02:36,808
Pretty please!

867
01:02:36,997 --> 01:02:40,729
The physical appearance
of the please makes no difference.

868
01:02:40,754 --> 01:02:43,193
It is still no, so go to sleep.

869
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:45,240
But we can't.
We are all hyper!

870
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:49,205
And without a bedtime story, well
just keep getting up and bugging you.

871
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:50,798
All night long.

872
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:53,960
Fine.

873
01:02:55,268 --> 01:02:57,192
Alright, alright.

874
01:02:57,498 --> 01:02:58,576
Sleepy Kittens.

875
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,176
Sleepy Kittens?

876
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:02,321
What are these?
Puppets.

877
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:04,680
You use them when you tell the story.

878
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,544
Ok, lets get this over with.

879
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:16,852
Three little kittens
loved to play,

880
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:19,123
they had fun in the sun all day.

881
01:03:19,276 --> 01:03:21,640
Then their mother came out and said,

882
01:03:21,642 --> 01:03:23,606
Time for kittens to go to bed.

883
01:03:24,577 --> 01:03:26,432
This is garbage.

884
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:27,825
You actually like this?

885
01:03:27,827 --> 01:03:29,287
Keep reading!

886
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,280
Come on!
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

887
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:35,276
Three little kittens started to bawl,

888
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,651
Mommy, we are not tired at all

889
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:40,263
Their mother smiled
and said with a purr,

890
01:03:40,591 --> 01:03:43,626
Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur.

891
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:45,457
Now you brush the fur.

892
01:03:47,955 --> 01:03:49,268
This is literature?

893
01:03:49,731 --> 01:03:51,918
A 2-year-old could have written this.

894
01:03:52,418 --> 01:03:53,180
Alright.

895
01:03:53,513 --> 01:03:54,978
Three little kittens,

896
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,478
with fur all brushed

897
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:59,695
said, we can't sleep,
we feel too rushed!

898
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:03,019
Their mother replied,
with a voice like silk,

899
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:06,178
Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk.

900
01:04:06,648 --> 01:04:08,544
Now make them drink the milk.

901
01:04:13,174 --> 01:04:14,481
I don't like this book.

902
01:04:14,924 --> 01:04:16,456
This is going on forever.

903
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:18,514
Three little kittens,

904
01:04:18,516 --> 01:04:20,033
with milk all gone,

905
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,582
rubbed their eyes,

906
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:23,509
and started to yawn.

907
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:30,715
We can't sleep,

908
01:04:31,116 --> 01:04:32,402
we can't even try.

909
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,072
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

910
01:04:35,892 --> 01:04:37,403
Good night kittens,

911
01:04:37,405 --> 01:04:38,836
close your eyes.

912
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:41,340
Sleep in peace until you rise.

913
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:43,341
Though while you sleep,

914
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:44,918
we are apart,

915
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:46,381
your mommy...

916
01:04:47,663 --> 01:04:50,075
loves you with all her heart.

917
01:04:53,678 --> 01:04:56,014
The end. Ok, good night.

918
01:04:57,317 --> 01:04:58,165
Wait!

919
01:04:58,506 --> 01:04:59,327
What?

920
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:01,485
What about good night kisses?

921
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:06,692
No, no. There will be no kissing
or hugging or kissing.

922
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:11,891
He is not gonna kiss us
good night, Agnes.

923
01:05:13,228 --> 01:05:15,330
I like him. He's nice.

924
01:05:15,622 --> 01:05:16,957
But scary.

925
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:19,079
Like Santa!

926
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:39,893
Only 48 hours till the launch,

927
01:05:40,262 --> 01:05:42,178
and all systems are go.

928
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:45,252
About that,

929
01:05:46,403 --> 01:05:49,107
I was thinking that
maybe we could move

930
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:50,605
the date of the heist.

931
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:52,748
Please tell me this is not

932
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,240
as a result of the girls
dance recital, is it?

933
01:05:56,511 --> 01:05:58,320
No, no, no!

934
01:05:58,355 --> 01:06:00,299
No! The recital? Don't!

935
01:06:00,402 --> 01:06:01,915
That's stupid!

936
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,280
I just think it's...

937
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,623
kind of weird to do it on a Saturday.

938
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,592
I was thinking maybe,

939
01:06:09,013 --> 01:06:11,803
a heist is a Tuesday thing.

940
01:06:12,117 --> 01:06:12,766
Right?

941
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:13,891
Gru?

942
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:16,654
You and I have been
working on this for years.

943
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:18,971
It's everything we've dreamed of.

944
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:20,990
Your chance to make history,

945
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,648
become the man,

946
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:24,263
who stole the moon!

947
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,712
But these girls are becoming
a major distraction!

948
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:29,343
They need to go.

949
01:06:30,622 --> 01:06:32,652
If you don't do something about it,

950
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:34,411
then I will.

951
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:37,109
I understand.

952
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:40,956
Good.

953
01:06:44,893 --> 01:06:45,606
Butt.

954
01:06:49,123 --> 01:06:49,794
Butt.

955
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,562
Butt.

956
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:09,812
Alright, now when we put
our cups together,

957
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:12,676
we will make the clink sound
with our mouths.

958
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:13,845
Ready? Edith?

959
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:14,921
Clink.
Clink.

960
01:07:14,923 --> 01:07:15,709
There we go.

961
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:16,934
And now we drink.

962
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:18,994
And Agnes?

963
01:07:19,275 --> 01:07:19,812
Clink.
Clink.

964
01:07:19,845 --> 01:07:20,780
Very good!

965
01:07:23,066 --> 01:07:24,090
Excuse me, girls.

966
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:25,805
Come on!

967
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,436
Don't worry, Ill be back.

968
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,199
Keep clinking.

969
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:31,034
Clink, clink.
Clink, clink.

970
01:07:33,474 --> 01:07:35,522
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?

971
01:07:35,638 --> 01:07:36,738
I'm here for the girls.

972
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,220
I received a call that you
wanted to return them.

973
01:07:42,049 --> 01:07:46,059
And also, I did purchase
a Spanish dictionary.

974
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:50,747
I didn't like what you said.

975
01:07:51,084 --> 01:07:51,881
But...

976
01:07:58,711 --> 01:08:00,366
I will get the girls ready.

977
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:13,378
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!

978
01:08:14,629 --> 01:08:16,565
Tell her you wanna keep us.

979
01:08:17,088 --> 01:08:18,750
Alright, girls.
Come on, lets go.

980
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:21,695
Goodbye, Mr Gru.
Thanks for everything.

981
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:39,085
I did it for your own good.

982
01:08:39,955 --> 01:08:42,824
Come on, lets go get that moon.

983
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:45,809
Right.

984
01:10:02,397 --> 01:10:03,523
What is this for?

985
01:10:05,276 --> 01:10:06,722
The recital? I...

986
01:10:06,761 --> 01:10:10,110
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.

987
01:10:10,112 --> 01:10:13,562
I don't go to little girls dance recitals!

988
01:10:34,991 --> 01:10:37,165
<i>Opening launch bay doors.</i>

989
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,632
<i>Commencing launch sequence.</i>

990
01:10:40,062 --> 01:10:42,004
<i>And we are good to go</i>

991
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:45,212
<i>in T minus 10 seconds.</i>

992
01:10:45,964 --> 01:10:46,830
<i>Ten.</i>

993
01:10:47,558 --> 01:10:48,345
<i>Nine.</i>

994
01:10:48,701 --> 01:10:49,350
<i>Eight.</i>

995
01:10:49,827 --> 01:10:50,388
<i>Seven,</i>

996
01:10:50,784 --> 01:10:51,714
Six.

997
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:18,896
Oh, yeah!

998
01:11:20,732 --> 01:11:23,276
Nice work, Doctor.
All systems go.

999
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,180
Boo-ya!

1000
01:11:36,307 --> 01:11:37,624
My flight suit.

1001
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:40,938
Oh, yeah!

1002
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,547
Once again, the mighty...

1003
01:13:07,692 --> 01:13:08,984
Ive got it!

1004
01:13:10,592 --> 01:13:13,209
Ive got the moon!

1005
01:13:13,675 --> 01:13:16,469
Ive got the moon!

1006
01:13:31,341 --> 01:13:32,843
I can make it!

1007
01:13:40,473 --> 01:13:42,262
Wait a minute!
Kevin!

1008
01:13:45,627 --> 01:13:47,764
Come on, come on!

1009
01:13:55,603 --> 01:13:57,379
He's still not here.

1010
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,668
Why would he come?

1011
01:13:58,670 --> 01:13:59,639
He gave us up.

1012
01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:01,486
But he pinkie promised!

1013
01:14:01,564 --> 01:14:04,102
Girls, girls, places!

1014
01:14:04,332 --> 01:14:07,211
No, we can't start yet!
We are still expecting someone.

1015
01:14:07,348 --> 01:14:09,725
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

1016
01:14:13,325 --> 01:14:15,057
Alright.
But just a few more minutes.

1017
01:14:15,699 --> 01:14:17,550
He's not coming, guys.

1018
01:14:21,347 --> 01:14:22,063
Gru!

1019
01:14:22,494 --> 01:14:23,645
Gru, can you hear me?

1020
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:26,429
Quick,

1021
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,015
we have to warn him, and fast!

1022
01:15:04,776 --> 01:15:06,505
Ok, ok.
Theres the library.

1023
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:09,253
That's Third Street.
The dance studio...

1024
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,420
There! There!
There it is!

1025
01:15:48,116 --> 01:15:49,542
Sorry, buddy.

1026
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:50,624
Shows over.

1027
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:51,910
Over?

1028
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:31,710
Vector, open up!

1029
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:35,135
<i>First give me the moon.</i>

1030
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:36,330
<i>Then well talk.</i>

1031
01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:50,945
<i>Mr Gru!</i>

1032
01:16:50,947 --> 01:16:52,357
<i>Zip it, Happy Meal.</i>

1033
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:53,962
Now, the girls.

1034
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,128
<i>Actually, I think Ill hold on
to them a little while longer.</i>

1035
01:16:58,153 --> 01:16:59,085
No!

1036
01:16:59,087 --> 01:17:00,283
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1037
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:02,486
<i>Unpredictable!</i>

1038
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,419
Listen close, you little punk.

1039
01:17:04,421 --> 01:17:05,728
When I get in there,

1040
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,759
<i>you are in for a world of pain!</i>

1041
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:10,816
I'm really scared!

1042
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,168
He is gonna kick your butt.

1043
01:17:56,294 --> 01:17:58,487
What? He punched my shark!

1044
01:18:25,093 --> 01:18:26,362
There he is!

1045
01:18:31,955 --> 01:18:33,374
Hang on, Gru.

1046
01:18:38,779 --> 01:18:40,072
Oh, no!

1047
01:18:50,374 --> 01:18:52,218
Vector has the girls. Go!

1048
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:57,752
What happened to the ship?
It's big again!

1049
01:18:57,754 --> 01:18:59,894
Not as big as the
moon is going to be!

1050
01:18:59,896 --> 01:19:00,565
What?

1051
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,904
The larger the
mass of an obiect,

1052
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:05,820
the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off!

1053
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:08,717
I call it the Nefario Principle.

1054
01:19:08,965 --> 01:19:10,660
I just came up with it now, actually.

1055
01:19:11,494 --> 01:19:12,705
Oh, no!

1056
01:19:19,328 --> 01:19:20,212
Did you see that?

1057
01:19:20,504 --> 01:19:21,716
Vector!

1058
01:19:21,718 --> 01:19:23,274
Help! Vector!

1059
01:19:23,444 --> 01:19:24,707
Over here!
Hey!

1060
01:19:24,848 --> 01:19:26,276
What are you girls doing back there?

1061
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:27,344
The moon!

1062
01:19:43,742 --> 01:19:44,785
Watch out!

1063
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:50,158
Get as close in as you can.

1064
01:19:50,992 --> 01:19:52,285
You got it.

1065
01:20:08,635 --> 01:20:10,904
Mr Gru, up here!
Mr Gru!

1066
01:20:11,303 --> 01:20:13,054
Ok, girls! Girls!

1067
01:20:13,547 --> 01:20:15,826
You're going to have to jump.
Jump?

1068
01:20:16,117 --> 01:20:17,828
Are you insane?

1069
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:19,451
Don't worry, I will catch you.

1070
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:21,744
You gave us back!

1071
01:20:21,923 --> 01:20:26,330
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.

1072
01:20:26,685 --> 01:20:28,446
But you have to jump now.

1073
01:20:29,141 --> 01:20:30,273
It'll be ok.

1074
01:20:35,996 --> 01:20:37,038
Ok, girls.

1075
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:40,438
Jump now!

1076
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,626
Margo,

1077
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,253
I will catch you.

1078
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,727
And I will never let you go again.

1079
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:02,889
Not so fast!

1080
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:03,603
No!

1081
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:04,626
Let me go!

1082
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:09,805
Margo!

1083
01:21:15,748 --> 01:21:17,362
I'm coming, Margo.
Hang on!

1084
01:21:46,608 --> 01:21:47,685
I got you.

1085
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:07,379
No!

1086
01:22:24,563 --> 01:22:25,613
Oh, poop.

1087
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:29,005
<i>This time, good triumphs,</i>

1088
01:22:29,019 --> 01:22:32,299
<i>and the moon has been returned
to it's rightful place in the sky.</i>

1089
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,580
<i>But once again,</i>

1090
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:35,370
<i>law enforcement is baffled,</i>

1091
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:37,010
<i>leaving everyone to wonder,</i>

1092
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:39,028
<i>who is this mysterious hero?</i>

1093
01:22:39,152 --> 01:22:41,113
<i>And what will he do next?</i>

1094
01:22:41,601 --> 01:22:43,435
Ok, girls. Time for bed.

1095
01:22:43,629 --> 01:22:45,224
Come on! We want a story.

1096
01:22:45,484 --> 01:22:46,875
Three sleepy kittens!

1097
01:22:47,085 --> 01:22:51,537
Oh, no! Sorry that book was accidentally
destroyed maliciously.

1098
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:53,726
Tonight,

1099
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:55,840
we are going to read a new book.

1100
01:22:56,199 --> 01:22:58,174
This one is called.

1101
01:22:58,346 --> 01:23:00,771
One Big Unicorn.

1102
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:02,354
By... Who wrote this?

1103
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,031
Me!

1104
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:04,909
I wrote it.

1105
01:23:05,137 --> 01:23:06,749
Look, it's a puppet book!

1106
01:23:07,501 --> 01:23:08,609
Here, watch this.

1107
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,677
That's the horn!

1108
01:23:16,181 --> 01:23:18,175
This is gonna be the best book ever!

1109
01:23:18,354 --> 01:23:20,437
Not to pat myself on the back,

1110
01:23:20,812 --> 01:23:23,077
but yes, it probably will be.

1111
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:24,109
Here we go.

1112
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,375
One big unicorn, strong and free

1113
01:23:27,646 --> 01:23:30,357
thought he was happy as he could be.

1114
01:23:31,535 --> 01:23:34,961
Then three little kittens came around

1115
01:23:35,523 --> 01:23:38,714
and turned his whole life upside down.

1116
01:23:38,989 --> 01:23:40,505
Hey, that one looks like me!

1117
01:23:40,534 --> 01:23:42,204
No, what are you talking about?

1118
01:23:42,206 --> 01:23:43,144
These are kittens!

1119
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,694
Any relation to persons living
or dead is completely coincidental.

1120
01:23:50,538 --> 01:23:51,865
They made him laugh.

1121
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:54,626
They made him cry.

1122
01:23:57,498 --> 01:23:59,522
He never should have said goodbye.

1123
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,553
And now he knows he could never part

1124
01:24:05,247 --> 01:24:07,833
from those three little kittens

1125
01:24:08,925 --> 01:24:10,442
that changed his heart.

1126
01:24:11,336 --> 01:24:12,308
The end.

1127
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,966
Ok, alright. Good night.

1128
01:24:39,295 --> 01:24:40,304
I love you.

1129
01:24:41,472 --> 01:24:42,727
I love you, too.

1130
01:24:52,602 --> 01:24:54,490
No, no!

1131
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:57,931
Alright.

1132
01:25:02,554 --> 01:25:04,723
Didn't I get you already?

1133
01:25:38,548 --> 01:25:39,987
They're very good!

1134
01:25:40,793 --> 01:25:43,653
I'm so proud of you, Son.

1135
01:25:43,678 --> 01:25:46,598
You've turned out to be a great parent!

1136
01:25:47,927 --> 01:25:49,226
Just like me.

1137
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:51,778
Maybe even better.

1138
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,356
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

1139
01:26:22,843 --> 01:26:24,155
No, no, no!
