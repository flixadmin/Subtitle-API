Barry Allen when he went back

a little thing called Flashpoint.

The hardest thing I
ever had to do in my life

331
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,890
was let Darhk live.

332

every ounce of self-control
not to kill him.

- Wait.

Why would you do anything for that man?

Ava, he lied to you.

He implanted false
memories into your head.

He hired actors to
pretend to be your parents.

you won't aid the man

Okay. But then what?

I'm just supposed to
hand Darhk over to Ava

783
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,830
And I know it sounds crazy
to let a time demon out,

784
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,790
but it's a hell of a
lot easier to stomach

785
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,160
than turning on a friend.

786
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,370
Okay, yes, but didn't
the original totem bearers

787
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,290
try and face Mallus and... and blow it?

788
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,510
Constantine said the only
reason they couldn't kill Mallus

789
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,080
was because the Death
Totem betrayed them.

790
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,880
And that's not gonna happen this time.

791
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,210
How can you be so sure?

792
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,580
I needn't remind you what happened

793
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,930
the last time you tried to wield it.

The Death Totem was
attracted to Captain Lance

797
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,790
because of a unique
quality we both share.

798

We were both brought back from the dead.

799

Plus, I have a personal stake

800

in wanting to send
Mallus straight to Hell.

801

He took my little girl.

True as that may be,

Well, as a man of steel,
which is an element,

I always felt a strong
connection to the earth.
